            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THer was treated in our vniuersite of Tolose a very harde question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is leful for the brother to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry her, whiche had ben wyfe vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now departed, and that without chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derne.

The Rector of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersite called to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell all the doctours re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gentes, that were that tyme at Tolose, for to shewe theyr myndes vpon this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and that not ones but twyse: for he iuged / that counsell gyuynge ought not to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted / nor done vpon heed, and that we had nede of tyme and space to do any thynge conueniently, and as it ought. At the last there came to gether in to one place all the best lerned and counningest doctours / both of holy dyuinite, and also doctours, that were most best lerned in bothe lawes, yea and finally as many as had any experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion we fell so faste vnto this poynt, that this was the sentence and determination, that our vniuersite / with one voyce of all / dyd determine and conclude, with moste pure and clere conscience, and defyled with no maner of leuen or corruption: that it is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for no man, nother by the lawe of god nor yet by the lawe of nature, to take her to wyfe, that his brother hath lefte. And seinge that it may not be done by the lawe of god, nor of nature, we answered al / that the Pope can not lose no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro that lawe / nor dispense with hym. And as for that thynge can not be contrary to our sentence &amp; verdicte, that the brother in olde tyme was compelled by the lawe of the Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomi to mary the brothers wyfe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Last of all &amp; for a conclusion consider, what and howe greuous punysshementes god dothe threten them with, whan he dothe require of them the kepyng of this lawes: ye and more ouer, how sore he hath taken vengeaunce, and hath punysshed the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, by cause they had contracte cursed mariages within these degres, and that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this lawe was made.

commixtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / where he exhorteth the Ephesyens / that no fornication / or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clennesse, or fylthynes shulde be ones na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or spoken of amonge them / and wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as / he writinge vnto the Galates / techeth them / that fornication / vnclennesse / and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery / be carnall workes. For saynt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, declaring the same selfe place / saith: The first worke of the flesshe is fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / the whiche amonge the other .vij. vices is the mooste greattest synne / bicause that by the vncleanes of the flesshe the temple or church of god / that is to say / the soule and the body of man, is polluted and defiled.</p>
            <p>The seconde worke of the flesshe is called vnclenes / whom foloweth her companion lechery. For as in the olde lawe, where it is written of crimes and sinnes / that be nat to be spoken / whiche are done secretly / and it is a very foule thing euen to name them / lest the mouthe of the speaker / and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the herers shuld be defiled / all suche vyces the scripture hath comprehended them generally / sayenge: Make you the children of Israhell to be shamefacid and aferde of al vnclenes. Euen after the same maner the apostel, in this place also / doth

name and call all other extraordinary and vnlefull pleasures / and also the actes that be done in mariage selfe vnclennesse and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherye / if they be nat done with shamefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidnes and honestie / and as vnder the eies and in the syght of god / and onely bicause they wil take peyne, and do their duetie to bringe forthe childerne. For saynt Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styne writeth, that lyke wise as vnder the name of thefte in the .x. commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes is vnderstande all maner of vnlefull v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpynge or medlinge with an other mans good: and vnder the name of adulterye must be vnderstande forbidden al maner of vnleful medlinge to gether, and all maner of vnleful vse of those membres: So plein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all maner of vnlefull couplynge or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeng to gether of man and woman is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in scripture foulenes / and all adulterie and foulenesse or foule, and vncleane mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge also, in scripture is called fornicacion. For al though, as Isodore saithe, al men / that do leudely abuse theyr bodyes / haue nat one wyll of theyr foule dealynge: yet howe some euer a man dothe pollute hym selfe by pleasure of the bodye, all is called fornicacion. For of delyte and pleasure of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7850:26"/>
doing fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there come many &amp; diuers foule lustes and vices: ageyne whiche the kingdome of heuen is shutte / and man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided &amp; departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god. Furthermore the apostels in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell / that they called &amp; kept through the holy gost in Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, went about to p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scribe &amp; shew what poyntꝭ of Moses law they / that had ꝓfessed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes religion / &amp; were become Christes men, shuld be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to kepe or to forbere, &amp; they made a decre worde for word as here folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. It is thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly goste, &amp; to vs, that there shuld be no fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther burdon laide vpon you, than these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thynges / that is to saye / that ye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein from contaminations of idols, &amp; from fornicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from eatinge of beastes / that be strangled to dethe / &amp; from eatinge of bloud of beastes. In the whiche place doubtles they couertly / vnder the generall name of fornicacion, dyd forbyd all maner of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinge and mariage vnlefull and prohibite by the lawe / and dyd prohibyte the selfe same thynge, whiche was vnderstande vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of fornicacion / after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and entent of the olde law. For seing that they do forbid fornicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen so as it
<pb facs="tcp:7850:27"/>
is forbid by the rules and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes of the law / it can nat be / but we must nedes thinke / that here in this decre of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels / mariages vnlefull / contrary to the dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position of the lawe / be also forbydden. For of those mariages there was no nede for the apostels to haue made further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions / or newe prouisions for them. for that thinge that is nat changed, wherfore is it forbydden to stande? And seinge that these Leuitical lawes of god were nat cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: it foloweth, that they dyd stande styl in their olde strengthe and auctortie: and by this reason the apostels had no nede to make a newe lawe / but forbyddynge forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation generallly / dyd forbyd all those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull mariages / that god had forbydden before in the .18. chaptre of the Leuitical. ¶And therfore lette no man flatter and glose hym selfe / as though these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes were light / or these reasons of litle weight or regarde / whan that you se eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently / that they be great fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacions and groundes of our feythe / layde by the holy counsaile of the apostels / and as ye wolde saye the stronge pyllers and vpholders of the churche / to dryue out fornicacion and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7850:27"/>
idolatrie: vnto the whiche thynge these fornicacions came verye nere. For euerye christian man doth perteyne vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che or companye / for the whiche Christe / willingly gaue hym selfe to sanctifie it, and make it sacre and holy / and to purge and clense hit with the wasshynge of water through the worde of lyfe. And ageyne al we be membres &amp; partes of Christes owne bodye, and we be of his bones. Therfore we had nede to take sure kepe / that no man with foule and vngodly mariages do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyle and pollute the temple or churche of our lordes body / wherin dwelleth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of our lorde. For who so defileth the temple or churche of god / our lorde shall distroye hym. Wherfore me semeth / that it is declared manifestly inough by these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde reasons / that these prohybicions of mariage haue auctoritie and strength euen at this day / nat onely by Moses lawe / but also by the gospell / and by the ordynaunce of thapostels / and they be both of goddis lawe / &amp; of the lawe of nature most hollely made / and euermore to be obserued and kepte / and at no tyme to be broken. ¶Nowe to come to the doctours of the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:28"/>
churche. Tertulian / the most oldest writer of all that were sins the tyme of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels, is author and dothe wryte / that this Leuitical forbyddynge / that a man shulde not mary his brothers wyfe / was brought in / taught / and ordeyned specially and by name euen of Christe him selfe and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postels / bycause that all the holle churche and company of Christes faith shulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and kepe it with all deuocion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For the same Tertulian disputeth agaynst Marcion vpon this poynt / that Christ in the gospel dyd excuse rather then distroye Moses constitution of the lawe of diuorse / or departynge of man and wyfe. This matter / saythe he / of diuorse is nat here brought in sodeinly of Christe / but it taketh his rote and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of that thinge / that Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh mencion of. For Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did sore rebuke Herode the kyng / by cause he had, contrarye to the Leuiticall lawe / maryed the wyfe of his brother / whiche was deed, and leste a doughter / that he had of her. And therfore Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was caste into prison by kynge Herode, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde by hym slayne. Therfore saythe Tertulian / that after there was mencion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7850:28"/>
made of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and what ende folowed of hym / our lorde for an example of vnlefull maryages and adulterie dyd vehemently crie out vpon kinge Herode / sayeng openly and playnely, that euery man also was an adulter, who so euer dyd marye her / that was departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her husbande / that ther by he might make the vngodlines and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominacion of Herode the more greuous and heinous / whiche had maried her / that was departed from her husbande / as well by his deth as if she had ben diuorsed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him / specially seing that his brother had a daughter by her / so that she was maryed vnto hym vnlaufully / and hit were but for this thinge / bicause he dyd it by instinction and mocion of foule luste of the body / and nat by instinction and mocion of the lawe / and therfore slewe the prophet, which was the meynteyner of the Leuiticall lawe.</p>
            <p>And the same Tertulian also writeth in an other place: Bycause, saythe he, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne persones some tyme do saye, that they haue no thing to do with Moses law / whiche Christe doutles did nat take away / but fulfylled and made hit perfecte, do some tyme take those thinges of the lawe / 
<pb facs="tcp:7850:29"/>
that lyketh them, and make for their pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose: playnly we also say this / that the law is departed and gone, as touchynge this poynte / that accordinge to the mynde and sayenge of the apostels / the burdens of the lawe / whiche our fathers were nat able to beare / be vtterly ceassed and taken aweye. But as for those thynges that perteyne to Iustyce and vertue / do remayne holle / nat onely reserued / but also amplified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creassed / so that our instyce and goodnes / whiche be christian people / shulde be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che greatter and perfecter than the iustice of the scribes and phariseis / and be suche iustyce / as a very iuste man ought to haue. And our chastite likewise shulde excel and passe theyrs / and in no poynt be lasse than theyrs. Nowe bicause it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in Moses lawe / that a man shuld take to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage his brothers wyfe / that is departed without children / bicause he shulde stir vp sede / or gette issue to his brother: And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this thyng may happen often tymes to one persone / as that one woman may be maried to .vi. or .vij. bretherne / one after an other / for lacke of issue by the former bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / accordinge to the subtile question of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7850:29"/>
the Sadduces in the gospell: therfore some do thynke / that the oftennes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is permysed also in other cases. But these men shulde haue vnderstanden first of all the reason and consideration of this precept / &amp; so they shulde haue well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en / that this reason is nowe ceassed and one of the thinges / whiche be nowe voide and of no strengthe nor auctoritie. For a man was bounde of necessite to marie the wife of his brother / whiche was departed without chyldren: Fyrste bycause that as yet that olde blessyng of god: Increse you and multiply, ought to run forth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Seconde by cause the children were punisshed for the fathers fautes. Thirdly bycause that the drye and baren persones were had for defamed persons: therfore an ordynaunce was made / that they shulde haue issue by other of theyr kynne / as ye wold say by a proctour / and bigotten after the dethe of the father / bycause that they / whiche were departed without issue / nat by the faute of nature &amp; by preuencion of deth shulde not therfore be iudged accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and vnhappy. But nowe the blessynge of encresynge and multiplyeng bodily and
<pb facs="tcp:7850:30"/>
carnally is ceassed / bicause the worlde is at an ende. For the apostle induceth &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayleth vs / sayenge. There is no more, but that they also, whiche haue wyues, shuld be, as if they had none, bicause the tyme is shorte. And agayn, The soure grape that our fathers dyd eate / that is the sinne that they dyd / doth no more stonysshe, or set on edge, the tethe of the childerne. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man shall dye for his owne synne. And more ouer the baren nowe be nat all onely without infamy and rebuke, but also haue deserued thanke &amp; fauour of god / being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited and admitted into the kingedome of heuen. And therfore nowe this lawe, that a man shuld succede into his brothers ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage, or that he shuld marie his brothers wyfe, is nowe vtterly deed and buryed: &amp; the contrary of this lawe hath place, that a man shuld nat succede into his brothers mariage, nor marie his brothers wife: And by this (as we said before) that lawe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is ceassed / and is no more of strength / by cause the reason of it is taken away or ceassed / can nat be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient prosse for an other thinge. ¶Therfore seinge that these thingꝭ before said were writen of Tertulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7850:30"/>
at that tyme, whan the church had made very fewe lawes, or truly none at all, beside tho thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gꝭ, which Christ him selfe &amp; his apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stels had taught / it is plainly to be beleued that this law, that a man shuld nat marie his broders wife / came by the ordinance of Christ &amp; his apostels / &amp; that it was renued / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed / &amp; declared / as ye wolde say, by a new conuena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; by a latre testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as a law very worthy to be obserued of al christian men for euer more, and that ought to be kept with al reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ¶And that holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saint Gregory, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che for his great lernynge and vertue was named Great / dothe greatly confirme the same thinge / whiche whan saint Augustine the bysshop of the Englysshe men, had in tyme past writen to him for counsell / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two brothers germayn myght marie ij. sisters / which were descended of a stocke farre from them, he answereth, that this thinge in all cases was lefull to be done, by cause there is nothinge fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture / that is thought to speke ageynst this poynte. And agayne / whan he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the same bysshoppe / vnto what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Christis faithfuls might marye with
<pb facs="tcp:7850:31"/>
their kynsewomen / and whether it was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to marie with their stepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers / &amp; with their brothers wiues / whom at that tyme they called cosyns / he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in order to both two questions in this maner. There is a certayne erthly and worldly law within the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome / that the sonne and daughter of brother and syster / or of two brothers germayns / or of two sisters / may be maried to gether. but we haue lerned by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / that ther coulde neuer issue come of suche mariage / and the holy lawe of god forbyddeth vs to discouer the foulenes of our cousyns. wherfore it muste nedes be amongest faith full or Christian people, that if they, that be of kynne, will laufully mary / that they be in the thirde or fourth degre of kynred. For they, that be in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de degre / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we spake of before, maye in no case be maryed to gether. And as for a man to be maried with his stepmoder / it is a greuous synnne. why so? bicause it is written in the lawes of god, thou shalte nat discouer the foulenes of thy father. For although the sonne can nat discouer the foulenes of the father: yet bicause it is written / The man
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7850:31"/>
and wife shalbe two in one flesshe or body: doutles who so shall presume to discouer the foulenesse of his stepmother / whiche hath ben one flesshe and body with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / he in dede doth discouer the foulenes of his father. Ageyn, it is forbidden by the Leuiticall lawe, that a man shulde myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or marye with his cosyn, that is to sey his brothers wyfe, bycause that she / being ones ioyned with the former brother, is made his flesshe: and for the same thynge saint Ihon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptist loste his heed, and by an holy martyrdome was brought to his ende. Vnto whom it was not seyde / that he shulde deny Christe / yet he was slayne for confessynge Christe. But bycause our lorde Iesus Christe had sayde: I am the treuth / saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truely shed his bloud for Christe / by cause he was slayne for the treuth. But bycause there be some amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the Englysshe people / whiche whyle they were yet infidels or vnfaythfuls / as hit is sayde / haue myngled them selfe by suche abhomination, and not to be spoken mari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ages / they muste be warned / whan they come to the faith / that they absteyne and forbere their carnal pleasure betwene man
<pb facs="tcp:7850:32"/>
and wife, and that they beleue and grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / that it is a greuous sinne to vse it. let them feare the terrible iudgement of god / lest for a lyttell carnall pleasure they falle into the tormentes of euerlastinge paynes. ¶Nowe reder marke diligently with me these wordes of saint Gregory, &amp; consider me here in his writinge .iii. or .iiii. thinges. Fyrst that the most holy &amp; most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned doctor, both in the law of god, &amp; of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly &amp; plainly affirmeth, these Leuitical lawes, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shulde not mary his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wyfe, with the other / to be of suche auctorite, that he saythe openly, that they be the very lawe of god. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that the same lawes be nowe at this tyme of suche auctoritie &amp; strengthe / that it is not leful in any case to contracte matrimony contrary to that is forbidden in the same. Thirdly, that the occasion of saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was this / bicause he wold meinteyn &amp; vphold the truth &amp; auctorite of the same lawes ageinst Herode the king / which had maried his brothers wyfe. Fourthe, that the mariages / which certain englisshe men had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract with their broders wiues / and that euen before they had taken the fayth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7850:32"/>
vpon them / to be so vnleful / &amp; not to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they could not without dedly sinne rendre their duetie of mariage one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / nor yet abide stil in thesame mariagꝭ: the whiche thing truely we thynke ought not lightli to be passid ouer. For ones saint Paule biddeth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth, that they, whiche be laufully maried / shulde nother be diuorsed / nor yet the ton to deny the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the right &amp; dutie of mariage. Agein, saint Gregory had grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the said englisshemen / that they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract matrimoni in the .iiij. degre / &amp; that mariage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract in the .iiij. degre shuld nat be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. wherfore these thingis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered / it must ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des be / that there was doutles some great cause / why saint Gregory wold nat admit or suffre such mariages / as the englisshme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract with their brothers wiues / at the lest wise to haue suffred them by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation or lycence, if it had ben lefull to haue dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And truli ther lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not causes, which ought to haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for to haue dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: As bicause of the faith of christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom / the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che some freill persons had leuer ꝑaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture vtterly to forsake and renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue
<pb facs="tcp:7850:33"/>
departed from their tenderly beloued wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues / as the tymes were than in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the faith. An other cause shulde haue ben this / that they had bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de them selfe by maryage before the wasshynge of baptisme / at the whiche tyme there were no lawes wrytten, by the whiche the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were forbidden from suche mariage of their brothers wyues. But this moste holy and moste wyse man thought / that in all and before all a man shuld regarde the commaundement of god. And he wolde nat be author nor causer to no man for to breake that lawe. He sawe, and playnely dyd iudge / that he, whiche had maryed his brothers wyfe, hath done contrary to the principal cause of mariage / and against the naturall inclination of man / whiche he hath to haue issue and posterite / bycause that god saith: He that marieth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wyfe / shall dye without children. he sawe that this is plainly an vngodly dede / abhominable before god and man / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ageynst the nature of man / and as nygh as can be vnto the nature and lyfe of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. He sawe / howe greuous punisshment is abiding them / which haue defiled them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7850:33"/>
selfe with this foule synne. Therfore he iuged / that nother peace / nor yet faith and christendome, nor any other thinge in this worlde, beside forth, is of suche vertue and goodnes, that it is able to recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and weye out the malyciousnes of this dede. He wolde nat than that suche mariages shulde stande styll and remayne / or be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led / or so moche as be thought to be mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: but he wolde rather haue them bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken and vndone / and dyd commande / that as many as had intangled them selfe with suche mariage / shuld be admonisshed and warned / that if they wolde professe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes religion / they shulde from thens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde absteyne and forbere from medling the one with the other: If nat / they shuld haue for theyr carnall pleasure / the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of euerlastyng punisshment. ¶Furthermore reder there be other bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops also / whiche in tyme passed were in very dede greattest and hyghest / nat onely for their lerninge and wysedome / but also for the holynesse of theyr lyfe / that maye clerely teache the / that these Leuitical for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddynges of mariage haue in them the auctoritie and maiestie both of the lawe of
<pb facs="tcp:7850:34"/>
god and of the lawe of nature / and that by very good ryght and reason. Amonge the whiche Popes be princypally / Calixtus / Zachary / and Innocent / the residue we will not speake of. For Calixtus / when he was asked why the maryages of kynsfolke were iudged to be vnlefull / he answereth: Bycause / saith he / that both goddes lawe / and mans lawe / hath forbydden them.</p>
            <p>And truely goddes lawe dothe nat onely cast out the childerne / whiche were gotten in suche maryages / but also dothe calle them accursed: and the lawes of manne do calle them infamed persones / and do putte them backe from their fathers hery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Further Pope Zachary aunswereth in this maner vnto Theodore the bysshop of Tycin or Pauy, askynge counsayle of hym / whether that the god doughter might be maryed with the naturall sonne: Thy holy brotherheed, saythe Zacharie, knoweth right well, that our lorde did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande Moses, sayenge: Thou shalte not discouer the foulenes of thy father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or syster: for it is thyn owne foulenes. Seinge therfore that we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to absteyne from our owne kynrede carnall /

moche more it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that we shuld with all straytenes beware of her / that is our faders doughter spritual. which place the gloser expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding doth argue / that the Pope / al though he wold / can not dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the .ij. degre of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinite / nor yet i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the .ij degre of the fyrst maner of affinitie. for the ij. degre of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinite and of this affinite hath his beginning of the lawe of nature. And agayne bicause the same degre is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden expresly in the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god. ¶Furthermore holy Pope Innocent the third also / when the king of Hungary had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained vnto him of the bisshop of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiense / that he shulde haue misused him selfe with his owne nece / he wolde gyue no eare to suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint. For who, sayth he, can lyghtly beleue, that the bysshoppe of Quinclesie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se wold be turned to so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful passion / that he wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incest with his owne propre nece, seinge that euen after the myndes &amp; sayenges of the hethens, the lawe of nature dothe not suffre, that we shulde suspect any greuous crime betwene suche persons. ¶And the same Pope also, folowynge the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the emperours in this poynt,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:35"/>
For the same consideration / dyd make a lawe / that prestes myghte kepe theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders / their doughters / and their sisters ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayns within their houses.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore the same Pope / whan the archedeacon of Byturs sent vnto him to knowe / whether that wyfe / whiche was departed from her husband without iuge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the church / bicause her husbande and she were in so nygh degree of kynred / that the sete apostolike coulde nat / nor yet was nat wont to dispense with it, ought to be restored agayn to her husbande / answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth on this maner: This woman / sayth he / which doth knowe the kinred betwene her husbande and her / specially in those degrees / whiche be forbydden by the lawe of god / can not haue to do carnally with this her husbande without deadly synne. For all that is not done with faythe and good conscience / is synne: and what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is done agaynste our conscience / dothe bylde to hell warde. And therfore it were but foly to yeue iugement in this case / that this woman shulde be restored agayne to her husbande, by cause she oughte not in this poynt to obeye the iudge contrarie to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7850:35"/>
god / but rather shulde mekely suffre to be excommunicate. For if she shulde be resto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red agayne vnto this man / there shulde ryse a marueylous perplexe and intricate difficultie. for she shulde be bounde to do her duetie to her husbande / bycause of the iudges sentence, and agayne she ought not to do it bycause of her owne conscience / se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she knoweth / that she is of his kinred. And so it shulde come to passe / that they shulde be greuously combred / and a snare shulde be set for them both / to bring them to helle / seynge that they can nat carnally come to gethers / nor yet be maried the ton with the other. Therfore / seythe he, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as kinred is obiecte within the degrees forbidden by the law of god / it is thought best / that iudgement be gyuen / that restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion be made as concernyng al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / but as concernynge bedde and carnall medlynge / restitucion must vtterly be differ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red / seinge it is better for bothe parties to be discharged in their conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnder this maner / than by the other wey to remayne in charge and cumbraunce of conscience. And Innocent doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme in the foresaid place this iudgement of his / by dyuers
<pb facs="tcp:7850:36"/>
reasons, fyrst by the answeres of two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes / Lucius and Clement, of the whiche the one vtterly denieth / that there shulde be made any restitution in the foresayde case, and that they oughte in any wise to knowe of the exception / that is / whether they be in suche degre of kynrede or no, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they come to the article of restitution, wherby she shuld be restored home again to her husbande.</p>
            <p>¶And the other Pope, all thoughe he graunt, that she shulde be restored / yet whan that is opteyned, he thynketh hit is not lefull for the manne / whiche dothe knowe of his kynrede betwene hym and the woman, nother to paye the duetie of mariage ageynste his owne conscience, nor yet that he can require the same of the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man, Bicause, saythe he, if he shulde do it / he buyldeth to hell warde: no more then he can, that is maried to his kynsewoman &amp; hath knowlege of his kinrede / although there be no questyon nor doubte moued vpon his maryage, but onely his owne knowlege and conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:7850:36"/>¶Furthermore Innocent confirmed his sayenge by a commune opinion and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynacyon of the Canon lawes / by the whyche doubtlesse hit is determyned / that in degrees of kynrede / forbydden by the lawe of god / there shulde be no waye to restytution / by cause that in those degrees there canne be no dyspensacyon: But in those degrees / the whiche be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydden by the lawe of manne / there maye be fulle and effectuall restitucyon / bycause in these degrees there maye be dyspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Nor be dothe not synne / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in this artycle dothe paye the dette of maryage at the commaundement of the Churche.</p>
            <p>¶ And trewely manye other thynges there be wrytten of the same holye man, for this pourpose, in other places: but our boke wolde growe to an excedynge greatte volume, if we shulde wryte them all. And these thynges, that we haue shewedde, gentyll indyfferente reder, do clerelye open vnto the / what these good Popes haue determynedde vppon these Leuitycall prohybytions of matrymonie / 
<pb facs="tcp:7850:37"/>
whiche is this / that they do bynde of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessite / bycause they be both of the lawe of god / and of Nature / so that they iudge / that they ought of necessite to be obserued both amonge christian folkes / and amonge infidels and the vnfeythfuls.</p>
            <p>¶Now besyde al this / we shal proue the same by the auctoritie of holy counsayles. For doubtles in the counsaile of Tollet it is decreed in this wyse: we decree / that no faithfull man shall desire to haue any nere kynswoman of his to be maried vnto him / bycause it is wrytten in goddes lawe: No man shal come nye her / that is next of his bloud to discouer her foulenes. And hit is written agayne: Euery soule / that shall do any of those thinges, shall perysshe from the middes of his people.</p>
            <p>¶And in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayle of Agathe it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned in this maner: we reserue vtterly no maner of forgyuenes nor perdon / nor dispensation / for inceste maryages / but we wyl in any case / that they be punisshed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte onely they heale theyr adulterye by departynge the one frome the other. For as for inceste persones / we iudge them nat worthye to haue any name of maryage,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7850:37"/>
seynge it is a deadly thynge euen to make any token or mencion of suche persones. And we iudge them to be incest persones / whiche by carnall medlynge haue defiled his brothers wydowe / whiche was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his sister before / or he that hath taken to wyfe his syster germayne / and he that hath maryed his stepmother. &amp;c. All these persones we doubte not but they haue ben before time, and by this our constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, incest persones: and we commaunde, that they abyde and praye amonge them that be yet vnchristened, and but onely lerners of the christian faythe / and not to come amonge christian folke / tyl they haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently repented them selfe, and amended that they haue misdone.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore in the counsayle of Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesar / and in the Synode of Gregory the yonger / it was decreed, accordynge to the wordis of god, that a woman / whiche had ben maried to .ii. bretherne, shulde be put backe from communion, and from recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the sacrament vntyl she dye. And a man that had maryed his brothers wyfe shulde be an anatheme, in the whiche sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node al to gethers answered an anatheme
<pb facs="tcp:7850:38"/>
be he / that is as moche to seye / as damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to euerlastynge dethe.</p>
            <p>¶Last of all, and for a conclusion / that sentence of wiclyffe, wherin he dyd bolde that the prohibicions of matrymony, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Leuiticall / be onely iudiciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of Moses, &amp; therfore the causes of diuors brought in by the meane of kynred &amp; affinite / to be brought in without grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and onely by the ordinaunce of man / was dampned as contrarye to all vertue and goodnes, as hereticall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly agaynste holy scripture, in the great conuocation, that was had fyrste at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don / and after at Oxenforde / &amp; last of all in the counsaile of Constance.</p>
            <p>¶There be decrees of other counsailes and aunswers in writynge of other of the Popes, whiche do subscrybe and agree to these foresayde determinations / of the whiche thou shalte fynde verye many in the Popes lawe / bothe in the boke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees / and of the epistols decretalles also: but we truste / gentill and indifferent reder, that these forsayde thynges shall fully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the. For thou seest here fyrste of all, in maner an hole commune assent and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7850:38"/>
of the holle churche / and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more thou seest the Popes them selfe do gyue so great maiestie and godly aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vnto these Leuiticall prohybicyons, that they do playnely affirme and holde stedfastly, that who so euer do marie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of these lawes / be not in very dede man and wife, nor they can not haue to do carnally to gethers, without deedly synne, and that they may departe in soundre without any ingement or decree of the Churche / and that they nother can nor oughte to be compelled by any iudgement of man, eyther to require or to perfourme the vse and custome of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage one to an other. Thus say the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and hit is to be thoughte and bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that bothe they dyd knowe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of theyr iurisdiction / and what they were able to do, and that they had wolde rather to haue encreassed and amplifyed theyr power and auctoryte, than to haue restrayned hit and made hit lesse. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thou seest / that they leye none other cause herof / but onely this, that is bicause none auctorite of man can extend or stretch
<pb facs="tcp:7850:39"/>
so farre / that it may releasse by any dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation the forbyddynges of god.</p>
            <p>More ouer thou seest / and excepte we be deceiued / thou dost grant and confesse also / that these decrees and lawes of these Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and counsels, vpon the mariage of the brother with the brothers wyfe / is plainly none other thynge then a publishyng and sendyng out of the lawe of god, and of the techyng of the apostels, &amp; no newe lawe of their owne inuention or making. For they do neuer so forbydde suche maryage / as though hit had ben lefull before tyme / but onely rehersynge vnto vs the olde lawe of god, and the receiued or approued custome and vsage of the churche. And that there hath ben suche a custome and vsage euen from the first begynnynge of the churche / and that it hath ben obserued before there was any Popes law / it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly knowen by the wordes of Tertulyan / whiche we haue before rehersed.</p>
            <p>Finally to make an ende thou shalte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande / gentill reder / that the requestes and sutes of diuers persons / whiche haue desyred dispensacyons in these degrees / haue many tymes heretofore bene denyed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7850:39"/>
and repelled by the Popes of Rome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che answered them thus: It is nat in any case lefull for vs to dispense with the lawes of god. And this we shall shewe you here after. Nowe seinge then that very natural inclination doth moue vs vnto the obserua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion and kepinge of these forbiddinges, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge reason doth leade vs, honestie stirreth vs, fere of god, and loue of god and of our neighbour, goodnesse and vertue doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire vs / the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modites and benefites / which come by the encrease of loue and charitie, do cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>saile vs to the same: And seing that god, moste best and almighty, made these lawes hym selfe, and that the consent and agrement of all people hath approued the same, finally seinge that the same selfe fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of god / whiche is the holye spirite of god, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded these prohibicions to be writen in the Leuiticall boke / doth ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifie and confirme the same prohibitions / bothe in the godspel of Christe, and in the wrytynge of his apostels, and also in the sacre holy counsailes of the churche / ruled and gouerned doubtles by the holy goste: And seinge they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of necessite to be kepte of all christian people / it can not

be, but that the sentence and determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of these vniuersities is of as vndouted cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence and auctorite, as can be, where they saye, that to mary her that is lefte of his brother / dyenge without chylderne / is so forbydden / both by the lawe of god and of nature / that the Pope is not of power to dispense with any suche maryages, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be all redy contracte or elles to be contracte.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7850:40"/>
Kepe you all my commaundementes and my iustifienges, and my iugementes: it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth saith he / requisite and necessary / that we shewe / what is signified by euery one of these wordes / and truly (as farre as euer I coulde perceiue) a precepte or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is / As for an example that, whiche is sayd in the .x. commandementes: Thou shalt not slee, thou shalte not do none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteri. for this is only precept or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but there is no punissheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t put to, for the breking of it. but nowe these same selfe pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceptes or teachynges be rehersed agayn / but here penalties be putte to them. For in this place it is sayde: what so euer man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth adultery with a mans wyfe / and with his neyghbours wife / lette them dye, both the man / that doth adultery, and the woman, that he doth it with / and he that shal slepe with his fathers wyfe / and shall discouer the foulenes of his father / bothe two lette them dye / for they be gyltie and deathe worthye.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore these lawes may well be called iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges and iudgementes / by the whiche he, that doth synne, or breketh the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is iudged to receyue / that is iuste for his trespas. But beholde the order of the godly wisedome. god doth not set punys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shement by and by at the fyrste / as sone as he had yeuen the preceptes or rules / bowe men shulde lyue. for he wyl haue the kepe the preceptes of thy father / and to do as thy father wylleth and byddeth the / not for feare of punisshement / but for loue that thou haste to vertue and goodnes, and to thy father. But if thou dispysest to do as thy father techeth the, than there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that thou shalt be punisshed / not bycause thou arte a man, so moche, as bycause thou art a contemner and dispiser of thy fathers teachynge. Therfore fyrste of al thou art prouoked and moued by gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tylnes and fayre meanes, as a chylde. and Dauid testifieth, that we be children / wher he sayth: you al be goddes, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hym that is hyghest. that if thou wilt not be obedient like a good childe, but

wylte be a transgressour and a dispiser of thy fathers teachynge / thou shalte be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshed lyke a bonde man. After this he saithe furthermore. And if any man shall slepe with his doughter in law, his sonnes wyfe / let hym dye, both .ij. haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted impiete or abhominacion, and they be gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and deth worthie.

And in the ende, where he speaketh of the same Leuitical prohibitions, at the last he maketh this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. Therfore it is good saythe he, to take good kepe / leste at any tyme we reuerence our carnal fader, or our father of heuen with lesse honour than we ought, and they deserue. And like wise hit is good to obserue / &amp; honour our mother, and also to obserue and kepe all other such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, what so euer they be, that commende to vs shamefacidnes, clennes,

And not withstanding that the law shuld constrain and binde the Iues to mary their brothers wiues, yet for all that we se them often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes lyttell regarde it / and make lyghte of hit / and not to do hit. wherfore Ruthe / a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also of Moab, was driuen to mary with one of her kynne / whiche was verye farre of. And Thamar was constrayned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7850:42"/>
to disguise her selfe in a common womans apparell, and to steale seade of her father in law. ¶Also Basilius the great / is of the same sentence and mynde / that these other two foresayde doctours be: whiche wrote vnto Diodore the bysshoppe of Tarsus on this wyse: There be come to my handes certayne writynges / whiche be sente out vnder the name of Diodore, but the thingꝭ that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in them / were like to be any other mans writingis rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. But me semeth / that there is some craftie felowe / that hath put vpon him thy persone / that by this meanes at the lest he might misuse the auctoritie of thy name, to gette hym credence, and to be beleued of his herers and schollers. For this man that wrote this thing, whan he was asked whether it was lefull for a man, whan his wyfe was deed / to marie his wyues syster, dyd nat abhorre this question / in so moche that he suffred to here it with a very good wyl, and dyd study and labour to promote and sette forwardes this lust, whiche is to shameles / to wanton / to foule &amp; vncleanly. And if I had those same wrytynges with me / I wold doutles now or this time haue

sent them to the / bicause thou mightest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and helpe both thy selfe and also the treuth. But bicause the same man / whiche brought the writinges, caried them by and by away with him again / and afterwardes bore them about with him / shewyng them in euerye place / as thoughe he had gotten the victorie of vs / whiche before tyme had forbydden suche maner of maryages / and dyd boost / that he had this licence of vs in writing: I determined to write vnto the of this thinge, to thintent that we shulde of both handes go about to reproue this ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gined tale / and falsly forged sayenge of this felowe, to shewe that it is nothynge but a sterke lie / lest it may hurt them, into whose handes it shal fortune to come.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7850:44"/>It is written / saye they / in the Leuiticall. Thou shalte nat take the syster of thy wyfe, beynge yet a lyue, to cause them stryue / whiche of them shall be beste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued and mooste sette by / for to discouer her foulenesse vpon her. By the whiche wordis it is open / sey they / that it is suffred to take thy wyues sister / whan thy wyfe is deed. whervnto first of all I answere and say this: what so euer the lawe saith / it spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth to them, that be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to kepe the law as to the Iues / but not to vs / that be chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folke. For by this meane we shulde be bounde to be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised / to kepe the sabbat or day of rest / and to forbeare and absteine from meates. For we shuld not submit vs &amp; binde our selfe to the yoke of the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of the lawe, where as we finde any thinge, that doth agre with our apetite &amp; plesure / and when there appereth any thing in the lawe / that is heuy and hard, and contrary to our pleasure and appetite / then to ronne to the libertie and fredome / that Christe in his godspell and lawe hath set vs in.

I saye for a suertie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whiche vnto vs is bothe manifest and true / that there is no suche thinge writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the law. for a thyng that is not expressed in the text or letter / but it may be gethered of the wordes / that the lawemaker meaned so / if suche a thynge be brought in by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a reason / as that must nedes folowe of that is sayde there / though it be nat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely wrytten / to saye whether the lawe maker meaned thus or no / this is a poynt that belongeth to the maker of the lawe selfe to determine / and nat to hym, whiche is desired to telle, what is expressed in the scripture. For els if euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may say, that this was the lawers mynde / &amp; thoughe he spake it not, yet he vnderstode it, &amp; this he did mene, as of the wordes may wel be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ther be any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so vngodly audacitie / &amp; wicked boldnesse / whiche / euen while his wyfe is alyue / wold haue her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to his wyfe, he shall not lacke / wherby he may proue that he maye laufully do it / by a like glose &amp; distinction. ye &amp; no doubt herof / for the scripture is this: Thou shalt nat take thy wyues syster, while thy wyfe is a lyue, for to make stryfe and debate

Of this it foloweth, and so the lawemaker shuld seme to meane, that if there be no suche stryfe for preeminence of loue betwene them, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not forbid, for a man to be maried at ones to .ij. sisters. For he that wyl set his minde vpon his lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stines and pleasure, wyll holde styffly, and say / that it is nat possible, that any suche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation or stryfe shulde chaunce betwene systers. And by this meane, syns that the cause is ceassed and gone / for the which the mariage of .ij. systers vnto one man is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydden: what nowe can let, that it shulde not be lefull for any man to haue at one tyme .ij. systers to his wyues / if we wyl ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit suche facion of reasoninge in scripture? ¶But thou wylt say to vs, this reason that we make nowe / is not in the scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we graunt and say like wise agayne to the / no more is that reason determined and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyned by scripture / by the which it shuld be proued of the contrary parte / that it is lefull for a man to mary .ij. systers. For the inuention and glose / by the whiche bothe the parties saith, that their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose doth folowe of the scripture, though
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7850:45"/>
it be not expressed in scripture, is all of lyke on the one syde, and on the other / and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth asmoche lybertye and lycence to do noughtli with as moche impunishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the tone glose as doth the tother. But a man ought dilygently to haue consydered the preceptis that go before / and then he shuld haue had no nede to haue taken all this la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour and payne, for to inuente and imagen additions to scripture on this maner. For it appereth, that the lawemakers mynde was not to speke generally in those lawes of all maner of sinne / but to forbyd special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely those vices / the whiche were commonly vsed amonge the Egyptions / from whens the children of Israell came / and also that were specially vsed amonge the Chananees, into whose lande they were goinge at that time. For in this place of the Leuiticall the very texte of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thus written, worde for worde, as foloweth: you shall not do, sayth god / after the custome of the lande of Egypte, where you haue dwelled, nor you shal not do after the maner and vsage of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chanaan / in to the whiche I shall bringe you / nor ye shall not lyue after their
<pb facs="tcp:7850:46"/>
lawes / nor folowe suche thynges as be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full amonge them. In so moche truly / that it is very likely / that as yet there had ben no suche piacull or abhominacion comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amonge those nacions. And therfore it was thought, that there neded no lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker / nor lawe to forbid that kinde of synne / that was not vsed: but that the custome / vsed of longe tyme amonge them / shulde be sufficient to make men abhorre and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste so great a vice.</p>
            <p>¶Howe is it then / seynge he forbyddeth the greatter vice / that he speketh not also of the lesser? doubtles by cause he iudged, that there shuld come many / which wold be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pleasure, and wolde folowe the myscheuous example of the patriarche Iacob / that maried his wyfes syster, and wolde mary with theyr wyues systerne, ye and that theyr wyues beynge a lyue.</p>
            <p>But nowe what shall we do? whether shal we confesse and graunt those thinges, that be written? or shall we apply our wyt to be somwhat curious, and to serche out those thynges / that be wrapped vp in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? It is not prouided fore, here in this lawe, that the father and the sonne shulde
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7850:46"/>
not vse one harlotte: and yet the prophet iudgeth them worthy of as greate rebuke as may be, where he saythe: Lo the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the sonne go to one woman. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally howe many and diuerse kyndes of synne hath the crafty dyscipline and scole of the deuell inuented / the which the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of god passeth ouer in secretꝭ &amp; syle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that for this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syderacion and intent / by cause the scripture of god suffereth not her honourable and reuerende maieste to be contamined and disteyned with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of so fowle vyces / but scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all maner of vnclenlynes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der generall names. Lyke wyse as Paule the appostle, vnder this one general worde vnclenlynes, comprehendeth all maner of vnclenlynes / &amp; not to be spoken impurites of man and woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where as he sayeth: Let nother harlottry, nor fornicacion, nor yet no maner of vnclennesse, be ones na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amonge you, as it besemeth saintes. So by this we may se, how true it is / that the sylence of scripture can not helpe vs, that we shulde haue lybertie to fulfyll our fylthy pleasures.</p>
            <p>¶How be it we iuge / that the lawmaker
<pb facs="tcp:7850:47"/>
did nat vtterly holde his peace in this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter / but that he hath forbidden this thing as diligently and as vehemently, and streit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as can be. For seing he saith: Thou shalt not approche to no woman, that is nere of thy flesshe and bloudde / to discouer her foulenes or priueties: This sayenge dothe comprehende also our kynne by affinitie. For what kynne can be more surely knyt, or more nere to a man / than his owne wyfe or to speake better, than his owne propre flesshe or body? For nowe they be no more two bodyes / but one flesshe or bodye. And for this cause hit is not laufull in any case for the wyues sister to approche vnto her sisters husbande, which is nere of her kyn. For like wise as we absteyne from our step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, as we do from our owne mother / and hit is as vnlefull to marye our wyues doughter / as our owne doughter: euen in lyke maner we maye not mary our wyues syster no more than we maye our naturall systers. And on the other syde among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men this reason of kynrede hathe place in lyke maner. for women be forbydden to medle with the nigh kinsmen of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes as the men maye not medle with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7850:47"/>
the nygh kynswoman of their wyfes / seing that the rightes and lawes of kinred do al of lyke bynde them bothe, the women, as well as the men / as it is euidently knowen. ¶But I do admonisshe and saye vnto all men, whiche thynke any thynge on mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that the floure and state of this world taryeth not / and there is a shorte tyme to come / to thentent that they, whiche haue wiues shulde behaue them selfe, as if they had no wyues. ¶That if any man on the other syde wyll ley ageynst me this saynge of god, Increse you &amp; multiplie, then wold I laugh at the mans vndiscretnes / whiche dothe not consyder the tymes / whan the lawes were made / and what were the occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions of makynge of them. For seconde mariage is permised to auoyde fornicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and barlatry with commune women, and concubynes / and to comfort the impotent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; great frailtie of nature / &amp; nat bicause it shulde be (if I may so call it) a gardeui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andes or mainteynaunce to intemperaunce and excesse of suche pleasure: and therfore sayeth the apostell. They that can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne and forbeare / let them mary. Howe be it they that mary not, do nat against the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:48"/>
lawe thoughe they marie not. But suche kynde of men, that wolde marie their wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues systerne / bicause their iugement and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstandinge is all blynded with a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an infamous affection and lust / they loke not ones vpon nature / which long sins hath diuised certayne and speciall names, the whiche shulde shewe of whens euery man is borne. and where a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marieth .ij. systers / this canne not be. for they that be borne of suche couchinge to gethers, what name shall one of them call the other, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne or cosyns, that is systers childerne? For soth by the meane of this mingle they may call eche other indifferently / both bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therne and also cosins, with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion both of names &amp; of kynred also. wherfore O man, make nat thy babes a stepmother in the stede of their other mother / or aunt by the moder side. Nor arme her not with cruell ielosyes and spytes of stepmothers, whiche ought before of nature and kynde to cherisshe thy children euen lyke a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where as nowe vnto them / that thou haddest bi the first sister, the .ij. sister, if thou marie her, muste nedes be a stepmother. for of stepmothers only the hatred &amp; malice is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7850:48"/>
so egre, that it reuengeth displeasures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dethe of them / that they be disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with. And where as in all other discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des deth maketh peace / the spyte and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce reygnethe and ragethe in them euen after deathe.</p>
            <p>¶For a conclusion of this matter, if a man desyre a wyfe / accordynge to the lawe / the world is wide, he mai haue choise inough. But if he regarde not the law / but his lust, so moche more he oucht to be withstande, for to lerne him / to kepe his vessell cleane / accordinge to honestie / not to the desire of the flesshe. I was about to write more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the / but it shuld be out of measure for a letter / and I pray god that other this our admonicion may preuaile ageinst all suche foule affection and lust, or els that this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence come no nere vs: but that it maye weare out in the same places, where as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che shamefull boldenes fyrst beganne. ¶On these mennes syde is also Isichius / Gregorie Nazianzens scholer / an excellent lerned man in holy scripture. For he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouninge this place of the Leuitical sayth thus. The intent of al this proces is this, that we shulde absteine from all vice / and
<pb facs="tcp:7850:49"/>
do those thynges that be vertuous. For the lawemakers intent here is this / to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streine vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all lechery / and not to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mariages, and from fornication, both spirituall &amp; carnall. wherfore whan he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth these forsayde commandementes / he saithe: I your lorde god. whiche wordes he spake for this cause, that whan we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that he, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vs to do these thinges / is our creatour / and made vs of noucht / and that he is our lorde and god / we shulde with all herte and mynde applie our selfe to kepe the thinges which he commaunded. For god dyd not in one place of the lawe gyue twise commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / that they shuld do his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and kepe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: god made no such rehersall nor doublynge / nor said not twyse: I your lorde god: but Moses, yea rather the holy gost, that spake in Moses, doth this for this consideration, that these holy lawes shulde not be dispised or littell regarded, by cause some sayde, that they were Moses lawes. But these thynges, that be here commaunded / be not Moses preceptes, but the commaundementes of god. Agayn Moses rehersed these thinges
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7850:49"/>
bycause there was meruaylous dilygence and studye taken, that bothe the letter and texte / and the lytterall or carnall sens and playne meanynge of these preceptes shuld be obserued and kepte / and also the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and gostly vnderstandyng / and that a great and a right lawe shulde compose and order bothe the outwarde and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man also, whiche is bounde to kepe bothe the outwarde superfyciall meanyng of this lawe / and also the inwarde and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same. And as for the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termore and superficial minde of this law / forbyddeth them / that be nyghe of bloud / to haue any a do to gether by the waye of mariage or other wyse, bicause that thyng also was kept amonge the hethens, whose londe god dyd take from them / to gyue it the Iues for their heritage. And by cause he wolde shewe that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement is necessary and of necessite to be kepte / he dothe nat onely recken vp the degrees of kynred / but also in rekenynge them / he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forthe playnely the cause, why euery lawe was made / and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixtion or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plynge of suche persons he calleth it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerynge of foulenes or shamelesnes / signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fienge,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:50"/>
that who so euer commytteth any suche dedes, euery body shulde be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him / euery body tourne their faces from hym, and that he ought to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hated of euery body. For who so vnhelleth the foulenes / or the parties to be ashamed of, of his kynsfolke, be they of kyn gostly &amp; spiritual, or bodili and carnal / he is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be a breker and a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of al the holle lawe. For the thinge / that he doth, is contrary to loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, whiche is the fulfyllynge and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of al the holle lawe. And that a man or a woman is after no small facion pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and defyled by these forsayde vices, the indignation vengeaunce and punysshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is appointed for such vice, doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly shew. And truly we ought not to pollute our selfe with neuer one of them. For who so is polluted with any one of them, is polluted with them all. Therfore whan the lawe wolde shewe / that they be all ioyned and knytte faste to gether / so that a man can not offend i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one but he must offend in all / &amp; so be polluted by al / for this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideracion the lawe hath gathered them all to gether, and couched them vp here
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7850:50"/>
all in one place / and proueth that they be so greuous and haynous enormities / that they distroyed holle nacions / and polluted the lande, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was polluted, made it for to be forsaken / and to vomit out and refuse them that had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted suche vice in hit, not bycause the lande coulde expell, put out, or euomit them / but bycause euen the very erthe selfe, of the owne Nature / that god hathe gyuen it, doth wayle and mourne at suche abhominations: and god that is ryghtefull taketh vengeaunce both for this mournynge and heuynesse of the erth his creature, and also for breache of his lawe / and for infamie and villany done to his creature.</p>
            <p>¶He maketh ofte rehersall / and stableth his law, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth his thretis, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyn setteth punisshementes, and that for this intent, bycause he wolde feare vs, and quicken vs to forbere suche thinges, as he forbiddeth vs, that we shuld not fall in to the penaltie / that he hath thret. And truly the penaltie is the losse and destruction of the soule, which begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth here in this life by syn, that is deth of the soule, &amp; is accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plisshed &amp; ended in the lyfe to come in the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:51"/>
euerlastinge tourmentes of hell. wherfore he byddeth bothe the Iewes / and straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that do professe the Iues lawe, to flie from suche abhominations, and in no case to do them, which thinges our auncientes greately vsed, and they haue polluted our lande. And yet nowe the thyrde tyme he commaunded the same thynges, to shewe that they be not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of god hym selfe. Laste of al sayth he / consyder with what wordes he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme this presente constitution or penall lawe: Suffre nat your selfe to be polluted with such vices: for I am your lorde god: wyllyng that we all shulde be cleane from al pollution and syn / for the image &amp; simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of god is with in vs, and rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about vs. and as often as we pollute the image of god by syn, but specially by any of these noughtie and not to be spoken dedes / that ben here forbidden, god must nedis be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased and angry. And if we kepe this y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of god within our sowle pure and cleane / god hath suche delyte and pleasure therein, that he vouchith saufe to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite within vs. Therfore who so euer doth defyle the temple or churche of god, god
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7850:51"/>
shal distroy hym. For the temple or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of god is holy whiche churche or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you be, saith Paule to al christen folke. ¶Ageyn Isichius sayth a litle after / It is in very dede, quod he / vncomely and as nye to the lyfe of brute beastes as can be / for a man to be maryed and medle with his brothers wyfe / or with any of his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens wyues, namely of them that be nere of bloud. wherfore god commandeth and decreeth, that he whiche marieth of this facion shall dy without children. Doutles bycause that he misusynge hym selfe doth marre and confounde / and vtterly disorder the lawe of bryngynge forth children. ¶And agayn afterwarde sayth Isichius / These thynges be not spoken of onely to the Iues / whiche by cause they be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and haue Moses lawe / thynke them selfe alone from al other nations, but they be spoken to euery man woman and childe whiche intende to serue god.</p>
            <p>¶And to this place we haue rehersed you Isichius wordes. Nowe with all these doctours opinion agreeth saynt Ambrose, saynt Hierome, and saynt Augustine. ¶Firste where one Paterne had a sonne
<pb facs="tcp:7850:52"/>
by one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a doughter by another, whiche had also a doughter, &amp; wold haue maryed his doughters doughter to his sonne / the maidens halfe vncle, he counsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led saint Ambrose in the case / which made hym this aunswere: I nother thynke nor iudge, that your bysshop / an holy man, doth loke after my sentence and iudgement in this matter. For if he hadde, he wold haue written to me of it / and in somoche as he wrytteth not, he sheweth playnly / that he iudgeth this no matter to be doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted on. for what doubt may be in this case, whether thy sonne, and thy doughters doughter, or thy nece by thin owne dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, may mary to gethers? seynge the lawe of god forbyddeth, that thy sonne shulde mary with thy brothers doughter. But fyrst let vs examine the wordes of the law. for thou p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest in thy letters / that by this lawe of god, mariage betwene suche pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or childerne / as thin be / is suffred, sins that it is not forbidden. And I sey plainly / that it is forbidden. For sithins that those thynges / whiche be not so greuous vices, be forbydden, as that we sayde of brother children, moche more this, I thynke, is

forbydden / where is moche nerer kynred. For he that byndeth vs to flee the lesser / dothe not set vs at libertie for the greatter synne, but byndeth vs the more. Than if thou thinke it is permised for this / bicause it is not forbidden specially and expressely, and by name, no more thou shalt not finde this thynge / forbydden by the wordes of the lawe / that the father shulde not take his doughter to wife. And is it lauful ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by cause it is not forbydden? ye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge so. It is forbydden by the rycht of nature / it is forbydden by the lawe, that is in euery mans hert and conscience / it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by loue and charite, which by long vsage &amp; custome / bi continuance &amp; proces of time, hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this thinge by p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scription / which forsoth is not to be broken / it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by title &amp; richt of nigh kinred. howe many suche great thinges shalt thou fynd not forbydden expressely by the lawe / that Moses made? and yet the same be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by a certeine playne expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of nature. ye and ageyne how many thinges be there, whiche are lefull to do, and yet not expedient?

That if the apostoll dothe calle vs backe from those thinges / that do not edifie / how can we trowe, that suche a thinge is to be done, that is not lefull by the sayenge of the lawe / nor yet doth not edifye, by cause the ordre of pitie loue and charitie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst it, and it agaynste the ordre of loue and charitie? For what is more solemne, or more customably and reuerently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, than the charitable kysse betwene the vncle and the nece / whiche he oweth to her of duetie, as to his doughter, and she to him / as to her father? Shalt thou then go and make this innocent kysse of loue and charite, in the whiche is none offence nor suspycion of euyll, to be suspecte, whyle thou dost intende suche mariage?

Shall the nece be maried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her vncle or mothers brother? and shall the pure loue and charite of thyn innocent children be tourned in to lusty and carnall loue?

This saint Hierome speaketh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he wold say / that this Leuitical lawe, that a man shulde nat marye his syster, is so grounded on naturall reason, that not onely Abraham ought to haue kepte this lawe / and that before it was publysshed in wrytynge / but also as many as professe the same faythe / beleue and truste in god / that Abraham had / and that all faithfuls in Christe ought to haue. ¶Laste of all

saint Augustine where he goth aboute to confounde and ouer come Faustus, that sore ennemye to Christes faythe / whiche leyde it for a foule vice and punysshable, that christian men at that tyme wolde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admit nor yet abyde to here the lawe of Deuteronomi ones to be spoken on, that a man might mary his brothers wydowe his brother beyng dead without children, aunswerethe to Faustus on this maner.

For in so moche as we do no more obserue it / that proueth not, that it is damned, &amp; in no wise to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued / but that it is fulfilled. And therfore this same selfe thynge / that Faustus, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dothe nat vnderstande it / hathe layde against christian men, as a crime and greuous offence: serueth for nothyng elles in the worlde, but onely to shewe mistycal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder a fygure and cloude a spirituall purpose / &amp; it is this / that euery preachour of the godspell is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de so to labour in the godspell / that he stir vp sede vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departed / that is to Christe, whiche dyed for vs. And the sede that shal be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vppe, muste haue the name of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is departed. wherfore we be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / and therfore without doubt, we nowe be bounde to kepe and fulfill this lawe, not carnally by bodily generacion / after the olde meanynge and takynge of it / but spiritually / and by gostly generacion, and after the trewe vnderstandynge.

            <p>And in an other place he saith / Although in tyme paste men maried their sisters / yet that thing was done bicause necessite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it / for as moche as tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were so fewe people: but this thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is not so olde / nor was neuer so necessary / but it is now as damnable / bicause that religion dothe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd it.

and it is this, that to what so euer woman we be bounde to do honour with reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and shamefacidnes / our carnall luste / yea thoughe it be for generation / yet by cause it is carnall luste / we refrayne it from that woman, specially considerynge that we se maryed folke / namely that haue shame &amp; honestie / to be ashamed of suche luste. ¶Nowe here thou seest / gentyll indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reder, what is the iugement of these great diuinis: wherin thou shalte call to thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance .iiij. or .v. thynges.</p>
            <p>Fyrste what so euer persone of Christes beleue breke any of these Leuiticall prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of maryage, he shall be damned bothe bodye and soule in to euerlastynge deathe of helle. Seconde that not onely the Iues dyd absteine from marienge their brothers wyues / euen as ye wolde say / for feare of some mischiefe, &amp; yet they mighte haue done it by auctorite of their lawe, but that the very heathens also after the deth of their wyues, dydde euer more absteyne from maryinge of their wyues sisterne / as from a certayne impietie or abhominaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agaynst nature. Thirde, that mariages contracte contrary to these prohibitions / 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7850:57"/>
be vncomely and abhomynable, and as nere as can be to the lyfe of brute beastes / and suche as christian people shuld nother abyde to here them spoken of, nor yet to thynke on them, and that they be cleane contrarye to charitie, ye and furthermore that they be the transgression and breking of all the lawe. Fourthe / that they be so greuous and so hateful in the sight of god, that they haue distroyed hole nacions / pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luted the lande, and being polluted / caused hit naturally to grudge &amp; to put them out, which had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mised suche thinges / doutles bicause that god did take vengeance at the grefe and complaynt of the lande. Finally that these prohibitions perteyne not onely vnto the Iues / but to all christians, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che come to serue god: and that they / whiche be polluted and corrupte with any one of these not to be spoken dedes, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyled with them all / and that god is angry with them, and wyll not dwell with them, and contrary that the spirite of god dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them / that kepe them selfe cleane from suche foule couples. And seynge that these foresayde thynges be true, it is prouided as playnely as can be / that these

Leuitical lawes be, out of doubte / the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For as many as be trewe Christes disciples / the spirite of god dwelleth in them / and if there be any / that hath not the spirite of Christe, he is none of Christes. And therfore christian people specially had nede to be holye, and not to suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the temple or churche of god with suche abhominations, or any other vice: but it becometh them to be innocent from all maner of foulenes and vnclenlynes. ¶And marke well this thynge also / gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll indifferent reder, that saynt Ambrose holdeth, that it is no doubte, and without question forbydden / any manne to marye his halfe systers doughter, and that for many consyderations, as for the increase or multyplyenge of stockes / or by cause of religion and reuerence, that is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of kynrede: whiche to be chaunged /

The canons and lawes of the churche be full of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement / and there be many decrees of the olde fathers also / that we shulde not mari with any of our bloudde / or if we haue maried, that we shulde be departed and disceuered again. And as for the cause
<pb facs="tcp:7850:60"/>
or reason of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, al be it I might say / that the simple &amp; plaine reason is / to obey the power &amp; auctoritie of them, to whom Christe sayd: It is not you your selfe truly that do speake, but the spirite of your father, whiche speaketh in you / and to folowe the custome of the holi churche, whose customes to breake and fordo is a kynde of heresy: yet for all that by the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syderation and marking also of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture I am wont to thynke thus with my selfe. Amonge the olde and auncient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iues / it was not leful for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone to mary with any out of his trybe. And whan I doubted, and soughte a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son / why so: the doughters of Salphaad came to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce. For whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages / whan certayne of theyr trybe and kynred dyd aske counsayle of Moses, and by Moses, of our lorde: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was gyuen them of our lorde, that there shuld be no mariages made out of one tribe into a nother, whiche was ordined / bycause the inheritaunce of the tribes shulde not be di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minysshed. For that carnall people could not lifte vp their hartes to heuen, but as an erthely crepynge beaste, with all their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7850:60"/>
breast and harte fast cleauing to the erthe, thought only of the erthely heritage / and not of the heuenly. Therfore euerye tribe had leauer to kepe their selfe within the straites of their tribe, by maryenge to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of the selfe same tribe with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / then by marienge out of their stocke, to diuyde &amp; parte out also their heritage. for suche was their heritage / &amp; suche is all erthely heritage / that if hit be ones diuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / it waxeth lesse and dimynissheth / nor can not come all holle to many. Therfore, as our lorde him selfe in the gospell sayth to the Iues, that Moses dyd suffre them for their vngracious stomakes and harde hartes, to put away their wyues / so that they put in a bill of diuorse: euin so in this case Moses gaue an answere to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalites &amp; fleshli desires, &amp; acording to their stubborne &amp; hard hartes, that they shulde nat mary out of their tribe: but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and perfectnes of vs / that be christian folke, is not on this facion. For seing that our herytage is god / of whom hit is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, God is loue and charitie, lyke wise as the Iues vsed a lawe fit &amp; agreable to their heritage, so we ought to mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tein a law for
<pb facs="tcp:7850:61"/>
our heritage / whiche is the lawe of loue and charitie. For as for loue and charite the brodder it is spredde, the more remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to hym, that doth spredde and caste it abrode / and the more his loue and charite dothe increace. Therfore the christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and perfection hath ordined, that the boundes and buttayles of consanguynite shuld be stretched forthe vnto the .vj. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on euery syde, accordynge to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of holy fathers and canons: so that kynsfolke being within the .vi. degre, may not marye to gether / betwene whom their owne naturall affection of one to a nother shulde be sufficiente to fortifye and make stronge loue and charite betwene them, the whiche natural affection it is great sinne to violate and breke / euen amonge the hethen and vnchristian people. And where that this naturall affection and loue begynneth to faile, there onely muste be putte to / the bonde of mariage / for to bynde loue &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to gether agein / that it slyp not away, to enlarge the boundes &amp; buttayles of our herytage, whiche is loue and charite. And it semeth moste right and reasonable, that as amonge the Iewes the transgressour of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7850:61"/>
theyr lawe was punisshed accordyngely / for marienge out of their tribe and kinred / for to conserue their erthely heritage: so amonge vs christian people it is ryght and resonable / that the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressor of our lawe be punisshed, to thintent our heuenly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and godly heritage may be encreased. ¶Yet an other reson. As they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to marye out of thayr trybe or stocke, euen so they were forbydden by the selfe same lawe to medle with them, that were nexte of their bloudde. For the lawe saith: No man medle with her, that is next of his bloudde: and the lawe putteth vnto / the auctoritie of the commander / sayenge / I the lorde: and as though they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a cause and a reasone why it was so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded / the lawe putteth vnto / Thou shalt not open and dyscouer thy fathers foulnes nor thy mothers / by cause it is the foulnes or fylthines of thy father and thy mother. And afterwarde streyght folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge he reakenneth vppe in ordre those / that be nexte of bloudde, with whom we muste not medle / nor open or discouer their foulnes / that is to witte, brotherne and sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne / and other that be there described.
<pb facs="tcp:7850:62"/>
The whiche cause and reasone may be also commune vnto vs / and to them / euen lyke as the commaundement is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune bothe vnto vs / and to them. Therfore let vs seke what foulnes is this, whiche who so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth and openneth / is wourthy to die for it. It is a foule thynge / whan one parte doth not agre with the other. And before the transgression of the fyrste man Adam, in all mannes body there was no thynge fowle fylthy or vnclene, no partie contrary nor rebellious to a nother. For while that same harmony and swete agrement / well and commely proporcioned, by the hande of the creator and maker god, did yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne: one partie dyd agre with an other and the soule was subiecte and obedient to god / and the body was subiect and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the soule in al pointꝭ. But after that by breakynge of the commaundement of god / the soule was made inobedyent and stubborne and rebellious agaynste god his superiour / the body inferiour was no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the soule his superiour. For streight the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressours / Adam and Eue, had theyr eies opened. And theyr eyes, sayth he, were opened / that is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7850:62"/>
the one to haue carnall lust vnto the tother / the whiche desyre and luste before they had not. And where as they before were naked / and were not a whit ashamed therof / streyghte whan they sawe that the partes of their bodyes were turned in to thynges to be ashamed of, went aboute to hyde and couer them / and dydde make co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerynge for them. The whiche thynge we maye perceyue euen nowe in children and litle babes, whiche as longe as they fele / nor perceyue no stirrynge nor motion of concupiscence or flesshely lustes / they haue no partis that they be ashamed of / bicause they can not be ashamed of any parte of their bodies. But whan they begyn ones to perceyue and fele that concupiscence / they can not suffre their priuities to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. Therfore after this harmoni and swete agrement was broken and vndone in our fyrste parentes / there happened not a lyttell foulenes and originall punysshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / that shulde go with originall sinne / fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to theyr posteritie, and to al that shulde come of them. And so by cause of this foule bodily luste &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence, that Paule calleth the body of synne / whiche is
<pb facs="tcp:7850:63"/>
within our body / those membres and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / that haue ones serued to this lust and concupiscence / be named shameful partes, foulenesse / and shame, by cause they be of knowlege / and do wytnesse of our inwarde foulenes / that is to sey / of our luste and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge to fleshely medlynge: whiche mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres euer more do require to be alway co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and hyd. And this foulenes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, desire, and lust is then opened or vncouerd / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it requireth and taketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the office and seruice of tho membres / that be ordyned for it, and dothe falle to practise / at whiche tyme all that myghte and power of the reasonable soule or of mans wytte is so dulled / so troubled / &amp; so ouercome / and so oppressed / &amp; ouerlaide by the filthy lust of the flesshe, that it may be very well sayde at that time: Adam / where arte thou? That is to say / thou that wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue ben lyke to god / I do not se wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to thou art come. And what is more foule than this foulenes? what greatter shame is there than this shame? The whiche the apostel rebukynge, Flie you, sayth he, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. All the synne, that a man doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, is without the body, but he that syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7850:63"/>
in fornication, synneth agaynste his owne body, that is to sey, all synnis truely hurteth the soule, but yet for all that they foule not the bodye: but he, that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fornication / doth not only offend god / and foule his soule / but also he defylethe and maketh vnhonest all the fayrnesse and goodlines of his body. For as a thefe, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is taken / hath a marke bourned in hym with an iron or with fire / to his vttre and euerlastinge shame and rebuke, so this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely pleasure was for a punysshement of synne put into our nature / which nature by the faute of brekyng goddes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was nowe holly corrupte thorowe and thorowe in euery parte of it, bycause that he, in whom al our holle nature was, and without whom there was no parte of it / was al holle corrupt. The which foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in all persons ought to be couered euer more with the coueryng of shamfacidnes, if it were not necessarie for the generation of man, for a peyne and punysshement of the fyrste synne. And yet there is no suche loue to the generation and encrese of man / that dothe suffre vs to discouer this foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in those persones / of whome the lawe
<pb facs="tcp:7850:64"/>
saith, that thei be next of our bloudde. For these persons by the law &amp; motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature self owe this reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of loue &amp; charite one of them to an other, so that there can be no iust &amp; lauful cause why they shulde shame and dishoneste their bodies on this facion / nor there can be no honeste excuse fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de or brought in / whiche may couer &amp; hyde this dishonestie. Not bicause I wolde sey / that mariages he nat holy, and that the bedde is not clene and without spotte &amp; synne, in the whiche matrimony is kepte laufully, with feare of god / and for charytable loue and honestye. For by suche matrymonye they that mary / be made one spirite and one sowle, syns that they be made nowe one fleshe. And thus bothe by their honest loue / and also by their desire to engendre and gette chyldren, do so hyde and couer their dishonestie, &amp; do, as ye wolde sey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure &amp; swalowe vp this penall foulenes &amp; filthines of mans generation, that as the Apostell saythe: They, that mary / be as though they were not maried. Therfore, as we haue sayde, they that were forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to mary out of their tribe: by the same lawe also were forbydden to meddle &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7850:64"/>
with them / that be nexte of their bloud. But amonge the Iewes this lawe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loue and affection scant did passe the thirde degre of consanguinite, but amonge vs (vnto whome the tyme of correctyon and amendement is come, by whome god hath corrected and amended the worlde / and brought it to perfection, whiche shal not be changed) loue hath growen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cressed, and honestie greatly abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and multiplyed / and for to be token and declare the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the gospell, that nombre of 3. is doubled / &amp; hath extende it selfe in to .6. whiche is a perfecte nombre, &amp; stondith by his owne partes / euen as the trueth of the gospell stondeth by it selfe alone / &amp; nedeth nothinge elles to vnderset and staye it vp. ¶But here thou wilte leye to my charge &amp; say / that there were in the olde tyme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good &amp; <abbr>vtuos</abbr> men, which for certain honeste causes did presume &amp; auenture to break &amp; disteine euen the firste &amp; seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d degre of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guinite, as before the lawe did Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / Isaac / &amp; Iacob / which lately before had ben disseuered &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to go aparte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / for auoidinge the couplinge &amp; mariage with the same nacions, and so did

And also Thamar kynge Dauids doughter / whan she was oppressed of her brother, Do not brother, sayd she, but aske me of the king my father / and he wyll nat denye the. The which kyng Dauid truly / that was said to gyue the syster to her brother in wyfe / was father to them bothe. wherfore where as I say they dyd presume vpon some certain honeste causes and consyderations, that chaunsed, yet for al that christian religion &amp; the perfectnes that ought to be in a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man / wyll iudge nothynge to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, that is ageynst the honestie of nature. ¶Lo here thou haste my mynde, &amp; what I thynke in this question of thyne, saythe saynt Ancelme, If thou be pleased and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented / it is well: if it displease the, I shall lyghtly get forgeuenes and perdon of the. ¶In this opinion also be Hugh Cardinal, Raufe Flauiacensis / Ruperte Tuitiensis / 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7850:65"/>
Hildebart Cenomanense / Iuo Carnotense all bysshops / and one water of Constance / archedeacon of Oxeforthe. And trewely the first two Hugh Cardinal &amp; Raufe Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiacense / expoundinge the .xviij. chaptre of the Leuiticall / shewe howe that chaptre dothe hange with tho thinges / that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Many misticall thinges, say they, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the lawe hathe gyuen to the olde people of the Iues to obserue and kepe / wherin onely was a shadowe of our faith and maners / &amp; not the very truth in dede: and as for here the lawe instructeth and teacheth the people, and gyueth them mo preceptes, wherby they may knowe what belongeth to good maners, to vertue, and honestie. For those thynges, that folowe here, must be euen so vnderstanden / as they be spoken, wherwith the people / whiche had nowe betaken them selfe to an other lorde and maister, is informed and taught / to the intent / that they for theyr lyttell power / shulde endeuer them selfe to do some good / nor shulde not be content with the heuye bourdon of bondage / and to be vnderneth sacreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, or signes and toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of sacre &amp; holy thinges / the whiche shulde

signifie and betoken iustyce and goodnes, not in them selfe, but in other men. Euen lyke wyse as if a Currour or poste shulde carye any kynges letters into farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, by the whiche he shal shewe other, what they shall do, and yet he shal not do the same him selfe. And this same Flauia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense a litell after, saith thus. Al though, saith he, that these mariages here forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in forne yeres at the begynnyng of the worlde had a certaine facion of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / neuertheles bicause in processe of time the vertue of continence and chastitie, and refraynynge of bodily luste and pleasure / was to be promoted, set forwarde, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased / and the licence and lybertie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be restrayned more straytely, and not so at large as it was wonte: this Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall lawe was made to forbyd suche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryages betwene them that be nygh of kyn and of affinite / for the encreasse of honestie and vertue, bicause that it was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to absteyne from suche maryages. And who so euer after this goddes forbod / pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to enterprise any such mariage, he is a transgressor of the lawe / and doth ron in to the abhominable crime &amp; syn of incest.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7850:66"/>
¶Forther more Rupert also, If thou as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest, sayth he, whiche be those vncleanly beastes, spoken of in the olde testament / that god doth hate, they be these, you shall not do after the custome and maner of the londe of Egypt / where as you haue dwelled / nor after the custome and vsage of the countrey of Chanaan, into the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I shall brynge you. And afterwarde he sheweth their customes, saynge: No man come nygh to her / that is next of his bloudde. For these verely be the vnclenly beastes / these be the caroginous and styn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge beastes, whiche the people of god is bounde not to eate / that is / not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them in to their company. For all those persones, that do such thynges / that commit suche vnclenly and vnresonable &amp; beastly vices, that discouer the foulenes or preuities of their mother, or father, that discouer the shame of their syster, other by the fathers syde, or by the mothers syde / those men I saye / that do these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in any maner of meane discouer the foulnes of their kynsfolke, and do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the foulenes or priuities of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath the floures: that haue a do with

their neighbours wyfe / that gyue of their sede vnto the image of Moloche / and do translate it vnto hym by fyre: these, and al suche other workers of wickednes, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyled and vncleane, vnto whom nothing is cleane. For these thynges / accordynge to the true sayenge of the gospell / do defyle and pollute the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that, that cometh into the mouth / as meate and drinke / doth not defyle or pollute a man. And we waste no time in these forbiddinges, that be here rehersed / to serche out the depenes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnes of mysticall meaninges or vnder standynges of these wordes. for they be plainly iuste and rightwise: and the reason why they be so / is open and playn at euery mans eie / and easye to se / by cause they do bryng great rest and quietnes of conscience to the herers / but rather I shulde haue said / to the doers and the folowers. ¶More ouer Hugh of saint Victore saith thus. The fyrst tyme, whan god dyd make mariage, he dyd forbydde vs onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte matrimonie with .ij. persons, that is the father and the mother. afterwardes whan he ordined mariage / the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de time / whiche was done by the lawe, he dyd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7850:67"/>
certayne other persons / both bicause nature shewed vs / that it was comely so to be / &amp; also for the increase of shamefacid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and chastite. Therfore I thynke / that excepte these foresayde mariages / where in nedeth regarde of shamefacidnes and chastite to be had, bicause of the horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and foulenes of the same: that in al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if any man by ignorance &amp; vnwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by chaunce offende in any woman / as longe as he doth not knowe it, no man can denie, but hit shall be called a lefull mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, if that it be lefully done after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the churche: so that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte euermore all suche maryages, in the whiche we muste nedes haue regarde of shamefacidnes and chastite. Therfore let no man obiecte vnto me the mariages bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene bretherne and systerne, or any suche other, with whom if any persone do mary ignorantly and vnwittyngly / this ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can not excuse them, in that thynge that they do. These be horrible and terrible, and no reasonable nor excusable dedes / in the which though there be any thing done by ignorance, yet for all that shamefastnes and chastite is disteyned and loste.
<pb facs="tcp:7850:68"/>
¶Besyde all this saynte Hildebart, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the bysshoppe Cenomanense / in a certayne epistle to the Archebisshoppe of Roan wryteth vnder this maner. As your letter sheweth, waters doughter of Medu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an / whiche is maryed to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton, men saye that she is very nygh of bloudde vnto him, and before that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde persones were maryed to gethers, water secretely came and tolde me of the kynred betwene them / and craftly did aske me counsayle / what I thought in it. He thought it very good, he sayde / if loue and charite, that shulde come by this mariage myght cease the warre, that the Erle had cruelly made agaynste him of longe conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce. He sayd more ouer / that you and other prelates of your prouince / had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned him by writynge / that this abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of kynred myght be suffred / for this entent, that he, the Erle, whiche had ben longe at warre myghte come to peace and quietnes / wherevpon he desyred also the consent of our churche Cenomanense / vnto the mariage that was then to come, that by the auctorite of that church also / he mighte stablysshe and make sure his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7850:68"/>
doughters mariage / if that at any tyme it shulde fortune a diuorse to be sued agaynst her: but he could in no meanis make me to agre to it, nor I coulde in no wise perfectly beleue, that your wisdome had fallen into the symplenes or vndiscretenes of them, whom the apostoll dothe rebuke / by cause they sey / Let vs do noughtly, that therof may come good. And therfore, as for my parte / I was ware and circumspecte. He requyred my consente: and I sente hym worde / that I wolde neuer agree vnto it, nor wolde not suffre / for regarde or consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any cause of dyspensation that coulde be, persons of kynred or affinitie to contracte vnlefull and forbidden maryage. And it shalbe longe to his cure and charge into whose parisshe or diocese it is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this woman is departed / to withsto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and be agaynste this mariage / euen vntyll it be diuorsed.</p>
            <p>¶Agayne the same Hildebart was ones asked of the bisshoppe Sagie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se / and of an other certayne Archidiacon / if two were spousyd and hande faste to gether, and the one of them dyed, whether the persone a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liue may enter matrymony with the syster
<pb facs="tcp:7850:69"/>
or brother of the deade? he aunswered on this wise: If crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of auctorite / mariage is made by consent, not by myngynge of bodies. wherfore saynte Ambrose sayth / She that is despoused / or hath made promyse vnto the man / hath taken the name of a yoked or maryed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For assone as she doth yoke her selfe by promyse vnto the man / and he to her agayne: then this promys of bothe sydes taketh the name of yokinge or maryage, not whan the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth her, by hauinge to do with her. For it is not the takynge a weye of the floure or beutie of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s virginite, that maketh the yocke, but the bargayne, agrement, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to be yoked. For whan the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is yoked by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or is handfast, then is the yokynge or mariage, not when the man dothe knowe her by hauynge to do with her. ¶Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore Isodore writeth: They be called more truely yoked to gether / for the fyrste fayth and promise of spousage, all though they be ignorant of medlynge to gether. ¶Also Nicolas writing to the bisshoppe Higmare. The onely consent, sayth he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them / of whose mariage thou dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7850:69"/>
/ is sufficient by the lawe. The whiche consent alonely if it lacke in mariage / than all that euer is done besydes forthe, is of none effecte, yea though they haue had to do to gether / as Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chrisostome / the great doctour / doth witnesse, whiche saith, <hi>VVIL,</hi> maketh mariage / &amp; not medlynge to gether. And therfore it is written in the Ciuill law in the boke of the constitutions. If a man vpon affection and mynde to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye leade a woman home to his house be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be any wrytynges made of the dowery / that he shall haue with her, lette hym not be so bolde to diuorse her frome hym / tylle he hath shewed a laufull cause of diuorse. These thynges, sayth Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert / if thou had diligently considered / for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soth this mayden shulde not haue entred maryage with that man, vnto whose bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she was coupled before by solenne mariage, and was ioyned vnto him by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, all though dethe, not loked for, dyd lette the secresis of mariage. For who so euer do contracte suche matrymonie / in no case can be suffred by any dispensation / but must be punisshed by the rule of iustice and right. And of suche mariages as these be,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:70"/>
thou shalte fynde in the counsayle Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riense. A man was handfast to a woman, with whom he coulde not haue the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of maryage: that same woman / his brother dyd priuely defyle and gette with childe. It was decreed &amp; determined / that how be it she coulde not be maried to the brother, that was her leful husbande / yet for al that the other brother, that had got her with childe, can not haue her / bicause she had made promyse before to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but both he &amp; she / that haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adultery / let them haue the punysshement of their fornication / and let them not be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nied to vse lauful mariage / the man to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laufully to whom he wyll / and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man also. For our fore fathers / by cause that maryage shulde be done with hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie / and the mariage bedde without spotte and vncleannes, they haue very diligently prouyded here before / that a woman / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che had made promysse, and was spoused vnto the one broder / coulde not be maried to the other broder: and he that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate, or be trouthed, to one sister / shuld not mary the tother sister. For by suche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and licence through the crafte &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7850:70"/>
of the deuyl / there might come many vnhonest &amp; beastly or incestuous mariages / whiche be ceassed / al the while that the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>biddinge of the lawe is obserued.</p>
            <p>¶And to the selfe same purpose, saint Iuo sometyme bisshop Carnotense, wrote vnto Lesiarde bisshop Swessionense. you know wel inough, saith he, that I neuer allowed the maryage betwene Peter / the sonne of Geruase / and of Galeranes doughter of Brutule / and that I neuer gaue counsaile / nor dyd neuer consente / that it shulde be done. Yea whan that Galeran, the maides father cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayled me in this matter / I gaue hym counsayle, by Drogon clerke / vtterly to the contrary, that it shuld in no wise be done, bycause that suche mariages might not stande / if there were any / that wolde breake it. I added also the sayinge of the lawe, that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be maried to .ij. sisters, likewise as one woman can not lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be maried to .ij. brothers. For Sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gund / the sister of this maiden / whom this forsayd Peter hath nowe maried, was the same selfe Peters wyfe, not only made sure and handfaste vnto hym by promysse / but also yoked and conioyned by the preestes

beneson and prayer. And if you lay against me / that ther was no yoking or mariages / where it is well knowen, there folowed no carnall medlinge betwene the man and the woman: I answere by the auctorite of the fathers, that the yocke and maryage can neuer be vndone / seinge there was ones a stedfast conuenant &amp; promisse of yoking or mariage betwene them. wherfore, as saint Augustine sayth, the aungell sayde true to good Ioseph: Feare not to take Marye thy wyfe to the. for he dyd truely calle her Iosephs wyfe, whom he had not knowen by secresye of maryage / nor neuer shulde knowe. And whan he had brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auctorities of the fathers / to this pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the whiche were cited before of Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debarte, It is, sayth he, a canonicall lawe, that no man can marie that woman, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath made promisse of mariage to an other man. Nor contrarie / if the man that hath made promysse, wolde be maryed to an other woman. For bothe the lawes of god and man forbydde these promysses to be broken. ¶This same saynte Iuo also writeth to Odon, the archidiacon. Euen from the begynnynge of the worlde, sayde
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7850:71"/>
he, the sacrament of maryage remaynethe styll / as of the lawe of Nature / and in no poynt broken nor changed / so that nother original sinne, or Adams trespas toke that away / nor the iudgement of drownyng the worlde / wherby synnes and naughty thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were wasshed away / dyd take away or chaunge maryage. Therfore that thynge that is ordyned by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of god / &amp; that god wold haue to be vnchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable / ought not be broken by no mannes commaundement / except the mariage were made without consent of the parties / or els dampnable of it selfe, that is: falsely forged and vntrue / or els incestuouse and agaynste Nature and kynde. That if any of those thinges do chance / there must be no delay / but suche mariages muste be healed out of hande by departing and diuorse. Therfore though the kyng do promisse, that he wyll forgyue many displesures / done vnto hym, and leaue many displeasures / that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that he woll do many good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and many plesures, if he may kepe still for a tyme this woman / whiche he vnlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hath / and the seate apostolyke to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent withal, and he to be styl in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb facs="tcp:7850:72"/>
of christian men: yet for all that I say and aunswere vnto you thus / by the auctorite of god and diuine scripture, that it is not possible for him to haue forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his synne / gyue he neuer so moche / or do he neuer so many good dedes in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / pence, as longe as he hath wyll and minde to abyde in the same synne, acordynge to the sayinge of the appostel: There is none hoste, sacrifyce / nor amendes / nor forgyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / for the synne of them, that synne wylfully. whiche in other wordes is as moche to say / that no persone / hauynge wyll and mynde to contynue in his synne / can haue forgyuenes of his synne by any maner of almes / or by any maner of good dedes, or by any maner of offrynge, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowyng of his goodes. wherfore we rede that our lorde also did answere Cain / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he offred vp his goodes, and for all that did intende murder: Yf thou, sayde god, doste offer a ryght, and doste not diuide a ryght, thou hast synned / Ceasse &amp; leaue of? as though he had sayd, thou dost synne / bi cause thou dost not departe &amp; diuide wel / which dost bring me thy goodes, &amp; thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>king vpon murder / dost take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me thyne owne
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7850:72"/>
selfe which art better to me tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thi goodꝭ. ¶Her fore also that good Pope Gelasius saythe. It is not redde, syns Christes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion began, nor there can none example begeuen in the churche of god / that this thinge was euer done or euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be done, other of any bysshoppes, or by the apostels them selfe, or els by our lorde &amp; sauiour him selfe: that any man shulde be assoiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his syn / that intended to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue in the same, &amp; dyd not fully purpose for euer to forsake &amp; vtterly to renounce / bothe that &amp; al other synne / or thinge that shuld displese god. ¶More ouer the same saint Iuo did write vnto He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d / that wolde haue maried his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one Hugh, a kinsma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his, answeri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wise.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, &amp; that the wyl &amp; minde of carnal ꝑsons shuld thorow this bestly exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple be encora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit like incest &amp; mariage again na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; kinde: for the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that we haue vnto you / &amp; true loue, that we bere you, we desire to admonisshe your maieste before / that while you may do it with your hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, you suffre no such mariage to be made:

leste that suche mariage / seinge it is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be agaynste the lawe, be worthily and of right broken and vndone agayn by the lawe. And doubtles it becommeth not a kynges maieste to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any suche faulte in his owne persone / the whiche ought to be punysshed in other with the rygor and extremite of the lawe. For sothe we can in no case swarue from the course and ordre of the lawe. If we se our parisshon / or one of our diocese co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte any abhomination / specially in mariage / bycause of the decree of the seate apostolike: <hi>VVE</hi> reserue no maner of forgyuenes / no maner of perdon or dispensation for incest mariages / &amp; suche as be against nature and kynde, vntil they haue healed their adultery by departynge and diuorce.

            <p>¶And he agayne wryteth to Damberte / the Archebysshop of Senon / of a knight / whiche before laufull maryage with his wyfe / laye with her syster, and dyd confesse his faute openly / wherevpon saynt Iuos wordes be these. I answere vnto your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therheed / that thinge, whiche you knowe well inough / that if he had brought vp an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infamy and sklander / and that against an honeste persone / that hath deserued no suche thing / hereafter he can nother accuse nor yet be wytnesse. But bycause no man, that is gilty, can make no confession, except it be of some naughtie thynge / we can not denye, but we oughte to receyue and take suche confessions, as they that be penitent or sorye for that they haue myssedone, do make against their owne selfe / for the feare and drede of god / and for the helth of their
<pb facs="tcp:7850:74"/>

Bicause therfore that the ende of all stryfe and controuersie / that belongeth to the determinacion of the Churche, is an Othe, after the sayenge of the apostel / this confession muste be confirmed / and proued by seuerall othes of euery persone / and by vi. sufficient and honest persones: the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che either were present, &amp; knewe the thinge done, or elles maye by profe of that / that they beleue and thynke lykely / affirme and vpholde the trouthe.

And we reserue no maner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuenesse for vnchaste mariages / after the canons, vntyll they haue healed suche syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mariages by departinge and diuorse. And he that did contrarie to the lawes of matrimony, and did accuse hym selfe, lette hym abide vnmaried, either for euermore, or at the least til the time that he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylled his pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

            <p>¶Finally walter of Constance, Archidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of Oxforthe, wrote vnto the bysshop of Exceter worde for worde, as here after folowethe. Seinge that bothe great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, and also vse and experience of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hath made you wise and circumspect in iugement and decision of causes, we mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle, &amp; other also, whiche be very wel ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in both the lawes maruayle / wherfore you haue so longe time differred to make a
<pb facs="tcp:7850:75"/>
diuorce betwene Roberte and Ismen his
kynswoman, specially seing that you haue expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Pope for the same, and seynge that holy Canons do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and compte it for a damnable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable synne / to suffre suche persones to dwelle to gether. Trewely there were brought forthe laufull wytnesse, and suche as no exception / nor refuse or chalenge can be layde agaynste them: whiche if they haue not made full profe vnto you in this matter / than (as well accordynge to the clause of the Popes letters / where as he saythe, you may proue the matter by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other / as also by auctoritie of Fabian and Celestine / and other holy fathers) you muste admytte them, whiche after these forsayde men, be moste nigh vnto you / and of moste sage counsaile / that suche diligent inquisition and serchynge out of the truth may be a lanterne to your feate, that you may tourne iustice into iugement. For the more abhominable and beastly synne that incest is, so moche the more scrupulouse &amp; curious you must be / to fynde out the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinte of this kynrede: so that in makynge the diuorce, the iuges sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce do not wauer

or hange doutfull. It is not leful for a iuge in this matter to dissemble or to vse any cloke or colour / and to make as he dyd not knowe that thing, that he knoweth in such a matter / wherin stondethe the perylle of mens soules. More ouer there is one thing in this matter / that troubleth vs aboue al. For wher as the said Robert is myn eldest brothers eldest son / and bicause that al the progenie of our stocke dothe hange vpon hym, as of the heed / by reason of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we feare leaste this synne of inceste or vnchaste mariage shulde passe from hym into his posterite / and to al that euer shuld come of hym. For all the holle succession and generation shall receyue and take cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and infection / if the membres come not laufully and without corruption from the heed: if the riuers come not pure from the spryng / and the braunches without cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption from the body of the tree / as holy scripture also dothe witnes, sayinge: The childerne of inceste persones be abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before god. And as saynte Gregorye dothe playnly saye, There cometh no lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor good issue of vnchast or inceste and vnkynde medlinge to getheer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7850:76"/>¶Nowe for to come also to the scole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours / whiche do vpholde and mainteine bothe with great nombre / &amp; great consent / this iugement of these forsaid fathers, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Leuiticall prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Forsothe saint Thomas saith. In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersacion of persons, that be of kynrede or of affinite, we fynde that ther shuld be no venereous medlyng, for .iii. resons. And first bicause that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oweth a certayne honor &amp; reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence / &amp; feare to his parentes, and therfore also vnto other of his kyn, which come ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nigh of the same parentes. In so moche that in olde tyme, as Valerius Maximus sheweth, hit was not leful for the sonne to baath in one place with his fader / lest they shuld se eche other naked. And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that in venereous dedis / there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine foule vse of medling and homelynes / whiche is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to honour &amp; reuerence. wherfore men do blusshe &amp; be asshamed of suche dedes. And therfore it is vncomely, that there shulde be any suche wantonne medlynge betwene suche persones. And this reason semethe to be expressed in the xviij. chapitre of the Leuiticall / where it is sayde: She is thy mother / thou shalte
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7850:76"/>
not vncouer her foulenes or priueties. And the same selfe thynge is sayde there also afterwardes on other persones. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde reason is, bybause persones that be of one bloudde / muste nedes be conuersant and in company to gether. wherfore if su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che persons shulde not be forbidden to vse suche wanton pastimes / one with an other / men shuld haue to moche oportunite and occasion to vse suche lustful intermedlyng. And so the stomakes of men shulde be out of courage, and their hartes cowardelike, and as it were woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hartes, by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of lechery and beastly pleasure of the bodye. And therfore in the olde Leuitical lawe, those persones seme specially to be forbydden maryage, whiche muste nedes dwell to gether. The thyrde reason is / bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause that by suche mariages / shulde be lettedde the multyplyenge and increace of frendship. For whan a man dothe take a wyfe / that is a straunger to hym / all the kynsfolke of his wyfe be knytte vnto hym by certayne frendeshyppe and loue / as if they were his owne kynsfolke. wherfore Augustin sayth, There was very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde taken of loue and charite / and that
<pb facs="tcp:7850:77"/>
accordynge to ryght and reason, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that men, vnto whom loue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde is bothe profitable and also honeste / shulde be knytte to gether by sondry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of kynred. And that one man shulde not haue many / but sondry to be disseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in sondry persones. And Aristotell, an heathen man / in the .ij. boke of the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, putteth to, the .iiij. reason / bicause that where a man doth loue his kinswoman by Nature / if there shulde be put to the loue that comethe of bodely medlynge / there shuld be to moche heate and feruentnes of loue / and to great a prouocation of flesshly luste, whiche is contrary to the chastite of mariage / where suche pastime is to be vsed for necessitie, and not for pleasure. Thus sayth saint Thomas here. And in an other place he sayth thus, That thynge in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age / is cleane contrarye to the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherby matrimony cometh not vnto the ende / whiche it was ordyned for / by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meanes. And the chiefe and fyrste ende of mariage of it selfe, is the good or benyfite of issue / the whiche doubtles by some certayne degrees of kynrede is lette / as betwene the father and the doughter,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7850:77"/>
the mother and the sonne, not bicause that issue here is vtterly taken a waye, (for the doughter maye haue issue of her fathers sede, and nourysshe it vp with the father / and teache and instructe it, in the whiche thyng stondeth the benifite of issue) but by cause that this ende of mariage, that is to haue issue &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can not be brought to passe in this case by any lefull &amp; honest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For it is ageynst all good ordre &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son / that the doughter shuld be coupled bi mariage with her owne fader / to be his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to bringe hym forthe children / &amp; to brynge them vp, seinge that she ought to be subiecte to her father in all thynges, as that dothe come of hym, and hath her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of hym / and therfore by the lawe of nature hit is forbydden, that any persone shulde marie father or mother / &amp; yet more with the mother, than with the father, by cause that hit is more contrarie to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / that is due vnto the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, if the sonne take his moder to wife / than if the father shuld take his doughter to his wyfe, bicause that the wife is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of god / to be subiecte and obedient vnto her husbande.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7850:78"/>¶But the seconde ende of mariage is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressynge and quenchinge of bodely luste, and concupiscence / whiche restraint of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luste / though it be not the fyrst &amp; chiefe ende of mariage / but the seconde / yet of it selfe it is an ende of mariage. And this ende also shulde perysshe and be loste / if a man myght marye whiche of his kynswomen he wolde. For there shulde be opened a great wycket vnto lustes of the bodye / ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there were some restraint / and flesshly medling forbidden amonge those persons, whiche muste nedes be conuersaunt to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one house. And therfore the lawe of god hath not only forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage with the father and the mother, but also with other persons / that be of our kynred, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che muste nedes company to gethers / and are bounde to conserue / the one the others chastite and honestie. And the lawe of god doth assygne this cause / sayenge: Vnheale not the foulenes of suche &amp; suche persones / bicause it is foulenes. But an other ende of matrimony not properly and of it selfe, but ioyned vnto it / is byndynge and knyttynge to gether of men, and multiplyenge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasse of frendshyppe, loue, and charitie,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7850:78"/>
while a man is in lyke maner to his wynes kynsfolke / as he is to his owne kynsfolke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therfore this increase of loue and charite shulde wrongfully take harme / if any man shulde mary her / that is knytte vnto hym all redy by bloudde. For by this mariage there shulde be none increasse of any newe frendeship loue and charite. And therfore by the lawes of man / and also by the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the church / there be many degres / in the whiche folke are forbidden to mary. ¶Ande saynt Thomas sayth in an other place on this wyse. Accordynge to dyuers tymes it is founde, that kynrede hath lette mariage in diuers degres. for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of mankynde father &amp; mother were onely forbydden to marye with, by cause there were fewe men / and of necessite men were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to do al their labour &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that they coulde / for the increase of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. &amp; therfore there were no more ꝑsons to be except, but those / whiche were not fit to be maried withal, &amp; I say fit, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the principal ende &amp; cause of mariage, which is the good or benifit to haue issue &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I said before. But afterwardes / whan mankinde was increased and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb facs="tcp:7850:79"/>
/ there were many mo persons excepte by Moses lawe / whiche began euin at that time to restrayne and refrayne mans concu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piscence &amp; luste. wherfore (as sayth Rabbi Moses) al those persones be excepte from mariage / whiche be wonte to dwelle to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one house. For seinge it must nedes be, that they / whiche come of one pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, or of one father and mother, bothe men &amp; women indifferently, company to gether of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge tyme in one house, plainly they shuld haue great prouocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; stirringe to flessh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luste / if it were not forbidden, that there shulde be no suche medley betwene those persons. And now, whan that they thinke sureli and beleue, that there can in no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes mariage be contracte &amp; made betwene them laufully, streight wayes that filthie luste and plesure is quenched &amp; ceassed / nor doth not prouoke nor stirre their myndes any longer / to desyre tho thynges, that be vnpossible, &amp; can not be done. wherby they instructe and taught to tame and refrayne their fylthy desire, as it were by a certayne former exercise &amp; practise, and assayenge of them selfe: no doubte but by this custome they shal the better absteyne afterwardes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7850:79"/>
from other women. for (as saynt Augustin saythe) custome to a thynge maye do very moche / either to prouoke mans appetite / and to make him haue a lust or desire to it, or to turne away his appetite from it, and to make hym to abhorre it. And therfore seinge that custome doth kepe in &amp; restrayn our vnmoderate luste and concupiscence in this matter: men do well to iudge / that it is a shamfull thynge to breke and corrupt it. For if hit be ageynst right, for desire of possession, to passe or breake the buttels of londes: howe moche more vnrightfull is it, for the lustnes of bodely plesure, to passe or breake the buttayles of good maners &amp; customes? ¶Furthermore saint Thomas sayth agayne / in an other place. Affinite, that is betwene persones before mariage, doth let the mariage / that is to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and dothe breke the mariage / that is contracted al redy / euen like wyse as dothe consanguinitie. ¶And in an other place. Infidels or vnfaythfuls, that be not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised / be not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the lawes of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / but yet they be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to the ordinance of the lawe of god.

            <p>¶More ouer and beside all these thinges, the same saint Thomas / where as he goth aboute to shewe what is the Popes aucto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie / and what thynges be in the Popes power / &amp; what thinges be not: The Pope, saithe he, hath full power in the churche / that is to be vnderstanden, that the Pope may dispense with all maner of thynges / that be institute &amp; ordeined by the church, or by the prelates of the churche, for these be tho thynges, whiche are saide to be of the lawe of man, or of the lawe positiue, which be no suche maters / that they binde of them selfe / but only by cause they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. But in suche ordinaunces, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be of the lawe of god / or of the lawe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7850:80"/>
of nature / the Pope hath no power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense: bicause these lawes haue strengthe and vertue by the ordinaunce of god / and they be vpon suche matters / that be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of their owne selues vnto the helthe of mannes soule. And vnder this maner these lawes muste be obseruid and kepte in all cases / and euery man is bounde to kepe them without dispensation. For lyke wyse as in the comune lawe of man, no man can dispense / but he / of whom the lawe hath auctorite &amp; strength / &amp; that is the maker of the lawe / or els he / to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maker of the lawe hath giuen suche power: so in the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of goddes lawe / whiche be of god / &amp; haue their auctorite &amp; strength of god, no man hath power to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se / but only god, or he / vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath specially gyuen suche power &amp; auctorite. For euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of what so euer auctorite or power he be / is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison to the lawe of god / euen as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ꝑson, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g no power nor auctorite / is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison to a comun lawe of the people. Nowe the lawe of god is what so euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the new lawe of the gospell, orels to the olde lawe of Moses, but this is the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce bitwen the two lawes, for the olde
<pb facs="tcp:7850:81"/>
lawe did appoynt &amp; set fourthe many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / and gaue many preceptis, about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and outwarde thinges, perteyning vnto the honour of god, and also diuerse preceptes of iugementes, that do serue for to kepe iustice amonge men: but the newe lawe of Christe / and the law of the gospel, the whiche is the lawe of libertie and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath no suche determinations, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntmentes, or boundes / but is contente with preceptes &amp; instructions of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the lawe of nature / and with the ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticles of the faythe, and with sacramentes of grace. And for this cause it is called the lawe of faythe / &amp; the lawe of grace / bicause it dothe determine, whiche be the articles of the faithe, and what is the vertue of the sacramentes. As for al other thinges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che perteyne to the determinacion and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne orderinge of suites and iudgementes betwene man and man, orels to the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of the seruice of god: Christe / the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ker of the newe lawe, did leaue them frely to be determined &amp; ordred by the prelates of the church / and by the princes &amp; kinges, that haue the rewle of Christes people. wherfore all suche maner determinations
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7850:81"/>
and ordinances do perteyne to the lawe of man, wherin the pope hath power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense: but those thinges, that be onely of the law of nature, and in the articles of the fayth, and in the sacramentes of the newe lawe, he hath no power to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se. for that shulde not be to haue power for to meyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the truthe, but to haue power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye the truthe. ¶And a littell after he sayth, that the apostel in his doctrine gaue instructions two maner of wayes. for some thinges he taught, not as his owne, but as publisshing vnto them the lawe of god, as is this: If you be circumcised, Christe shal helpe you nothinge at all / and many suche other thinges: and in these the pope hath no power to dispense. And certain thinges he techeth, as makinge ordinances by his owne auctorite &amp; power. For he saith: wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I come, I shal set an ordre vpon the other thinges. Also he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded / that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theringes of money for pore people shuld be done on one of their holy days, or days of reste: the whiche perteyneth not to the lawe of god. And like wise also where he writeth, that he, which is bigamꝰ or twise maried, shulde not be promoted to prest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod:
<pb facs="tcp:7850:82"/>
that is not of the lawe of god / but an ordinaunce by the auctorite of man / gyuen vnto hym by god. ¶And hytherto we haue rehersedde the wordes of Thomas. Nowe beside hym Altissiodorense saythe thus. Euery persone is laufull to contracte mariage with any other ꝑson, by the lawe of nature, a fewe excepte, as the father and the doughter / the mother and the sonne: whiche were except at the beginninge. And excepte those persones also / whiche be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by the Leuitical. For those preceptes / that be there / be no iudiciall preceptes / but moral / and perteininge to vertue and good maners. ye and we calle them morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes, or rules of vertue, not of mans tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge, but euen of nature. And we saye more ouer / that al preceptes of moralite na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall can not be chaunged, nor dispensed withal, as touchinge the substance of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. But by the lawe positiue / or the lawe of man / matrimonie in tymes passed hath ben forbidden, vnto the .vii. degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie or kynrede: but nowe a dayes onely vnto the .iiii. degree. ¶Ageyn Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Palude resoninge, whether the pope hath auctorite and power, for to releasse &amp;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7850:82"/>
dispense with these Leuitical prohibicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The pope, sayth he, hath no power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense in the fyrst degree of affinite / no more than he hath in the fyrst degree of consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie: bycause that it is contrary to the lawe of Nature and of god also. For we do reuerence vnto our fathers wyues / as we do to our owne mothers. Maryage also is forbydden by the lawe of god be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene these persones / whiche be in the first degree of consanguinite or affinite / not the one streight aboue the tother / but the one of side halfe to the tother, as brother &amp; sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. and therfore in this degree also the pope hath non auctorite to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se / bicause that this dispensation also is some wise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst nature. And therfore the loue and bonde, that is betwene suche persons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally / doth not suffre vs to suspect or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse / that there shulde be any heuy crime commytted betwene suche persones. And for this men beleue, that euen before the lawes of Moses, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that mankinde was ones encreased / other before the fludde, or after, they dyd absteyne from their owne systers / and from their brothers wyues, but if it were to stirre vppe sede to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:7850:83"/>
/ that was deade, as it is manifeste in Thamar, and in Iudas children. Nor it is nothinge ageynst this / that we say / that is writen of the wyues of Abraham &amp; Isaac / whom their husbondes called systers / by cause doubtles they were of their bloudde or kinrede / euen like wise as Loth was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abrahams brother, whiche was i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dede Abrahams brother sonne, and not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No more the Pope hath no power to dispense, that a man shulde marie the wife of his brother / although he died with out children. For howe be it men were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do thus in tyme passed: yet that was nat but by dispensation / yea and that dispensation was by the lawe of god, &amp; not by no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munly by the lawe of god they did absteine from their brothers wife / as from their owne sister: but it was suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that case. wherfore like wise as the Pope hath no power nor auctorite to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense for a pluralite of wyues, al though it was suffred in time passed / bicause it was suffred by a certayne dispensation and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilege granted by god, and was forbidden by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun lawe: no more auctorite nor power hath the pope to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se in the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7850:83"/>
/ that we speke of / that a man may mary the wife of his brother / departed without children / for to stirre vp the sede to his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: bicause that wher that thing was suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fred afore times, it was suffred only by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of god / for a certayne tyme, lyke as it was to haue many wyues, &amp; was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydden generally by the commune lawe. Nor ageyn he can not dispense with them that be in the seconde degree, the tone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the tother: but on the syde halfe, as to marie with the father or mothers sister. for this is forbidden by the lawe of god. ¶And with this dothe agre in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Antonine, archebisshop of Florence / Ihon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Turre cremata / some tyme Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of saynt Syxt. for Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> partly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auctorite of Pope Innocent, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Palude / and of Alexander de Hales, &amp; partly of .iii. other fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations / or resons at the last / after that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his aduersaries sayenges and opinions, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:7850:84"/>
taken away in the tyme of grace, that is to say, whan the lawe of grace / and of the godspell began, and that the Pope can not dispense with them. And the selfe same Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writeth / howe that Eugenius and Pius, beynge Popes and rulers of the churche of Rome, when that the kynge some tyme of Fraunce and the Erle of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minache did instantly desire the forsayde two Popes, that they wolde do them so moche pleasure, as to dispense with them / that the Erle myght marye his naturall syster, and that the kynge might mary the syster of his wyfe, that was departedde: these forsayde Popes did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte these .ij. matters vnto the preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Rote of the courte of Rome, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge whom was this forsaide Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of no small reputation / and to all the other great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men / whiche at that tyme chaunced to be at Rome / that this matter shulde be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by their lernynge and discrecion / that is to wit, whether it was lefull for the Popes to dispense in these cases. And after that they had disputed longe tyme vpon this matter, and had taken as moche deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration in it, as the thynge required, all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7850:84"/>
those lerned and wyse men / with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and agrement / came to this poynte / gaue this sentence, and made answere on this maner / that the Popes had no power nor auctorite to dispense in these degrees. Their reasone was this, bicause that these degres were forbidden by the lawe of god. The whiche verdit and sentence was of so great auctorite and strengthe, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes / when a certayne bishop had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid a false bull / by the colour and pretense of the whiche the Erle was maried vnto his owne sister: the bisshop was bothe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued from his dignitie, &amp; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to perpetuall prisone. That if so be (quod Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that euer any Pope had dispensed in these degres, bycause that either he was ignorant in the scripture of god, or elles all to blynded with couetous of money / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che customably be wonte to be offered for suche vnreasonable and shamfull dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacions, contrary to all goddes lawe / and mans: or by cause he wolde please men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then god: it foloweth not for all that / that he myght do it iustly and ryghtfully.

sone, that is ouer vs side wise.</p>
            <p>¶And thus also Astexan sayth / that the Pope can not dispense in the degrees / that be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the law of god, in the .xviij. chapter of the Leuiticall: and yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres forbidden bi the lawe of man he may.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte in any degree forbidden by the lawe of nature, or by the lawe of god: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwene them is no mariage, nor yet neuer was. For all be bounde to obeye the lawe of god / and the lawe of Nature, be they faithfull or other. And therfore after that they be conuerted to the fayth / they muste be departed. But if they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte in any degre, that is forbydden one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the churche / seinge that the lawes of the churche made for christian men be not extended vnto the vnfaithfuls or hethens, that were neuer baptisid / the mariage that was contracte betwene them was laufull / and therfore after that they be conuerted vnto the faith, they ought not to be diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And the same man saith furthermore, that if mankynde shulde fayle and decay, as hit dydde in the tyme of Noe: yet hit shulde not be lefull for the brotherne, by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7850:85"/>
their owne auctoritie / to mary their sisters, bicause it is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bi the law of god / but it might be leful for them by the dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>satio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god. ¶Beside all this Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bacon / an englissheman / was in time passid clapped &amp; whistled out at Rome, bycause a while he helde the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari opinion, that is, that the Pope might dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with degres / forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bi the law of god. But at the last he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged his errour, and sayd, that the Pope had no power to dispense in the degrees forbydden by the lawe of god / in the .xviij. chaptre of the Leuitical. And afterwarde, whan he had asked this question / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we kepynge the Leuiticall lawe of the Iues, be our selfe Iues also or no, in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng / did make answere him selfe.

            <p>¶Fynally that euery one of those prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of mariages, whiche be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Leuitical / be commaunded for a playne and a clere reason of iustice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, that is in them / and that is appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and euident at the eie without any mistical meanyng or vnderstandynge. Ye and more ouer that it is vtterly a poynt of heresye / to saye / and holde that they be not but iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall ordinances of Moses, and that they be at this daye abrogate and taken awaye / as wyclefe did holde, and that they ought to be obserued and kepte with al reuerence amonge all christian people, as morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of natures teaching / and that man in no case can dispense with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:7850:91"/>¶And amonge al / there is one thing, that I wold haue the / gentyl indifferent reder / specially to marke / whiche dyuers of these holy &amp; approued doctours do holde also / that the brother can not marye a woman / that is but onely handefaste vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / &amp; if he do / the mariage can not stande by helpe of any dispensation, and that all suche mariages must nedes be vtterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, leste carnall persons shuld apply their mindes, and be incouraged by suche bestly exemples to do likewise.</p>
            <p>¶And in this opinion both Lire him selfe is, whiche saith that Adonias, kinge Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids sonne / dyd synne, and dyd agaynst the helth of his owne soule, and contrarye to the lawe of god, written in the Leuiticall, and that therfore he had well deserued to be slayne of Salomon his brother / beynge kyng / bicause that he desyred to haue Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac, one of the spouses of Dauid his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and yet Dauid neuer touched her, but lefte her a cleane virgin.</p>
            <p>¶Agein that noble diuine Hugh of saynt Victore is also in the same opynyon. For all though, saythe he, that the woman, with whom it is knowen / that the man
<pb facs="tcp:7850:92"/>
had no carnall medlinge / doth not perteine to that sacrement or holy mistery, whiche Paule calleth a great sacrament / that is betwene Christe and his churche, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or faithfull christian people / yet vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it perteyneth to an other sacrament or holy misterie / the which is moche greatter that is betwene god &amp; mannes soule. For what? if it be a great mistery / that is in the flesshe / is hit not as great a mysterye / yea and moche greatter, that is in the spirite? for the flesshe doth nothynge helpe, it is the sprite, that quickeneth and giueth life. Therfore it is trewe mariage / and the very sacrament of maryage, all though there neuer folowed no flesshly a do / ye to speke better / bothe the mariage &amp; the sacrament is so moche the trewer, and the holyer, in so moche as there is nothinge in it / wherof chastite shulde be asshamed / but wherof loue may reioyce and glory. For if god by scripture be well called spouse of mannes soule / &amp; the soule ageyn the spouse of god, forsothe there is some thinge bytwene the soule and god, wher of this thynge, that stondeth in mariage betwene man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is the sacrament and image / and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihode
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7850:92"/>
and holy signe or token. And pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, for to speke more playnly in this matter / the very company / which is kepte outwardly in mariage, accordynge to the promys, that eche made to other, is the sacrament, and sygne or token. And the thinge selfe of this sacrament, is the loue of myndes of one to the other / whiche is kepte betwene them in this bonde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and leage of mariage. And agayne the same loue and fauour in their mindes, the tone to the tother, is the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and token of that loue and charite, by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che god ioyneth him selfe vnto mans soule inwardly / by putting in to the soule, of his grace and by sendinge into the soule parte of his godly spirite, by the which the soule is made one spirite with god. Therfore the flesshly couplyng, which before the sinne of Adam / was in mariage an office or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dede, and after the synne / it was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the same maryage for a remedy: so bothe tymes it is put vnto mariage, but so that it is with mariage / but mariage han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not of it. For trewe mariage is before any flesshely medlynge / and mariage may be holy without any suche thing / it shulde
<pb facs="tcp:7850:93"/>
doubtles not be so fructefull, if suche med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge were not, but mariage is moche clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if no suche thynge be in it. For that af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter synne, flesshely medlynge is suffered in maryage / it is rather of great sufferaunce &amp; compassion / lest the vice of concupiscence and lustines / whiche after that synne was roted in mans flesshe / shulde contrary to all honestie, and without measure / breke forthe and flowe abroode in euery place without any regarde, if there hadde ben no certayne place prouyded by the lawe, where hit maye be laufullye receyued. wherfore the verye true perfecte, and full mariage / is the same company, conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lyuynge to gether / the whiche is consecrate by the leage or bonde of spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or promysse, that one dothe make to the tother, whan bothe of them by theyr free and wyllinge promysse / do make them selfe detters / the tone to the tother: and do wyllyngly bynde them selfe by conuenant, that fro hense forthe the tone wyll neuer depart from the tother to the company of none other persone, while thother is aliue / nor that they wil neuer diuorce them selfe, nor breake of from this companye / that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7850:93"/>
nowe is betwene them. And if so be it / that vnto this conuenant and agrement of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation and company to gether, there be put to also in the first metynge a conuenant and bargayne of carnall medlynge / than the man and the woman be afterwardes bounde / the tone to the tother / of duetie to this flesshely medling. And if perauenture at the makyng of the mariage this carnall couplynge be remytted on bothe parties / by the vowe &amp; consent or promysse of them both, afterwardes they be no more detters the tone to the tother for this thynge. For that thinge / whiche by equale consent and agrement was remytted of bothe parties / and confirmed by their vowe and promis / it can not be iustely required afterwardes of other of them, and yet for all that / the sacrament of maryage stondethe euen in this case stedfaste and sure / wherof the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall couplynge is nother cause of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodnesse of it, whan it is there / nor can not take away the vertue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnes of mariage, if it be not there. And therfore this onely consent and agrement of their myndes is thoughte to vpholde and contynewe this vnpartable conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:7850:94"/>
and lyuynge to gether. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was ordyned for this cause, that this company of the tone with the tother / the whiche was begonne betwene them by this consent and agrement, shulde not be suffered to be broken at any tyme, as longe as they were bothe alyue. ¶So that now, reder, as thou hast seen by these two auctours, it is playne and open, that not onely the fyrste degree of consanguinitie and affinite / but also the fyrste degre / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in maryage is forbydden, for a Iustyce grounded onely vpon acertayne commune honestie and comelynes, is forbydden by the lawe of god / in the Leuiticall, and can not be dispensed withall by men.</p>
            <p>¶And that this thynge is very certayne and trewe / thou mayste take this for a good profe / that Alexander in tyme pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed / the thyrde Pope of that name, hadde leauer to suffre Henry / a citizin of Papi, to be periured / than that he wolde take vpon hym the auctoritie to dispense with hym for his othe / by the whiche he hadde bounde hym selfe to marye a maydden to his yongeste sonne, whiche hadde bene made sure before to his eldest sonne / nowe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7850:94"/>
beynge departed. For he aunswered the bysshoppe of Papi on this maner: By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, saythe he, that it is wrytten in the Leuiticall, that the brother can not haue the brothers spouse, we commaunde the, that thou suffre not this fore sayde Henry to fulfyll his purpose / and that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle hym by the ordre of the churche to do penaunce for his vnleafull othe.</p>
            <p>¶wherfore seynge that these thynges be thought trewe to so many and so discrete auctours / that it is not laufull for a man to marye his brothers spouse: howe moche more vnlaufull oughte we to thynke this thynge, that a man shulde marie his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wydowe, with whome his brother hadde carnally a do, and that he shulde vncouer the priuities of her / whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is one flesshe with his brother / not onely by the bonde of mariage selfe, with the other brother / but also by reason of carnall commixion and medlynge with the same? And therfore doubtles euery man ought greatly to approue and commende this determination of these vniuersities / whiche do holde and conclude / that to marye her, whom the brother, departed
<pb facs="tcp:7850:95"/>
without children, hath lefte, is so forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the lawe of god, and also by the lawe of Nature / that the Pope hath none auctorite nor power to dispense with suche mariages, whether they be contracte all redye, or for to be contracte: excepte pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture there be any man, whiche hath a pleasure to calle agayne into lyghte / olde reproued errours and heresies, that of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny yeres haue ben condemned.</p>

And we wyl not folowe here the scrupulose and curious labour and diligence of some men, whiche diuide and drawe into ouer many gobettes and peaces / the true signification / meanynge / and nature of these wordes. Surely we wyll not medle with no suche thynges, whiche all though they seme at other tymes / quicke or sharpe, and maye gyue and shewe to thorny, crabbed, and comberous wittes stertyng holes to skape out bi / if at any time their armi be brought into a streyte: yet doutles, as for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they do nothinge but make it darker / and incombre mens iugement.

Therfore to come to our purpose / the definition of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis lawe is this. ¶The lawe of god is the

goddes law might be distinct and knowen a sondre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudiciall, ceremonial, and mans lawes, the whiche / he wyl say / be not the lawes of god / by cause that the nexte and streicht intent of them is not to ordre &amp; leade man to that ende / whiche is laste of al / and aboue or beyonde nature / and how that he shall lyue with god in heuen / but only to an ende natural, howe he may lyue in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men welthe / and in company of men, whiche is called a politike or a ciuill ende.

or definition of the lawe of god, we did not so moch regarde it / and of purpose / and for the nonse, we dyd leaue out the lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultory and permissiue.

And yet if any body wyll examine and trie out this definition of ours / by the rules of logike, perchaunce he shal fynde / that it is absolute and perfet in al pointes.

called naturals: and iudicials: and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials. The difference of these, the Diuines fynde out on this maner.</p>
            <p>¶They calle morals, whiche teache and gyue preceptes of the actes, offices or due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of morall vertue, that is to saye / they shew howe a man shall do vertuously and after good maners / &amp; what dedes be good and what be not. ¶Iudicials they calle those lawes / whiche giue preceptes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler actes of Iustice betwixte man and man, and preceptes of punishementes and rewardes, as euery man deserueth.</p>
            <p>¶And ceremonials they call / whiche com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mande vs to do certayne outwarde dedes to the worshipping of god / from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the name of ceremonies seme to haue spro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge &amp; come vp. ¶we will speke nothinge here of ceremonials / whiche pertayne nothinge to our purpose, by cause that our matter is no cerimonie. As for the difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersite of the moralles and iudicials / howe thei ought to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, we must nedes declare more plainly. For herebi we haue sene men / &amp; that wel lerned, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times blynded &amp; deceyued, while they thought that this worde, Iustice, whiche is large &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7850:100"/>
conteyneth many kyndes vnderneath it / to be single, and conteyne but one kynde / nor to be taken but one weyes onely, where as in dede there be diuers kyndes of Iustyce. ¶One kynde of iustyce is called Legall, vniuersall or generall / an other is called particular.</p>
            <p>¶Legall or generall Iustice is, whiche ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conteyneth all vertues vndernethe it / and it by it selfe alone, is all hole vertue / that is: euen, as scripture dothe calle a iuste man for a good and a vertuous man, and iustice for goodnes and vertue / as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wyse / iniustice generall is not part or a kynde of vice / but it hathe in it holly all vice and synne that is.</p>
            <p>¶And nowe of particular iustice there be ij. kyndes Distributiue / and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutatiue. ¶Iustice particular distributiue standeth in distribution or partynge of honour / pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, or of money / or of other thinges / whiche maye be distribute amonge them / that be felowes of one citie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalte. For these thinges may be diuided amonge vs equally and vnequally, and so iustely or iniustly. ¶Particuler iustice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutatiue is ordined to mende and correcte suche bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7850:100"/>
as we make one with an other. Therfore when there is ani doubte or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of this poynte of iustice / we go to a iudge, whose office and deutie is to make them euin / whiche be not euin: as when he dothe condemne a man in a summe of money, and so taketh awey the wynnynge from him / whiche had more than ryght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by deceyte and wronge. Than whan the hurte is ones measured and estemed / one parte is called losse / thother wynnyng: and he is called the wynner, that putteth the other to losse / and he the loser, that hath losse.</p>
            <p>¶These thynges we haue spoken for this pourpose / that we shulde vnderstonde, that the Diuines, while they say / that the iudiciall lawes do treate vpon particular actes of Iustyce, betwene man and manne / they wyll and meane / that the Iudicials onely commaunde and teache / by what meanes and punisshementes those thingis maye be correcte, amended / and brought to a iuste and an euen poynte / whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to particuler iustice to order / likewise as morall preceptes belonge to general iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice / to order. And plainly if any man wyll
<pb facs="tcp:7850:101"/>
serche &amp; seche out the exacte meaning &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the iudiciall preceptes, specially that be spoken of / in the olde testament / he shall fynde, that they only be iudiciall, and so ought to be called, whiche be statutes of peynes, or at the leest, those / whiche god in tyme passed dyd answere vnto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whan that he asked hym counsaile of the sutes and controuersies of the Iues. For seynge the begynnynge of wysedome is the feare of our lorde, that same people so stubbourne and intractable, oughte for feare of punysshement to haue ben moued and prouokedde to vertue / and to be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen backe from their wonte and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med synne, leste that they, as men vnreuly and intractable, shulde by theyr synne so greatly haue moued and prouoked god, that they shulde rightfully, and of their deseruing, haue gone downe quicke to hell. Therfore afterwarde that the morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes were gyuen / in the mount called Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na / with incredible feare and horrour or quakynge of the herers: anon after were gyuen them also the iudiciall preceptes, in the whiche god did nothing els, but teache and shewe what vengeaunce oughte to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7850:101"/>
taken vpon them / that do trespas / and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gresse those forsayd morall preceptes. For the iudicials, as Thomas saythe, haue their name of this worde iudgement. And as for this worde, iudgement, betokeneth exercysynge of iustice / whiche is done by reason, applienge the lawes or rules of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice certainly to suche speciall cases, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe only to the ordryng of some certaine people amonge them selfes, &amp; that conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring the state of that people only. for, saith he, seing the moral preceptes be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune to al people, and that many of them, specially of the affirmatiues / do apoint neither time / place, nor maner, how to kepe them: it is ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessarie / that these circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances be specified &amp; determined by some lawe, either of god, or man. And therfore as that general com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement / that god must be honoured and worshypped, is specified and declared outwardely by ceremoniall preceptes: so lyke wise that same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of kepyng iustice amonge men / called the lauful or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall iustice / is determined by the iudiciall preceptes / that is done by a iudge, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge the vniuersall &amp; fyrste rule of generall iustice, to some particuler matter / &amp; to the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:102"/>
priuate state of some one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun welth / and to the profet and benifyt of the same only. ¶By these foresayde thinges we thynke, that it is euident and playne, what lawes ought of rycht to be called iudiciall lawes of god. Truly those whiche haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made &amp; ordined of god him selfe i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy scripture, to the gouernynge, not of all people / but of the Iues to gether amonge them selfe, and that in suche thinges as perteyne to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iustice / and haue no morall reason in them selfes, nor shulde be of no strengthe nor auctoritie, if there were nothynge but reasone to moue thereto: but the cause of their makynge was the state of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and other auctoritie and strength haue they none / but onely by cause they were made. for their auctorite sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth rather in that they be decreed and commaunded, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any reason of general iustice of god / as whiche stonde more in decrees and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties / then by reule or by reason of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune iustice. For there is no commune nor generall iustice in them, but they be onely iuste for them that they were made for. ¶And thus we haue shewed the, what is the iudicial law of god. Now i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:7850:102"/>
or certeintie of the morall &amp; naturall lawe, is great derkenes and doubtfulnes / bicause it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munly vnknowen, nor hath not ben written nor declared clerely and diligently of any diuine (as farre as we haue redde) by what shorte and substanciall waye / we myght fynde out by a sure facion of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, what is the lawe of nature, howe many kyndes there be of it, and also whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be the thynges, that natural reasone shulde shewe and teache vs. These thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges doutles be very darke and ouer rolled and wrapped in moste depe and thicke der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes, by cause that all people on al sydes / in maner by a commune consent and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, folowe vice &amp; synne / and of so longe tyme hath fallen away and cleane forsake their very propre nature, so that partly by cause there be so many vicious customes, partly by cause there be so many vayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, &amp; misordered iugementes, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croked errours / and ignorance / so many frowarde maners / fynally bicause there is so great diuersitie, bothe of mens wyttes / and of mens appetites and disposytions / the holy light of nature is in maner vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extincte and put out, and skante appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

or sheweth it selfe at all any where, and the sharpe or quicke syght and trewe iugement of mans reason, by the whiche he shulde knowe / what is good / what is yll / what is true, and what is false, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of his lyght and rightnesse / and lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the holy goste or spyrite of god / whiche is the ruler and gouernour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone / is vtterly become obscure and darke. Therfore here we muste reste and tarye a lytle whyle / that as farre as our wytte &amp; capacite will serue vs / and this our matter wyll suffre / we may gyue lyght to these darke thinges / and vndo the knottꝭ of the doubtes so as it may be. ¶Ther is in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / all though it be meruailously blinded and darkenedd, a certayne prudence, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune wytte ingendred in hym, grauen in him bi god his maker at his first creation / and this wyt or reason they calle naturall light / &amp; light of vnderstanding / &amp; the light of the visage of god, the ymage of god / the eye of the reasonable mynde, a parceiuinge of good &amp; euil, right &amp; wronge, finally they call it natural reson. ¶Beside this ther be write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the hart of man with the finger of god certain rulis or lawis of general iustice
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7850:103"/>
vertue &amp; honestie, whiche they cal the fyrst principils to liue by, accordinge to vertue / the fyrste rules to do iustly, whiche were to man as exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plars or patrons for to folow / &amp; to shewe him howe he shuld do iustly / the first truthes / sedes of <abbr>vtues</abbr> / sparcles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, imperfecte vnderstondinges / general knowleges, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun sense or perceuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun wisdome / finalli beginninges to al mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral iustice &amp; vertue. Nowe the office of the forsaid natural reson &amp; prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to shew, that we ought to do / or leaue those thingꝭ, what so euer these rules of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune iustice or vertue doth shew vs. And bicause that the same rules of general iustice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine the perfecte &amp; true nature of <abbr>vtue</abbr> / they teache / that those thingis only, whiche in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of al men vniuersally, be good or euil, right or wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, ought to be folowed, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided / euin for the thinges them selfe / and for obteining of euerlastinge blis. For this rule is no other thynge in dede, then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain line leading vs to honestie and vertue, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> disonestie and vice. So that what so euer is done, accordynge to this reule / it muste nedes haue the name of vertue, by the whiche vertue man is called good / 
<pb facs="tcp:7850:104"/>
what so euer is done contrary to this rule, it must haue the name of vice. This reule therfore ioyned with that commune pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or wysedome, we call the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If thou wilte defyne it: it is a general knowlege and iudgement, whiche god dyd graue in the mynde of euery man, to helpe hym / for to fourme and facion his maners and lyuynge. And it nedeth not vs to go farre to seche the profe of these thynges / that we haue spoken / seing that there is no man, but that he hath in him sometime an examynation and remembraunce of hym selfe, and remorse or conscience / that dothe iuge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne hym. and wher so euer these be / there muste nedes also be some lawe / fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose techynge the misdoer maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that he hath swarued, and that he hath not performed tho thynges / whiche the lawe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him. And as for this lawe both Paule hym selfe / and almoste al the diuines and the philosophers / call the lawe of nature, and sey, that it is a certayn commune sentence or iudgement / condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge or allowinge the dedes of men, the whiche god did graue in the herte of man with his fynger. In so moche that vnto vs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7850:104"/>
truly the lawe of nature / to speake of it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, semeth to be no other thynge / but these fyrste reules, and fyrste iudgementes, that man hadde / whiche were made with man / or rather borne with him / &amp; grauen in hym of god. But to speake of it specially and properly / and to shewe howe it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe from all other thynges / these two thinges folowynge, seme to vs to haue ben added to the definition very conueniently and to the purpose, that is to saye / whiche god dyd graue in euery mans mynde / and agayne whiche is fytte and conuenient to forme and facion the maners and lyuynge of men. The fyrste is added bycause we shulde vnderstande, that they onely be na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall lawes, whiche haue ben writen with the fynger of god / or rather borne in the harte of man / stablysshed and confyrmed by agrement of all nations / and not made by the ordinance of men / or by their lawis / their counnynge / opinion, or reasonynge / nor finally by no vsage or custome of men. The seconde is added bicause, that where there be many knowleges and iugementes in vs, all alyke can not be called lawes of nature. But to open this thynge some
<pb facs="tcp:7850:105"/>
what plainly / you shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reason there be .ij. partes, the one is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about study of sciencis / that is called Speculatiue, the other about the ordring of his life / whiche is called Actiue. And as this parte, that longeth to studie / hath his natural principils / and them most true / and so plaine of them selues / that they nede nor can not be proued by none other meanes but onely by them selfe, of whose trewthe and knowelege hangeth the trouthe and knowlege of all other thinges, that be tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in any of the speculatiue sciences: So truly god, that is moste good, moste wisest, &amp; moste of power / after that he had made man vnto his owne image &amp; lykenes, richt and without any crokednes / without any vice / streicht wayes he put in hym his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and holy goste, whiche shuld enflame and kyndle hym to goodnesse and vertue: and dyd by and by graue in his mynde / in the other parte of his reasone / that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the orderynge of his lyfe / certeyne generall knoweleges / and generall reules / vpon vertue, and vpon all thinges / that he shulde do, whiche shulde be as you wolde saye / certeyne principilles, groundes / and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7850:105"/>
chiefe conclusions / and that as it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, moste sure, and moste true reules to iudge by, with richt, and according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vpon all the maners and dedes / that belonge to man. And truely these generall rules of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune iustice or vertue, we calle lawes of nature.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe to shewe you, what is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralle lawe of god: what so euer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of god in holy scripture, and is shewed vnto vs inwardly in our hartes bi these fore sayde generall rules / or that in a good and formal reason folowith of them / or elles that agreeth with them / thoughe it dothe not folowe of them: all these the Diuines calle the lawes morall / whiche lawe they defyne and determyne on this maner.</p>
            <p>¶The morall lawe of god / is the worde or mynde of god / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundynge those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste thynges / and forbyddynge those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeste thynges, whiche the naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone of man lychtened with the lychte of the worde of god, dothe, accordynge to the rules and teachynge of commune iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice or vertue, teache vs to do / or to leaue: and whyche the same naturalle reasone
<pb facs="tcp:7850:106"/>
selfe so lightened, dothe shewe vs / that we be bounde to kepe them / al thoughe they were neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by none other lawe. ¶These thinges well knowen and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, it shalbe easy and playne to knowe the difference betwene the lawes moralles and iudicials. For the lawes morals were graffed and planted in man bi nature / or at the least came of naturall reason / and this natural reason euer and at all times before any lawe was wrytten / or any citie made, god hym selfe dyd plante in man: but the Iudicial lawes were shewed to man after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde / nor stonde not by nature, but by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce, and makynge. Ageyne, morall lawes serue to order, according to the rule or prescript of general iustice, all vertuous dedes / by the which a man is made good. And as for those iudicial lawes / serued not but onely to the orderynge of the Iues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them selfe, and in those thynges onely that belonged to particular Iustice. The lawes morall haue of them selfe a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall cause generally to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions why they were made: but there was no cause, why the iudiciall lawes of god were made / but only the state or condicion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7850:106"/>
of the Iues. The lawes moral be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and vnchaungeable, by the consent of al nacions / and so remayne and endure, by cause they haue their strength and power by the teachynge of naturall reason, so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, although they were neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by none other lawe. These iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lawes be vsed and accustomed onely by ordynaunce.</p>

And this thynge is playne / also by cause that god dothe threten to punysshe greuously and sharpely the breakers of these lawes / that is to saye / that they shall be blotted and cleane wyped out of the myddes of his people / and that they shulde be spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their lande / and they shall dye without chylderne / and yet we wyll not speake one whit of the more greuouse and sorer punisshementes.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, that they shalbe without children / whiche punisshment cometh onely of god.
<pb facs="tcp:7850:109"/>
And thyrdly euerlastynge punysshement, that is the banisshment of the soule out of the company of god for euermore. For as this seyinge / to be put oute of the myddes of his people / meaneth not that we shulde be punysshed by any bodely deathe, but that we shall not be reckened nor compted in the nombre of saintes or of chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And not onely they were thus punys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed / but also their bastardes / that came of suche forbydden mariages, whiche in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe be called <hi>Manzer,</hi> were forbidden the temple. for the Iues call him <hi>Manzer,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is begotten by any of these forsaid fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy couplinges / &amp; reken him as a bastarde / and borne of an harlot.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7850:109"/>
Egyptions did defile their lande, and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with filthines / while that they didde contracte mariage with their brothers wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and that he for that cause dyd greatly abhorre them, and dyd mooste richtefully take vengeaunce vpon them / and punys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them most sharpely / it can be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyse, but it muste nedes folowe / that god hath iudged this thynge to be sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vnhoneste and of them selfe / as they sey / morally euil &amp; nought / and also ageinst the richtnes of naturall lawe and reasone, yea to be abhominable and abhorred. For wherfore elles wolde god haue punysshed so greatly and so greuously the Chananeis and the Egyptions for these synnes and mischeuous dedes? For truely it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer harde, that the transgression of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiall or ceremonialle preceptes, whiche onely were giuen to the children of Israel / dyd at any tyme so greatly displease god, that he wold vtterli distroy them therfore. For seing the iudicial &amp; ceremoniall lawes, haue no power nor stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to binde vs but onely after they were made, truly the same prohibition / breakinge of the whiche god euen amonge the heathens, yea and that
<pb facs="tcp:7850:110"/>
before the lawe was made / dyd so greately abhorre and turne his face from it / can not be iudiciall, but plainly morall, as that is agreinge with the very teaching of nature / and that shulde be written in euery mans herte / al though in some men it be blotted out with wickedde and noughty maners, and vngracious custome. For els what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shulde that be / and what richt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science / to punisshe for doinge that thinge / that is not forbydden by any lawe? For as god is not wonte to punisshe iniustly, and ageinst right, so he is not wont to punisshe but for transgression of some lawe.

And who is he / whiche

            <p>¶Abimelech, a good and a iust man, after the maner of the lawe of Nature / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so greatly lauded and commended of god, dyd he not thinke and iudge / that it coulde nat be possible / that Sara might be bothe syster &amp; also wife to Abraham? the whiche Abraham / whan he went about by al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / that he coulde, to kepe it close / that Sara was his wyfe / he had no stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for him / than for to say / that she was his syster.

well ynoughe / that one and the same selfe man may be bothe a preest and a maryed man, and all at ones. So Aristotell a great philosopher, it is an vnreasonable thinge, saith he, that Socrates did forbyd the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of them that be of one bloud / for none other cause, but that there shulde haue come to moche pleasure of it / and that it maketh no matter, whether he marye his mother, his doughter / or his sister.</p>
            <p>¶And a man maye here of the hystoryes and the Poetes, what infamye and shame is spoken of Macareus, Caunus, Cydon, Pub. Clodius, whom Cicero accused of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest / Marcus Antonius themperour, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus Euergetes, Cesar Caligula, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus the emperour, Ptolomeus Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus / brother to Hypermestra, Cambises kyng of Perse, and all bicause they defiled their sisters, by the not to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plesure &amp; lust of the flesshe. Nor truly it is no smal infami / nor can not be lichtly wasshed out / wherwith these persons, here folowynge, be noted in the histories. Thereus kyng of the Thraciens / bycause he had to do with his wyues syster. Thiestes by cause he had to do with Europa his brothers wyfe, and

also with his doughter Pelopeia / &amp; Aufile<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na / by cause she had a do with her fathers brother, Hypermestra / bycause she did by deceyte obteyne her pleasure of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes brother / and also Flauius Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian / Theodorycke the Frenche kynge. Leucon, and Philippe, brother to Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the king of Hyspayne / those truely bicause they dyd corrupte their brothers dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and these bycause they coupled them selfe with their brothers wyues.</p>
            <p>¶And more ouer the prudence and wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Emperours hathe thought, that the naturall bonde or leage wyll not suffre, that we shulde suspecte or presume any suche heuy cryme betwene these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones / yea &amp; it is prouided for also by the sacre lawes of the same emperours / and openly commaunded, that no man shulde marie his brothers wyfe, or .ij. systers / no not al though the mariage be by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes broken &amp; vndone / but that they shulde al absteyne from incest mariages. And leste this vngracious licence and leude libertie / shulde be strengthed by any damnable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or cloke, it pleased themperours also that al suche rescriptes and writtes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences

not be suffered to make any testament / nor to haue their children / their heires / &amp; some commaunded to be beaten to deathe with roddes in the comen place, and in the sight of al the people / And some that their shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and armes shulde be plucked downe, and their titylles, and feates to be scraped out / And did also decree / that all mencion, remembrance / &amp; memoriall of them / shulde be fordone. ¶But truely it shulde be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and an endles labour, to reken vppe al the incest persones / or the peynes giuen them by the lawe, the infamy, commune hatrede, and sclaunder, whiche they were in / not in one or two cities or nations, but euery where, as far as the worlde is wyde / whiche dyd not refrayne them selfe from this kynde of incest.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore that to marie our sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne / is forbydden by the lawe of nature, appereth playnly by this, that al the most approued doctours of the Churche do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse suche mariages bi necessite. and what shulde it haue ben nede to excuse them / vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of necessite / if it had not ben of it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnleful and euill.</p>
            <p>¶But let vs harken, what Chrysostomus
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7850:115"/>
sath, vvilt thou knowe, saith he, by what meanes it was lefull somtyme / to haue our sisters to our wyues? Howe hadde Cain and Abel, Rasan and Edodam their sisters / and did nat sinne? bycause the scarsenes of men and women / and the necessitie / excused that sinne. Afterwarde when the nombre of men and women was increased, the said euill came into his owne nature / and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be sinne. And at that tyme it was in vse and custome / that one man mycht lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully haue many wyues, but afterwarde the worlde ones increased and multiplied / than this iuell also came to his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and began to be sinne.</p>
            <p>¶Also saint Hierome doth plainly meane bi those wordes, that were rehersed before out of him / that nature doth so greatly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre suche mariage, that it ought not to be named or spoken / leste that the deuoute earys be sore offended with so abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a worde.</p>
            <p>¶Also saynte Augustyne agreeth to the same. For he saith, when mankynde after the fyrste mariage of Adam, whiche was made of duste / and Eue his wyfe, made out his syde, coulde not be increassed without
<pb facs="tcp:7850:116"/>
commynge to gether of man and woman / and there was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nother man nor woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / but that came of them two: the bretherne toke their systers to wyfe. The whyche thing the more older that it is / in so moche that it was done at that tyme onely, whan necessitie droue them to it / so moche the more it was afterwarde damnable / whan that shame drewe them from it. For they had consideration / as it was mooste richt and conuenient, of loue and charite, that men / to whom it was ꝓfitable and honeste to be in vnite and concorde: shulde be knit and ioyned to gether by sondry degrees of kynred, and that one man or woman to an other shulde not haue many degrees, but with sondry and dyuers degrees shulde be departed amonge sondry and diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones: and euery persone to haue but one degree to an other persone: but at that tyme there was not wherwith these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges micht be brought to passe, seynge that of these twayne, Adam and Eue / ther were no men nor women, but all bretherne and systerne. Therfore at that tyme, that thing ought to be done, whan it was possible to be done: that whan there was plentye of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7850:116"/>
women / men shulde take suche wyues, as were not theyr systers. At whyche tyme there was not only no necessitie to do it / but also if it were done / it shulde be a sinne not to be spoken. The which thinge we se was so well obserued, euen among hethens and idolaters and wicked worshippers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and false goddes / after that mankynde was ones increased and multiplied / that al though it was suffred by noughty and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt lawes / to marye with our brothers wyues, yet for all that, the custome amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge them was moche better / wherby thei were brought to this, that they wolde in no wise vse this licence, but vtterly dyd abhorre the dispensacion of the lawe, and so helde againste it, as though it coulde neuer haue ben laufull.</p>
            <p>¶Therfore seynge that these so holy and deuoute men do call those lawes corrupte and noughty, which suffre, that bretherne and systerne shulde marie to gether, and syenge they affirme, that these / whyche worshippe false goddes / did neuer vse su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che mariages, bud did abhorre the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and dispensation of the lawe, fynally / seing that they sey / that it was not leful for
<pb facs="tcp:7850:117"/>
the fyrste men and women / but onely by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of necessitie / truely it is playne, that suche maner of mariages were not of their owne nature laufulle / euen at that tyme / when they were not yet forbidden by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe.</p>
            <p>¶The whiche thynge also in an other place saynt Augustine dothe witnesse: For, saith he, Abraham dyd lyue in the worlde at that time / in the whiche selfe same time it was not laufull for bretherne &amp; systerne to mari to gether, whether they had both one father and mother or diuers.</p>
            <p>¶Also Isichius vpon the Leuitical saith, It was thought tollerable of many, that brothers and systers mycht marye to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / by cause Abraham sayde of Sara / she is my syster by my fathers syde / and not of my mothers syde. The whiche vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly is not, as men thynke the historie is. For Moses rekennynge vp all those / that were begotte of Thare, Abrahams father, maketh no mention at all of Sara. And it so were / that Abraham dydde marye his owne sister: yet it was before he knewe god. Therfore it is synne to couple our selfe to our syster by bonde of maryage.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7850:117"/>
¶wherfore it is clere by this auctour Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, that maryages betwene bretherne and sisterne were not leful before the lawe, that is to saye, in Abrahams tyme / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was afore the lawe of Moses more than. CCCC.xxx. yere.</p>
            <p>¶So Methodius and Berosus, whiche rekenynge vp the causes of Noes floudde, telle bothe one cause. The one of them saythe, it was by cause brotherne shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully had a do with theyr systers. The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bycause Cains chylderne beganne to abuse theyr brothers wyues by abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fornicacion.</p>
            <p>¶But we nede not to tarye in rehersynge vppe the auctours, whiche make to our pourpose in this behalfe. Truely if they, whiche were wrapped in so greatte darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / that they dydde not perceyue / that they shulde worshyppe one god, dydde yet perceyue / that they shulde not marie theyr systers / but dydde naturally abhorre suche maryage / euer more hated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them / as cursed, and inceste, and not onely they / but also the most holy and moost true interpreters of the holye scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do wytnesse the selfe same thynge to

vs in their wrytingꝭ, it is as clere as can be / that these prohibitions were brought in by the lawe of nature, and that the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reasone, moued by the lawe and the worde of god, dothe commaunde and teache vs, that suche coniunction muste be vtterly abhorred / as a wicked sinne ageynst nature.</p>
            <p>¶If any man here will saye, be it, that we graunte, that these thinges be true / as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the mariages of bretherne and sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne, yet it is far a nother maner of reke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge / as touchinge our brothers wyues. Let hym vnderstande / that he is greatly blynded and deceyued. For if it be against the lawe of nature, that any man shulde mary his owne naturall syster, bicause it is not lefull by the lawe of nature to discouer her foulenes, &amp; he, whiche marieth his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers wyfe / discouereth the foulenes of his brother / he also shal breke the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / which coupleth vnto him bi mariage his brothers wife. ¶Although we haue made it playne and euident inough before, yet we shall put to these .ij. reasones, that folowe, whiche shall proue the same as openly as can be, that a man can not mary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7850:118"/>
his brothers wyfe. Fyrste / bicause affinitie doth as well let mariage / as dothe consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinite. Seconde, by cause he that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, dothe shame &amp; dishonestie to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the meanes. Of the firste if any man do doubte / he maye wel vnderstande / that this thynge is very trewe, and it were but by this reason only, that not all onely by the lawe of god, so manye persones be excluded from maryage in the lyne of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie / as be excluded and forbyd in the lyne of consanguinitie: but that also the lawe of the churche is compelled to sette the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of mariage in the lynes bothe of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and consanguinitie / in a lyke distaunce or degre. And this thinge is playne by the auctoritie not onely of Iuly and Gregory Popes / and also of saynt Augustyne, and Isodore, whose sayenges be receyued and approued in the lawe of the churche, but also of Abbate / and of all those that write vpon the chapter <hi>PITATIVM,</hi> And the chapter <hi>CVM AD MONASTERIVM DE STA. MONA.</hi> And the Chapiter <hi>NON DEBET. DE CONSANG. ET AFFIN.</hi> That if there hadde not ben as great cause, why they / that be of affinite
<pb facs="tcp:7850:119"/>
shuld haue ben as wel forbidden to mary, as they that be of consanguinite, but there hadde ben a greatter cause, why they that be of consanguinite shulde be forbidden / then they that be of affinite / truly so wise lawe makers wolde haue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones of consanguinite, vnto a streiter bond of mariage, then persons that be onely of affinite / and not bothe vtterly of lyke and in one degre. But nowe / seynge one selfe same prohibicion of the lawe of god dothe conteyne all persons / aswell of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as of affinite in the fyrste degre, and of the fyrst kynde / and that bothe by the lawe of god / and the lawe Canon / we ought to absteyne aswell from these persons / that be of our wyues bloudde, as from them that be of our owne bloudde / by cause that man &amp; wife be bothe one flesshe &amp; bloud / as witnesseth this sayinge of god: They shal be .ij. in one flesshe: And bycause that the kynred of bothe sydes / that is to say, of the mans side / and the womans side / ought to be compted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune to them bothe, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shulde take our brothers wyfe euen as our owne natural sister, as touching the ꝓhibition of mariage / like as our doughter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7850:119"/>
in law ought to be taken of vs, euen as our owne doughter, as saint Augustine sayth. ¶And that the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de also is very true / it is very euident &amp; playne. For he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his broders wife / taketh his fathers flesshe &amp; bloudde to mariage. The whiche thing plainly is ageynst the law of nature. For seinge the husbande &amp; the wife be one flesshe &amp; bloud: truely he / that taketh his brothers wife, takethe also the flesshe and bloud of his brother / &amp; as for our brother is the flessh &amp; bloud of our fader &amp; moder, &amp; that more nerer vnto them, than any of both theyr sisters / bicause he is their owne son. Therfore if it be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lawe of god / &amp; also by the lawe of nature to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie our fathers sister, or our mothers sister / or els the wyfe of our fathers brother / or mothers brother / whose wyues be but of affinite to vs, &amp; that onely in the seconde de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gre: truly moche more it shuld be ageynst nature, to mary our brothers widow. For the nerer that they come to the stocke, &amp; to be one flesshe &amp; bloud, the more thei ought to be forbid. But our brother is more nerer vnto our fader, as it is aboue sayd, then is either of our vncles or auntes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7850:120"/>¶And here be proues inough / by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we haue shewed, as it becommed vs, that these Leuiticall prohibitions / that we shulde not marye our brothers wyfe. &amp;c. come of naturall reason.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe there remaineth, to shewe / how the same be toucht vs by the sayde natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reasone / accordynge to the reules and teachynge of generall iustice or vertue, for to fourme and ordre the maners of men. And this we dyd proue partly before / and nowe we shall speake of this same matter more largely. For the reule of commune Iustice or vertue dothe teche vs tho thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only, whiche in the maners of all men vniuersally be good / euyll, rychte, croked, iuste, vniuste / and suche as ought to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or auoyded / euen of them selfe and for the obteynynge of euerlastynge blysse. And truly there is no man, but sayth, that tho thinges / whiche be forbyd in the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical lawes / be such thinges. For fyrst they perteine and serue to facion and order men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes maners. For here truely we calle the <hi>MANERS</hi> of men, the outwarde dedes of men, and also the inwarde affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and disposytions of the mynde / what so euer
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7850:120"/>
they be, that come of morall vertue / the whiche who so euer dothe kepe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme / it shall be sayd / that he lyueth well / and doth well / and he shalbe called verely and truly a good man. Nowe as for these Leuyticall lawes / do not onely belonge to chastite / but also to <hi>PIETIE,</hi> by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, as Cicero defineth / we be taught to do our duetie and dyligente honoure and seruice to our countrey, to our parentes / and to them of our bloudde / and vtterly to all men, all that ryght and reasone wyll we shall do. This thynge the fyrste lawe of maryage declarethe playnely inoughe, whiche is this, <hi>THIS BONE</hi> nowe is of my bones / and this flesshe and bloudde of my flesshe and bloudde: For the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynge a man shall leaue his father and his mother / and shall stycke to his wyfe. The whiche sayenge all be it other men drawe it to the dwellynge to gether of man and wyfe, and other to the loue that ought to be betwene them / to vs it semeth / that these two thinges were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly commaunded vs in this lawe. Firste that the housbande shuld euermore / with out any departynge, sticke to his wyfe,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:121"/>
Seconde, that no sonne shulde mary with his mother, nor no doughter with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But for this thinge, that is to saye, bicause the strength and power of mariage is suche, that it gleweth faste to gether with streite and moste holy bonde the man and the woman, and dothe make of them / that be .ij. seuerall and distincte persons / one body and one flesshe? therfore shall man leaue his father &amp; his mother, &amp; shall sticke to his wife / that is to saye / man shal absteyne from the mariages of father and mother / nor shall not disclose their foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor shame them, agaynste the holines and chastite of maryage, and agaynst na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall honeste and shamefacidnesse, and against reuerence, whiche by nature is due vnto them. For seynge that those persons be ioyned moste nye vnto vs / longe syns / by the bonde of bloudde and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinite / to whome also nature teacheth vs, that we shulde owe other loue / shamfacydnes, and reuerence / be syde the loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of mariage, truly if they shulde ioyne them selfe to vs by maryage / bothe the cause / why maryage was ordined / shulde lacke the chiefeste and beste ende / nor shuld
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7850:121"/>
not take effecte, and shamefacydnes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and reuerence naturall shulde be vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and broken, contrary to all comelynes and goodly behauour.</p>
            <p>¶And that this was the very reasone, and intente of the Leuiticall prohibitions / this thynge playnly declareth. For god / did put to the cause of the forbyddyngis after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / which is this. For it is the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or shame of the father, &amp; it is the foule<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes &amp; shame of the brother / &amp; so forthe: so that if one wolde aske, why it is not lauful for vs to mary our stepmother, to discouer her foulnesse / there it is answered, For her foulenes is the fathers foulenes, whiche is one body and one flesshe with the father. And if a man wolde demaunde agayne / why it is not laufull to discouer the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy father, the answere is by cause he is nieste of bloud to the, to whome thou must before al other do honour &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to do him sham &amp; villany / it is an vnlouinge and not to be spoken dede. And plainly so did Sem &amp; Iaphet iudge / which tought by the prescriptes of nature / before any lawe was written / couered them selfe with a cloke, &amp; going backewarde did hide
<pb facs="tcp:7850:122"/>
and couer their fathers priuities / by cause they wold not se their faders priuie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. And so doing they had their fathers blessynge, and Cam hadde his curse. On this maner ought tho prohibitions, that we shuld not marie our brothers wyfe. &amp;c. to be weyed and examined. For seynge our brothers wyfe is one flesshe and bloudde with her husbande, and he lykewyse one flesshe and bloudde with his brother, it fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth well / that the brother and the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wyfe, be not .ij. but one flesshe and bloud, and so consequently, that they can not be ioyned to gether by mariage, seinge that it is necessary before they mary, that they be diuers flesshe and bloudde, and so by maryage / be no longer .ij. bodyes / but be made one fleshe and bloud.</p>
            <p>¶For matrimonie is forbydden betwene persones of consanguinite and affinite / by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that betwene these persones there is a certayne naturall amitie and frendship / made by the institution of nature, whiche dothe not nede the helpe of maryage to strength it, but those persones ought to be coupled to straungers and nothynge of bloudde to them / to increasse amitie / loue / 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7850:122"/>
and charitie, whiche is increassed by mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge of straungers to gether. By cause that these persones, whiche before were not bounde to gether one to the other, by any specyall bonde, shulde nowe be made frendes and louers by the richtes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of maryage / in the whyche frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe and loue standeth the faste knyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge to gether of hartis and myndes / and vnitie of wylles. And likewise as there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no maryage betwene them that be of consanguinitie and affinitie to make loue and charite, and to be of one wyll &amp; minde / no more there nedethe no maryage for to make them of one flesshe and bloudde. But those persons must be coupled by ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage to them, that be straungers and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng of their bloud to make mo persones of one flesshe and one bloud, that by this meane they / whiche before were not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de one to an other naturally by any bonde of carnall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction, now by mariage shuld be made one flesshe and one bloud / by the whiche mariage diuerse persons be ioyned to gether and made one body. For by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall copulation the man and the woman be made one body, and by maryage they,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:124"/>
the whiche were twaine before, be nowe no more tweyne but one flesshe and bloudde. The whiche reason also our sauiour Christ in his godspell / doth not abrogate nor take a way / but renueth it / sayenge: Therfore now they be no more tweyn / but one flesshe and bloudde. By the whiche wordes it is euidente and playne inough, that the lawe in the boke of Genesis / wherin it is sayde, <hi>THAT</hi> a man shuld leaue his father and mother and sticke to his wyfe, dothe not seme to be put as a rule of graunte and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to mary in all other degrees / onely the father and mother except, but that it shulde rather teache vs / that the vnite of flesshe and bloudde / betwene man and wife ought to be indissoluble and neuer to be broken. And that the same vnite of flesshe and bloudde / seynge that it is amonge the parentes and the children, betwene whom also is naturally vnite of persons, and that they be naturally as it were one selfe same persone, it dothe let mariage betwene them specially and generally be twene all other, that be forbydden.</p>
            <p>¶And this forbyddynge of maryage / by the meanes of <hi>VNITIE</hi> of the flesshe and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7850:124"/>
bloudde / if we wyll knowe howe farre it extendith / we must loke for it in the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawe. For all though / as Dunse wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tethe, euen after the multiplication or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasse of mankynde, if they had perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and abydden in their innocencie and goodnesse / god wolde haue forbydden o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees besyde the fyrste, (For truely there is nothynge almoste so necessarye to men / as to knowe the natural lawes of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rieng) yet for al that god hath in no place, in the olde Testament / expressed those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees so playnely / and shewed howe farre their bondes do exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and what persons nature abhorreth to be maryed to gether, as he hath done in the Leuiticall.</p>
            <p>¶And nowe to retourne backe to our pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose / where as we lefte. Truely if it be a poynt of chastite, and a poynt of naturall loue, not to discouer the dishonestie of thy brothers wife, and if these Leuitical lawes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the to do them this duetie, this honour / and this reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and to restreyne thy luste and desyre of incest pleasure, from them / and to absteyne and kepe backe thy handes from so fylthye and abhominable a dede: Fynally if the same prohibitions
<pb facs="tcp:7850:123"/>
be greatly profytable to increasse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large loue and charitie betwene christian men, which loue and charite by this thing chiefly doth increasse, if there be made fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deshipe amonge them, whiche be not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled before by none other naturall bonde of loue: playnely we muste nedes confesse and graunte / that those Leuitical lawes be fit and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to forme and ordre mens maners / and that they do agre with the teachinge of commune Iustice, or honestie and vertue / and that they belonge to the dedes and duties of the morall vertues.

All these wordes truly, sayth Ireneus, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye nor anull these thynges, that were writen before in the olde law, as they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che folowe Marcion saye / but fulfyll and make them perfecte / as Christe hym selfe sayth, Excepte your iustenes and goodnes passe the iustyce and vertue of the scribes and Phariseis / you shal not haue the king dome of heuen. And wherin, sayth Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, shuld we passe and excelle the Scribes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7850:128"/>
and the Phariseis? Firste truely that we shulde beleue, not onely in the father / but also in his sonne, whiche is nowe manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen amonge vs. Moreouer that we shulde not onely speake well / and after the lernynge of Christe, but also do accordyng to the same, which the scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis dyd not: whiche somtyme spake well / and did not therafter. Last of all, that we must absteine, not onely from yll dedes, but also from the thoughtes, wylles / &amp; desires of all euyll. And as for these thynges he taught not as contrary to the law, but put them vnto it to fulfyll and make it vp / and to roote in vs the iustifications and perfect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the lawe. For where as Christe did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande vs to abstein / not only from those thynges / that were forbydden by the olde law, but also from the noughty lustes / de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires / and wyll of the same: this thynge is not contrari to the lawe / as we said before / nor breketh not the lawe / but fulfilleth and increasseth the lawe.</p>
            <p>¶Therfore by cause all the naturall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes be commune to vs and to them / and we be as well bounde vnto them / as they were amonge them, trewly they had their
<pb facs="tcp:7850:129"/>
beginning &amp; first springynge vp / in vs they toke their ful perfectnes. For truly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selfe vnto god, to folow his worde and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and aboue all thynges to loue him / and to absteyne from all euyll doinge / and all other lyke thinges, whiche be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune both to them and to vs / shewe and witnesse, that both they and we haue one selfe same god, whiche as he did firste begin such lawes, so he did neuer after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null them / but dyd fulfyll and make them more perfect / and did increase, and inlarge them amonge vs christians and faithfuls. ¶And to this purpose writeth saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustyne also. Certeynly, saith he, no man shulde doubte / but that the olde lawe of god / whiche hath toucht vs suche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as belonge to vertue and to good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is as necessarye for vs nowe to leade and instructe our lyfe withall / as it was at that tyme to the people of the Iues. For who wyll say, that that commandement, whiche is written in the olde lawe: That who so euer hath founde any thynge / he muste restore it vnto hym / whiche hath loste it, and many other lyke, by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we lerne to lyue louyngely and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7850:129"/>
do not belonge vnto vs, that be chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men, and specially the .x. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, whiche are conteyned in the two tables of stone. For who is so wycked / to say, that he ne wyll kepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the olde lawe, bycause he is a christian man / and therfore is not vnder the lawe, but fre and vnder grace?</p>
            <p>¶To the whiche thynge agreeth Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marulus Euangelistarius, seyenge, That what so euer is in the lawe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the instruction and ordrynge of our lyfe and of our maners, ought as well to be obserued amonge vs, that be nowe newe men in Christe, as it was amonge the Iues and the olde men, that were in tyme passed, and that we ought to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with the godspel / and to take it as a parte of the godspell / and that of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preceptes, both of the newe testament and the olde / we oughte to saye as Dauid sayth: The wordes of god be tried &amp; pure wordes.</p>
            <p>¶Nor truely it is not with out maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great reason, why that moral precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the olde law shulde styll yet endure, &amp; shuld bynde christian men to kepe them.
<pb facs="tcp:7850:130"/>
¶For as saint Thomas saith, Euery man / as sone as he is lyghtened by the lawe of god / hath a certayne naturall motion or inclination planted in hym, for this pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose / that he may do accordinge to vertue. for euery thinge naturally is inclined to do that worke / whiche is agreable with the propre nature of it: as fyre to heate. Now mans soule / folowinge reason / is the chiefe part of the nature of man / which lichtened with the worde of god, teacheth, that we shuld do tho thinges onely / which of their owne selues be good &amp; vertuos. For truly euery mans owne reasone, lichtned by the word of god, doth naturally teache hym / that he shuld liue vertuosly and honestly: And playnly / seynge that all morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes in the olde testament do nothynge, but commande vertuos dedes / by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the soule of man may ordre it selfe wel, as it ought to do, not onely to god, but to his neihgbour alhso: terfore Christ did not adnulle any of these preceptes by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge. For euen as the grace and fauour of god / dothe presuppose our nature, yea maketh it full &amp; perfet / so truly the godspel did neuer breke and adnulle the naturall
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7850:130"/>
lawes / but did stablisshe and make them perfecte / and brocht them agayne to their fyrste perfectnesse of nature, in so moche that what so euer morall preceptes of the olde lawe, do agree with the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whiche Paule saith, is written in our hertes, do euermore endure and remayne in their power and auctoritie, nor no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man is fre and lose from them, but all persons / as concerninge the playne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stondynge of them, of necessite be subiecte and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto them / although they had neuer be ordined by no mans lawe. For all the lawes of the olde testament / whiche so euer agree with the lawe of Nature and with vertue, nor do not onely withdrawe the hande and body / but also the mynde and will of man / why shulde they not be receyued amonge christian men?</p>
            <p>¶For god forbid / that any christian man shulde contracte suche mariages / whiche, as saynte Augustyne writeth before / euen the cruell hethens and barbarous people, without all ciuilite hath for very honesties sake, euermore abhorred. The whiche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull mariage Christe dyd so greately ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, that he semed rather to go aboute
<pb facs="tcp:7850:131"/>
to drawe backe the bondes of mariages to the olde and fyrste state of nature whan it was create. And for this cause he brought mariage home agayne to his firste begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge / that one man shulde haue but one wyfe, and that he shuld be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to kepe her euermore / and neuer to put her away: For bycause, saith Christe, it was so at the begynnyng. and he wolde haue made and brought to passe, if the present myserable wretched state of our exile and banysshing wolde haue suffred it, that there shulde haue ben no foulenes nor fylthynes in the workes of mariage, and that it shulde be euen so / as saint Augustine sayth, it was in the begynninge of the worlde / <hi>THAT</hi> all our mariages shuld be so clene / that they micht wel become them, that shulde lyue in the felicite of Paradise / bothe hauynge childerne, that they shulde loue / and no fylthy pleasure / that they shulde be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore wherto shulde Christe haue antiquate and annulled the Leuitical lawes / the whiche streicht after he wolde inspire in to the fathers of his fyrste and primitiue churche / and wolde commaunde
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7850:131"/>
them to make those lawes of newe? wolde Christe haue exempte vs from the lawe of god / and that in tho thinges / whiche haue so euident and playne token of vertue in them, vnto the whiche he wolde streichte after that we shulde be bounde / by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Churche?</p>
            <p>¶And finally / why dydde the sacre holye churche forbid vs to do those thinges, but bicause it iudged them / to be maruaylous foule / vnhoneste, and vncleane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But howe or wherby may that / that is cleane or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste be discerned and knowen a sonder fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, that is foule and vnhonest / but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandmentes of god? For if the churche hadde forbydden suche maryages / and had iudged them foule and vncleane, for none other thinge / but by cause they were forbydden in the olde testament vnder the name of ceremonies / as diuersyte of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / of dayes / and of places / and suche like thynges / as be forbydden in the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamente, it mycht be lefull to make an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection / and to lay agaynst the church that thing, whiche is said bi god vnto Peter in the actes of the apostols / whiche wold not eate of al maner of meates, but did forbere
<pb facs="tcp:7850:132"/>
certayne meates / that were forbydden in the olde lawe / vnto whom god saith thus: That thynge, whiche god hath puryfied and made cleane / call not thou it foule or vncleane.</p>
            <p>¶But seinge that the ende, the intent / the pythe / the strengthe, the reasone of these Leuiticall prohibitions do yet remayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge christian men / &amp; be written in heuen / &amp; euermore indure: truly a christian man / whiche doth take vpon him more perfecte faith, hope, &amp; charitie / than the Iue / muste be moued to kepe these forbiddynges only by his feith / &amp; by the holy goste, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iues by the letter &amp; law. For god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd / that the holy bonde of loue &amp; charite betwene kinsfolke / that the faste knotte of mariage whiche in no wise oucht to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done / &amp; the working of the lyuely trewth and of reasone / whiche naturally moue a man to goodnesse, shulde not be iudged as holy, as cleane / as vnfilthy, as pure, as chaste, and as well to be obserued amonge christian men / as they were in tyme passed amonge the heathens / and the Iues. And god forbydde / that christian men shulde chaunge the libertie of the spirite, in to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7850:132"/>
fylthines of the body. for if they that flee the foule pleasures of the worlde / for the knowlege of our sauiour Iesus Christe / be agayne intangled and ouercome with the same / they be in worse case nowe than they were before at the begynnyng. For it were better for them neuer to haue knowen the wey of iustice and vertue / then after that they knowe it, to tourne away ageyn from that thynge / that was geuen to them by a great and a holy commaundement. ¶Certes if Noes sonne did not escape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punisshed, for discoueringe the foulenes of his father, nor the Egiptions / nor the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naneis, for the discoueringe of their owne kynsfolke / and of them that were nigh of their bloudde / for the whiche dede god, by his godly iudgement and sentence / dydde spue them out of their lande, whiche were heathens: Howe shall a christian man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the displeasure and vengeaunce of god, if he committe the same thinges, that they were punisshed for. For knowe you this well / and take good hede of it, that no fornicator, nor lecher, nor fylthy persone / shall haue herytage in the kyngedome of Christe and god.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7850:133"/>¶Nor truely it nedeth not, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries shuld dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of vs / why Christ did not make expresse mention of the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall lawes in the godspell, if he wolde haue had them liued and indured amonge vs still after the Synagoge or olde lawe was deed. For truly he did not make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse mention of them, by cause he hadde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded longe before, that they shuld euer to come continue / and neuer fayle / se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that he dothe abhorre suche fylthy mariages / and curseth them not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Iues, but also amonge the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thins / meaninge / that he will moche more abhorre them, if they be a monge chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styan men.</p>
            <p>¶And bycause he did commaunde playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the gospell / that the iustice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vs, that be christians / shulde passe the iustice of the Scribes and the Phary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis / where in a generall rule that we / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be called christian men, shulde not be wors in any thing then the carnall people, but that we shulde be better then they in all poyntes.</p>
            <p>¶Nor we must not thinke / that no thinge is forbid bi the law of god / but that / which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7850:133"/>
is expresli and plainly set out in the gospel. For the apostols write and publisshe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynges, whiche they toke of the very mouth of Christe / and yet they be not writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten in the boke of the newe testament. ¶And the catholike and vniuersal church hath approued many thynges for goddes lawes / of the which there is neuer a worde spoken in the newe testament, as is this / That confession in no case ought not to be disclosed, and suche other thynges. For so doth Dunse also proue / that the secrete confession in the eare is of the lawe of god, not bi cause it is written in the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / but by cause it can not be shewed / whan it was fyrste begonne. Playnly it is heresye to affirme, that there is nothynge goddes lawe, but that, whiche a man may poynte vnto with his fynger in the newe testament. For by this meanes the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes shulde be taken a wey, &amp; shulde be receyued onely by the constitution of man. Nor truly there is no mention made in the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the forbidding of mariage betwene the father in law and the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in lawe, whiche thynge neuerthelesse to be forbidden by the lawe of god / saynt
<pb facs="tcp:7850:134"/>
Hierome doth testifye.</p>
            <p>¶And also if our aduersaries wyll stycke and holde them to this, than let vs occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie vsurye / and lette vs gyue money by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge / and require it ageyn with vsury, lette vs also haue many wyues / and lette vs couple our selfe with al maner of bestes / nor lette vs not paye the tythes of all our frutes to the prestes / nor let vs not confesse our synnes to them / nor lette vs not go to them / whan so euer there is any doubte be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene bloudde and bloudde / betwene lepri and no lepri. For there is none of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely commaunded or forbydden in the godspel, or in the writinge of the apostols / but for to bynde vs to the keping of them, be cyted and alledged the wrytynges of the Prophettes.</p>
            <p>¶But this thynge dyd lychtly deceyue them / that be ageynst the libertie and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome / whiche we haue by the gospell, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not knowe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the newe testament and the olde / the gospell and the lawe, Christe and Moses: whiche if they had knowen very wel, they shulde not haue ben so foule deceyued and blynded in this matter. And contrary by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7850:134"/>
they did not discusse them, and seke them out to the vttermoste / nor did ponder and way them so diligently as they shulde haue don / we se / that by this meanes they were brought in to this errour / that they thought / that euery thinge, whiche is not expresly forbidden in the newe testament, is laufull for christian men to do. By the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che errour, we do thinke / that the same man of Corynthe was deceyued / whiche maryed his stepmother. For seynge that he harde the lybertie of the godspell / by the whiche we were made free frome the lawe of Moses / greately commended and preysed of the apostols / and knewe that it was forbydden by no lawe of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell / to marye whome so euer he wolde, streychte he, abusynge the sayde libertie, dydde agaynste the Leuiticall lawe / ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie his fathers wyfe. But he was mooste rychtfully condemned of Paule / not only bycause he had broken Moses lawe / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che forbiddeth it, but bicause he was diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the honestie of nature / whiche na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall honestie the godspell hath euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. and it shuld be suche a pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple of a mooste leude libertie amonge
<pb facs="tcp:7850:135"/>
christian men / as euen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the hethins / bycause of the reuerence of nature, coulde in no wise be suffred to be don.</p>
            <p>¶<hi>AND TRVELY HITHERTO,</hi> most gentyll reder, we haue serched out the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secresy of the scripture of god, deuoutly and reuerently, for this intent onely, with peyn and labour to seke out and to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the truthe, and suche argumentes and reasons / as semed after our iudgement to make most for this matter, we haue soucht them oute of the definition and very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and nature of those thinges, that we treate vpon, wherby thou mayst playnly perceiue / moste gentil reder / that these Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall lawes / whiche forbydde / that we shulde marie our brothers wyfe / be the lawes of god.

And this is no doubte / seing that they haue in them naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone / fetched from the begynnynge of the worlde, euen out of the secrete ordinaunces of nature. For we haue proued by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorite of god / or of holy scripture, that as it was ordyned of the moost beste mynde,

which is god / euen so it was ordined vpon the moost beste reason and consyderation: that is / onely for a zele of chastite / of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall shamfacidnes / and other vertues / that no man shulde marye his brothers wyfe. we haue shewed howe agaynste nature / howe fylthy and abhominable it is / and vtterly vnmete for a christian man / to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte mariages in that degree. we haue shewed howe greatly contrary it is to the ordre of loue / and of the reuerence, that shulde be betwene kynsfolke / and what a confusion it shulde cause of names of kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rede, &amp; how moche it is ageyn the increase of loue &amp; charitie: we haue shewed / that holy &amp; deuoute christian eares / do abhorre it / and can not suffre to here it spoken: we haue shewed / that besyde the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisshmentes and vengeaunce, that god ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on men in this lyfe, that also the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisshement of the euerlastinge fyre of helle abydeth them / whiche be not afrayde to commit this syn. By the whiche reasons without doubte it is euident and playne, that these Leuiticall prohibitions be the lawes of god / and morall / bicause they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶Also saint Ambrose maketh to this pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose, for he, expouninge, in the .iij. of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis / the answere of Eue, sayth thus. The proces of all this present lesson teachethe vs / that we oughte nother to take awaye any thynge from the commaundementes of god, nor yet to putte more vnto them. For if saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue this iudgement of his owne writynges, saynge thus, <hi>IF</hi> any man shall adde vnto them / god shall cast vnto hym those plages and vengeances, whiche be wrytten in his boke of reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and who so euer shall take away any thinge from the wordes of this prophecy / god shal wype his parte cleane out of the boke of lyfe: Howe moche more muste we be ware, that we take away nothinge from the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes of god / nor put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge to them?</p>
            <p>¶Also saynte Barnarde maketh for this pourpose. I vnderstonde, saithe he, that thinge to be so necessarie / that it can not be broken, not that, whiche is ordined by

manne / but by god / and can not be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in any case / excepte it be by god / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che made it.</p>
            <p>¶And a litell after / in the same boke / the said saint Barnard saith, That he, whiche is of lesse power, can not dispense in those thinges / whiche be ordyned by hym / that is of greatter power.</p>
            <p>¶And also pope Fabian maketh for this pourpose. He truely, saith Fabian, that dredeth god, doth not consent in any wise / to do any thinge contrary to the godspell, contrary to the apostols / contrarye to the Prophettes, or contrary to the ordynaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holye fathers.</p>
            <p>¶Also in this thynge agreeth Isodore, and saythe: If that he, whiche hath rule, do him selfe, or commaunde any other to do / any thynge / that is forbydden of god / orels if he do leaue vndone, or bid any man leaue vndone that, whiche god hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: the sayenge of the holye apostoll saynt Paule muste be rehersed vnto hym, <hi>YEA</hi> if we our own selfe / saith sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Paule / or an angell of heuen do teache you any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue toucht / cursed be he: And if any man do forbid you that, which

shulde do ageynst god / obeieng the iudge / whan he commandeth: moche more then shulde he do ageynst god, folowyng onely the dispensation and licence of the iudge. ¶Saint Thomas also is of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. for he in many places of his werkes, which partli we haue afore rehersed, doth plainly shewe / that the prohibition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage / as concernynge degres of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and affinite / whiche be expressed in the olde lawe, do belonge to the naturall and morall preceptes. And that the pope can in no case dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with those thinges / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che belonge to the natural law / and to the lawe of god.</p>
            <p>¶with saint Thomas agreeth Alexander de Hales, Dunse, Richarde de Media vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Durandus, Albertus magnus, Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Maro, Gerson, Gabriell Biel, Herue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Iacob Almain, Barnardus de Trilla, Antoninus Florentinus / and many other beside these / whiche playnely do saye, and holde stiffely / that it can not be proued by no good richt / that the pope can in ani case dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with any of those prohibicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / that be made by the lawe of god and by the lawe of nature. For they saye, that it is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7850:141"/>
not resonable, that they / whiche be of lyke power / shulde haue power one ouer tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shuld be moche ageinst reason / that the inferior shulde lose or dispense with that the superior hath bounde: or bynde men to that thinge, whiche the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hath not bounde men vnto. ¶<hi>FVRTHERMORE</hi> besyde these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of natural honestie / shame, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence / whiche we haue shewed afore, an other cause of this Leuiticall prohibicion, That a man shuld not marie his brothers wife / is the wyl of god, whiche is the very and trewe Iustice. For god wyll not this thinge or any other, bycause it is iuste and richt, but therfore it is iuste and richt / by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause god wylleth it / as saynte Augustyne saith. Therfore seyng that from this dede, nother the ylnes of it can be taken awaye / nor any goodnes put vnto it by any other maner of meanes / but that the mynde and wyll of the lawemaker must be chaunged: truely there can none dispense with suche lawe / but he that shalbe able to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge also the wyl and minde of the lawemaker. For the dyspensation causeth, that he, with whom we dispense / is not bounde to that
<pb facs="tcp:7850:142"/>
thinge / to the whiche before it apered / that he was bounde by the wordes of the law. But no pope of Rome can change the wyl of god. For he / seinge he is Christis vicar, oucht to folowe Christe / &amp; to do as Christe did, and not to contrarie him in any thing, nor in any thynge to swarue from his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge: and Christe nother did nothing, nor sayde nothinge / but onely that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his father / nor brake nothing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whiche his father commanded and wolde haue done. And seinge that the pope hath taken of Christe / shepe and lambes to fede with the lernynge of the churche, or of the gospell, and is onely made a minister and Almoysnar or dispenser by Christe of the sacramentes / which be ordined of god and Christe, Finally seynge our lorde did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde hym to teache all men to kepe all maner of thynges, what so euer he hadde commaunded them: god forbyd, that the Pope of Rome shulde thynke it lefull for hym to chaunge the wyll of god, and that he hadde power to couple those persones to gether by mariage, whom the law of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture &amp; of Moses / wherof god him selfe is the auctor, hath forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be coupled to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7850:142"/>
gether. For if he shulde do it, plainly he shulde not be that blessed and faythefull almosynar and dispenser of the worde of god, gyuynge in tyme measure of corne / by the whiche mens spirites shulde be refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and their soules shulde lyue, but he shulde rather be a wretched vnhappy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and a spender, that shall be cast out in to extreme darkenes / and shulde be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious felowe, whiche sowed amonge the good corne / that is to say / i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scripture of god plenty of Cockel or Darnel / and suche other wedes / whereby the soules shulde waxe lene and perisshe for euer. For Christ him selfe saith, <hi>HE,</hi> that hath my COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / and kepeth them, that is he, that LOueth me: and he that LOuith me not / doth not kepe my commandementes. ¶Vpon the which sayenge Cyril writeth thus. These thinges, saith he, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge meruci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lously well to gether / so that the tone must nedes folowe of the tother. For if to kepe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of god, is to loue god, it must nedes be / that to breke the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tꝭ of god / is to hate god. and seing that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can loue god, and breke the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of god: howe then by any maner
<pb facs="tcp:7850:143"/>
of iuste and laufull cause maye the Pope gyue lycence, that a man shulde discouer the foulenesse of his brother / the whiche dede nature and the lawes of god do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre? except he wyl runne into that moost rychtefull condemnation / whiche Paule threteneth them / whiche do euyl thynges / that there may come some good of them. ¶Truely pope Zosimus saythe / That the auctorite of this seate of Rome can change nothynge ageynste the decrees of the holy fathers.</p>
            <p>¶Also pope Leo writeth to Anatholius and saith, that the ordynaunce of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean counsaile coulde in no case be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed withall at any tyme.</p>
            <p>¶And so Isodor, in the boke of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, citeth / that pope Damase sayth: Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that suche persones may (and that not without reason, sayth he) be thought to blaspheme and speake vnreuerently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst the holy gost / whiche constreined by no necessite / but of their owne plesure / and of a frowardenes / do take vpon them any thinge, that is ageynst the holy canons, or els consent willyngly to other / that wyl do any suche thynge: Therfore the rule of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7850:143"/>
holy canons / whiche be consecrate by the spirite of god / and by the reuerence and allowyng of al the worlde / we oucht faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to knowe, and we must handle them diligentely, lest that we do breake by any meanes (whiche god forbyd) the statutes and decrees of the holy fathers, without ineuitable necessitie.</p>
            <p>¶And the selfe same Pope Damas wold not take vpon him to determine the cause of Bonosius the bishoppe, by cause that the Synod of Capua had committed it be fore to be examined of other iudges, playn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly shewynge, that it was not his parte to medle with those matters, in the whiche the Synode had medled before.</p>
            <p>¶And finally pope Hilarius wolde haue his decrees confirmed by the counsell. ¶By all the whiche reasons it is euident and playne, that euin in those lawes / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be only the constitutions and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy fathers, the Pope can not dispense without in euitable necessitie / and suche necessite as can not be other wyse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded. Nor truly it is not conuenient for a prince or a reuler to desire to abrogate
<pb facs="tcp:7850:144"/>
and adnull without consideration &amp; cause / that thinge, that a nother prince or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath ordyned with great studye and peyne, and for weighty causes: howe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che lesse than oucht that to be suffred / that other the pope him selfe doth ageynst the lawe of god, or gyueth lycence to other men to do it? Specially seynge it is not founde in no place of goddes lawe, nor yet in the ordynances of the fathers / that any suche power is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the pope. ¶For by these wordes, <hi>VVHAT</hi> so euer he shal lose vpon erthe, shall be loosed in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And <hi>VVHAT</hi> so euer he shal binde in erthe, shall be bounde in heuen / he hath doubtles power giuen him: not wherby he micht reuoke the lawe of god / or breke and dispense with any parte of it: but he hath power to bynde mennes synnes / and that not generally and in all cases / but fyrste it muste be supposed / that he vseth his Keye with such discrecion and richt iudgement, as he ouchte to do. Therfore Christe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he spake these forsayde wordes / sayde thus as folowethe: <hi>I, SHAL</hi> gyue the, the keyes / that is to saye / I shall gyue the power to discerne and iudge leprye / 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7850:144"/>
from no leprie / and power to lette in / and shutte out from the kyngedome of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, all suche as thou haste so iudged by rychte. And nowe, what discrecion / and rychte iudgemente shulde this be / if the Pope wolde take vpon hym for to coupul to gether in mariage, by his dispensacion those persones, whome the lawe of god &amp; of nature doth forbyd to come together, seynge, <hi>GOD</hi> hath commaunded, that his commaundementes shulden be kepte to the vttermoste poynte? Truely though in the orderynge of those actes / whyche of them selfe be indyfferent / and nother good nor badde / his Keye of power in a maner reuleth more thanne his Keye of lernynge and scyence: yet for all that / in the determinacion and orderynge of thoo thynges / that perteyne to our beleue / to honestie / to vertue / and to good maners / it is contrary. For in these thinges his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer determineth nothing, but that lerning hath determined / &amp; power here oucht in al cases to be ruled &amp; ordred by lerning. For here if power in the least thing that can be, be contrarye to the keye of LERnynge, that is the cnowlege of the law of god / the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:145"/>
determination shulde be nothinge worth. For if the Pope wolde by any maner of power determyne any thynge other wyse than lernyng, that is the cnowlege of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis lawe / wolde haue it be determyned, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our fayth, or in good maners: his determinacion shulde be vtterly nothinge worthe at al / yea it shulde be lefull for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry christian man, that knoweth this / to crie out ageinst it / and all to be spyt &amp; be spue it / and to reproue and damne it as hereticall. For if any power do commaunde the to do any thinge, that thou oughtest not to <abbr>do</abbr> / then doubtlesse contemne and dispice that power, as saynt Austine sayth. For, saith he, take hede of the degrees / that be in worldly thynges. For if the Marshall of the hoste bidde vs do any thynge / shall we do it / if it be ageynst the grande capitayne? Agayne, if the graunde Capitayne byd vs do any thinge, and the kynge or Emperour commaundeth vs to do a nother / dost thou doubt / but that we muste obey the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the kynge or the emperour / and contemne the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the grande Capitayne? Therfore if the kynge or the emperour bydde one thinge / and god an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7850:145"/>
we must obey god, &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nother kyng nor emperour. Therfore we may not thinke / that the Popes licence in the degrees forbydden by goddis lawe, is iuste and a richtfull dispensation? but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an vnrichtfull and an vnresonable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipation / and mysorderynge of the lawes of god. For truli god doth not alowe such maryages, whiche be ageynste his owne lawe / nor yet suche ouchte not to be called trewe mariages. For that oucht not to be iudged mariage, whiche is made ageynste the lawe of god. But when it is ones kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen / it muste nedes be amended, as saynte Ambrose sayth.</p>
            <p>¶<hi>YEA AND</hi> besyde al this, though we wolde euen grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neuer so moche, that the popes haue ben wont of custome to put to, or to take awey from the lawe of god / and so to make expositions &amp; restreyntes vpon goddis lawe: yet for all that the doctours of the lawe do thynke / that it is lefull for them / but only in .ij. cases.</p>
            <p>¶One case, whan that one lawe of god is expouned and restreyned by an other lawe of god / as this commaundement, <hi>THOV</hi> shalt not slee / is lymytted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouned
<pb facs="tcp:7850:146"/>
thus / that it is lefull to slee mysdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. ¶An other case / whan the pope of a iust and a leful cause, and suche as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out synne / doth put to / or take away some parte / from the lawe of god, as to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶But the pope can by none of these .ij. weyes expoune or restreyne this Leuiticall commaundement, That a man shulde not marie his brothers wyfe. For all thoughe that it was limitted and restreyned before tymes of god in the Deuteronomi, yet for all that bycause afterwarde the sayde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streint was taken awey of god hym selfe bi the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge of Christe: truly the pope can not brynge vp agayne nowe in these dayes the same restreynt. For if the pope now of dayes coulde by dispensation cause / that a man micht mary after the law of the Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomi, his brothers wyfe, whiche dothe dye hauynge no issue, for to reyse vp sede to his brother: without doubte he shulde make christian me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day to folow the Iues cerimones &amp; supersticiousnes / which
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7850:146"/>
the pope can not do, no more then he can cause that we shuld kepe their sabbat dai / or that there shulde be circumcisyon, as saint Gregory saith. After that the grace &amp; fauour of almichtie god appered, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the law / which were spoken bi figure &amp; mystically / can not be kepte, as we haue shewed you before of the sabbat day / &amp; of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / &amp; other figural or mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lawes, as is also that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Deuteronomi, That we shulde marie our brothers wyfe. wherfore if the pope wold brynge vp this nowe amonge vs christian men / he could not. For he can by no meane bringe vp ageyn the customes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Iues / whiche were abrogate &amp; clene taken awey bi the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christe. This saint Paule proueth, saying, <hi>IF</hi> you be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised / Christ shal ꝓfet you nothing at al / which did speke ageinst Peter to his face / bicause he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>streined the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the Iues ceremonies. And also saint Thomas saith / that whan thapostol doth publisshe the law of god, it is nat leful for the pope to dispense / as for an exemple, where the apostoll sayth, <hi>IF</hi> you be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised / Christe shall profette you nothinge,
<pb facs="tcp:7850:147"/>
whose sayenge also Ioannes de Turre cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata doth folowe. Therfore the pope can not restreyne this Leuitical lawe in the first case, that is, by cause it is restreyned by the Deuteronomi lawe / whiche is but a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and a ceremony.</p>
            <p>¶And agayne in the seconde case, that is to say, for a cause or consideration the pope can moche lesse dispense in this Leuiticall lawe / seynge there can be no cause founde lefull inough, and that shulde be without synne / for the whiche he may dispense. For to discouer the foulenes of our brother / is in the maners of men foule and shamefull / and suche couplynge is called inceste: and incest is as greuous a synne as can be. And therfore playnely euin as the pope can not dispense, that a man may commytte adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery / or to kepe a concubyne or le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man / or to haue many wyues at ones, and in suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyke, by cause they be of them selfe, and by their owne nature, euermore yl and nouchty: so nother in this kynde of inceste mariage, where as is deadely synne after the law of god / ther can be no cause fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / whiche can excuse that synne. For seynge that honestie is cause of this prohibition / 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7850:147"/>
whyche is the contynuall companyon of mariage, this kynde of mariage playnly is to be thoucht so euyl in the maners of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and also so myscheuous in example / that it can not be mainteined in no case, nother by man / nor by aungell / nor by apostoll, nor by any apostollyke man.</p>
            <p>¶Nor let not the Pope here lay ageynste vs his full power. For we graunt / that the Pope hath in dede a fulle power, and not yet all thinge so full as the worde souneth: so that this full power shulde be able to do any dede that is possible to be done, or any thynge that hym lustethe to do / as though there were no superior. For suche power is onely mete for Christe, according to that sainge of Christe, <hi>VNTO</hi> me is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all power bothe in heuen and in erthe / but this power of the Pope is restreyned and drawen in / to tho thinges / whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the pastorall or sheperdly cure of soules. And for orderynge of this power / bycause the pope is nat suche one / that can not synne, nor is not confyrmed in grace / Christe hath made his rule of the godspel / after the whiche the pope shulde order all his doynges: from the whiche rule of the
<pb facs="tcp:7850:148"/>
gospel if the pope wolde vary and swarue, and wolde grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te any thinge, that shulde be contrary to the preceptes of the same godspell / he doth not followe that power, that god hath gyuen hym / nor god doth not approue that, that he doth. ¶And as for that, whiche Pope Innocent, &amp; Pope Nicolas do saye, That it is not lefull for any man to iudge of the iudgement of the seate of Rome / nor lefull for any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke or reuerse the sentence or iudgement of that seate / for bicause of the preemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the churche of Rome: This say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of them ought not greatly to moue vs. For we thinke / that tho wordes muste be vnderstonde thus: That it is not lefull for any inferior power to reason vndiscret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the iudgement and determination of that seate / nor to affirme and holde openly any thinge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that determination: excepte that it be euident and playne / that the iudgement of that seate be erroneous &amp; wronge (As master Gerson writith) And that it is not leful for ani inferior person, to iudge as it were by auctorite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; determinaitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made bi the pope, &amp; as though he had iurisdiction &amp; power ouer
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7850:148"/>
the pope, for bi cause of the preeminence of the seate of Rome. But if that any pope do decre any thing ageynst the lawe of nature and goddes lawe: there if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do iudge &amp; reson of his determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / discretly / &amp; clarkely, &amp; not as it ware by auctorite / &amp; doth labor with all his might / that his sentence &amp; determination maye be reuoked and called agayne: This thynge is (as we thynke) so far of from sacrilege / pride / and presumption / or any other vice / that we beleue / there can be nothinge more godlye or more nere vnto the religyon of Christe. For doth not the Churche often times by recht and good lawe / reuoke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reproue the dedes and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Popes / whiche haue not bene very wel and conuenyently done of them, or dothe it let to chaunge them and make them better? yea furthermore, hath not al so meane bisshopes resisted &amp; withsto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the wronge &amp; vnreasonable sentencis &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the popes / not regardinge their cursynges / exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municaotins, &amp; al punisshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / that the churche doth vse?

Truely if the pope do suffre / bi his auctorite and power / incest mariages to be made, or wyll not breake them, when they be made, which (as Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory saith) be abhominable to god &amp; to all good men / it shall be the dutie of a louing &amp; a deuout bisshop / not only to withstande the pope openly to his face, as Paule dyd resist Peter / bicause the pope verili is to be reprehended &amp; rebuked: but also with all faire meanes &amp; gentylnesse, and lernynge, in tyme and out of tyme / oucht to crye vpon hym / to rebuke / reproue / beseche / exhorte hym / that the persones, so coupled to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / maye forsake suche maryages.

at the last the bysshoppe ouchte to plucke forthe his spirituall sworde of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and cursyng, and to shake it vpon suche persones, and to be take them to the diuol, to the punisshement of their flesshe, so that their spirite or soule be saued in the day of our lorde Iesus / accordynge to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment of Christe, and the exemple of Paule. For els howe shal these prelates do the dutie of bysshoppes and ouerseers, as they oucht to do, if that for the cruelte, &amp; thretes of the popes, they shall not dare calle backe theyr shepe in to the waye of truthe, that be out of the wey and loste, for whom they shal gyue a compte in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dredefull iudgement of god? Or how shal they escape the greuos &amp; sharpe punysshementes of god / with the whiche god thretneth them, that wyll not shewe the wycked synner his fautes, nor wyll not crye and gyue warnynge, whan they se the swerde commynge, that the synner may be conuerted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wronge wey to the richt wey / and to the trouth? <hi>I, AM</hi> alyue, saith our lorde, bycause that my flocke is rauys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed / and my shepe deuoured of al beastes of the felde / bicause they had no herdeman

<pb facs="tcp:7850:152"/>
shulde do the contrary.</p>
            <p>¶For there be two lawes saith pope Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, one public / an other priuate. And the public lawe is that, whiche hath ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by writynge of the holye fathers. The priuate lawe is the lawe / that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mennes hartes / by the inspiration of the holye goste / as thapostoll speaketh of certeyne, <hi>VVHICHE</hi> haue the lawe of god written in theyr hartes. ¶And in an other place he sayth, <hi>VVHAN</hi> the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens / which haue no lawe / do NATural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / that is to say / by the inspiration of the holy goste onely / without any lawe writen / tho thynges that the lawe commandeth, they be the lawe to them selfe. Therfore if any of these, saith Vrbane, hath people in his gouernaunce vnder the bysshop / in his churche, and dothe lyue secularly, and if that he, inspired with the holy goste, wyll saue him selfe in some monasteri / or amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge regular chanons: bicause this man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the priuate lawe of his conscience / that is, by the motion of the holye goste, there is no reason, that he shuld be bonde to the public lawe. For the priuate lawe is of more dignitie than the publike lawe.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7850:152"/>
               <hi>FOR</hi> doubtlesse the spirite of god is the lawe, and, <hi>THEY</hi> that be ledde by the spirite of god, be ledde by the lawe of god / and, <hi>VVHAT</hi> persone is it / that can of richt withstande the spirite or holy goste? Therfore who so euer is led with this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite / lette hym go his wayes free, euen by our auctoritie / yea although his bysshop say nay. <hi>FOR</hi> there is no lawe nor bonde made for a richtwyse and a good man / but where as is the spirite of god, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and fredome / and, <hi>IF</hi> ye be led with the spirite of god, ye be not vnder the law, that is to saye / if we folowe the motion of the holy spirite and of our conscience / we be not vnder the commune lawe / whiche euer ouchte to gyue place to the pryuate law. For in tho thinges / that be forbidden by the lawe of god / we must obey our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: and in other thinges the churche. Nowe fyrst the churche can not binde any persone to synne by her commaundement. Seconde, it can not be auoyded / but that suche persons, whiche by the lawe of god &amp; nature be vnlaufull to marie / and yet be coupled by mariage, or at the leste / that is presumed to be mariage / do lyue in synne / 
<pb facs="tcp:7850:153"/>
onely excepte that they be maried by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that by such ignorance, as could not be auoyded. Finally Paule saith, <hi>HE</hi> that putteth difference betwene meate and meate, if he eate / then he is condemned / by cause that / that he dothe is not done with faith, and good conscience. For all that is not done with faith is synne.</p>
            <p>¶Of these .iij. reasons / it foloweth / that al christian men / if their priuate conscience, lichtned with the holy gost / and knowlege of holy scripture, as it ought to be, hath moued them vnto it / they may without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ieopardie / yea and are bonde to make a diuorse with her, whom bothe nature and the lawe of god doth forbid them to haue to their wyfe: and to delyuer them selfe from that vntrue and onely presumed and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed mariage: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune lawe / what so euer it be / notwithstandyng and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge the contrary. Lykewise as a secular preest / moued by his owne conscience / and not by any lichtenes or inconstancye maye laufully go to an other bysshoppryke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste his owne Bysshoppes wylle, no maner of decree of the fathers to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye withstandynge: and as a regular
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7850:153"/>
professed, or the bysshoppe of a churche / thouch his prelate and the pope be ageinst it / maye laufullye go to a streyter maner of lyuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun lawe notwithstanding and byddynge the contrarye. For suche a one, as Innocente sayde, after that he hathe asked lycence of his prelate to go his waye, vpon his priuate lawe, whiche is to be preferred before the commun lawe he is absoyled and losed, and may frely fulfyll his purpose of a more holier lyuing / the sayenge nay and frowarde forbiddyng of his indiscrete prelate not withstandinge. For who so euer abuseth the power, that is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him / deserueth to lese his priuilege. And euen so it is in the maryage / that if a mans conscience moue him to diuorse / that he diuorse hym selfe, thoughe the churche say co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. For truly al though the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doth not declare suche maner of diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, yet the churche is bonde of deute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them, &amp; to bid openly such diuorsis to be made. And all though the Pope by his prepensed &amp; expresse acte, doth not agre to this diuorse / yet for all that by his secrete acte &amp; of duetie he vtterly agreeth vnto it. ¶<hi>AND HITHERTO</hi> we haue shewed
<pb facs="tcp:7850:154"/>
well and sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly / by very many reasons, as far as it perteyneth to this pourpose / that the prohibition / <hi>THAT</hi> we shulde not mary our brothers wyfe / whiche is deade without issue / is not suche a ꝓhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as stondith by constitution of man / but as nature fyrst did plant in mannes mynde / and afterward chastite and reuerent sham facidnesse hathe kepte it before the lawe: and our lorde shewed it vnto his chosen people by Moses, and such as the custome of christian men, with great consent and agrement of them that vseth it, hath from the beginnynge of the christian fayth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeres folowed and obserued / whiche hath so often ben renewed by counsayles, receiued and confyrmed by latter lawes. And fynally we haue proued, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes auctoritie can not stretche so far / that he may dyspense with suche maryages / whether they be made all redye, or be yet to be made. The whiche thinges / moste gentyll reder / bycause we truste they will so satisfye and content the, that we thiinke it but labour vtterly loste to seke for ayde any farther in this matter / either of holy scripture / or of the decrees of the churche,

or of the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the vniuersities, that be in Italye, Fraunce, and Englande, or of the suffragis and voycis of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste lerned men that be / as yet there be a great many behynde, it semeth to vs beste here, to conclude and make an ende of our worke, and not to tary the any longer in rekenninge them vp.
