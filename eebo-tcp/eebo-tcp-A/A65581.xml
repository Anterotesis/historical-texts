            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEre followeth a Compendious <hi>Chronology</hi> for <hi>62.</hi> Years last past: which (till the beginning of our late <hi>Plus quam civilia Bella</hi>) I have faithfully extracted, either from the private <hi>Adversaria</hi> of some very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Observers, or the publick writings of others, exceedingly eminent for their performances. The rest from the store of my own Collections; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet I had either my own Eyes, or the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all <hi>Parties,</hi> to warrant their <hi>Entry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Th' Impulsive to which was no other, than have all provident Husbandmen, who in plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Trees and Fruits, as they cannot but know (by the slender stock of their own Nature) they shall never live to taste of, do nevertheless
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99961:3"/>
reckon it <hi>Guerdon</hi> sufficient, but to think that thereby 'tis possible, they may gratifie <hi>Posterity,</hi> and perhaps therefore have grafted on their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, the venerable name of <hi>Good-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, the <hi>very All</hi> I hereby intend, is onely an infallible, an impartial conveyance to <hi>Posterity</hi> of the following <hi>Transactions,</hi> in their due <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi> By the <hi>Sanguine</hi> part whereof, I would not be thought <hi>Dolores renovare,</hi> to set our wounds fresh a bleeding, but <hi>Triftium Breviari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um dulce exhibere,</hi> to present you with a sweet <hi>Summary</hi> of <hi>Britaines</hi> bitter <hi>Calamities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is a kind of voluptuousness in the rehearsal of past miseries, a Pleasure even in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery it self, my own experience hath taught me.</p>
            <p>For, although (I know) it cannot but affect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truly honest mans heart, to reflect on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite <hi>Cruelties,</hi> unheard of <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Bloud-shed</hi> common to us all of these macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nations, in so narrow a Period of years, yet concerneth it not a little to recollect, view, and review, as in a Mirrour, with what Providence those <hi>Judgements</hi> befell us, by what <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Artifice</hi> perpetrated, with what <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Impieties</hi> acted: how the troubled <hi>Sea</hi> of our Misfortunes <hi>Ebbed</hi> and <hi>Flowed,</hi> with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99961:3"/>
various shapes of alternate <hi>Successes:</hi> how Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous the <hi>Storm,</hi> how menacing, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the <hi>Waves:</hi> how unequall the <hi>Temper</hi> of best composed <hi>Spirits:</hi> how inordinate the <hi>Pulse</hi> in soundest <hi>Constitutions!</hi> Lastly; what, and how wonderfull the <hi>Vicissitudes</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> thence emergent. And if so, then certainly from this bulk of <hi>Miseries,</hi> may be sucked some <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> as well as <hi>Poyson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, (if <hi>Chronology</hi> be the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>) I doubt not, but that hereafter, when by the <hi>Mosse</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> our <hi>Scarres</hi> are over-grown, this despicable Brat may (<hi>Digito monstrare</hi>) point at the Barbarous, bloudy <hi>Hands,</hi> as well as <hi>Envious Times,</hi> that gave them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, a <hi>Micro-Chronicon</hi> hath attended my <hi>Kalendar</hi> several years together: but the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room therein allotted, so confin'd me, that whensoever any new matter came to be added, more or lesse of the Old was still omitted, it could not be otherwise: Insomuch that unlesse all my former <hi>Chronical-notes</hi> were ever in readiness, you should one time or other be to seek, for what you desired most to be informed in.</p>
            <p>To prevent which, was the present <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all the most considerable of them, into this one portable Volume: wherein you have also this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99961:4"/>

            <p>To conclude, I declare it, that (as there are and ever will be <hi>Mistakes</hi> and <hi>Defects</hi> in the best of <hi>Humane actions,</hi> especially in works of this Nature, so) none shall more oblige me than such, who can and will freely by <hi>Material Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> but assist me in the least; or give civil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing, that either for want of better <hi>Intelligence,</hi> or through my own or the <hi>Printers Inadvertency,</hi> hath escaped Erroneous.</p>
