         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>He sayleth with a contrarie winde as Christ sailed on the shippe of the crosse, that prayeth for his enemies, and doth good to them that doe persecute him. The wicked doe also many tymes suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and sickenes as well as the good, for that God will, that they shall in this lyfe beginne to feele of the tormentes which they must suffer after in hell.

                  <p>Thou must haue patience in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yf thou lookest to be of the number of the elect. Patience in aduersitie and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is to God a most acceptable sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. In patience there be many good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

And so much more feruent oughtest thou to be in thy doing of good deedes, as thou arte vncerteyne of the houre when thou shalt be called: &amp; since the tyme when thou shalt dye is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeyne, thou oughtest allwayes to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and prepared, for to receyue death. If there be many now which doe lyue in the offence of God, hauing the day of their death vncertayne, how many more wold there be much worse, yf they shold know certeinlie the end of their lyfe? They wold deferre their pennance, and commit many moe offences vpon that assurance.</p>
                  <p>If men doe lyue lewdelie now, being not sure to continue vntill to morow, in what sort wold they lyue, yf they might be sure to lyue here an hundreth yeres?</p>
                  <p>The ignorance of the last houre, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many to absteyne from synne: And if some men doe happelie gyue them selues a little to the world, yet doe they not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie addict them selues thereunto, for the feare that they haue of the sodayne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of death vpon them, whiche they wold not doe, yf they knew they shold lyue many yeares: for then it is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that they wold with more negligence, and forgetfulnes of God, gyue them selues vnto vice. And allthoughe that the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of death doth not keepe a man all

together from synne, at the leastwyse, yet it maketh hym not to contynue therein, so longe as els he wolde.</p>
                  <p>If wicked men knew the houre of their death, they wolde be much worse then they be. Many dare not sinne, leste death sholde take them whylest they be doing it.</p>
                  <p>If a man might knowe surely the houre of his death, yet is it playne that he colde not knowe it, but vnder one of these two conditions, that is to say, eyther that he sholde dye very sodenly, or els haue some certayne tyme after appoynted and prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed him to dye in: and if he sholde knowe that he sholde dye sodenly, his pennance being vpon a sodayne, were lyke to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daungerous and doubtefull: and if on the other side, he sholde knowe his tyme to be lengthened for a longer space, then wolde he take more occasion to sinne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his pennance vntill the very laste day, both which wayes wolde be very daungerous and inconuenient for his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p>An hastie pennance, and a vayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of pennance are both very hurtfull to a mans conscience: to deliuer thee from both these inconueniences, the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath so ordeyned, that the houre of thy death sholde not be made knowne vnto thee, but kept secret from the, and that thou sholdest allwayes stand in some awe of death, because thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

still seeke how to lyue a vertuous lyfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou arte much bound vnto God, that by keepinge secret from thee, the houre of thy death, hath gyuen thee thereby, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler occasion to lyue well and to worke thyne owne saluation. And in that pointe sheweth be his mercie vearie much, that by keeping thee from the certeintie of death, doth gyue thee occasion daylie to conuert thee vnto hym, lest thou sholdest be taken vnprouided, for yf the day had bene set downe certayne vnto thee, thou woldest haue multiplied and increased thy sinnes vearie much? Also God wolde not that thou sholdest knowe the daye of thy death, because he wolde haue thee for to lyue for the profit and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of other and not for thyne proper benefite one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>The common commoditie is to be preferred, before the priuate and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And yf thou knewest that thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest die shortlie, thou woldest leaue many good workes to doe, whiche sholde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde to the benefite of others, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupying thy selfe about thyne owne proper commoditie, thou woldest haue care of none, but of thy selfe, and so who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget thy neighbours.</p>
                  <p>And yf agayne on the other syde: when a man is sicke, yf he sholde knowe surelie that that sickenes sholde not be his last sickenes, he wolde neyther confesse hym selfe, nor receyue any of the sacramentes,

neyther calle on God and his Sainctes, nor procure the prayers of his frendes, nor the common suffrages of the Church to be sayde for hym. All these good workes with many more wold he omit, yf he shold knowe for certentie, that he sholde then recouer and not die.</p>
                  <p>Many in their sickenes doe turne vnto God, thynkinge that they shall die, which they wolde not doe, yf they knewe surelie that they shold lyue. Further also did God prouyde, and most wyse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So as that which before his glorious death, was vearie death in deede, is nowe become lyfe to all good men, and to all wicked men it is a sure port of euerlasting death. It is the table of accompte, or the place of payment, where the true knighte, and the faythfull souldier is payed his wages, and the faint harted coward turned out of paye and discharged. Death doth gyue his hyre diuerslie, accordinge to the diuersitie of mens lyues. Seeke to be of the Number of those, which shalbe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.

<pb facs="tcp:1821:169"/>
death. Carry allwayes before thynes eyes the consideration thereof, &amp; doe not lyue in blyndnes.</p>
                  <p>The Niniuites hearinge the sentence of death pronounced against them by Ionas the Prophet, they straight wayes fell to pennance. Behold how much good the memorie of death doth worke in man, when it made so sodayne, and so greate an alteration in those sinners hartes. If thou doest meditate well of death, temptation shall neuer ouercome thee. Beware that thou loue not so this lyfe, that thou doest thereby forget death, for then doest thou die most of all, when thou hast best good will, and most desire to lyue.</p>
                  <p>The memory of death keepeth a man from beinge to high mynded in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is a good thinge to be readie to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death before he come, and to expect with good will the tyme that is to folowe after death.</p>
                  <p>If thou doest see others die before thee, thou mayest well knowe that thou art walking that same way, althoughe for the present tyme thou thinkest thy selfe to stand still and moue not.</p>

see passe by them. So many which doe see others die daylie before their face, doe thinke that them selues be immortall, and that they doe stand stocke still, whilest others doe goe on a pace towards death.</p>
                  <p>If death doe come vpon a sodayne, and doe carrye anye man awaye with hym, neuer say that he playeth the traytor with hym, since that he hath longe agoe proclaymed hym selfe for an open enemye to vs all. And it is a playne token that he neuer meaneth to make a perfect peace, that euerie day is killinge some one or other. So that yf he doe take thee vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, the fault must needes be thyne, seeing he threateneth thee daylie, and thou wilt neuer beware. Thou must still looke for hym, and thinke of hym, as of one that were present with thee, and so shall he neuer catche thee like a traytor by treason. If thou considerest well of death, thou wilt lyue with some feare in thy lyfe.</p>
                  <p>They which goe throughe the fieldes when they be couered with snowe, their eyes doe so dasell, that they can skant see any thing when they be entred into their house, and therefore were it greate perill for them to come into any place where daunger were: Euen so the glisteringe brightnes of this worldlie prosperitie, doth so dymme the eyes of worldlie men that haue passed through it, that when they once enter into the nexte lyfe, through the
<pb facs="tcp:1821:170"/>
passage of death, they can see nothing, but blindly runne into the pit of perdition. Into such confusion doe these worldlings runne, through their ouermuch deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in worldly pleasures, and the little consideration of their owne estates and conditions: and no maruayle is it that they doe then feele pouertie, which lyued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in welth ouer wantonly, and that they doe taste of sorowe after they be deade, which in their lyfe, tooke all their fill of pleasure and worldly vanitie.</p>
                  <p>It is but meete, that he which in his lyfe forgetteth him selfe, sholde when he dyeth forget God also: at that tyme the worldly man can haue no full sighte of his owne saluation, by reason of the glistering lighte of this false deceyuable worlde which doth so dimme his eyes.</p>
                  <p>The remedy that such a one hath, is first to sit without at the dore of his house, and there looke well about him, and settle firmelie his eye sight agayne. And when he hath shaken of the dymnes of his sight, whiche the earnest beholdinge of those shyning visible thinges did dasell his eyes withall, then may he safelie enter into his house, &amp; neuer indaunger him selfe at all. After this manner in this lyfe, must thou behold death considering what the glorie of this worlde is worth, and the vayne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and riches thereof.</p>

That vessell which is able to conteyne God hym selfe, can neuer be full, vntill that God hym selfe doe fill it. The cause whereof is the vanitie of these worldlie thinges.</p>
                  <p>The thinges that be of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vayne, (as all these worldlie thinges be) doe so occupy the place wherein they be, that for all their being there, the place remayneth emptie still, and golde doth no more satisfie the soule, then wynde doth satisfie the bodie. The desires of our soule can be but little satisfied, with all that is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1821:196"/>
on the earth to be desired, because the desires thereof be infinite, and without the compas of any measure or boundes. Therefore in this lyfe wee haue no other remedie, but to take away the desire of the thinges of this worlde.</p>
                  <p>If a man were so madde, that he wold needes flie vp into heauen, it were but an euill remedie to deuise for hym all such thinges, as were necessarie to further his enterprice forwarde. It were much better to consider the meanes how to make hym leaue it of, and to put that imagination out of his heade, since it is a thinge impossible to be broughte to passe. After this manner must thou applie the remedie to all thy greedie desires, and thirsting after honors and riches, alwayes perswading thy selfe, that it is vnpossible for thy soule to be satiate with any thinge that is conteyned vnder thee cope of heauen. This is all the remedie that thou hast to take away these vaine desires of thyne, for it is more easie for a man to haue wynges, and to flie aboue the cloudes, then to haue thy desires fullie satisfied with the pleasures of this lyfe.</p>

The principall cause and reason thereof is because that none of the goodes of this lyfe, can haue any conformitie or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the nature of our soule.</p>
                  <p>God hath made vs for hym selfe, and our harte is neuer setled in full quyetnes, vntill that it rest whollie in hym. God hath gyuen vnto all thinges certaine prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed rules, answerable vnto their owne natures. It were against all rule of reason to feede an horse with flesh, and a lyon with grasse, because it is not agreable with their natures. And our soule beinge a spirite, how shall it be satisfied with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinges? Golde and our spirite be nothing like together, neyther any thinge that the worlde bringeth forth or gyueth, hath conformitie with the nature of the soule. Vnto some creatures as vnto the Camelions, it geueth ayre to mainteyne them withall, wherewith the proude men doe seeme to be maynteined also, but yet the soule is no Camelion.</p>
                  <p>Vnto some other it geueth Iron to lyue withall, as the Oysteriges, vnto which it seemeth that couetous men haue some conformitie. Some be fed with filthines, as the fleshlie and carnall folke, and to some it gyueth poyson for their foode, as vnto the enuious persons. But because all these thinges be earthlie and haue no agreement with our soule, it can not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And although that pride, and enuy, and all other vyces, be thinges in their kynde spirituall, yet folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it not thereon that they be the foode of our spirite, for their be many corporall thinges which be not the sustenance or foode of our bodies. The reason is, for that God is onlie the foode of our soule, and not any other thinge in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. He hauing so ordeined it in our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our soule sholde not be satisfied with any thing but hym selfe.</p>

                  <p>This spirituall foode hath also this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, which our bodely nourishment hath not, for that our bodely sustenance engendreth still a satietie and loathing in them that doe take of it, but the soule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying once heauen, and hauing the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, may both haue satietie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lothsomnes, and yet haue withall an hunger vnto God, so as the satietie or full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes quencheth not the desire, neither let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the soule from desiring still.</p>

                  <p>VVhen God created the worlde, of all such thinges as he made therein, he created of euerie sort of the thinges that he made, many, as trees, plantes, beastes, &amp; all other liuinge creatures, which sholde multiplie and increase euerie one of them in their kyndes, yet made he but one man, and one woman, of which all the rest of the men in the world shold discend, to the end that when they sholde see how that they were all discended from one, they might be prouoked thereby one to loue another with more earnest affection and good will.</p>
                  <p>God praysed the first day that he created, and all that he made in it, but not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d day, vnto the which he gaue no prayse at al, neither called he it good, as he did all the other beside that.

                  <p>God commaundeth vs alwayes such thinges as our natures be most prone vnto, and asmuch against the nature of man it is for to hate one another, as it is against the nature of water to ascend vpward. And albeit that by the meanes of thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minde, it might seeme vnto thee some pleasure for to hate thy neighbour, yet can it not seeme any pleasure to thee at all to burne therefore for euer in hell fire.

But thou must seeke God in all thyne actions, &amp; bend thy selfe, onlie vnto hym.</p>
                  <p>The loue of a mans selfe, is like vnto the harte in the bodie of man, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth and ruleth the flesh, vaynes and finewes. Selfe loue doth guyde and direct a sinner, to all mischeefes &amp; harmes. VVhy doest thou desire honor, riches, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but because thou louest thy selfe too much? But the little esteemynge of a mans owne selfe, maketh hym acceptable both vnto God and man. The loue of a mans selfe, is like vnto a treason, that deserueth both losse of goodes and of lyfe.</p>
                  <p>If selfe loue reigne in thee: thou mayest well knowe what thou desirest, but thou seest not what will doe thee good.

mans owne will vnto hym selfe: If that wolde cease, hell wolde soone cease also. VVhereupon doth the fire of hell worke, but vpon the will of man? And if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution or trouble afflict thee, what is the cause of thyne affliction, but thyne owne proper will. Of that cometh all thy greefe, and all thy torment, take away thy will, and there will remayne no matter of torment, and vntill that be gone, thy payne shall neuer cease. It is not possible for thee to loue God as thou sholdest doe, and not to take away thine owne proper loue.</p>
                  <p>There be certayne pretious stones, which if they touch some kinde of mettle, they loose their vertue, and by some other agayne they increase it. And loue being a most precious stone, doth loose his vertue being put vpon thy selfe, but if that thou puttest it vpon God it groweth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth.</p>
                  <p>Of thy great conuersing with thy selfe, groweth thy much louing of thy selfe: and so if thou woldest conuerse with God, thy loue to him wolde increase. A man that is all his lyfe longe broughte vp in a feelie sheepe cote, waxeth so blinde in the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, that he thinketh that place to be better then all other places in the world besides: In lyke maner, by thy much conuersing with thy selfe, thou growest in loue and lyking with thy selfe.</p>

medlest not with any matter, but that which concerneth thy commoditie. And thus beinge alwayes busied aboute thy selfe, &amp; thyne owne matters, thou growest into an ouer greate likinge, and loue with thy selfe. If the Apostle did so much loue God, that he saide, nothing could seperate hym from Christ, doe not thou marueill thereat, when hym selfe saide also, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>By these two loues, there are two cities buylded. The loue of God with the despisinge of thy selfe, is the one, and the loue of thy selfe with despisinge of God, is the other: And betwene both these, that is betwixt God and thy selfe standeth thy will, which the nearer that it draweth vnto thee, so much goeth it further from God.

it may growe so neare vnto thee by the greate loue that thou bearest vnto thy selfe, that it may growe vnto the despisinge of God.</p>
