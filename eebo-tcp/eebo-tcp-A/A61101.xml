         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen in all Controversies about matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the dictate of the Word of God is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to be attended; and the certainty of that
dictate depends upon the assurance of the true
sense and interpretation of the Scripture; It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that in the first place we have considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the assurance one may have of the true and genuine sense
thereof.</p>
            <p>For though without controversie the Scripture be a Rule of
the highest, most absolute, and most sacred Authority that
may be, and such as wheresoever it extends to give Rule, bindes
and regulates all humane Laws and Constitutions, from what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
soever derived, and though in many things (as namely, in
the Fundamentalls of Religion, in matters of necessary faith,
and in the expresse Commands of God) the truths thereof are so
manifest, and of so assured receipt, as that no authority, no not of
an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> is to be received to the contrary, but every
one must of his own illumination embrace and hold them; yet are
there other truths which may so easily admit dispute, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the awe of some authorized Moderator, men of perverse affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
would inevitably subvert the peace of the Church with their
infinite dissentions about them. It is true, that to the great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Church, there is much dissention made about the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
or Interpreter of the Scripture; but that is not so much
through error of Judgement, as obstinacy of parties, among whom
the two most adverse and dangerous parties are neither of them so
blamelesse, but that they are culpable of detracting from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100497:4"/>
authority of the Scripture, by authorizing unwarrantable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of it.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in the first place the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the
great subverter of the Scripture, by assuming to her self the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the whole Church Catholique, and by vertue thereof, to
have infallibility of judgement in interpretation of Scripture;
for whilst she as Judge arrogates to her self infallibility, she makes
that there is no more regard to be had what the Text is, than
there is heed to be taken what was the Warrant that the holy
Ghost had for those things which he hath at any time delivered;
for he that is infallible, pronounces of his own authority, and can
no more depend or be restrayned to any originall out of himself,
than infinitenesse can be restrayned to a finite thing, or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto a creature: wherefore there can be no extrneall Judge
of Scripture, of infallible authority, for that of necessity annulls
the Scripture, and makes it no other than a dead Letter.</p>
            <p>But in the second place they also destroy the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
who when in word and outward profession they magnifie
it above all things, do then by subjecting it indifferently to the
judgement of every one that takes upon him to interpret it, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under foot the honour that they gave unto it; for as infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Interpreter takes away the Scripture from the hearer,
so incertainty in the Interpreter takes away the hearer from the
Scripture: for how can one hear, when he may either doubt the
judgement or fidelity of the Interpreter? or when (as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens)
the Interpreters that are authorized one as much as another,
do make a diverse, perhaps an adverse delivery of the Scripture? As
in the Romish errour the Scripture is made a dead letter, so in this
it is made a Trumpet of incertain sound, which none can with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hear and receive, unlesse you will suppose some hearer also infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
To say truth, as in the question whether one God or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
it was truely said, <hi>Dicite plure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, dicite null<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;</hi> so in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Gods Word (whereof none can be authentique, but with
whom the Spirit of God is warrantably to be presumed) if in
equall degree and authority we make many, we make as good as
none at all. We must therefore finde an especiall Interpreter, and
that of such potiority of judgement before all others, as that we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100497:4"/>
may safely confide therein, and yet so confide, as that we may not
detract ought from the Authority of the Scripture, by ascribing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
to the Interpreter.</p>
            <p>We are taught negatively,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20.</note> That <hi>no Prophesie of the Scripture is
of private Interpretation;</hi> We are also told, That the <hi>Church is the
ground and pillar of the truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> And we are warned not to adhere to
the doctrines of particular men, be they never so eminent and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in the Congregation, but to weigh their Doctrines deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the Word of God, and to see if they have alwayes been so
understood and received by the Church; for if we finde not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(of our own Church at least) for them, we are then but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
to receive them; but if we finde the judgement of the
Church Catholique against them, we are altogether then to reject
them: for when the promises of the holy Ghosts assistance were
made, not to single disciples, nor to some in particular, but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
to the universality of them:<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 20.</note> 
               <hi>I am with you unto the end.
He that heareth you, heareth me. He</hi> (the Spirit of Truth) <hi>will
guide you into all Truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 16.</note> that is, not some, nor every one of you,
but generally the Body of you:<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> We cannot receive Doctrines
with any confident assurance, but from the concurrent Judgement
of all the Pastors of the whole Church Universall, to whom the
promise of assistance is properly, and in the first place made; or in
defect thereof, from the concurrent Judgement of the Pastors of
our particular Church, which, as to her own Members, is to be
received as the Judgement of the whole, till the Judgement of the
whole appeareth to the contrary. For as the spirits of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Prophets in every Church ought to be heard and received
of all the Members thereof, untill it appear that their particular
spirits and Doctrines recede from the concurrent Judgement of
all the Prophets of that Church (to which they ought to submit
their judgements) so ought the concurrent Judgement of all the
Prophets of every particular Church, to be received of that
Church, untill it appear that it is contrary to the Judgement of
the Church Universall: But then as the Universall Church must
be heard before the particular, so must the Universality of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
before any particulars of that particular Church; for God,
saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>is not the author of confusion:</hi> And therefore he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100497:5"/>
not onely obiects against the refractory particulars of <hi>Corinth,
We</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">1 Cor 11. 16.</note> the Church of <hi>Corinth) have no such Custome;</hi> But lest
they should alleadge errour also in that particular Church, he
justifies their practise, by the practice of the Universall; <hi>Neither</hi>
(saith he) <hi>have the Churches of God.</hi> By which it appears, private
men are tyed to submit to the judgement of their particular
Church, and that unto the judgement of the Universall.</p>
            <p>But if any ask what is the Catholique Church, when and how
is her judgement to be had.</p>
            <p>The Catholique Church (properly so called) is the whole
number of Christians in all places Universally professing Christ;
And this, since the Apostles times, never was, nor can be assembled
into one, to give sentence upon any thing: But as in the Politique
Body of Civill States, the reall assembling of all the Members
personally being unnecessary, inconvenient, and almost impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
some persons representative of the whole, being by intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the superiours from all parts, delegate to give the common
suffrage of the whole, do by the Laws of God and man, give the
binding sentence of the whole Body Universall, So in the mysticall
Body of the Church, the Ecclesiasticks, which are the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
Members, for discerning and judging matters that depend
upon the Word of God, because that to them, and to them alone,
were the promises of the holy Ghosts assistance made, they (I say)
either all assembling themselves together, or at least in their severall
Diocesses, chosing and delegating from among themselves trusty
men, to do the office of the Clergy in that point, do truely and
properly give the entire Vote of the whole Catholique Church:
And in this way we have many sentences and Decrees thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
to us; which being from age to age successively received,
do stand in force and speak, unto this very present: against which,
whosoever shall in practice or doctrine attempt any thing to the
prejudice of what is so established, shall apparantly declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an insolent and schismaticall exalter of himself, and of his
own private judgement, against the judgement of the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church: and in the same way that the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
speaketh, in the same also, if need be, speaketh every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100497:5"/>
This being the extraordinary way wherein the Church speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, but upon extraordinary occasions; she hath also for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
occasions, a continuall constant voyce in an ordinary way;
The Church, considered in it self, is not, nor cannot be lesse than
the whole Body of it; but considered in the actions of it, any
part by which it duely worketh; as to that work onely which it
so intendeth, is truely and properly enough called the Church:
If we speak of a man, as of his being, as that he lives, is in health,
young, lusty, &amp;c. we mean by the man no lesse than the whole
man, with all his members; but if we speak of the particular
actions of the man, as that he did hear, see, speak, take, &amp;c. we
do not then intend that every distinct member of his body did
actually hear, see, speak, take, &amp;c. but that the man performed
those actions by the proper members respectively ordained for
the doing of them, and that neverthelesse the office of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
so ministring, was the proper act of the whole man; so that
though the eyes of the man onely saw, his ears heard, his tongue
spake, and his hands handled, yet is the whole man said truely to
hear, see, speak, and handle.</p>
            <p>As then in the body naturall,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> so in the Body mysticall, the
<hi>Church;</hi> though the Church, in her being comprehend all members,
as well Lay as Clergie, yet in her work and actions she worketh
not promiscuously by all, but by her proper and ordained mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
for if every one were an eye to see, a head to judge, or a
mouth to give sentence, then were they all but one equipotent
member,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 19.</note> and <hi>where then were the body?</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> therefore though
in the question of circumcising the believing Gentiles, the letters
of Ordinance went in the name of the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
yet plainly the Brethren had no vote in the decision of the
question, but as the Apostles and Elders are onely said to have
<hi>come together to consider of the matter,</hi> so the debate and decision
there, is onely theirs, and the Decrees thereupon are in the 16 Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
<note place="margin">Acts 16. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> called onely <hi>the Decrees that were ordained of the Apostles and
Elders,</hi> and if we will have the Brethren to have been named in
the Apostles Letters, to shew that Lay-men have authority to vote
in matters of Religion, then must we also confesse that Lay-men,
aswell as <hi>the Man of God,</hi> have authority to judge in matters of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100497:6"/>
Doctrine also, for they that writ the Letters, say of the point of
Doctrine, <hi>We gave no such Commandment.</hi> Therefore plainly the
judgement of the Apostles and Elders, was in that matter, the
judgement of the Brethren, and of the whole Church there, by
their unanimous submission and agreement unto them. And
when all is done, the voting of Apostles, Elders, and Brethren to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
is a thing farre differing from the voting of Lay-men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and from Lay-mens choosing of the votes.</p>
            <p>In the same manner the voyce of the ordayned Governours and
Ministers in every particular Church, in those things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Care and Charge, is the voice of the Church it self;
and the voyce of that particular Church, not being repugnant to
faith, nor the declared judgement of the Catholique Church is,
(as to the Members of that Church) the voice of the whole
Church Catholique: so that he that refuseth to hear the voice of
the Governours of his particular Church, refuseth to hear his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church; and not that Church onely, but the whole Church
Catholique.</p>
            <p>Again, as in the body the most usefull members thereof, the
eyes, the ears, the tongue, the hands, the feet would not onely be
uselesse, but make a confused deformity, if they were every one
annexed immediately to the grosse of the body, and not joyned by
the mediation of some noble limb, the eyes, the ears, and tongue,
by the head; the hands, by the arms, and the feet, by the legs: so
would it be in the Church Catholique, if every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
should hold it self immediately to depend on it, and not on
the noble and mediating limb of his particular Church; that so by
a usefull and decent subordination of the Members under the
head.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>The Body from thence</hi> (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>by joynts and
bands having nourishment and knit together, may encrease with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These same things doth our Saviour teach, when giving a Rule
for governing ones self in private offences betwixt his brother and
him,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 17.</note> he bids him <hi>Tell it to the Church:</hi> Our Saviour meant not
that upon every such occasion the Church Catholique should, or
could be convoked, but onely that the offended should complain
to the Governours of the Church he lived in, the doing whereof,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100497:6"/>
is properly to complain to the whole Church, yea to the whole
Church Catholique, as appears by our Saviours adding, that if
the <hi>offender refused to hear the Church, he should be as an Heathen
man;</hi> as much as to say, That if by refusing to hear his particular
Church, he refused to hear the whole Chuch Catholique, he should
then be as an Heathen man, cut off from the Communion of the
whole Church; for it were no just sentence to cut off one from the
whole Church, for disobeying the particular, unlesse that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the particular, were disobeying of the whole
Church.</p>
            <p>Every particular Church then hath so farre the authority of the
Church Universall, that (as to her own Members) her voyce is the
voyce of the Catholique Church, and tyes them all in conscience
to submit their judgements to hers, and to yeeld observance to all
her Ordinances that are not against the expresse Word of God,
nor judgement of the Catholique Church. And even in her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
that minister question, whether they be Orthodox and
agreeable to the Word of God or no, her authority is so farre
binding, as that even those Ordinances<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are not to be rejected nor
condemned upon the judgement of any of her private Members
onely, but either by her own review and censure, by some
more generall Nationall Assembly, or (if the consequence require
it) by a full and true Generall Assembly of the Church; whose
sentence when once it shall be obtained, shall be received, as the
most sacred, and most authentique judgement that may be had in
that matter, and neerest approaching to the judgement of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost; but shall not be received as infallible, as if pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a Judge infallible; for what assistance soever God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to his Church, it is onely such as agrees with the condition
of a Church Militant, therefore he hath neither promised it to
the single Ministers in every of their Preachings, neither yet so to
the Church it self, as that in every of her Consultations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
she should infallibly produce the sentence of the holy Ghost
(for then were the Scripture needlesse, seeing the Church should
be able to pronounce infallibly with authority, equall to the
very Text, and the Church as to errour in knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
should not be Militant, but Triumphant: but every
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100497:7"/>
judgement of every Church shall have such a potiority of credit
and authority, in respect of the judgement of any part or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof, as that it must not be rejected nor over-ruled by any
other judgement, than either her own revisall and censure, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of her proper Judges, a more generall Nationall Assembly,
or a full generall Assembly of the Church.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, when for avoyding confusion in the Church,
<hi>God hath subjected the spirits of the</hi> (particular) <hi>Preachers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32.</note> to the
concurrent judgement of all the Preachers; for men, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of preaching Gods Word, to preach their own private
judgements, in detraction from the authority of their Church,
and without submitting their opinions to the judgement of their
Church; this is so farre from honouring God by magnifying of
his Word, as that contrarily it destroyes the authority of the
Scripture, by confused and wrong arrogated judgement in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
of it, it by sects and schismes subverts the peace of the
Church, and contrary to the Admonition that God hath given in
that behalf, makes God the author of confusion.</p>
            <p>The assurance of our Orthodox profession, depending upon
the consideration of these things, cannot but occasion a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
examination of them.</p>

which followeth his own judgement or conscience onely, to avoid
disobedience and will-worship; for private judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
are neither sure nor constant observers of Gods Law, nor
can a man alwayes tell whether his iudgement, or his affection
leads his conscience; but as obedience is that which our Saviour
himself learning, sheweth that we all must learn; so the power of
<hi>Godlinesse</hi> is to constrain obedience.<note place="margin">Heb 5. 8.</note> And if there be a question
what we shall obey,<note place="margin">Mala. 2. 7.</note> the Scripture tells us <hi>the Priests lips should
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100497:7"/>
preserve knowledge, and we should seek the Law at his mouth.</hi> And
our Saviour tells his disciples, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and

the Church, be as an Heathen man:</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

and indecencies in the service of God: he obiects, that

               <hi>for the Lords sake;</hi> And that <hi>every soul be subject to the higher power;</hi>
that <hi>he that resisteth the power, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and
receiveth to himself damnation.</hi> The Scripture is abundant to
this purpose,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 6.</note> and among many other places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 6. is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable:
When <hi>Jacob</hi> (or <hi>Israel</hi>) was afraid, in the apparell of
his elder brother, to seek his fathers supreme blessing, lest by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in a undue manner, he should, instead of a blessing, get a
curse; his mother requires his obedience to her voye; <hi>Israel</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, and by it obtained the blessing. If this Allegory so much
concern us, as that we be the <hi>Israel,</hi> the younger brother that
want and seek the blessing, our Saviour our elder brother, in
whose clothing we seek it, and God our father that gives it; who
is our directing mother, by oheying whose voyce we obtain the
blessing, but she that is the wife of our father, the Church of God?
By these then, and many other Scriptures, it appears, That in all
matters of Religion, wheresoever there is a doubt, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
use of judgement, the iudgement of the Church is to be
preferred; So Gods Word (which must be observed) directs, so
the exigence of things requires, the particular man cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
avoyd will-worship and singularity, nor the Church of God
confusion.</p>
            <p>When now there is so great offence taken at divers Ordinances
of our Church, what is there in any of them so erroneous or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
as to discharge ones conscience from the terror of these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and from the obedience that they command? Is there any
thing in the Ordinances of our Church against the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God? If there be, Why do not the offended shew it,
that they may justifie themselves, vindicate Gods Truth, and
stop the mouthes of all gain-sayers? But when instead of things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100497:8"/>
expresly crossing Gods Commadments, they finde no exceptions
but what, at the most, are disputable, grounded upon inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and collections, and those not generally received, nor yet all
approved by the judgement of any particular Church, but late
imaginations of men, of a few, and them private men, whether
it be meet in the sight of God, upon such grounds to follow
men, or indeed ones own self, rather than God, every one may
judge.</p>
            <p>And were that granted (which indeed cannot be proved, nor
may be granted) that the Ordinances of our Church are supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
How yet will that warrant the disobeying of them, to a
conscience that is guided onely by the Word of God? For where
is superstition by the Word of God forbidden? Or where is it
there described? Though then we grant superstition to be the
foulest corruption a Christian Church can be depraved with, and
neerest approaching to Idolatry, yet being a corruption discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the judgement of the Church, rather than any expresse
Word of God, With what warrant can any mans conscience,
against Gods expresse command, disobey the Ordinance, for fear
of superstition, when concerning it he hath received no command
from God?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 23.</note> especially, when disobedience being like <hi>the sinnes of
Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he commits a sin that is equall to them,
and onely to avoid superstition, which is lesse than either. Nay,
that is not all, but while he disturbs his duty with false apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of superstition, he with his disobedience, commits the
superstition which he fears; for when superstition properly is an
over-strict religious insisting upon the doing or not doing of that
which in it self is but indifferent; his own scrupulousnesse not
to kneel, not to bow, not to stand up, not to be uncovered, not
to answer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the use of the Church, is not onely
disobedience, but very superstition it self, placing Religion
in that wherein there is no Religion to be placed; and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conscience more to fear pollution from without, by
things externally enioyned, than to fear it within, from the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse,
stubbornnesse, or self-conceitednesse of the heart, than
which, nothing doth sooner defile the actions of a man, and make
his Religion vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100497:8"/>
But, will he say, His conscience cannot be satisfied, but that
the Ordinance of the Church in some things, is superstitious, so
as he may not submit unto it. We must answer, <hi>Let him use</hi> the
liberty of his consci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, but let him withall take heed he use it
not for a cloke of maliciousnesse; for if through weaknesse of
conscience he takes offence at the Ordinance of the Church, as
superstitious, which otherwise he knows himself tyed to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and observe, let him, in true humiliation of his soul, behave
himself like one afflicted, that laments the breach between the
Church and him, let him labor for satisfaction by the help of
those whose integrity in that behalf, shall not by any aversenesse
to the Ordinance, be suspected: let him forbear rayling language
on Governours, and contemptuous behaviour towards the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that so though he cannot be conformable, he may not yet
become refractory, but may be piously embraced of the Church, till
in the spirit of meeknesse he be at last restored to his strength: But
if he will not do thus, but will contend, hold his own opinion suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to oppose against the Judgement of the Church, adde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to his non-conformity, seek to poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

glory in their association, and towards the Governors of the
Church be <hi>as one of those that controll the Priest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 4.</note> yea, that controll
the whole Priest-hood; that man, in pretending conscience, lyeth
unto the holy Ghost; he is not prest with conscience, but a lift up
heart, self conceited, and affecting singularity, hath seduced him,
and makes him maintain an affected scruple of his own,
before the iudgement, yea, and the peace of the whole
Church.</p>
            <p>From these generalls, we come somewhat more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to consider that which some affirm, that for remedy of the
corruptions of the Church, any Assembly representative of the
whole Body of any State, seeing it implicitely comprehends all
Orders, Degrees, and Conditions, that are parts of the State, have
full power and authority of doing whatsoever any order or part
of the State may do; and that therefore they, as well as the Clergie,
may, in that State, determine what form of Ecclesiasticall
Government, what discipline, what Ceremonies are most fit for
the Church, and most agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100497:9"/>
Who knows not but that by the same reason they may as well
determine what Doctrines are most agreeable to the Word of
God: but we shun captiousnesse, and seek our own and every ones
clear satisfaction.</p>
            <p>It is true, a Body representative of the whole State, hath
the power of the whole State, to do whatsoever the whole
Body of the State, if it could be all assembled, could do;
but the whole State, if it were gathered together in one, and
the whole Clergie in it, could not by their promiscuous Vote
determine of any thing that God hath subjected to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Clergie onely. Some argue, That the whole
State be Christians, and every true Christian a spirituall man;
<hi>The Spirituall man judgeth all things;</hi> And it is true; but that
judgement is onely as to himself, to discern and judge for his
own right governance, but not to binde others therewith;
he may exercise such judgement as grace administreth, but
cannot exercise directive judgement, for that is not to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
but by especiall Commission of Authority. It was the
ground of <hi>Corah's</hi> fearfull sinne,<note place="margin">Num. 16. 3</note> that because all the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were holy every one of them, and the Lord among them,</hi> that
therefore Levites and Lay-men might offer Incense as well as
the Priests: one without lawfull authority may not more
meddle with decreeing the suppression of vice, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of vertue, in a way that belongs onely to the Jurisdiction
of another,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 14</note> then might the sonnes of <hi>Sceva</hi> use the authority of
Christs Name to casting out of devills; Therefore particular men
must have expresse Warrant, before they can decree any thing.
And were it granted that they, if known, might in this life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
directive judgement in Ecclesiastique affairs, yet being so
small a number, in respect of worldlings, and it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in this world to distinguish them, or to avoyd, but that
while they vote together with worldlings, their votes will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by worldlings: for these causes, the being inwardly a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
man, can nothing more avail him in that point, than if he were
not so.</p>
            <p>And for this last cause, it nothing also avails, though the
Clergie themselves actually vote amongst seculars; for where
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100497:9"/>
the carriage of matters cannot certainly follow the votes of the
Clergie, but be subject to the votes of the Seculars, their votes
so given, cannot have the authority of Ecclesiastique votes, but of
Lay. And both for the peace of private consciences, and also for
the peace of the Church, it would advisedly be examined whether
the votes of Clergy-men chosen by the Seculars (say by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
representative of a whole State) be of more authority for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
matters of Religion in question, than the votes of the
Seculars themselves that chose them be; for when by the expresse
Word of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32.</note> 
               <hi>The spirits of the Prophets, are to be subject to the
Prophets,</hi> the Prophets must either all of them together hear and
determine, or all of them freely make choice of such of their
Brethren as shall do it for them, lest if the secular power assume
the choice of the men, they, by assuming the choice of those that
shall give the Clergies vote, assume the giving of their vote, and
upon the matter reject the vote and judgement of the Clergie:
for the few men that so be chosen, have no authority of themselves,
to judge by themselves, but have the authority of those onely that
made the fiduciary commitment of power to them; and if they
that committed the authority be Seculars, then is the judgement
and executing of the spirit, of Seculars only. And it would further
be taker into consideration, Whether, as the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi>
usurpation of the authority of the universall Church manifested
him to be the great spirit of Antichrist, so in every particular
Church, any usurping or undue assuming of the authority
thereof, will not amount to an inferiour exercise of the same
spirit?</p>
            <p>Now whereas it is conceived that Forms of Government
Ecclesiastique are not tyed to the Judgement of the Clergie, but
are arbitrary as the State shall judge expedient, it is not denyed
but that Church-Government may be accommodate to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the State; but then those cautions are to be observed,
(1) That as the State is Judge what form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be most commodious for the well-fare thereof; so the
Clergie be Judges, whether the form desired be safe for the Church,
and agreeable to the Word of God; otherwise the one may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
while the other is accommodate: Therfore we see that upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100497:10"/>
every change and remove of the Camp,<note place="margin">Numb. 4. 15.</note> not onely the taking down
and folding up of the Tabernacle, and all things belonging to it,
was committed to the Priests, but even the utmost act of carrying
of it, when all was disposed and ordered by the Priests, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in charge to those onely that were Levites: And whereunto
are <hi>helps in Government</hi> reckoned among <hi>Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 12. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Prophets, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and other Members which <hi>Christ hath set in his Church,</hi> if
the Government of the Church be to be managed by those that
are not to be numbred among them. And if among Pastors
which <hi>God hath set in his Church,</hi> he hath ordained some to be <hi>helps
in Government,</hi> how dangerous a matter will it be for those that
are not of their calling, to iustifie them out of their authority,
and in that point usurp their Function? <hi>Moses</hi> hath long since
put terrour in the case, when with a Propheticall spirit praying
for <hi>Levi,</hi> he saith, <hi>Smite thorow the loyns of them that rise up against
him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 11.</note> And the Prophet likewise, where speaking of the Church,
he saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 54. 17.</note> 
               <hi>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every
tongue that crieth against thee in Judgement, thou shalt condemn:</hi>
And our Saviour himself, where he saith to his Apostles, <hi>What ye
binde on earth, shall be bound in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Caution to be observed, is, That in accommodating
Church-Government to the frame and occasion of the State, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be disestablished or unsetled, that seems to have been setled
by any authority of the Scripture. Therefore whereas we see
there, the Government of the Church first setled, in the hands of
Bishops (that is, of Pastors that had authority over Pastors, <hi>To
rebuke with all authority:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 15.</note>

Church, and also of the Spirit of God revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>For as in the change of the Sabbath from the Saturday to the
Lords Day, the Church hath clearly shown that she had power to
make such a change; but that change being once made for impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
causes, the like whereof hereafter can never happen, that
power of hers once lawfully used, can never lawfully come to be
used again, because there can no more such ground and cause to
do it, come again to passe; So it is likewise in point of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Government; though the whole form and frame of it is not
so expressely prescribed, but that the Church may, in many things,
have power of making therein accommodations to the times
and exigence of State; yet may not those acts of accommodation
amount to such a height, as to subvert or abolish the Government
which by the iudgement of her Members than infallible was set on
foot, because no judgement of her present Members now, can
come in any competition with her first: And if any State shall so
accommodate it self, the accommodators may, perhaps, be found
fighters against the Spirit of God, manifested both in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in the Judgement and practice of the Universall Church
of God.</p>
            <p>One further particular depending upon these points, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for every one to have his conscience clear and well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is the lawfulnesse of the Liturgie of our Church, concerning
which, these considerations present themselves.</p>
            <p>The Church being freed from the tyranny of the Heathen perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
and setled in peace, it was necessary that God (<hi>that had
done so great things for her</hi>) should be honored, not onely by the
private devotion of her single Members, but also with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
service of her greatest Congregation; And seeing that in the
Church <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (ever since Christianity) becoming inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
without walls, occasions the making of as many places of
Worship, as there are places of severall cohabitation; it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
both for observing decency and order, for avoiding confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and for shewing (by asmuch unity of way as might be) the
unanimity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and true communion of the Churches members; that
thorowout all her severall Congregations (at least, all of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100497:11"/>
one Form of Divine Service should universally be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Hence have the Western Churches (where Religion flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most and longest) received much what one Form perhaps not
all at once, nor alwayes the very same, but with some addition or
change, as use and experience gave occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> (corrupting with her greatnesse) suffered not the service
of God to be exempt from her corruptions; and growing at length
so licentious in them, as even to subvert the Fundamentalls of
Religion; It pleased God in divers parts, so farre to enlighten
and strengthen his Church, as to examine the <hi>Romane</hi> alterations
by the <hi>Test</hi> of Gods Word, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> having
more happily than others performed, reiected what was repugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to Gods Word, and wisely retaining the rest, left us that
Form of Divine Service, that unto this day, by the Laws of
this Kingdome, is advisedly confirmed in the Church.</p>
            <p>In this our restored Liturgie, the long practised judgement
of the Church (regarding one way the property of devotion, and
another the infirmity of man) thought it fitting not to have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
preaching, and thanksgiving alone, without the publique
reading also of the very Word of God; neither thought they it
fit that the Confessions of sins, Supplications and Thanksgivings
that publikely were to be made, should all at once in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
exercise be performed, lest happily in many, devotion want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter of present excitation, should wax cold, and then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the minde growing remisse, and the thoughts wandring,
men in spight of their hearts should with their lips onely, perform
an empty mock-God service.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that the whole service of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be truely publikely performed with true communion,
and likewise with true and lively fervour of spirit, they ordained
such change and succession of all duties belonging to Gods service,
as might best make those severall duties most effectuall to the
performers.</p>
            <p>First therefore, That the Congregation observing one and the
same demeanour thorowout all her Members, should upon their
knees, with loud voyces, and articular Confessions, make an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and publike and acknowledgement of their sins, and vile
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100497:11"/>
dition, and beseech God for mercy and forgivenesse; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
for the comfort of the penitent, to pronounce Gods pronesse
to forgive, and to pray for them, and with them.</p>
            <p>That after their humiliation they should with Hymnes of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
exhortation taken out of Scripture, stirre up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to proceed to praise, to singing and rejoycing before God.</p>
            <p>Then some portions of the Scripture should be read in course,
of which, the Psalms should ever be part, which because they
contain matter so abundantly usefull for instruction, for meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for comfort, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, they should
therefore be read alternally betwixt the Minister and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to make them in publique more fervent in the prayers and
praises wherewith the Psalms abound, and to make them also more
perfect in the Contents of them for their private use; then as
Gods works (especially of man Redemption) <hi>are so done as that
they ought to be had in remembrance,</hi> so on Sundayes, and other
dayes of especiall Commemoration of them,<note place="margin">Psal. 111. 4</note> such portions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as tended most to the setting forth of Gods work on
that day annually commemorated, should be read; at the end of
which, the Congregation (as moved by the impressions which
these portions ought to make in every one) to render God that
praise, that glory and blessing which the sense of his mercy in his
work then declared, doth justly procure from the heart and
mouth of the thankfull hearer; and this they do in Hymnes either
taken out of Scripture, or composed and allowed by the ancient
and generall approbation of the Church.</p>
            <p>After the Lessons of Scripture and Hymnes ended, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to stand up, and make a publique confession of their faith,
and then prostrate on their knees in prayers fitted to the divers
necessities and infirmities of humane nature, to make supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for all sorts, degrees, and conditions of men; in which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
should not alwayes himself alone utter the words of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but (for the better entertainment and incitement of devotion)
every Member of the Congregation, with frequent interjecting of
their Votes and Invocations, should like more active parties in
Gods service make a more frequent and effectuall joynt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100497:12"/>
Then (after an especiall prayer for grace and sanctification) the
two Tables of Commandments to be read, which summarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our whole duty both to God and man, the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conscious of the breach of every one of them, should at the
reading of each Commandment, cry out for mercy for their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and implore grace for the betcer observing of it in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And that done, some choice portions of Scripture of espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
comfort and instruction, and more especially relating to
the work of Redemption that day commemorated, taken
out of the Epistles of the Apostles, and the Gospel of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
to be read, with which (unlesse the Communion be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
the Word preached, or an Homily read) the publique ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church to be concluded with certain prayers, and with
the Ministers blessing of the people.</p>
            <p>How well this Ordinance provides for offering unto God
the reasonable service of man, we must leave unto the consciences
of every man. As for the exceptions that are made against it,
they are chiefly these: First, in generall, That it is popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
Antichristian, (a charge which is very foul, if true) then in
particular, That it is in a set Form.</p>
            <p>Now first to be popish, is no more than to partake of the
Manners, Customes, or Ordinances of the Popes, which when in
plain tearms it is not forbidden in the Scripture, we must
seek how it it comes to passe, that to partake of them must be
unlawfull.</p>
            <p>The Popes (briefly) were the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which the
formost having both for life and doctrine been glorious members
of the Church, that Church grew so renowned, as that for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of Religion, they had the priority of repute,
were to the Western Church the authors of many good Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Religion, and the great support thereof; till abusing their
repute, and by little and little degenerating, they grew into so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as no intelligent man may partake in those
things with them, without a conscious committing of manifest sin
against the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Now though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir corruptions are by all means to be rejected,
yet are they not therefore corrupt, or to be rejected because they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100497:12"/>
were the acts of Popes, but because they were things which the
Popes acted contrary to the Word of God; so as repugnancy to
Gods Word being the true and onely ground of their unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we can reckon them no further unlawfull than that ground
or reason will demonstrate: and we may no more for respect of
persons (be they Popes or whatsoever) call <hi>good evill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 20.</note> or <hi>evill good,</hi>
then we may for respect of persons break the Commandments of
God; Nor is it more to be abhorred as a popish corruption to use
the Ordinances of Popes, which are not wicked Ordinances in
themselves, than blessing the people of in the words wherewith
<hi>Balaam</hi> blessed them, is to be abhorred as a <hi>Balaamish</hi> corruption;
for when by the names of Popish, Jewish, Heathenish, &amp;c. we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
any thing, we all intend that the thing condemned is of
the nature of those things wherein they were especially corrupt,
and not of the nature of their doings, which were neither good
nor evill, and much lesse of the nature of those wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
So as to be popish simply being no argument of necessary
faultinesse, we must see whether our Liturgie partakes of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
corruption or no.</p>
            <p>To come readily to the matter, when in all the whole Frame
of our Liturgie there is no Worship nor Innovation, but of the
true God onely; neither is he worshipped any other way, than
by the sole and immediate mediation of our Lord and Saviour
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> there first can be no Idolatrous corruption in the
Liturgie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It cannot be Antichristian, because that contrary
to the proper work of Antichrist (which is to <hi>to deny the Son and
the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh 2. 22.</note> and as God <hi>in the Temple of God, to exalt himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that is called God</hi>) the Liturgie thorowout the whole
course thereof,<note place="margin">2 Thessal. 2. 4.</note> makes an exact acknowledgement, adoration, and
exaltation above all things whatsoever; and as it acknowledges
them in profession, so there is not any thing in it, whereby they are
denyed in practice; So as to call it Antichristian is a malicious
slander against the clear truth examined by the Light and Rule of
Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It cannot be superstitious neither; for howsoever in the
performance of it there may be some few Ceremonies brought in,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100497:13"/>
which rightly weighed, do perhaps conduce more to worldly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
and ostentation in Religion, than to true and necessary
religious decency and reverence, and therefore would be laid
down, yet being things otherwise indifferent, introduced for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
onely, and not pressed as things of any other necessity, they
can (at the worst) be but errours of Judgement, mistaking what
is decent and orderly, they cannot be superstitious, seeing they are
not made matters of Religion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40.</note> but of decency and order, without
which, nothing ought to be done.</p>
            <p>When then, according to true understanding and intention, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is meant popish, but what partakes of the superstitious corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of the Popes, the Liturgy of the English Church must needs
be acquit and discharged, not onely of the infamous calumny of
being Idolatrous, Antichristian, and suspicious, but even also
of that malicious aspersion of popish; And then it will follow,
That the censures of those sinners against their own souls, who in
and for these things do falsly judge, censure, and condemn their
Mother Church, and renounce obedience to her, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with her, because, as they suppose, she is popish, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
idolatrous, Antichristian; their unjust censures (I say) will
prove the condemnation of themselves, both of uncharitablenesse,
of self-conceit, and of insolent exalting themselves against the
Church of God at least, if not of Antichristian persecution of it
also; and the more for this, That while they promise liberty and
freedome from superstition, they themselves become slaves unto
superstition, making a matter of Religion not to obey the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their Church in things indifferent, and where the Word
of God doth not forbid obedience, but command it. This briefly
touching the generall exceptions, Popish, Superstitious, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
Antichristian.</p>
            <p>As for the particular exception, That in our Liturgy all
prayer, praise, and thanksgiving is in a set Form, a device of mans,
not the command of God; a muzling of the Ministers spirit, a
nurse of idlenesse, and means of neglecting the gifts and graces
of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We must consider, 1. That there is not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Scripture against set Forms of prayer, and therefore the use
of it is not against any expresse command of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100497:13"/>
2. All Christian Churches thorowout the world, as well the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> (where Popery never raigned) as these our
Western Churches when once they attained a setled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have in all ages served God in set Forms of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
yea, even the reformed Churches beyond Sea use some set
Forms. And for our set Liturgy, if any man lift to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
against it, we can truely say, It is <hi>the Custome of our Church,</hi>
and also of <hi>the Churches of God;</hi> and then the depravers of it
will prove to be despisers of Authority, and advancers of their
own private judgement against the Universall Judgment of the
Church Catholique.</p>
            <p>3 Under the Law there were set Forms of publike Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Thanksgivings, Blessings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being no part of
the Ceremoniall, is warrant enough for Christians to use the
like.</p>
            <p>4. The Psalms of <hi>David</hi> (which as they abound with all those
necessary parts of Gods publike service, confession of sins, prayers,
Praise and Thanksgiving, so especially with Prayer) many of
them having that Title (<hi>A Prayer</hi>) they were not onely used
publikely by both the Jewes Church and the Christians, but were
penned to that end, and dedicated to the Priests that had the
Office of praising God, and were most excellent in those kindes
of Musick to which they were set, and the most excellent passages
of praise and prayer in them had the word <hi>Selah</hi> added to
them, to the end that in the publike use of them, those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
might be iterated, and said or sung over again. Also
our Saviour himself having given us one Form of set Prayer
(which he bids, <hi>When ye pray, Say</hi>) and not at all forbidden
the use of set Forms, makes it out of question, that to
pray in a given Form is lawfull (so the Form be good)
And what doubt we but when <hi>John Baptist</hi> taught his
Disciples to pray, he did it by giving them some Form,
which our Saviours Apostles liking, desired to have the like
from him, and our Saviour (we see) did not so much give
them Precepts and Rules, instructing them how to make prayers
of their own (though his Prayer hath that office too) but gave
them a perfect prayer in an exact conceived Form, how much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100497:14"/>
should men fear that their conscience (offended at the use of set
prayer, without the Light of Gods Word declaring it to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
are consciences blinded with superstition, afraid where no fear
is, and their consciences not onely darkened, but their hearts also
seduced with self-conceit and singularity, unto perverse and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
contention with the Church.</p>
            <p>5. While they pretend to be free Ministers from a supposed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
put upon their spirits by the use of set Forms, they lay a
reall restraint upon the spirits of all Congregations; who being
always perfect in the Contents and use of their set prayers, do with
prepared hearts and spirits attend the publike and joynt present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their known supplications to God for those mercies and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which the Church, by those Forms, declares all men to stand in
need of, and every ones particular spirit attesteth to be necessary
for him: But if all Congregations (which God forbid) should be
deprived of the use of them, every man shall go to Church bound
in the spirit, and know not what supplications he shall make to
God, till the mouth of the Minister shall declare it, and then the
single Minister (whatsoever his gifts or faculties be) shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the devotion of the whole Congregation, and conclude
them all, that they shall make no publike Invocation of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for matter nor form, otherwise than as his spirit, and perhaps
sudden conceit, shall minister unto him.</p>
            <p>6. When all the Service of the Church shall stand onely upon
the strength and gifts of the Preachers, and they differing in gifts
one from another, it will inevitably follow, That those of the
best gifts will more draw disciples after them than ever, and men
will become followers of men, when they shall have no other
means of publike communion with God, either to hear him, or to
speak unto him, than onely by the gifts of the Preacher, and so the
Church shall, against Gods Word, be necessarily drawn into Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
and Division.</p>
            <p>7. Lastly, If we change our set Forms of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vine Worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the various and arbitrary service that is to be performed by the
Minister onely, among many evills (not now to be foreseen) there
is to be feared, that when men shall have known no other publike
exercise of Religion, than by the Preachers arbitrary administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100497:14"/>
and that he be generally beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld, as the onely Minister of the
spirit, of publike service and prayer, the consciences of men thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
subdued to an awfull dependance on him, shall finde the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
(like the Jesuites) through the Soveraignty they hold in
matters of Religion, to exercise an externall dominion over their
fortunes also, and set on foot a more dangerous tyranny in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than hitherto the Church hath ever known. And if their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to set Forms of publike Service, and to what is used in
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall proceed so far, as to reject the publike
reading of the Scripture (eight severall Lessons or portions of
which are now,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Two in the Psalmes, two in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, two in the new, and two out of the Epistles and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels.</note> by Gods mercifull providence, dayly, or at least
every Sunday and holy-day, publikely read in the Church) then
shall our Church of <hi>England,</hi> by an ill-guided meaning to oppose
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> come to imitate her, and towards her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
commit the same cruelty that we justly condemn the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> for using towards hers; who though she suffer her Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
to hear the Word preached, yet suffers them not to hear in
their own Tongue the powerfull Word of God read unto them;
and we, as well as the Romanists, shall (toward those that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or are carelesse to reade) even wholly take away the means
which our pious Mother the Church hath ordained for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
And whereas such publike reading of Gods lively and
powerfull Word is no mean degree of Preaching, we shall, in an
important part, suppresse the Word of God, and through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
of frequent hearing, breed a generall unacquaintednesse with
the Precepts and Stories of the Scripture, which will in time hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both the understanding and applying of that which shall be
preached.</p>
            <p>We need not further seek to give particular answer to every
quarrell that is now made against severall parts and passages of
our Liturgy. But when kneeling at the receit of the Sacrament
is so agreeable to the religious performance of that Duty, and
yet is quarrelled with, we cannot in silence passe it over: For
when want of due preparation is dangerous, yet is not performed
without humiliation, contrition, abhorring ones self, forgiving
others, turning to them in all charitable affections, thirsting for
grace, and fervent invocation of the Divine Majesty for them;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100497:15"/>
how can we perform these rightly, without the lowliest prostrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of soul and body that one can solicite God withall? Will we
say, It should be done before, but not at our receiving? It is
true, it ought to be begun before, but he that can so approve of
his preparation before, as to cease and say, I have done enough, he
is rather to fear his presumption, than to rest in such preparation,
he perhaps makes a popish <hi>opus operatum,</hi> of his preparation, and
cries peace, before there is peace; nor can he say kneeling is an
unfit posture to receive that grace in, which is fittest to be begged
on our knees. Will we say kneeling is Idolatry to the Bread
and Wine? We must then shew that it is commanded to be done
to the Bread and Wine, or intended so, or at least, by Protestants
abused so, if none of those be, but it be commanded only as the
proper expression of the reverence and humiliation belonging
to the duty, then is the exception not onely without cause, but
slanderous and malicious. Will we say, That in the Institution
of it, our Saviour made not the disciples kneel; True, but let
us also confesse that the disciples had the <hi>Bride-groom with them;</hi>
who, though he were their Lord, yet called them friends, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to a liberty sutable. We will not (I am sure) say
the Sacrament is now to be celebrated in all things as it was then,
and no otherwise; and if in any thing there be liberty of receding
from what was done at first, whose judgement shall we trust what
we must hold, and what we may recede from, if not the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Practice of the Universall Church from the first to this
present? And if indeed we would observe the first Institution,
Why spurn we at receiving it together at the Table, for so the
the disciples did? And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the partaking of the Table
of the Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 21.</note> and <hi>David, The preparing of a Table for us:</hi> Truely
the receiving every one, or every family apart by themselves in
their seats,<note place="margin">Psal. 23.</note> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uits not with observing of Communion, nor coming
together to eat, nor eating together into one Body, but savours of
singularity and inconformablenesse to the observance of a true
Eucharist.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expected we should here examine all the dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Religion that are among us. But seeing that in generall
they are the quarrells of particular men for exercise of Religion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100497:15"/>
in wayes either besides, or contrary to the established Ordinances
and usage of our Church (in which yet they can neither charge
the Church, with violating the Word of God, nor shew by the
judgement of the Church Catholike, that their own exercise of
Religion is that which by the Word of God, is only to be taught
and practised;) It will not be unnecessary, to represent to further
search and consideration, how much some passages of Gods Word
(too little examined by us) are pertinent to the decision of these
matters.</p>
            <p>For, Whereas true Christianity is a perfect Catholicisme, and
contrarily Antichristianisme, or fighting against God, walks in
singularities, partialities, sects, separations, and the like. It is
too apparant, that the wayes wherein men now pretend, that the
true exercise of Religion lyeth, do very much hold the byasse of
Sectarisme; who sees it not in our extraordinary running after
choice and affected Teachers? In which, though the shew of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
so awes our judgements, that we distrust no errour in it;
yet does it concern us to take heed of a deceiveablenesse of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
in it. To love, desire, and seek, the lively delivery of
Gods Word, is good, and our duty, and so is it also to love, and
honour the Preacher for the Words sake. But there is great danger
in the comparing, preferring, and despising of one, in respect of
another; For while we assume the judgement, and choice of our
Teachers, and hear, and follow them according as we like their
Doctrine, and no otherwise: We under the shew of godly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Gods Word, and honouring the choice Preachers of
it, discover an hidden exaltation of our selves, and of our
own mindes, and judgements, both above the Preachers, and the
Word they preach.</p>
            <p>On the other side toward the Ordinance of the Church, and
our proper Ministers, we do not only unduely exalt our selves,
but adde unto it disobedience; yea, even a faulting of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
we make our own <hi>Jordans,</hi> too shallow brooks to cleanse
our Leprosies.<note place="margin">Io. 9. 7.</note> Our <hi>Siloams</hi> that are sent; too unclean pooles to
help our blindnesse:<note place="margin">Isai. 8. 5.</note> Yea, and we refuse the waters of <hi>Shiloah</hi>
for no other reason, then that, they runne softly; We choose our
selves streams to our liking, which like the Rivers of <hi>Damascus</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100497:16"/>
must be better waters, and of more approved depth and current.
Every one must follow his <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 11.</note> his <hi>Apollo,</hi> his <hi>Cephas,</hi> his <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as our selves encline to these wayes, so have we Teachers
that cherish that inclination in us, and finde it no small advantage
to them, that by applying themselves to the present affectations of
men, they can so draw Disciples after them. For the effecting of
which, Though <hi>the weak in faith,</hi> ought not to be <hi>received to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disputations;</hi> yet they, making no difference between strong
and weak, School and Pulpit, Governours and private Men, do
unto their vulgar Auditories (who, they know have neither
capacity to judge, nor authority to reform) frequently preach
their own apprehensions concerning the Government of the
Church, and the right exercise of Religion, not only in things
apparent, and agreed on, but even in things which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have lately questioned, and drawn in doubt, whether they
be right or no. By which means, private presumption, insolence,
self-conceipt, disdain, uncharitablenesse, and disobedience (sins
most incompatible with true Religion) are grown so great and
generall, as that they are become like an Epidemick contagion,
putting all men in a maze, what shall be the end and consequence
of them. Of which when we cannot have a greater admonition,
then where the Spirit of God sets forth the last and perilous times
of the Church; It is not amisse to summe up into one entire view,
what it is, that the Holy Ghost doth there admonish us of.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour himself first warnes the Church, <hi>to beware of
false prophets, that come</hi> (saith he) <hi>in sheeps cloathing, but inwardly
are ravening Woolves.</hi> Whom that we may know he gives a rule,
<hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits,</hi> and in another place, <hi>by their works:</hi>
Where we must note, the fruits and works, are to be taken, as they
are in themselves, and as they are naturally taken notice of in all
mens understandings; otherwise we make our Saviour teach,
<hi>ignotum per ignotius.</hi> It is true, that in every fruit and work that is
good in it self, if an evill circumstance, or way, or end, accompany
it, the fruit that was good in it self, may by way, or end, be made
evill, as if mercy, charity, zeal, &amp;c. be shewed for ostentation,
or for a cloak of pretence, &amp;c. But in evill fruits, and works, it
is other wise, for no end, or circumstance whatsoever, can make
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100497:16"/>
that work good, that is evill in it self, as disobedience, sedition,
treason, &amp;c. For God <hi>having no need of a wicked man,</hi> and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us, <hi>Thou shalt not do evill, that good may come thereon,</hi> he takes
from evill works all the help that their good end, or circumstances
may do them. When therefore we finde a deed, that in it self is
evill, we must not make that good, for the good end, or good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the doer; but contrarily, we must make him a misdoer,
notwithstanding the good end and intent of the action. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
further reveals, That <hi>many shall come in his name, and shall
deceive many;</hi> the manner of whose coming, he intimates to be by
way of secret insinuation <hi>here in the Chamber,</hi> or by way of sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>there in the Wildernesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 29. 30</note> 
               <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>gives warning of the
like false Teachers, and tells the Pastours of the Church,</hi> Of your
own selves shall men arise, preaching perverse things, to draw away
Disciples after them.<note place="margin">2 Thessal. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>In the second of the</hi> Thessalonians, <hi>he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells
of a</hi> falling away, <hi>and of the</hi> revealing of the man of sinne that
exalteth himself above all that is called God, or worshipped; <hi>whose
coming he shews to be after the</hi> working of Satan, with all power,
and signes, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveablenesse of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse.
<note place="margin">1 Tim 3 2</note> 
               <hi>Again in the first of</hi> Timothy, <hi>he foretells a</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of some from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and that
speak lies in hypocrisie, forbidding marriage, and meats. <hi>In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of</hi> Timothy,<note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he declares that in the last dayes,</hi> perilous times
shall come, <hi>the perilousnesse of which he shews to be in this, That</hi>
men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, truce-breakers,
false-accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of the good, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
heady, high minded, &amp;c. having a form of godlinesse, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the power thereof, &amp;c. Of which sort are they that creep into
houses, and lead captive silly women, laden with divers lusts, ever
learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <hi>And
lastly, That</hi> the time would come, when they would not endure sound
Doctrine, but after their own lusts, heap to themselves Teachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint</hi> Peter <hi>forewarneth also of false Teachers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>shewing that
they should</hi> privily bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord
that bought them; <hi>and an especiall description of whom, he maketh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100497:17"/>
in this, that they</hi> despise Government, are presumptuous, self willed,
and not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint</hi> John <hi>tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 19</note> 
               <hi>That as</hi> we have heard that Antichrist
shall come, even now there are many Antichrists. <hi>And them he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers
by their inconformity, and disobedience.</hi> They went out
from us (<hi>saith he</hi>) but are not of us, for if they had been of us, they
would have continued with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. Iude 4.</note> 
               <hi>Saint</hi> Iude <hi>in his generall Epistle, warneth the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Church of men of like singularities, noted by this, that</hi> they
creep in unawares, that they despise dominion, and speak evill of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
that they speak evill of those things they understand not, that
they go the wayes of <hi>Cain,</hi> and runne greedily after the errour of <hi>Balam</hi>
for reward, and perish in the gain saying of <hi>Core, (as much as to say,
men of unbrotherlike affections, seekers of their own gain, and
disobedient to their Superiours;) further, that they</hi> are murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
complainers, walking after their own lusts, speaking swelling
words, having mens persons in admiration for advantage; <hi>And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That they be</hi> they that seperate themselves.</p>
            <p>What have we in this, but an entire description of the whole
practice of the spirit of errour, and of adversation to Christianity,
which the Scripture calleth <hi>Antichrists.</hi> By which, sinne (that
through the light of the Gospel was subdued, and deprived of his
first and naturall Empire, consisting in the viciousnesse of corrupt
nature) turning himself unto his Artes, like the divell into an
Angel of light, does now with refined and mysterious falsities,
(such as resemble Piety, and true Religion) renew his onsets in a
warfare of a more dangerous consequence; so various and (in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance)
so contrary often to sinne, as puts the strongest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to the use of all his <hi>Armour of righteousnesse, as well on the right
hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thes. 2. 3, and 8.</note> 
               <hi>as on the left,</hi> to be able to withstand him.</p>
            <p>This Antichristianisme is here represented to us in a twofold
form. The first an Empire of mysterious sinne; A body of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
well united together under one head, or Soveraigne, set forth
one while by the names of the <hi>Man of sinne, The sonne of perdition,
The wicked one;</hi> Another while by the name of <hi>Babylon the great,
The mother of fornications, The greatwhore, &amp;c.</hi> The description
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100497:17"/>
of which Empire is in such Characters, as marveilously sureth with
the Roman Papacy.</p>
            <p>The other form of mysterious wickednesse is, of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
nature. A loose Anarchy of singulars, of men by themselves,
not united together in one by any common Bond of true Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
but (like quicksands cast together, by the working of the
Sea, and from time to time shifted and changed with it) so they,
as judgements, private ends, or affections do concur, are brought
accidentally to a concurrence among themselves, but without any
ground, or sollid principle of uniting. For though they seem to
put on the Yoak of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet every one keeps the Bonds of the
yoak in his own hands, and is the Soveraign Arbiter of his own
obedience. Notwithstanding which contrariety of theirs to the
Roman Church (who abuses obedience as these do liberty) they
are no other then derivatives of the same spirit of errour, begot
by way of opposition, on her that is <hi>the mother of fornications.</hi> Who
having against the manifest Word of God usurped a tyrannicall
soveraignty both over Gods Word, his Church, and all the Princes
of his Church, and being beaten from it, the divell instead of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the rule, that he held by her Monarchall tyranny, changes only
his vicegerent, and continues the same usurpation in a popular, and
Anarchall way; that is, by the hands of every particular man, or
number of men, who (abusing the example of rejection of her
usurped authority) shall invade and reject all authority how law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
soever established in the Church. Both are opposers of <hi>Christs</hi>
Doctrine, both usurpers of the authority of his Church; both
hiding their usurpation under a form of godlinesse; they differ
but in this, Men in the one, partake only of the iniquity by influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the head; but in the other, every distinct member, is
the originall Author of it to himself.</p>
            <p>We finding then such an alarme in the Scripture blown against
perverse, and self-led professors of Religion, set forth unto us by
such Characters,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as <hi>Wolves, Foll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>cursed children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. Iude 11.</note> and the like; Notwithstanding that they have <hi>sheeps
cloathing, forms of godlinesse, and fained words</hi> to cover them. It
remains, that we strictly examine what fruits, or works, have
passed our hands, which in their common and naturall acceptation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100497:18"/>
are evill, though brought forth for good ends, and that we utterly
relinquish them, that we take heed of wayes of singularity, that
lead to <hi>false accusation, trayterousnesse, headynesse, high-mindednesse,
and denying of the power of godlinesse;</hi> That we take heed of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of those <hi>that draw disciples after them,</hi> That <hi>creep into hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
That <hi>go out from the fellowship of the Apostles, and continue not
with them,</hi> That <hi>follow the wayes of Cains</hi> uncharitablenesse, of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi>
prophesying for lucre, or of <hi>Corabs</hi> disobedience; That we
take heed of those that <hi>despise Government, Are presumptuous, self-willed,
not afraid to speak evill of dignities, that despise dominion,
have mens persons in admiration because of advantage,</hi> That <hi>heap to
themselves Teachers,</hi> That <hi>separate themselves.</hi> And lastly, That
while we justly hate Popery, we do not in any thing partake of
that sinne of the Popes which made him that hatefull Apostate,
and mysticall enemy of the Church, namely, That we do not, by
assuming into a wrong hand any power or authority which God
hath by his Word committed to the Body of the Pastors of his
Church onely, rob him of his rightfull Jurisdiction, as they that
have invaded his <hi>Tythes and Offerings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8.</note>
