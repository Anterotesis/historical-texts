         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been the univerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Earth (Mankinde)
to be overſpread with a black
Cloud of darkneſſe; and the
knowledge of the King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
hath been manifeſted
but in ſome few ſcattered ones,
which as they haue had the
ſpring in themſelves, ſo they have been as lights in the
dark world, and others have walked in their light,
and reſted content to drink of their ſtreams, as if
their declaration of truth had been the very Fountain
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I my ſelf have known nothing but what I received
by tradition from the mouths and pen of others: I
worſhipped a God, but I neither knew who he was, nor
where he was, ſo that I lived in the dark, being blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the imagination of my fleſh, and by the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch as ſtand up to teach the people to know the
Lord, and yet have no knowledge of the Lord them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but as they have received by hearſay, from
their books, and other mens words.</p>
            <p>I ſpoke of the name of God, and Lord, and Chriſt,
but I knew not this Lord, God, and Chriſt; I prayed
to a God, but I knew not where he was, nor what he
<pb facs="tcp:119616:3"/>
was, and ſo walking by imagination, I worſhipped
that devill, and called him God; by reaſon whereof
my comforts were often ſhaken to pieces, and at laſt it
was ſhewed to me, That while I builded upon any
words or writings of other men, or while I looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a God without me, I did but build upon the ſand,
and as yet I knew not the Rock.</p>
            <p>And now know friends, That this ignorant, unſettled
condition is yours at this time, though I know, that
the proud King fleſh that is in you, will be ready to
ſpeak within you, and tell you, that you do know God,
and Chriſt, and be offended with me, becauſe I ſay you
know him not. I do not write any thing, as to be a
teacher of you, for I know you have a teacher within
your ſelves (which is the Spirit) and when your <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſh
is made ſubject to him, he will teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance, ſo that you
ſhall not need to run after men for inſtruction, for
your eyes being opened; you ſhall ſee the King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
ſit upon the throne within your ſelves,
judging and condemning the unrighteouſneſſe of the
fleſh, filling your face with ſhame, and your ſoul with
horror, though no man ſee, or be acquainted with
your actions, or thoughts but your ſelves, and juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your righteous thoughts and actions, and lead you
into all wayes of truth.</p>
            <p>And this is the Spirit, or Father, which as he
made the Globe, and every creature, ſo he dwels in
every creature, but ſupreamly in Man; and he it is
by whom every one lives, and moves, and hath his
being; perfect man is the eye and face, that ſees and
declares the Father, and he is perfect when he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into this ſpirit, and lives in the light of reaſon;
and there is no man or woman can ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth not dwell in him, for he is every where;
<pb facs="tcp:119616:3"/>
there is no a creature in the compaſſe of the creation,
but he is in that creature, but diſobedient man knows
him not, and why? Becauſe fleſh is not ſubject to
the ſpirit within it; his covetous fleſh hath deceived
him, for he either looks abroad for a God, and ſo doth
imagine and fancie a God to be in ſome particular
place of glory, beyond the skies, or ſome where he
knows not, or in ſome place of glory that cannot be
known till the body be laid in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Or elſe if men do look for a God within them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Record ſpeaks, God is within you;
yet they are led by the motions and commands of
King fleſh within them, and not by King ſpirit; and
here they are at a loſſe, not being able to diſtinguiſh
between fleſh and ſpirit, by reaſon that covetouſneſſe
and ſelf-will blindes their eyes. Truly friends, King
fleſh is very covetous, ſelf-loving, and ſelf-honouring;
it likes them that ſay as it ſaith, but it would impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
kill, and hang every one that differs from him;
he is full of heart-burning, either of open envy, and
bitter diſtemper, or elſe carries himſelf in a ſmooth,
quiet way of hypocriſie, walking in a ſhew of truth,
like an Angell of light, but when he gets an opportune
power, he turns to be a tyrant, againſt the way of the
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And ſo all his love was but for by-ends, to ſatisfie
ſelf in ſome particular or other: But now the King
of righteouſneſſe within you, is a meek, patient, and
quiet ſpirit, and full of love and ſincerity, he burns
up the proud and haſty fleſh, he loves truth, and
hates a lie; if the creature acts unrighteouſly, he
checks and ſhames him, if he act righteouſly (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the creation of a man) he ſpeaks peace within,
and ſo makes the man to walk ſincerely, and warily.</p>
            <p>And when you come to know, feel, and ſee that the
<pb facs="tcp:119616:4"/>
ſpirit of righteouſneſs governs your fleſh, then you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to know your God, to fear your God, to love your
God, and to walk humbly before your God, and ſo to
rejoyce in him; and therefore if you would have the
peace of God (as you call it) you muſt know what
God it is you ſerve, which is not a God without you,
viſible among bodies, but the ſpirit within you, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in every body to the eye of fleſh, yet diſcernable to
the eye of the ſpirit; and when ſouls are made to
have community with that ſpirit, then they have
peace, and not till then.</p>
            <p>For this let me tell you, that if you ſubject your
fleſh to this mighty governour, the ſpirit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
within your ſelves, he will bring you into
community with the whole Globe, ſo that in time you
ſhall come to know as you are known, and you ſhall
not need to run after others, to learn of them what
God is, for as you are a perfect creation, every one of
himſelf; ſo you ſhall ſee, and feel that this ſpirit is
the great governour in you, in righteouſneſs; and
when you come thus to know the truth, the truth ſhall
make you free from the bondage of covetous, and
proud fleſh, the Serpent that held you under ſlavery
all your life time. Well, as darkneſs hath overſpread
the Earth (Mankinde) ſo now is the time come,
that knowledge ſhall abound, and cover the earth
(Mankinde) light begins to ariſe, the spirit
begins to appear in fleſh, he spreads himſelf in his
ſons and daughters, ſo that as the Sun ſhines from
Eaſt to Weſt, ſo ſhall the appearing of this Son of
righteouſneſs he; he comes not now in corners, but
openly; the poor receive the Gospel, (which is this
everlaſting spirit) wiſe men in the fleſh are made
fools, fools are made wiſe, ſcholars are declared to
be ignorant, the ignorant ones in mens learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:119616:4"/>
abundantly learned in the experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I do not write to teach, I only declare what I know,
you may teach me, for you have the fountain of life in
you as well as I, and therefore he is called the Lord,
becauſe he rules not in one, but in everyone through the
globe, and ſo we being many, are knit together into one
body, &amp; are to be made all of one heart, and one minde,
by that one spirit that enlightens every man. I have
yeelded to let theſe few experiences come abroad,
and partly unwilling, becauſe I ſee more clearly into
theſe ſecrets then before I writ them, which teaches
me to rejoyce in ſilence, to ſee the Father ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
at work; and it ſhall ceaſe speedily for men
to ſtand up as they do to teach one another, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſhall be taught of him, and I ſhall be as ready
to hear as to ſpeak, and to give as to receive, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one delighting to do as they would be done unto.</p>
            <p>This is the King of righteouſneſs that ſhall raign
in the earth, this is the ſpirit that is now pouring out
upon ſons and daughters; though it yet ſeem ſmall,
it ſhall ſpeedily increaſe, and the Father will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
that day of ſmall things; proud fleſh ſhall die,
and raign King and governour in man no longer:
they that have underſtanding know what I ſay, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may reproach, and be offended, but after they
have been tryed in the fire, which is the spirit, they
will acknowledge a truth herein, and he made to
speak as a friend to truth.</p>

God ſpeaks to the capacity of men, and

ſhall never ceaſe;<note place="margin">Iſa. 54. 13.</note> Gods teaching differs
from men very much,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 45.</note> for men ſpeak
words to the ear, but God works out the
ſerpent and works himſelf into a man,
and ſo gives words of a feeling experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the heart, and cauſes the man to
ſee light in Gods light; as thus, I have been
proud envious and diſcontent, and I have
heard words from men againſt theſe, yet
in thoſe dayes I thought I was good, and
I knew not thoſe evils; but when God
came, and wrought humility, love, and
contentedneſs in me, he then taught me
to ſee, and know by experience what the
ſtrength of God in me is, which is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
love, and patience, which hath
thrown down the ſtrength of the ſerpent,
which was pride envy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſcontent:
And this teaching of God I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 63.</note> it ſticks lively in me, though the

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ords of men are forgotten by me: and
thus God takes up the ſoul more and

much ſweetneſs in feeling, ſeeing, and

working, dwelling, and ruling in him;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119616:7"/>
this is Gods teaching,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note> in making men to

for the ſoul ſhall ever be learning
what God is, and ſhal be more &amp; more fed
with this his teaching; and as the divine

the teachings of God in a ſoul ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 17.</note>
with<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

is GODS teaching.</p>
               <p>And without Gods teachings in this
kinde,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 45.</note> all the teachings of men will do no
good,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> for hence it is that there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hypocrites amongſt Profeſſors,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 27.</note> they
know much in the letter,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> as men teaches
them; but they know nothing in ſpiritual
power, which is the way that God teaches.
And truly let me tell you, if this power of
God be wanting, you will feel an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
in you to give way to every evil
action, when a temptation thereunto is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you; for though a man know from
the letter, that iniuſtice, covetouſneſs, raſh
anger, hardneſs of heart toward others,
and uncleanneſs of the fleſh are evil; and
that the wrath of God will break forth
upon ſuch as commit ſuch and ſuch evils.</p>
               <p>And though he know likewiſe from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119616:8"/>
letter,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> that Juſtice, Faith, Meekneſſe, and
tenderneſſe of ſpirit, holineſſe and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
are good, yet this very man will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> nay ſtrongly drawn by the powers of
his fleſh to do the evill, and refuſe the
good, unleſſe the powers of God be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in him, and be his keeper: As
thus, The power of juſtice delivering him
from the power of injuſtice; the power
of a meek and patient ſpirit delivering
him from the power of pettiſh froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
the power of chaſtitie delivering
him from the power of uncleanneſſe: for
this is the Anointing, or that Son of God
ruling, a King of righteouſneſſe and peace
within you, that ſets you free.</p>
               <p>And truly when God is pleaſed to ſet
you free from the Serpent,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 20.</note> and to let you
ſee and feel his divine power thus ruling
in you, your heart and tongue cannot be
ſilent, but you will with life, delight, and
power be chearfully returning praiſes to
your heavenly Father, that hath made
your nature conformable to his ſon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Another thing let me tell you, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is to let you ſee what danger you are
in,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> if you only know the letter, and want
the power of God, if you hear <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119616:8"/>
that Believers are not under the Law of
works, but under the Law of love; and
if you hear the Saints of God ſpeak out of
experience that Chriſt hath ſet them free:</p>
               <p>Now obſerve, I ſay, you that only hear
the letter, or outward report, and do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and can ſpeak again what you
hear,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 16, 17.</note> you begin to think your ſelves ſome
body; I ſpeak to you that think you are
free, and yet are not: Here is a ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
preſently ariſes in you, for knowledge
in the letter only puffs up, and this is one
danger, but this is not all.</p>
               <p>For now this wiſe fleſh will be yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,
and will argue thus within thy
heart, God hath ſet us free from the Law
of works, we ſhall neither be condemned
nor ſaved by that, for we are under grace,
that is, the the law of Chriſt, and therefore
ſaith the fleſh, thou maſt take thy pleaſure,
that which was ſin formerly, while thou waſt
under the law of works, is now no ſin while
thou art under the law of love: This is the
temptation, and now thou art upon tryall.</p>
               <p>But if the Son ſet thee free, he doth not
only ſet thee free from the Law, but from
the Serpent too; not only from Gods
Law, of <hi>Do this and live,</hi> but from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
law of works too; for thy proud
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119616:9"/>
fleſh would be reconciled to God by his
workings, but this is thy bondage, and it
ſhall not.</p>
               <p>And if thy thoughts run, that thou art
freed from Gods condemning Law of
works, and yet findeſt no power of God
within, caſting out the ſtrong man, truly
for the preſent the father of lies, the ſubtil
fleſh hath deceived thee.</p>
               <p>This tickling delight of thy fleſh, is the
ſame Serpent that tempted <hi>Adam;</hi> if
thou eat hereof, that is, if thou joyn hands,
and take delight according to the whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
thereof, as to be unjuſt, ſecretly to
ſeek revenge, to be unclean, or adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
or the like, thou wilt finde that this
is the father of lies, that promiſes much
pleaſure, but cannot perform, for it will
throw thee into the fire, that is, under the
laſhes of Gods law, which thou thought
thou waſt freed from.</p>
               <p>But if thou have ſuch whiſperings, and
finde a ſtrength to reject them, thou wilt
then ſee by experience, that the ſtrength
of God is ſtronger then the fleſh: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the dear ſervants of God are much
tempted; for my own particular, I can
hardly hear a ſin named, but I have been
tempted to it, but I have found the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119616:9"/>
of God very, uſefull, and the only
power of the Father at ſuch times hath
kept me from wicked actions.</p>
               <p>Well, if thou finde that the power of
God in thee, which is ſincerity and truth,
treds the aſpiring of injuſtice in thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot; and the power of God, which
is chaſtitie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 36.</note> treds adulterous, unclean en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements
under foot; and the power of
God, which is love, treds envy and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning
grudge under foot, and the like:
This is the wiſdom and power of God,
even that Son of righteouſneſſe that ſets
you free;<note place="margin">Pſal. 133. 3.</note> for this is the powerfull oyle
that was poured upon the Head, Jeſus
Chriſt, and runs down to the loweſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>This power of God within thee, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
the whiſperings of that lyar the fleſh
within thee, and tels thee,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> it is true, thou
art not under the law of works to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
or ſaved by it, but thou art under
the law of love and holineſſe. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and power of God is thy keeper; is
God unrighteous, is God froward, is God
envious, is God unclean, or doth he take
delight in ſtrange fleſh, or in any creature
without himſelf, or doth he not delight in
himſelf, in whom there is all glory?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119616:10"/>
Indeed friends, minde what I tell you,
The fleſh alwayes delights in its ſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 3. 8.</note> and
in the enjoyment of creatures;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 31.</note> but the
power of God in thee alwayes glories,
and delights in God, and findes reſt in
none but in God.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak this, becauſe I know that this is
the moſt ſubtil, moſt enſnaring, and moſt
dangerous temptation of the profeſſing
fleſh, of any I know: And if God appear
to be your ſtrength at this time of trial,
you will then ſay feelingly, and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
thankfull heart, O the mighty
God indeed is my ſtrength, I had been
unjuſt, theeviſh, envious, proud, given to
all uncleanneſſe of the fleſh, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Gods truth, love, humility, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie
hath caſt this ſtrong man armed out;<note place="margin">Luke 11. 22.</note>
and now I ſee what truth is, what chaſtitie
is, what love to enemies is, what ſincerity
is; this is the power of God, this is the
anointing, this is the King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that rules in earth, this is the Son
that hath ſet me free, will keep me free:
every particular meaſure of this ſweet
power of God are ſo many particular
Angels of light, or manifeſtations of love
ſent from the father, to be my keeper:
Well, I only mention this experience, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119616:10"/>
men may prize Gods teachings more then
they have, and to be afraid of mens teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
when Gods is wanting; for truly the
moſt glorious Preacher, or profeſſor of
literal goſpel, either are, or will prove
the ſubtileſt hypocrites, if this power of
God be not their ſtrength, and life, for
without God we can do nothing, and by
him, we are able to do all things.</p>
               <p>Some truths I ſhall here write, which
brought along with them much life
and peace into my heart, when God
ſent them down into me, (or rather when
he took me up into them) and cauſed me
to behold, and feed upon the glory of
them: But I do not write to teach any
one my words to be their knowledge, for
what I know, I ſpeak, and leave it upon
the ſpirit of the Reader,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 14.</note> that if he finde
the ſame workings of God in him, his joy
may be confirmed by a witneſſe, and ſo
fulfilled; that more hands may be lifted
up together to ſet the Crown upon our
God, and that more mouths may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 13.</note> to ſing Alleluia, and prayſes of
honour to our Father, and to the Lamb
for evermore.</p>
               <p>It is very poſſible, that a man may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the literal knowledge of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119616:11"/>
of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and
may ſpeak largely of the Hiſtory thereof,
and draw concluſions, and raiſe many uſes
for the preſent ſupport of a troubled ſoul,
or for the reſtraining of lewd practiſes,
or for the direction of a civill converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet both they that ſpeake, and
they that hear, may be not only unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, but enemies to that Spirit
of truth, by which the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
writ.</p>
               <p>For it is not the Apoſtles writings, but
the ſpirit that dwelt in them that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
their hearts,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 6.</note> which gives life, and
peace to us all: And therefore when the
Prophets, <hi>Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſpake what they ſaw from God, they
ſpake, thus ſaith the Lord, out of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of what they ſaw, and felt, and they
were called true Prophets.</p>
               <p>But when others riſe up, that ſpake
their words and writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to another age, and generation
of men, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, as
the other did, yet they were called falſe
Prophets, becauſe they had ſeen nothing
themſelves from God, but walked by the
legs, and ſaw by the eyes of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
for God doth not threaten death
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119616:11"/>
to every City in every age of the world,
as to <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> neither cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to every people, as he did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
under <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 17.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he promiſe victory and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to every Army or people from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as he did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi>
time.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſpeak,<note place="margin">Num. 23. 7.</note> and aſſure others
of victory, when God purpoſes deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ſpeaks of deſtruction, when God
purpoſes a victory; theſe men ſpeak at
random, and though they ſpeak the very
words of the ſcriptures, yet they ſpeak not
the minde of him that gives life, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys,
and ſo having ſeene nothing
from him, they are to be reckoned among
falſe Prophets, that run before they be
ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though their words be many and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent.</p>
               <p>A man may know the ſcriptures as they
are written,<note place="margin">John 5. 46.</note> &amp; yet a ſtranger, yea an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
enemie to the God of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as the Jews were, they knew the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> who writ of Ieſus Chriſt &amp;
yet they perſecuted, and killed Ieſus Chriſt,
when he who was the great Prophet was
come, becauſe they knew him not; for if
they had known him to have bin the great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119616:12"/>
power and wiſdom of God, they would
not have killed him.</p>
               <p>And ſo many now a dayes do, and may
know the Scriptures of the Goſpel, and
yet may and do perſecute the ſpirit of the
Goſpel through ignorance and unbelief;
truly friends, it is not the knowledge of
the Scriptures only,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7.</note> but the knowledge of
the God of the Scripture, as God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to make known himſelf by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
working to you, that gives life and
peace to you; if you know, or can ſpeak
of Scriptures, and have ſeen nothing of
God, you are like Parats, that ſpeak the
words of another as you have been taught
by humane education.</p>
               <p>But if the ſame anointing, or power
and wiſdom of God dwell and rule in
you,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 5.</note> as did appear in the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
that writ, then you can ſee into
that myſterie of the Scripture (which is
God manifeſt in fleſh) and ſo can
ſpeak the minde of the Scriptures, though
you ſhould never ſee, hear, nor reade the
Scriptures from men.</p>
               <p>If your peace and comfort in God
ſhould only remain with you while you
are either hearing, or reading Scriptures,
or while you have the ſociety of ſuch as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119616:12"/>
can ſpeak or diſcourſe thereof, and then
finde again that your comfort and peace
is gone, when you are deprived by any
occaſion of that ſociety of Saints; truly
let me tell you, that though you prize and
know the Scriptures, yet there is a great
ſtrangneſſe between you and the God of
the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>It hath been ſuch a time with me, and I
ſee it is thus with others at this very day;
let them enjoy outward hearing, reading,
and liberty in prayer, and Saints commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and they are in peace, and they live
in heaven as they conceive, and it is a ſweet
life, but it is not The life; for if the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God hedge up all thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with Thornes, and leave theſe poor
ſouls alone, as it was Chriſts caſe, all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
him and fled, and left him alone to
ſtand in the midſt of enemies; why truly
here is your tryall for God hath denyed
you the opportunities of hearing, reading,
praying, &amp; Saints fellowſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; doth not
your heart now look after thoſe helps, &amp;
mourn in their abſence? If ſo, as I know
it is with you, then where is your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<note place="margin">Iſaiah 32. 12. and 28. 9.</note> experience, and your peace in, and
with God; it ſhews plainly that at ſuch a
time we ſucked refreſhment from the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119616:13"/>
creatures breaſts, but not from God.</p>
               <p>Or further, when you have all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to hear, to read, to pray, and to
communicate with Saints in their ſociety,
and yet if God deny you peace and life
under all this enjoyment, then you begin
to mourn, to ſee your barrenneſſe and
condition, like a fruitleſſe Fig-tree, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous
Wilderneſſe; which is well it is thus
with you, God will have you lie here for a
while under this bondage, before he give
you liberty; and if it be thus with you, as
I know it is, then where is your reſt and
peace in God? for truly God will
take up his people into ſuch a height of
glory, that he will make them lie down in
reſt and peace in him, when no viſible
help or means appear, when there is no
Cows in the Stalls,<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 16, 17.</note> nor bloſſomes on the
Vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when no creature ſpeaks peace, but
every creature is barren of giving refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then God will make his people to
ſuck life from him, who is the God of their
ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Well, when I was under your bondage,
my God, who is the beſt teacher of erring
ſouls, let me ſee that I reſted firſt upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
helps and means, and ſuch as you call
Ordinances, though I thought not ſo, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119616:13"/>
was offended at any that told me I reſted
thereupon.</p>
               <p>And when God gave me thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and yet denyed me a heart to ſuck
ſweetneſſe from them, or rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
their ſweetneſſe from my heart, then
I was troubled to ſee my barrenneſſe;
And if at any time God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to let a beam of light and peace
ſhine into me, and gave me enlargements
of heart, then I thought my ſelf to know
God, but when this ſun was clouded again,
then I was in bondage again.</p>
               <p>Well, here God taught me that I knew
him not, but that I knew his gifts, and the
beams of his preſence that he ſent down
to refreſh my drooping ſpirit, and that I
reſted in thoſe beams, not in him that was
the ſun from whence thoſe beams come;
And this I know is your condition, who
know the Scriptures it may be at your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ends, as we ſay, and that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
as yet with the God of the
Scriptures. Be not offended with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
for it is a truth, and your ſouls
either do or will know it to be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But when Gods time is to ſet you at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

That if God deny you all outward means

are content, and reſt in him who is your

content (though you were not content

much peace to eye God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 31.</note> and to wait upon
him, and reſt in him, as if you were full of
actings or enjoyed much of the Saints
communion; ſo that you are taken off
from either glorying in the preſence, or
mourning in the abſence of any creature-help,

               <p>WEE ſee in theſe dayes the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe

               <p>By reaſon whereof, ſome through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

poſſeſſe them, that the ſincere hearted

times. Indeed I believe God may
ſuffer ſome few of his Saints to endure
waſting in their eſtates, and may give up
the liberty and lives of their bodies into
the hands of wicked men: Yea, but the
number of Saints are limited, and the
length of their ſufferings are limited; all
the Saints ſhall not die, neither ſhall the

muſt caſt but ſome into priſon (not all)
and there ſhall be tribulation but ten

therefore you ſee, while <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did only
oppreſſe Iſrael, God ſuffered <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to
live, but when his malice riſe ſo high (or
rather his ſpirit fell ſo low from God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119616:15"/>
as to deſtroy all Iſrael at the red

this ſtorm was over, God ſet Iſrael in a

from the oppreſſion of enemies then ever
he was in before. And in King <hi>Davids</hi>

and ſought to deſtroy all Iſrael, that the

their protection.</p>
               <p>Even ſo, while the myſterie of iniquity,
which rules in the unbelievers of our daies,
have ſought to wear out formerly ſome of
his Saints by High Commiſſion Courts,
Seſſions, Canon Laws, Whips, Priſons,

appointed ſome of his Lambs and Sheep
for ſuch a ſlaughter; as in the time of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,

be put to death, and ſuffer too; As in

all Gods people; it is the generall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of all the ſcoffing ſons of bondage,
they will deſtroy all the free born <hi>Iſaacs</hi>

Alas poor creatures, God may ſuffer you

the ſeed of the Serpent to ſheath their

               </p>
               <p>And ſo let theſe hot ſpirited people in

ſhall never deſtroy all Gods people out
of the Land,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 11, &amp;c.</note> God will have his witneſſes

perſecution, ſcoffs, reproachful names

               <p>For if the Nations of old could not
root out <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, which were
one ſingle nation, viſible among all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119616:17"/>
of the earth, though they did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it; neither can you now, you hot
ſpirited people, root out all the Saints,
much leſſe, you will finde it now the more
difficult, for now the Saints doe not live
all in one Nation, but are ſcattered
through all Nations, kindreds, tongues,
and People; The appearence of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them is not altogether in out ward
formall worſhip, and Temple ſervice, as it
was to the Jews, viſible to the eye of the
world.</p>
               <p>But the appearance of God now,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 1.</note> is in
the Saints,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 10.</note> that they worſhip the Father
in ſpirit and truth, in ſuch a ſecret manner
as the eye of the world cannot, nor does
not alwayes ſee; And therefore though the
myſterie of iniquitie ſeek to kill all, as
theſe unbeleevers that are the actors
thereof do ſay they will, yet they cannot,
becauſe they cannot know them; And
when they have killed all as they think,
if God ſhould ſuffer them to act their
bloody intents and words, yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
it will appear, that the enemies
kill one another, and ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael</hi> will
be preſerved; <hi>Herod</hi> killed all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Jeſus whom he ſought chiefly to kill, was

gone, ſent by God far out of <hi>Herods</hi> reach;
and when it ſhall appeare in concluſion,
that they have killed their own hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
people, and the ſincere hearted, whom
they aymed at are eſcaped, their vexation
wil increaſe, and they will dye with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>Therefore now Judge if God be not
the chief ſufferer, becauſe they will not
leave God a ſeed on earth; you Saints
of God, be not troubled to hear that your
neighbours will plunder and kill you, and
root out all <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the land,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 15, &amp;c.</note> they
cannot do it, God will fight for you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, the cauſe is Gods, not yours;
And in ſeeking your ruine, they will pull
their own ruine ſpeedily upon themſelves,
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought to deſtroy <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his

upon, was accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Be not troubled at theſe threatnings,
but ſtand ſtill, waite with a quiet peaceable
heart on God,<note place="margin">Exo. 14. 13</note> and ſee what a deliverance
he will work for you; Aſſure your ſelves
I ſee God working a great deliverance for
you, your number ſhall increaſe, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of bloody minded men ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
therefore do you meet God by
faith, and honour him, by owning him in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119616:18"/>
the middeſt of theſe ſtormes; the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your riches, friends or bodily
life doth not make you happie, nor the
loſſe of theſe cannot make you miſerable;
if you have theſe, it is the enjoyment of
God within that gives you a ſweet uſe of
them without; if all be taken from you, it
is your Fathers will to ſuffer it, and he
will be honoured by it, your oppreſſions
and ſufferings will bring glory to him;
And if you loſe your life, then your work
in done, therefore ſtand ſtill with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
in the place and condition God hath
put you in; And ſay, Father, do with my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
my body, my life, what thou wilt,
honour thy ſelfe in me, and by me, and
thy will be done. Now if once God hath
brought your ſpirit to this frame, then
God is glorified on your behalf, for now
the glory of Chriſt, the King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
hath ſubdued the Serpent,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 13, 14.</note> and is
revealed in you. But God is evil ſpoken of,
and doth ſuffer on their behalf that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute.</p>
               <p>Now know you weake ones, that it is
not you, but God, who is the greateſt long
ſufferer in theſe times; it is not men, but
the appearance of God in men, which the
myſterie of iniquity ſtrives againſt,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 4, 5.</note> for do
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119616:18"/>
you not ſee how the ſpirit of lies would
root out the ſpirit of truth, the ſpirit of
envy would root out the ſpirit of love,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 6, 7.</note>
the ſpirit of hypocriſie would root out the
the ſpirit of ſincerity, the ſpirit of pride,
and ſelf honouring, would root out the
ſpirit of humility that honours God, the
ſpirit of ſelf-will would root out the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meekneſs and patience, that waits
upon the will of God, the ſpirit of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
raſhneſs &amp; diſcontent, would root out
the ſpirit of quietneſs that is at reſtin God,
the ſpirit of greedy covetouſneſs, injuſtice
and oppreſſion, would root out the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of juſtice and tenderneſs that depends
upon God. And in one word, the myſterie
of iniquitie, Beaſt, whoriſh ſpirit, or fleſh,
having a time given him of God, to act
and ſhew its wiſdome and power, ſtrvies
might and maine to root out all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God out of mankinde. But alas
poor Serpent, thou muſt die thy ſelf, Gods
time is neer expired that he gave thee, and
he is rooting thee out of mankinde, and
conſuming in the fire of his wrath;<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 9.</note> for
he will become the Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and dwell in fleſh himſelfe; this is
Gods myſterie, which he is in and about
to make publikely manifeſt amongſt men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119616:19"/>
But as yet hypocriſie raignes, and
would raigne as King; And ſincerity,
which is God, is laughed to ſcorne. The
national peace and liberty is pretended
(that is, the outward ſhew of love to
God) but ſecretly moſt men, both of
high and low degree, intend either
to inrich themſelves with the kingdomes
monies &amp; ruins, or elſe by their ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
working, endeavour to vent their
malice upon the kingdomes friends, even
the Saints. And alas poor blinde creature,
you work your own ruine; take <hi>Lot</hi> out of
<hi>Sodome,</hi> and the vengeance of Gods Law
fals immediatly, therefore you weak ones
that are troubled, take notice, That God
is moſt perſecuted, hated, and fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
in theſe dayes, for the plaine truth
is, the myſterie of iniquity would not
have the God of love to have any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in earth; So that God is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſufferer.</p>
               <p>And therefore that truth which my ſoul
moſt drives at, is this which follows:
that though God ſuffer moſt,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 12.</note> yet it is not
againſt his will,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 7</note> but with his will; And
that this ſpirit of darkneſſe, or myſterie
of iniquity, that fights againſt God, hath
no power to act like it ſelf, till God limit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119616:19"/>
him that power, and limit him a time to
act that power in. And here I ſhall ſhew
in my experience, what I ſee and know
the Devill is; And what the power of the
Devill is, and by what power he workes.</p>
               <p>The Devill or father of lies, in the full
body of him, is unrighteous fleſh, and the
imaginations thereof.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> He is that <hi>Belzebub</hi>
that ſat among the ſonnes of God,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 6.</note> that is,
among the five ſences or ſpirituall lights
which God hath ſet in the ſoul; for the
imagination of fleſh will not ſubmit it ſelf
to God, but is found a chiefe enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
               <p>And the pride of the fleſh, envy, ſlaviſh
feare, diſtruſt, hypocriſie, carnall thoughts,
ſelfe love,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14.</note> and the like, are particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
that firſt intices the ſoule, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
brings him to trouble; and every
one of thoſe have particular degrees, like
legions of Devils, which holds the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
man, in bondage.</p>
               <p>While a man enjoyes his luſts, he hath a
ſeeming peace within himſelf. But when
the holy law appears to diſcover thoſe
lurking Devils, then begins the creatures
torment and ſlaverie; And this lets me
ſee what the enmity of nature is between
God and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119616:20"/>
The enmity in fleſh, it is the ſpirit of
envy and darkneſſe, which is Gods op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
as darkneſſe is oppoſite to light,
and heat oppoſite to cold. And this
workes in the creature, man, to maintaine
its unclean beeing,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 22.</note> in oppoſition to the
beeing of God. And while it hath its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
ſinfull man is in peace. But when
God pleaſes that the declaration of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
ſhall take hold upon that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
it throws the ſinner preſently
under ſorrowes, and breakes his peace
to pieces. And this is that which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in my experience calls the Devil or
murtherer; Even the enmity that is in my
nature againſt God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 15, 16.</note> which threw me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the flaſhings of Gods righteous law,
which was enmity againſt me, and this I
ſhall endeavour to clear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>BUt firſt of all, what is the righteous
Law here to be underſtood? I Anſwer;
It is not the words of the letter, called the
ten Commandements, and therein only
bound up;<note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note> But it is the manifeſtations of
God in all, or any one of his Attributes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119616:20"/>
ſhining forth upon, and in his creature,
endeavouring by his ſpirituall power to
ſwallow up all the motions and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the fleſh into God. And ſo burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, (by the ſpirit of burning) all the
droſs of the fleſh, that the creature may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
pure gold. As thus, the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods wiſdom to the heart,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4</note> is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſite to the wiſdome of the fleſh,
and declares it to be folly, which inward
diſcoverie troubles and ſhames the man,
though none ſee and know it but himſelfe.
The manifeſtations of Gods love, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; truth, is directly oppoſite to the carnal
love, carnal humilitie, &amp; unrighteouſneſs of
the fleſh. The chaſtitie and holineſſe of
God lets a man ſee his uncleanneſſe and
filthy luſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note> The ſincerity of God, ſhining
forth upon the heart, diſcovers its hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
and ſo of all other manifeſtations of
God, being darted into the heart by the
father; He declares the creature his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and that every way he comes ſhort
of the glory of God, by reaſon whereof
the creature is filled with horror and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the eye of other men ſees
not, but ſtands and admires.</p>
               <p>So then (here lies the myſterie, though
to me it is an unfolded truth, for I ſpeak
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119616:21"/>
what I know.) The Serpent or proud
fleſh, in all the imaginations of it, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to maintain its corrupt ſelf, and
to ſwallow up the Law of God, which is
the pure ſpirit. But the Law of God,
which is the wiſdome and power of God,
manifeſted in all the branches of it, to, and
in the heart, doth ſwallow up the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf, and deſtroys and conſumes all
the powers of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 5.</note> and becomes the
King of righteouſneſs, ruling and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and by what power doth he work? I
anſwer: This is not a power diſtinct from
God,<note place="margin">Rom 7. 9. &amp;c.</note> as I have thought, that the Devill is
a middle power between God and me,
but it is the power of my proud fleſh,
and the power of Gods holy Law, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
together, the one fighting againſt the
other, and ſo ſlew me, and held me under
bondage, as thus;</p>
               <p>God bids the heart truſt in him by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
whiſperings, the heart not knowing
God, looks after the creature, and thinks
it cannot live without money, lands, help
of men and creatures; This is the Devill
that tempts. Well, the pure ſpirit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
law within tels the heart, he muſt be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119616:21"/>
ſtript of all theſe, and truſt providence
for ſubſiſtence; the heart while it hath uſe
and plenty of all theſe, ſaith, yes, I will
truſt God for every thing. Yea, but when
riches fayle, friends frowne, men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
help, and begin to ſpeak evil, and to
hate, and the heart ſees it muſt truſt in
God, or ſtarve, and yet it cannot, he hath
no power, ſlaviſh feare and unbeliefe is ſo
ſtorng in him, then it begins to ſinck;
And it reaſons thus,</p>
               <p>I have no riches,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 11.</note> no certain dwelling

fulfilled to him, he feeles no power from
God, and his ſpirit droops. So that here
is depth of miſery in the hearts appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
it is hedged in with ſorrows on
every ſide.</p>
               <p>Let him look to men and creatures,
and there is no help, all hath forſaken
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119616:22"/>
him, and ſtands aloofe off; let him look
within himſelfe, and he ſees nothing but
ſlaviſh feare, and unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> queſtioning the
truth and power of God, how can ſuch
things be? and ſo beating him off from
quiet cloſing with God, but labouring
to make a breach between God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<note place="margin">Heb. 12 6.</note> Well; thy ſpirit is full of languiſhing,
this is a very low ebb, but thou art not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of the father, though thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is much ſhaken; the reaſon of all is this,
The pure law of the ſpirit is ſcorching and
burning up the unbeliefe of thy fleſh, to
make thee know God, and to make thee
bright in the eyes of God and men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Now ſpeake, if this be not true,
you that have waded in,<note place="margin">Iſa. 12. 6.</note> or through this
fire, ſome are wading in this fire, few have
waded through it, all muſt be burned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
more or leſſe, before they lie down
quietly in the lap of providence.</p>
               <p>Well,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> this is the power of darkneſſe
and bondage, under which the divell, or
troubles within, doth buffet you. The
power of my unrighteous fleſh ſtrives to
maintain the kingly power in me, and the
righteous Law, or the pure ſpirit ſtrives
to maintain his owne righteous and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power in me, by tredding the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119616:22"/>
foot; If proud fleſh ſtand, then the
the King of glory in me muſt be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but if he keep the field, and raigne in
me, then the head of my troubles, which
is the Serpent, muſt be bruiſed; And this
is the enmity of natures between God
and me, this is the Divell; and the power
of this Divell, or enmity, doth not worke
without the will, but according to
the will of God, in killing the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
creature; when the ſerpent in fleſh
kills, then the creature, man, dies from
God: but when the law comes and kills,
then the creature begins to live again
to God.</p>
               <p>The fleſh and darkneſſe within me,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 9.</note> is
the Divell, that is, the father of lies, that
never ſpoke truth. And the power of the
perfect law taking hold thereupon,
threw me under ſorrow, and ſealed up
my miſerie, and this is utter darkneſſe,
for my ſoul lived below the life and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God in ſin and diſobedience, and
while that ſtrong man kept the houſe, I
had peace, and I lived below the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and joyes of God, in ſorrowes and
miſerie, under the ſence of Gods wrath for
that ſin, and then my ſinfull peace was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from me: And this is Hell, yea, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119616:23"/>
extremitie of the power of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>But this Divell is not a middle power,
diſtinct from God, between God and the
creature, and ſo waits as a Gaoler to do
his Office when the Judge condemns the
ſinner, as ſome ſay, and as I thought; but
it is the power of proud fleſh, and the
power of the pure ſpirit mixing together;
not as friends,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> but enemies, oppoſing each
other, and ſo killing the weaker party, the
creature, and taking peace from him.
And though God ſuffer the Divell to act,
and gives him a power ſometimes over
the creature, yet God doth ſuffer it, not
to ruine his creature man,<note place="margin">Eph 2 15.</note> but to ruine
the Divell, to bruiſe that ſerpents head,
and to reconcile the creature to himſelfe,
and ſo to raiſe him up to enjoy the life of
God, that is dead under the power of the
Divell.</p>
               <p>This proud fleſh, or Divell, is called the
wicked one, in his ſeverall degrees, in
mankinde, which is the ſerpent, which
bends his bow, and makes ready his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
that he may ſhoot privily at him
that is upright in heart, that is, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God in the heart of man, in
every degree and meaſure of it.</p>
               <p>This is that envious, uncleane, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119616:23"/>
man that gathers to himſelfe, and that
ſcatters from Chriſt; for let a man, in whom
any meaſure of this ſerpent rules, preach,
pray, beare rule, or do any thing, he gives
not the honour to God, but he gathers
up the honour to himſelfe, for he is full of
ſelfe-ſeeking, and ſelfe-praiſe, and this is
the wicked one, whether he be little or
big; And God is angrie with this wicked
one every day: And this lordly power
of the ſerpent muſt be killed, before the
manifeſtations of the fathers love favour
ſweet to the creature.</p>
               <p>This is the father of lies,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> this is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 4.</note> this is he that deceives the Nations;
this proud fleſh that would ſit in Gods
Temple,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 5.</note> and be as God,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 7. 10.</note> is the myſterie
Babylon, the mother of all abominations,
this is the firſt mover to all enmity againſt
God, for it will not own the Father, the
King of glory. But now it is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Law that makes this appear to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
for light diſcovers darkneſſe, and
the ſpirit of fire diſcovers coldneſſe. Now
the great myſterie of God is this, he will
remove this great ſtone or mountain that
lies between him and his creature; for he
will ſwallow up his own diſpenſation of
wrath, as the creature cals it, which is the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119616:24"/>
Law of holineſſe, proving the creature a
ſinner, and ſo caſting him under ſorrow,
which is ſenſe of wrath, and he will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up the enmity of our natures into
love,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 15.</note> even into himſelf, and ſo to make of
two, one, when this mixed murderer is caſt
out of heaven.</p>
               <p>And this devil, or murderer appears,
ſometimes within a man, in troubling and
filling the heart and fleſh with ſorrows
and miſery; and ſometimes he appears
without: when the ſpirit of proud fleſh in
other men envies me, God may, and
many times gives way that that ſpirit of
envy ſhall go forth and proſper, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his will; for if the envy, hypocriſie,
and cruelty that breaths in others be acted
upon me, it is not the will of that envious
ſpirit for my ruine, but the will of God is
done, in ſuffering that ſpirit to act for its
own ruine, and my healing: And truly I
have a great perſwaſion, that though God
ſuffer this unclean ſpirit to run up and
down, and range in this Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
yet God will heal England in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
and caſt this devil or unclean ſpirit
into the lake of fire, and ſo conſume him.</p>
               <p>There is one Scripture that gives great
light into this truth.<note place="margin">Iob 1. 12.</note> The devil, troubler,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119616:24"/>
or ſpirit of darkneſs in other men did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<hi>Job,</hi> (which indeed is but the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of proud envious fleſh, for this is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi>
that deviſes miſchief) and told God,
that if he would lay his hand upon him,
<hi>Job</hi> would curſe him to his face. Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thought (ariſing from envy) that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
would be a means to make a
breach between God and <hi>Job,</hi> as thoſe
wicked men did imagine in <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 2. 21.
Well, God ſaid Amen to the requeſt of
that evill ſpirit, behold, ſaith God to the
devil, <hi>Job</hi> is in thy hand, even under that
very power of temptation and ſuffering
as thou wouldſt have him to be under, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch not his life; ſo that here is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
limited to Satan, or to the envy of fleſh
in other men againſt <hi>Job;</hi> but this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not Satans power properly, diſtinct
from God, but it is the very power of
God, which the God of wiſdom hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and limited to Satan, whereby God
will honour himſelf, and ſhame the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and bruiſe his head by <hi>Jobs</hi> ſufferings.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of envy imagines, that if <hi>Jobs</hi>
Cattle and goods ſhould be taken away
by robbery, it would vex him, and make
him ſpeak evill of God, therefore deſires
that ſuch a croſſe might befall <hi>Iob;</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119616:25"/>
God ſaid Amen, I grant thee thy deſire,
let that befall him.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of envy imagines, that if <hi>Iobs</hi>
houſe was burned, and his children killed,
it would make him blaſpheme God, and
therefore deſires that power; God ſaid
Amen, I grant thee that power ſo to do
to him.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of envy imagines another
miſchief, and would have <hi>Iob</hi> filled with
diſeaſes in his body, and would have his
friends and kindred forſake him, and to be
a bitter croſſe to him; God ſaid Amen, let
it be ſo.</p>
               <p>Now theſe evils are acted upon <hi>Iob,</hi> as
if the devill did it by his power, diſtinct
from God, but no, it is by Gods power,
limited to the devil, at the devils requeſt:
not ſo much to gratifie the devil, as by this
means to bruiſe his head; for God makes
uſe of Satans malice, in deſiring theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
to befall <hi>Iob,</hi> to do two things, firſt
to try <hi>Iob,</hi> and to make him the more
bright and faithfull to God, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
afterward: And ſecondly to
ſhame envy and the devil by his own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 22.</note> for ſuch means as the devil did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
would make <hi>Iob</hi> to curſe God, God
uſes the ſame, and thereby made <hi>Iob</hi> to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119616:25"/>
worſhip him more experimentally.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of pride, covetouſneſſe, and
envy deſired to ſit in Gods Temple (Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde)
and not only in the whole bulk of
Mankinde, but in that part which is neereſt
and deareſt to God, even the Spouſe of
Chriſt, or elect City, that thereby he
might the more provoke God: Well,
God ſaid Amen, and grants him a power
to ſit there, and to rule and tred the holy
City under foot forty two moneths,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 25.</note> or for
a time, times, and a half time; and now
the devil raigns not by a power abſolute
of his own, but by a limited power, and a
limited time too given him from God.</p>
               <p>And truly all this time Satan hath made
uſe of this power, and his malice hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very violent, and not only the
Saints, but God in the Saints eſpecially
hath ſuffered; for his wiſdom, his love, his
patience, his faithfulneſſe and truth hath
been tempted and tryed to purpoſe: I,
but the King of righteouſneſſe is the ſame,
he alters not, and therefore in concluſion,
when the righteous Law takes away this
limited power which this devil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one deſired and obtained, it will then
appear it did him no good, but proves his
utter ſhame and ruine, and declares God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119616:26"/>
to be the only one infinite beeing, to the
eternall glory of his own name.</p>
               <p>And ſo in theſe dayes, we ſee and feel
great troubles and temptations do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
men round, and it appears to the
eye of man, as if envy hypocriſie, pride,
and ſelf-will ruled as it would himſelf,
and as if there were no power to reſtrain
this flood of ungodlineſſe: I, but dear
friends, know that all this power of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
which you ſee in the hand of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and hypocriſie, it is not their own
power, but Gods power, or the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of viſible wrath, which God hath put
into the hand of that evil ſpirit for a time.
It is not his own abſolutely, but it is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
power and time;<note place="margin">Dan. 8. 23.</note> and this ſpeaks
great comfort to the Saints, for God will
bring good out of all this; God, our God
and Father, ſtands and looks on, and the
end of all this hurly-burly will bring ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
glory to the Father, in and through
his Saints, and everlaſting ſhame and ruin
to the devil.</p>
               <p>Therefore be not troubled you Saints
of the moſt high, though you be hated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
and perſecuted, for if you would
ſee Satans head bruiſed, you muſt firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your heel to be bruiſed by his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119616:26"/>
ſo that reaſon tells you, that there
is a neceſſitie that the Divell ſhould
enjoy a limited time, and power.</p>
               <p>Well, God himſelf ſuffers moſt in theſe
times; for though Satan get a power to
try and tempt the ſaints, and to trouble
the world, yet the envy of the fleſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
ſtrikes at God; for pride fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
humilitie, malice fights againſt
love, falſhood fights againſt ſincerity, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
fights againſt knowledge, ſelf-will
in fleſh, fights againſt the King of glory,
the pure ſpirit that dwels in fleſh; So that
God himſelf is the ſufferer: But that Satan,
or father of lies ſhoots at; and the Father
ſuffers it thus to be, and limits him a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thus to fight againſt him, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
he may ſend forth the brightneſs
of his Law, and bruiſe Satans head by his
own weapons, and Judge, and condemne
him by the words of his own mouth, and
works of his own hands,<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 36.</note> and ſwallow up
that ſpirit of envy and darkneſs into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the ſpirit of love, which is the power
of God, yea God himſelf, and ſo takes
him out of the way that troubles his
Saints, that they may reſt and lie down
ſweetly in him, and to have no troubler
at all to trouble them, when this accuſer is
once caſt out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:119616:27"/>
The Saints in all their afflictions look
upon the hand of God that ſmites them,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note>
as <hi>Iob</hi> did; but unbeleevers that live after
the fleſh, think it is the Devils power, and
not God:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>NOw this adverſe power, which men
readily think is the Devils power,
diſtinct from Gods, as though God had
no hand in it, appears to me, to be the
very power of God in an immediate
diſpenſation of wrath upon the ſinner; and
that which we call Devill, that terrifies,
is but the declaration of the rigour of the
righteous law of God, laying hold upon
the corruption that is in the creature,
which the ſinner cannot look upon, and
live; for if God look upon any creature
through the righteous law, which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
man, hath gone aſtray from, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live. But when the law of love hath
ſwallowed that law of works that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
perfection from the creature, then the
brightneſs &amp; power of that love ſhining
upon the heart, and changing the man in
to the ſame nature and glory, makes him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119616:27"/>
able to behold God, and live; yea, and to
live joyfully too, both in him, and before
him; But let me not digreſs too far.</p>
               <p>The adverſe power ſpoken of, is the
very diſpenſation of the wrath of God
upon ſinners, and there is one ſcripture
doth countenance this;<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24.</note> which is this, So
he drove out the man, and placed at the
Eaſt of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> Cherubins,
and a flaming ſword which turned every
way, to keep the way of the tree of life. By
tree of life is meant God himſelf, in whom
<hi>Adam</hi> dwelt; And <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, was that
living garden in whom God delighted;
But ſince <hi>Adam</hi> began to delight in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he went out of God, and God ſet
this flaming ſword to flaſh againſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
that ſo he might come into God again,
and taſte, and eat, and delight himſelfe in
that tree of life, till it was the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God to take him in again. And ſo
all ſinners ſtand without the ſpirit, till
God pull them into himſelf, in his own
time and ſeaſon; But that creature that
is beginning to look in, by deſires, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings,
and precious delight towards
God, is in the way of entrance, and when
the ſpirit of burning is made manifeſt, he
ſhall then enter in, and finde reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119616:28"/>
Well, <hi>Adam</hi> is gone out of God, and
this flaming ſword is ſet againſt him, that
he ſhall not enter in again; but <hi>Adam</hi>
ſees not this myſterie, becauſe the love of
ſelf had blinded his eyes; And <hi>Adam</hi> is
hid from God among the trees and leaves
of ſelf-aſpiring principles that riſe up
in him, to which he gave conſent, to be a
more knowing man then God had made
him,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 2.</note> and he could not ſee God through
theſe, the love of ſelfe was ſo thick: This
teaches every one to waite upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for pure teaching, and to covet after
no more knowledge, then what is freely
given them.</p>
               <p>Now the Father is beginning to work
a great myſterie, and that is, to pull <hi>Adam</hi>
out of ſelfiſh fleſh again, and to plant him
into the pure ſpirit, and ſo to bring him
into the moſt fruitfull garden of <hi>Eden.</hi>
But this God would not do preſently, but
in length of time; and <hi>Adam</hi> neither
could, nor ſhould come back again to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſelf and fleſh, and to acknowledge
the Father his all in all, till the Father was
pleaſed to appoint a time when he would
manifeſt himſelfe in <hi>Adam.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the preſent, God hath ſet this fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſword, which turns every way, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119616:28"/>
keep the way of the tree of life; <hi>Adam</hi>
muſt not come in, to live in the pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
again,<note place="margin">Zach. 3. 4.</note> till he be changed, and his filthy
garments taken from him by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
own hand, and in the fathers own
time.</p>
               <p>Now I conceive, and truly I finde in my
own experience, that this flaming ſword
is the enmity of natures ſpoken of, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is ſet
in our hearts ſince the fall, being a mixture
of oppoſite natures, &amp; ſo a frighting, and
killing the creature with terror; So that
let me go or come, think or do, or turne
any way, this enmity hath met with me,
terrifing and troubling of me; for I could
apprehend nothing from God but anger;
And ſo long as I looked upon God as an
angry God, I could not look upon him
and live, but was as a ſtranger to the peace
and reſt of God, and I lay under bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>Now all afflictions, croſſes, troubles,
ſtraits, that I met withall, &amp; the of death,
or feare of dangers, or feares that ſome
Devill, or ſpirit would take hold upon
me if I were alone in any dark room, or
in the night, I thought it was the Devill,
ſome third power between God and me,
that affrighted me; But alas, now I ſee it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119616:29"/>
was but the diſpenſation of Gods wrath,
the ſhinings forth of the righteous law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, which, as fire, ſcorched &amp; burned the
enmity of my nature, &amp; ſo became a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me, though I ſaw it not, and that
flamed, and flaſhed againſt me, which way
ſo ever I went; So that this adverſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that troubles the creature, is not a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
diſtinct from God, but it is the very
power of Gods righteous law, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of his wrath, yea, the ſpirit of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 14, 15.</note> which appeares very terrible, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the enmity of nature that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the ſinner, for there is no
agreement between God and the ſinner,
for ſinners are at a diſtance from God in
place and comfort, till there be a oneneſs
wrought between God and them, by the
power of the anointing, Chriſt. And then
this Devill vaniſhes, the enmity dies, the
flaming ſword is taken away, and then the
Father appeares in manifeſtations of love,
peace, and oneneſs, to the joy, life, liberty,
and peace of the creature, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he goes. Then the creature looks not
upon God as an angrie God, but a God
of love to him, whatſoever befalls him.
Let him meet with afflictions, croſſes, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
frownes of friends, ſickneſs, death,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119616:29"/>
any thing, ſtill the poor redeemed ſoul can
ſay, this is the good will of my loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his will be done. Now the bondage,
the enmity, the flaming ſword, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
is taken away; and the creatures taſte
and eat daily of the tree of life, even live
in God, and God in them; and here is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Now <hi>Adam</hi> is come into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
again, and finds reſt in God, and there
is none to keep him out of this enioyment
any longer.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cleares this,<note place="margin">Eph 2. 15</note> when he
ſpeaks what Jeſus Chriſt the Anoynting
does for ſinners, ſaith, he hath aboliſhed
in his fleſh the enmity, even the law of
Commandments, and ſo making peace;
and that he might reconcile both Jews
and Gentiles to God, in one body, by the
croſs, having ſlaine the enmity thereby.</p>
               <p>So that now you ſee, for what reaſon
God ſet the flaming ſword in <hi>Adam,</hi> the
living garden; that this Enmity might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and work, till the time and ſeaſon
of the Father came; That the Anoynting,
Chriſt, who is the wiſdome and power
of the Father, did come and take it away,
and reconcile him, and his offending crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo making peace by uniting them into
one ſpirit of love; throwing down all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119616:30"/>
partition walls, taking away the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of wrath, or Divell, and murtherer,
and now ſhines in the bright beames of
love in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Let God and man be made friends, and
you never here of a Divell to trouble, or
affright, or kill any more; therefore this
Divell,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6. &amp;c.</note> or adverſe power, is no other, but
the diſpenſation of wrath, through the
ſtrictneſs of a righteous Law, which the
creature lies under, by reaſon of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and when the Anoynting hath made
God and the creature meet in love each
to other, the enmity dies, and the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Divell vaniſhes away, and is caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lake of fire,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 15.</note> and ſo conſumed, and
ſhall never affright, or terrifie the creature
any more.</p>
               <p>Indeed, while theſe enmities are in force,
there is great flaſhings one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſometimes there is troubles
within a man, horror and trembling, and
ſecret burning; and ſometimes frightings,
and appariſions of wrath without a man;
but all theſe are but the effects of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
law, occaſioned through enmity of
natures, but I ſay, when the Anoynting hath
made a oneneſs, ſo that God dwels, and
rules in man, and man lives in God; then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119616:30"/>
all thoſe frightings are taken away.</p>
               <p>But is there no divel that tempted Chriſt?
or that oppoſes God? yes, it is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darkneſs, or ſpirit of enmity, that was
the firſt fruit that ſprang up from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
after he was made, and which does
yet dwel and rule in diſobedient fleſh;
untill Chriſt, the power of God, who is
ſtronger, come and caſt him out.</p>
               <p>For as thoſe whiſperings of fleſh, that
riſe up in <hi>Adam,</hi> wich was the ſerpent
that inticed him to diſobey; did move <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
with a tickling deſire to be more wiſe
and honourable then God at preſent had
ſet him in, to which <hi>Adam</hi> gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and ſo eat of the tree of knowledge
of good and evill, even his own ſelfe and
imagination.</p>
               <p>The ſame whiſperings of fleſh appeared
in the humane nature Jeſus Chriſt: for he
was thereby inticed to diſlike that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his father had put him in; for firſt he was
moved to murmur againſt the father, as
though his father were careleſſe of his ſon,
in letting him faſt forty dayes,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> and forty
nights; and ſo the fleſh would have had
Chriſt to have waited no longer on his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to Command thoſe ſtones to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bread. But Chriſt rejected that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:119616:31"/>
Then the fleſh begins to move him to
preſume upon his fathers protection, that
is, to caſt himſelfe down from the pinacle
of the Temple, upon this conceit, that he
was the ſon of God, this is an unreaſonable
attempt, even mere confuſion, as all the
wiſdome of the fleſh is. But Chriſt rejects
this likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Then the fleſh intices him to Convetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and vaine glory, after the things of
the world; and told him, that if he would
ceaſe waiting upon the fathers providence,
and follow the imaginations of the fleſh,
all the glory of the world ſhould be his;
for the imagination of the fleſh thinks it
can compaſſe any thing by its own wit
and policy. But Chriſt rejects this likewiſe;
and becauſe he was the ſon, he delighted
to obey, and to wait upon his father, and
was content with his condition his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had put him in; ſo that here was whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings
of unbelief, whiſperings of pride,
and whiſperings of covetouſneſs, and
vaine glory, all which are the fruits of the
fleſh.</p>
               <p>But Jeſus Chriſt gave no conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man did, but ſtil kept
cloſe to his father, &amp; ſinned not; ſo that here
was the divell, the motions, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119616:31"/>
of the fleſh, the father of lies that
tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſlew him; And here
was the ſame divell that tempted Chriſt,
for he did partake of fleſh, and was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in all things like unto us; But Chriſt
ſlew him, and caſt him out of heaven, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fleſh,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 14.</note> and therefore this Anoynting,
is ſaid to be the earneſt of our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that as this power of God did dwell
in Jeſus, and trod the divell, the father of
lies, the fleſhy imagination under his feet,
ſo that he killed him that killed <hi>Adam,</hi>
and us in him; even ſo the ſame power
in the fathers times and ſeaſons will bruiſe
the ſame Serpents head in every ſon and
daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> and tread them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet in them.</p>
               <p>But till ſuch time as Chriſt hath finiſhed
this great myſterie,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> there is, &amp; will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
in this fleſh, our bodies; for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
up of a mans own concupiſcence will
trouble him, and the flaming ſword, the
diſpenſations of the righteous law, laying
hold thereupon, will affright and terrifie
the enſlaved creature, and raiſe mountains
of miſerie againſt him; and ſo from hence
comes all thoſe horrors within a man, and
all thoſe alterations, and hurly burlies in
the world, upon, mens eſtates, families,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119616:32"/>
and perſons, as we ſee befell <hi>Iob,</hi> which
loſſes and miſeries to <hi>Iob,</hi> were the
breakings forth of a righteous law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Iob,</hi> tempered by the wiſdome of God,
not for <hi>Iobs</hi> hurt, or the Devills good, but
for <hi>Iobs</hi> liberty and peace with God, and
for the devils utter ſhame and diſtruction.</p>
               <p>Well, in all your troubles, I could wiſh
you could look upon the hand of God
that ſmites, and not upon the Devill at a
diſtance from God, as I have done, and I
know you do; for when God is pleaſed to
open your eyes, as to ſee that it is he that
ſmites, affrights, torments, ſhakes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
families, eſtates, &amp; perſons, through
the power of his righteous law, which all
fleſh have gone aſtray from, and which the
power of darkneſs, even the imagination
of your proud fleſh ſtil flaſhes againſt. I ſay,
if the father pleaſe to let you ſee this, then
that which you call devill will appeare to
be in you, &amp; his power wil appear to your
ſight, &amp; you will ſee that by the power of
the Anointing, the law of love (and by no
other power) you will &amp; muſt be ſet free
from the devil in ſhort time. For firſt, the
Father doth quicken and awake you,
and then he takes away the flaming
ſword, &amp; cauſes the creature that was loſt,
to come into him, and to taſte, and eat of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119616:32"/>
him, who is the tree of life, and ſo to wait
upon him, and live for ever.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it is the letter
that kils, but the Spirit gives life; that
is, the ſtrictneſſe of a righteous Law being
broken by the creature, it kils the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for this is the flaming ſword that
turns every way upon the thoughts,
words, and actions of the ſinner, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but wrath, miſery, and death
in the inward ſight of the minde. But now
the Spirit, the Law of love, this quickens,
and unites the Father and his creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and makes them one: This Spirit
doth burn up, and caſt away the fleſh, and
that enmity, and it caſts the diſpenſation
of wrath out of Gods hand, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
that enmity likewiſe.</p>
               <p>And now God appears not in anger,
as an enemy, and his Declarations are
not in terms of killing, and bruiſing, and
making the creature grone under mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
affrightings, and death: But he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in manifeſtations of love, peace,
and fatherly oneneſs:<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 10.</note> Now all the clouds
and ſtorms are blown over, and the love
of the father ſhines bright and hot upon
the ſoul, making it fruitfull in love, joy,
and peace, in humility, obedience, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119616:33"/>
in God, now the troubler, or devill
is caſt out, and goes; and there is a one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life, peace, liberty and joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and his creature. Wel, this may
be a burthen to ſome, to heare me thus
ſpeak, but to you that the ſon hath given
liberty to, I am confident it will drop
a pretious favour into your ſpirit.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>A poor ſoule that lies under bondage,
before the father ſets him free, is
troubled in a two-fold ſence; both which
are the fruits or effects of the righteous
law,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note> which hath firſt ſlaine the creature, by
taking advantage of diſobedience, and
then holds him under the bondage of
that death, till the law of love ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up the murtherer, and ſet the creature
free.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the poor enſlaved creature is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with many troubles within his own
ſpirit, which no man ſees but himſelfe,
ſuch as theſe; ſometimes he cannot pray,
then he is troubled; &amp; when he doth pray,
he either miſplaces his words, or he hath
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119616:33"/>
been too long, or too ſhort, or ſome ſelf-prayſing
thoughts ariſe, and then he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
he cannot underſtand, nor ſpeak
what is in his heart, and when he findes
himſelf able to ſpeake, then memory
fayles him, and then he is troubled; when
people do not regard him for his
preaching and praying then he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
when others tell him that he muſt
ceaſe praying, and preaching, and ſelf-acting,
and wait upon the Father for his
pure teaching, for time is coming that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one muſt be taught of God, and this
troubles him very much. Well, all theſe
troubles, and ſuch like, proceed from the
ſhinings forth of the righteous law upon
the proud heart, and he cannot bear it,
becauſe he ſeeks himſelfe more then God;
the unbelief of the heart lives by ſence
upon the creature; the law of God tels the
heart, he muſt truſt God, and not man,
and though all ſence fayl him from men
and creatures, yet to waite upon God, but
this troubles him, he cannot wait, and if
he do wait, he queſtions whether he ſhall
have ſuch things he is bid to wait for; and
the poor heart lies under great toſſings.</p>
               <p>Again, in his courſe of trading in the
world, if he ask ſometimes too little, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119616:34"/>
ſometimes too much for his wares, then he
is troubled, and do what he can, his heart
is troubled, becauſe he thinks he might
have done better; when buſineſs goes croſs
to his minde, he is troubled; whether it be
fair weather or fowl, if it be not juſt to
his minde, he is troubled.</p>
               <p>Then appears pride, covetouſneſſe,
frowardneſs, uncleaneſs ſpringing up in his
heart, and theſe trouble him; if he
cannot ſpeak for God, when others ſpeak
againſt him, as he thinks, then he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
if he do ſpeak of the things of God,
then his heart tels him he is an hypocrite,
or ſelf-lover, and then he is trobled; ſo that
there ariſes not a thought in his heart, but
there is ſome fretting, or trouble tyed to
it.</p>
               <p>And vvhat are all theſe, and ſuch like,
but even a legion of devils, or troublers,
that holds the creature under bondage,
and torments him thus in hell day and
night. I call it a hell, for it is a condition
of darkneſs, below the life, comfort, and
peace of God. All theſe are wrought in
the ſoul by the righteous Law; for the
creature ſtrives to be wiſe, and the Law
proves him a fool; he would fain be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and the light of the Law ſhews him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119616:34"/>
he is a wicked hypocrite; he would fain
have faith and holineſs in him, and the
Law ſhews him he is an unbelieving ſinner;
he would fain enjoy the peace of God,
and yet enjoy himſelf too, the Law tels
him, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up
his croſs daily if he would enjoy God; he
would fain be counted ſome body for
wiſdom, faith, prayer, preaching, the
Law tels him, all is as good as nothing,
becauſe he goes forth in his own ſtrength,
and the power of the father is abſent.</p>
               <p>And thus the Law is that flaming ſword,
which turns every way upon the ſinner,
and ſcorches the poor impriſoned ſoul in
every thought of his heart,<note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> burning up his
pride and ſelf-conceit; ſo that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Law raigns like a Tyrant in,<note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 1, 2.</note> and over
the poor priſoner; and while the ſoul is
thus tormented by the diſpenſation of
wrath, the envious ſpirit of darkneſs that
rules in other men, delights to ſee this
poor creature thus under bondage, and
ſo caſts jeers, ſlanders, reproaches, and
hard uſage upon him: Envy rejoyces in
others miſery, even as Love rejoyceth in
the liberty and life of others. But poor
ſoul, know this, that God is burning up
thy droſs, and ere long vvill ſet thee at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119616:35"/>
and the fire of love that burns in
thee, will break forth to thy comfort, and
then he will give thee power to rejoyce
over the Devill,<note place="margin">Heb. 1 13.</note> and to ſet thy feet upon
his neck as a conquered ſlave, even as he
makes thee his ſlave now.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, This ſame impriſoned
creature that lies under the Law, being as
yet not ſet free by the Son, meets with
many troubles without, and theſe are but
diſpenſations of wrath, as the other was
likewiſe, as ſickneſſe, frowns of friends,
hatred of men, loſſes of his eſtate by fire,
water, being cheated by falſe ſpirited
men, death of his cattle, or many ſuch like
caſualties, whereby he becomes poor in
the world, and meets with many ſtraits,
as hard language, hungry belly, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
impriſoned, and abundance of ſuch
provocations in the vvorld.</p>
               <p>And it may be meets with fearfull Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſions
in the night or day, that terrifies
him; as it was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, he was filled with
terrors in the night; ſometimes theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
lie within a mans ſpirit in griefs, and
ſadpreſſures, &amp; inward burnings of trouble
and torment, which no man is ſenſible of
but himſelf, and ſometimes it breaks forth
in bitter words and ſpeeches, through op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119616:35"/>
of the ſpirit, to the diſturbance
of others, and this is called madneſs, or
diſtraction, which grows upon a man, when
the pure Law doth croſs his carnall imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
wilfull will, pride, covetous; or luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deſires, then doth the diſtemper of
his troubled ſpirit break out.</p>
               <p>But when Chriſt comes and ſets him
free,<note place="margin">Luke. 21. 17. &amp;c.</note> then he comes to ſee, that whatſoever
did befall him, muſt befall him, it was the
will of the father, for the burning up of
his droſs, and pride of fleſh, and ſhall be
made to ſay, Father, thy will be done, and
for ever, yea, infinitely for ever be thy
name praiſed, that thou haſt given me
ſuch a heart to be content, and ſubmit in
love and meekneſs to thee, and to take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing in love from thee, this is thine
own handiwork, it was not thus former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but thou haſt drawn me through a nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 3.</note>
and pinching wilderneſs, into this
land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> even to lie down in reſt
in thine own boſome, prayſed be thy
name.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the poor troubled ſoul is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at my words, and thinks, and ſaies,
this cannot be, it is impoſſible that any
man ſhould have ſuch a frame of ſpirit.
Alas poor man, I have been as thou art,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119616:36"/>
but if thou canſt believe in Gods love and
power, from the teſtimony of another,
thou wilt believe this for a truth: But
if thou cannot believe,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 45.</note> but yet remain
troubled, he that feels the ſweetneſs of ſuch
a work of God, knows it to be a truth;
wait upon God as thy fellow ſervant doth,
for his pure teaching, and thou wilt finde
him the ſame to thee as he is to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writes of one that was in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and ſo, though thou wade
through flames of fire, to imbrace God in
thine armes, thy comforts will be the
ſweeter, thy experience the more, and
thou wilt greatly rejoyce, in that thou haſt
been in ſo hot a fire, when the father
cauſes thee to lie down in his boſom the
liberty in this reſt is now ſo ſweet to thee.</p>
               <p>And truly friends, let me tell you; that
which hath been often of late whiſpered
into my ſpirit, and I believe there is
ſomething in it; that this wrath, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
and diſcontent that appeares
generally in mens ſpirits in <hi>England,</hi> one
againſt another, upon the breakings forth
of the truths of God, doth whiſper in my
ſpirit, that the Father hath caſt <hi>England</hi>
into the fire,<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 5, 6.</note> and is purging the droſſe
from the gold, that liberty is not far off,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119616:36"/>
and that the plentifull pouring out of the
Anoynting, even the ſpirit of love,
truth, and oneneſſe is near at hand; and
that <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo
ſet at liberty from the bondage of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
within, and the diſpenſation of wrath
without, ſhall be the tenth part of the
City <hi>Babylon</hi> that ſhall fall off firſt, and
bow down at the feet of the Anoynting,<note place="margin">Eſa. 60. 14.</note>
which is the wiſdom and power of God,
that rules in fleſh, as <hi>Eſay</hi> propheſied, but
whether God will manifeſt ſo great a
work in this kingdome, or no, at this time,
his will be done; but this I know, much
may be ſaid of the workings of Gods
power in this kinde in particular mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and as the father enlarges his
hand, this manifeſtation of his love will
ſpread.</p>
               <p>There is more hopes of a bitter ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpirit to be brought into God,<note place="margin">Rev. 21 8.</note> as
this kingdome is generally full of, then
of a ſmooth,<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 25.</note> cloſe, fawning, hypocriticall,
ſelf ſeeking, fearefull ſpirit, that playes of
all ſides, for ſelf-ends ſake. God received
perſecuting and bitter ſpirited <hi>Paul</hi> to
mercy, when as he let hypocriticall, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> go by, as it were
not counting him worth the minding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:119616:37"/>
All that I ſhall ſay, is this; you Saints of
God, that taſte how ſweet the love of the
father is,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 1.</note> bear patiently with hot ſpirits,
God doth beare with them, for he ſuffers
more then you, he is called the great long
ſufferer;<note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 1.</note> and when Gods love begins to
ſhine forth upon them, he can, and it may
be wil make ſome of them to out-ſtrip you
in experience of his love, good will, and
power, and ſo fill them abundantly with
the ſpirit of joy.</p>
               <p>But ſome do object againſt what I
have ſpoken, and ſay, are not thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
which fell, devils diſtinct from God, as
man is diſtinct from God;<note place="margin">Jud 6.</note> as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks,
And the Angels which kept not their firſt
eſtate, but left their own habitation, he
hath reſerved in chaines of darkneſs, unto
the Judgement of the great day.</p>
               <p>To anſwer this: Firſt I ſhall note; that
as heaven is ſet before us in a two-fold
glory; ſo are Angels.</p>
               <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor 3. 17.</note> every particular Saint is a true
heaven, or place of glory; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Father dwels in him, but becauſe
he dwels in the Father likewiſe, as thus;
the Father delights in him, and manifeſts
himſelfe to this his ſon, and his ſon by the
clear ſight, and feeling of this manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119616:37"/>
is filled with joy and glory in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſo that here is a mutuall fellowſhip
of joy, and oneneſs of love between them.
And this is Gods Kingdome, even for fleſh
to be filled with Gods glory, and indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
preſence in love; and this is heaven
in a leſſer ſence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the whole City <hi>Sion</hi> is true
heaven, or a place of the fathers glory,
which is but the perfection of the former
joy, for as the father dwels and rules as a
King of righteouſneſſe and love, in one
Saint, ſo he dwells in all, and all of them
dwell in him;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 31.</note> as he enjoyes them for his
delight, ſo they enjoy him for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>And as all, and every one of them ſees,
enjoyes, and glories in the Father, ſo they
ſee, enjoy and glory one in another,
every one knowing, ſeeing, and ſweetly
rejoycing in the unity,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31.</note> and oneneſs of
each others ſpirit it being the ſpirit of the
father,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4 6.</note> nay, the father himſelf, who is the
ſpirit that fills all in all; and knits them
together into one body, treading down
all oppreſſing powers of the fleſh for
ever, under their feet; and this is heaven
in the largeſt ſence, which every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſon and daughter of the father ſhall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119616:38"/>
enjoy hereafter, though they are now
ſcattered abroad among the <hi>Sodomites</hi> of
this unrighteous world, that vexes their
pretious ſoules from day to day.</p>
               <p>And as heaven, I ſay, is ſet before us in
this two-fold glory, ſo the Angels are ſet
before us in a two-fold glory likewiſe.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the particular ſparks of glory,
or heavenly principles in man, which the
father hath ſet as lights, to make known
himſelfe in his Saints; as love, humility,
ſincerity, content, and reſt in God, and
ſuch like, theſe are Angels, and Angels of
glory too; becauſe they are ſparks of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
iſſued out of the father, into earthen
veſſels, and makes them to become the
ſalt of the earth, and light of the world.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, Men that are wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into God, are called Angels, ſuch
as have all their ſences ſpiritually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the father, that can ſee, hear, taſte,
ſmell, and handle the excellent and
glorious father; and ſo Jeſus Chriſt being
a man ſo taken up into the father, for he
was a man fully anointed, the God-head
dwelt bodily in him;<note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> he was called an
Angel, the Arch-Angell, and Angel of his
preſence, for he was the glorious ſparke,
and light of the father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:119616:38"/>
And when men ſhall be, and are ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into God, they are called Angels,
and Angels of heaven too; becauſe the
father dwels, and glories in them, and they
live, dwell, and glory in the father,
and theſe are the Angels, which the father
ſends to do his will.</p>
               <p>As firſt, the ſeverall meaſures of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are ſparks of his glory; as love, joy,
humility, ſincerity, and peace in God,
and ſuch like; theſe are particular Angels,
which the father ſends down into humane
fleſh, to keep it in all his wayes, that it
may not deſperately blaſphem God, and
ſo daſh againſt the rock; and ſuch Angels
as theſe every ſon and daughter of the
father doth enjoy, more or leſſe; and if it
were not for theſe, temptations would
preſently overcome them, but theſe are
ſpirituall powers from God, that keep
them upright in all their wayes, and which
makes them differ from the world.</p>
               <p>And then, for men that are wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into God, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as Chriſt
was, they are miniſters or Angels, which
the father ſends forth to ſpeake, and do
his will before, and in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the world in theſe dayes learne
meekneſſe, and wiſdome, and lay aſide
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119616:39"/>
their envy, leſt in the day of account they
be found beating and killing ſuch as the
father ſends in his name.<note place="margin">Ioh 5 43.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But now to anſwer to the objection:
We are to note, that Angels in this latter
ſence, which are men taken up into God,
and made perfect, can never fall from
God, and ſo become Devils and enemies
againſt God; for this is the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which is unchangable, and the
father dwels and rules in them, and hath
bruiſed the ſerpents head in them, never
to revive again in them; and they likewiſe
live, and dwell in God, whoſe power
treads all enemies under their feet.</p>
               <p>And they have the ſparks of glory, or
Angels of light within them; which are
the ſeverall meaſures of the fathers ſpirit
poured into them, which remaines for
ever; and they themſelves are Angels of
light, ſent from the father, to do his will
here in this low condition of weak fleſh.</p>
               <p>But now Angels in the former ſence,
which are divine ſparks of glory, planted
in humane nature, in its firſt creation,
which was the habitation where they
were ſeated; theſe are faln from their
excellency, and are become Devils, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Angels, or ſpirituall powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119616:39"/>
I ſhall declare what I know by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
that fell; they were thoſe glorious
lights, and ſparks of glory, ſhining An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of light, in their ſeverall meaſures and
degrees, which God had placed in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall. As his
love of God, delight in God, Peace
and reſt in God, humilitie before God,
obedience and ſelfe deniall before God,
and all ſuch like; theſe all lived in God, for
he was the Center from which they came,
and to which they reflected back again,
they being all alive within <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Adam</hi> being alive within them.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Adam</hi> hearkened to the
whiſpering of that a ſpiring ſelfiſhneſſe,
that was the ſerpent, which twiſted it ſelf
round about the tree, <hi>Adam,</hi> and every
glorious light that was in that humane
creation; and when <hi>Adam</hi> (or indeed any
man, or woman) doth give way to ſelf,
and eat of that fruit, that is, delight in
ſelf, above the King of righteouſneſſe in
man then thoſe glorious Angels left God
their habitation, and took up their glory
within the circle of humane de<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed fleſh,
and ſo become enmity againſt God.</p>
               <p>For now the mans love is turned from
living in the King of righteouſneſſe, to live
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119616:40"/>
in corrupted fleſh,<note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 14.</note> it is become a ſelfe love,
and ſo envious againſt God; his delight
and his joy is become ſelf delight, he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in himſelf, which is his pride; his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
doth live in himſelfe, for he gives
way to all the whiſperings of the fleſh,
and luſts within himſelf; but diſobeys
the command of righteouſneſſe within
him. And further, his ſincerity is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hypocriſie, and his imagination works
ſtrongly, how to pleaſe the fleſh, in the
motions of it, not how to pleaſe the ſpirit
of truth and holineſſe,</p>
               <p>And now thoſe glorious ſparkes which
were Angels of light, while they lived in
God, and reflected upon him, are become
Angels of darkneſſe, or legions of devils,
murtherers, or deceivers, according to
their many degrees and meaſures, while
they live in unrighteous fleſh, and reflect
upon the diſobedient creature, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and to honour the being of the fleſh,
before the righteous God that governs in
the fleſh; thus they are faln.</p>
               <p>And theſe devils or deceivers (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
pride, covetouſneſſe, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of proud fleſh doth deceive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man) they are reſerved in chaines of
darkneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:119616:40"/>
Theſe chains are the diſpenſations of
Gods wrath through his righteous Law;
for upon every one, and upon all of theſe
faln Angels, the righteous ſparks, or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
forth of the righteous Law, like a
flame of fire, turning every way, meets
with them,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> bindes them, keeps them in,
and reſtrains them within bonds: ſo that
God hath theſe powers of ſelf-ſeeking
fleſh at his command; they cannot appear,
nor act but by his leave.</p>
               <p>Pride, ſelf-love, envy, hypocriſie, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
cruelty, cannot act, but by his leave;
and when he doth ſuffer them to act, then
his righteous Law is preſently made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
following their heels like fire, burning
up the ſtubble.</p>
               <p>For God never ſuffers theſe devils to
appear, either within a man, or by ſome
violent way to break forth of men for the
hurt one of another; but he makes uſe
thereof to ruine and deſtroy that power
of darkneſs, even that poyſonous power
of covetous fleſh.</p>
               <p>And they are called chains of darkneſs,
in oppoſition to the Law of perfect love
and liberty; for while theſe Angels lived
in God, they had no reſtraint, for love
God, and thou art at liberty, thy whole
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119616:41"/>
ſoul is free, and no bondage lieth upon
thee.</p>
               <p>But when thou loveſt ſelf and fleſh, then
all thy powers run ſelf-ward, and then the
flaming ſword, which is the righteous ſpirit
of burning, doth flame upon thee, burns
thee, and reſtrains thee, and holds thee
under bondage: But how long?</p>
               <p>Till the Judgement of the great day,
that is, till the power of Chriſt do make
it appear to the mans clear knowledge,
that ſelf and fleſh is the devill and ſerpent,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 15.</note>
and by his power of righteouſneſs, doth
not only judge and condemn that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but caſts him into the lake of fire,
and conſumes him to nothing, as if his
power had never been; and ſo ſets the
creature free, according to the myſterie of
God.</p>
               <p>And here note, that the reſtauration, or
ſalvation which is pointed at in the letter
of the Scripture, doth lie in the reſtoring
of the creature, Mankinde, from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of theſe Angels of darkneſs; and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindes
redemption lieth in the breaking of
thoſe chains of darkneſs aſunder, and ſo
taking him into the life, liberty, and peace
of the King of righteouſneſs. As thus,</p>
               <p>Whereas in this preſent poyſoned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119616:41"/>
of Mankinde in which fleſh glories
it ſelf, as in ſelf will, delight, and ſelf-love,

all work fleſhward, and ſelfward; and the
maſculine powers that rule the ſoul, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be envy, hypocriſie, pride, anger,
ſelf-ſeeking, ſubtilty, and ſuch like. And
the ſpirit of truth,<note place="margin">Ro. 1. 18.</note> who is the Father, by
whom the creation, man, doth live, move,
and hath his beeing, doth lie buried under
that unrighteous fleſhie power.</p>
               <p>But now in the reſtored eſtate which the
Father hath begun to work, and which his
people wait for compleatneſs of. I ſay
now, All the powers of the ſoul, as his
love, delight, and peace, &amp;c. run God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
again, and is centured in the Father
again.</p>
               <p>And thoſe powers of the fleſh, as pride,
covetouſneſs, raſh anger, love of ſelf, and
imagination working to advance all theſe,
which are, as I ſaid, the Angels of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in man: Theſe are now in this day
of judgement condemned and deſtroyed,
trod under foot, and buried out of minde
like a dead man, without beeing; And the
Lord alone is exalted now in this day of
reſtauration which is the day of his power.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the myſterie of all, King
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119616:42"/>
fleſh and ſelf is dis-throned,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> and the
King of righteouſneſs in fleſh hath begun
to take the Kingdom, and doth raign, and
will raign, and his dominion ſhall ſpread,
and endure for ever and ever; for though
he take the Kingdom by ſtrength out of
King fleſh his hand,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 26. &amp;c.</note> yet none ſhall ever be
able to take it out of his hand again, for of
his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing people are not yet taken off
from looking upon other mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I ſhall mention this one Scripture,
which if people did feelingly underſtand,
the diſtemper of their ſpirits would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is this,</hi> Light is come into the world,
and men love darkneſſe rather then light,
becauſe their deeds are evill.</p>
               <p>The <hi>world</hi> is mankinde, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man and woman is a perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 16.</note> a perfect created world;
that if a particular branch of mankinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to know what the nature of other men
and women are, let him not look abroad,
but into his own heart, and he ſhall ſee:
ſo that I ſay, man is the <hi>world,</hi> a perfect
creation, from whoſe poyſoned fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the
fleſh, and the pride of life; theſe are not
of the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119616:42"/>
Now <hi>light is come into this world;</hi> that
is,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19. &amp;c.</note> the ſpirit of right underſtanding hath
taken up his dwelling in this fleſh;<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 25.</note> and
from hence man is called a reaſonable
creature, which is a name given to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature but man, becauſe the ſpirit
of reaſon appears, acting in him, which if
men did ſubmit themſelves unto, they
would act righteouſneſs continually; and
ſo man would become Lord of all other
creatures in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I, <hi>But men love darkneſs rather then
light;</hi> men here ſpoken of, are the evill
maſculine powers of created man in his
poyſoned eſtate, as man pride, man cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
man hypocriſie, man ſelf-love,
and King imagination, that rules over all,
and in all theſe; and this, or theſe, is the
wicked man, ſpoken of in ſcripture; theſe I
ſay, are called men, becauſe they rule over
the created fleſh, which is the feminine
part, and leads it captive in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and will not ſuffer it to obey the
King of righteouſneſs, which is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
likewiſe in the creation, man.</p>
               <p>For I ſay, every particular man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is a perfect creation, or a world of
him, or her ſelf: And thoſe powers are the
men that live and raign in that poyſoned,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119616:43"/>
created world, for theſe will not ſubmit
to righteouſneſs; and what is the reaſon?</p>
               <p>VVhy, becauſe their deeds are evill:
Indeed covetouſneſs is an evill man,<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 7.</note> and
pride and envy are evill men, and all the
reſt of their imaginary companions in the
ſoul, they are evill men, yea, the wicked
man, and all their actions are evill like
themſelves, and they will not ſubmit
themſelves to righteouſneſs. That mightie
man of truth, whoſe dwelling is in fleſh
likewiſe, he dwels in heaven and hell, that
is, he dwels in cleanſed fleſh his Saints,
where he is ſeen and known; he dwels in
uncleanſed fleſh, the vile ones of the earth,
where he is unknown, and unſeen by them;
though he, as he is the righteous Judge,
doth check and condemn them, yet they
ſmother his ſmitings within themſelves,
and will not ſubmit; for which diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake, their ſpirit is filled with horror
and bitterneſs, and they roar in hell.
Speak thou wretched man, if thou haſt
not found terrible affrightings and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
within thy ſelf, when thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to act the righteous motion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
within, who indeed is the King
of glory, though thou art ignorant of him,
and ſubmitteſt thy ſelf to King fleſh in all
the beaſtly actings of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:119616:43"/>
Well, theſe maſculine powers of the
poyſoned fleſh ſtand it out againſt the
King of glory, till he caſt them into the
lake of fire, into his own ſpirit, by which
they are tried, and being found but chaffe,
and not able to endure, are burned, and
conſumed to nothing in the flame.</p>
               <p>No man or woman needs to be trobled
at this, for let every man cleanſe himſelf of
theſe wicked maſculine powers that rule
in him, and there will ſpeedily be a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of love in the great creation, even
among all creatures.</p>
               <p>Therefore let no man look without
himſelf, and ſay, other men will not obey
this light that is come into mankinde;
but let him look into his own heart, and
he ſhall finde that the powers of his heart
are thoſe very men of the world, that
will not ſubmit to that light of reaſon
that is come into it.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 21.</note> that God ſent his Angell,
and cut off by him all the mighty men of
valour in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> army; therefore
Angels are a mighty power between God
and man, and diſtinct from both.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, Angels in this ſence are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſent by commiſſion from God to do
a particular work. As firſt, Good Angels
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119616:44"/>
are ſent, and theſe are inward diſcoveries
of God to, or within a ſoul, ſuch as was
ſent to <hi>Jacob</hi> to awake him; for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of the Fathers power within,
do make the creature, man, watchfull, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to foreſee &amp; prevent a danger, or elſe
to ſupport the drooping ſoul in trouble,
through the hope or expectation of ſome
bleſſing, or deliverance, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſpoken to the heart, and this the
Father doth in a two-fold ſence.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſpeaking inwardly, as to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King 19 6.</note> the Angell of the Lord touched him,
and bid him ariſe, and eat, this was a
ſpeaking to <hi>Eliahs</hi> heart, either by voice,
viſion, dream, or revelation.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes by the voice of a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
man, ſtanding before them, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
that brought the glad tidings to
<hi>Sampſon,</hi> the two Angels that came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and <hi>Lot;</hi> theſe were materiall
men, taken up into the ſpirit of the Father,
and ſent by him to do ſuch a work, and
their vaniſhing away, as the interpreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, it is no other but their departure
from <hi>Sampſon, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> when
they had done the work they were ſent
about.</p>
               <p>But now according to the Objection,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119616:44"/>
ſuch Angels as are ſent to deſtroy, are
called evill Angels, according to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
capacity, becauſe they are miniſters
of ſuch things as the creatures call evill,
though in themſelves, as being ſent from
God, and in the execution of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
they are good; but I ſay, they are
called bad, becauſe their work is of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature to them that are called
good Angels;<note place="margin">Iob 1. 10, 11.</note> Satan, that envious Angel
did the will of God, in troubling <hi>Job,</hi> for
the end of that trouble was good to him,
his laſt dayes being his beſt dayes.</p>
               <p>And theſe evill Angels are three-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſuch as are ſent into the ſoul, when
the Juſtice of God goes forth upon a
man, and ſtrikes him with blindneſs of
minde, and hardneſs of heart, as he ſmote
<hi>Pharaoh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 9. 17.</note> and theſe are ſtrong powers of
darkneſs, that holds the creature in chains
of bondage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when he ſends the ſword, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and famine, or the like, &amp; gives them
commiſſion to waſte &amp; to deſtroy a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
people, theſe are Gods Angels, or
mighty powers, to which he hath given
a commiſſion to go forth, and to perform
ſuch a work, and this you ſhall ſee in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
that which was called the deſtroying
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119616:45"/>
Angell in one <hi>verſe,</hi> is called the peſtilence
in ths next <hi>verſe. 1 Chron.</hi> 21. 12, 13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, when wicked people are
ruled by King envy, King covetouſneſſe,
or King pride, that uncleane ſpirit that
rules in the children of diſobedience;
and when theſe have a liberty given to
them, to go on and proſper without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint;
now they are mighty powers, or
Angels ſent by God, either to waſte and
deſtroy, or elſe to be a terrible warning
to a ſleepie people, to awake them, as the
King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was ſent to do a worke
in that kinde,<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.</note> that is, to whip the Nations,
but to brighten <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when his work was done, then he
himſelf was deſtroyed by another pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or Angel which God ſent to take him
off, for his cruell and unrighteous act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
like that of <hi>Gideons</hi> Army, when <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
began to obey the Lord; then the
Lord ſent an Angel, which was no other
but a mighty ſpirit of feare and confuſion
of minde among the <hi>Midianites, Iſraels</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
which made them to deſtroy one
another, while <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the liberty to

the fleſh was as the woman to the man, or
the box that carryed that precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in; and this man is ſat down at the
right hand of the father, that is, he is the
ſtrength of the father, whereby he deſtroys
King fleſh, and he ſits in the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
that is, in thoſe Saints that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up the higheſt into the father, and
lives in him, treading the curſe under
foot.</p>
               <p>And as the body of his fleſh in his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,
ſo called, went out of the Apoſtles
ſight, in a cloud of the Skies, ſo ſhall the
ſame mighty man riſe up out of the earth,
that is, from under the earthy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119616:46"/>
and luſts of the ſons of men; for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is the earth that containes him buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and out of this earth he is to ariſe, and
appeare in the clouds, that is, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to ſhew himſelfe in a man or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the fleſhy powers in thoſe enſlaved
ſoules will, and do riſe up to darken
the light of that ſun as long as he can, till
he, the fleſh, who is the wicked man, or
the curſed thing that dwels within (man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde)
be taken away.</p>
               <p>And therefore if you expect,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> or look
for the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor 5. 16.</note> you
muſt know, that the ſpirit within the fleſh
is the Jeſus Chriſt, and you muſt ſee, feel,
and know from himſelf his own reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
within you, if you expect life and
peace by him.</p>
               <p>For he is the life of the world, that is,
of every particular ſon and daughter of
the father, who are every one of them
a perfect created world of themſelves, and
need not to ſeek abroad after other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for teaching, for every one hath the
light of the father within himſelf, which
is the mighty man, Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And he is now riſing and ſpreading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in theſe his ſons and daughters, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119616:47"/>
ſo riſing from one to many perſons,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 9.</note> till
he enlighten the whole creation (man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde)
in every branch of it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> and cover
this earth with knowledge, as the waters
cover the ſeas.</p>
               <p>And this is the lightning that ſhall ſpread
from Eaſt to Weſt;<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 21</note> this is the kingdome
of heaven within you, dwelling and ruling
in your fleſh: therefore learne to know
Jeſus Chriſt, as the father knows him; that
is, not after the fleſh; but know, that the
ſpirit within the fleſh, is that mighty man
(Jeſus Chriſt) and the fleſh takes it name
from that mighty man of truth that dwels
within it;<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> he within governs the fleſh, he
within laid down the fleſh, when he was
ſaid to die; he within is the wiſdome and
power of God, he within is to ariſe, not
at a diſtance from men, but will riſe up in
men, and manifeſt himſelfe to be the
light and life of every man and woman
that is ſaved by him.</p>
               <p>For a meek ſpirit bears the name (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus)
And a man filled with the power of
God, or a man taken up into God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one in ſpirit within; beares the name
(Chriſt) &amp; therefore you are not ſaved by
believing there was ſuch a man, that lived
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119616:47"/>
and died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for though you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was ſuch a man, yet that is not
ſaving faith to you,<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 5.</note> till you feel the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a meek ſpirit come into you, and
raigne King, and tread all your envy,
frowardneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9</note> and bitterneſſe of ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot; and till you feel and ſee the
power of the righteous ſpirit come into
you, and raigne King, treading all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
of the fleſh whatſoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, making a conquered ſlave of
that wicked man in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And ſo changing your vile bodies,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> and
making them like his glorious body;<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39</note> that
is, making the bodies of your fleſh ſubject
to the ſpirit of the father within it, as the
bodie of the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſpirit, his father, that dwelt
within him in all things.</p>
               <p>So that you do not look for a God now,
as formerly you did, to be a place of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beyond the Sun, Moon and Stars, nor
imagine a divine beeing you know not
where, but you ſee him ruling within you;
and not only in you, but you ſee and
know him to be the ſpirit and power that
dwels in every man and woman; yea, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
creature, according to his orbe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the globe of the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:119616:48"/>
So that now you ſee, and feel, and taſte
the ſweetneſſe of the ſpirit ruling in your
fleſh, who is the Lord and King of glory
in the whole creation, and you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
with him who is the father of all
things. Now you are inlightened, now
you are ſaved, and riſes higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
into life and peace, as this manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the father increaſes, and ſpreads
within you.</p>
               <p>And this is it,<note place="margin">1 Cor 3. 16.</note> to be ſaved by Jeſus
Chriſt, for that mighty man of ſpirit hath
taken up his habitation within your body,
and your body is his body, and now his
ſpirit is your ſpirit, and ſo you are become
one with him, and with the father; and
this is the faith of Chriſt, when your fleſh
is ſubject to the ſpirit of righteouſneſſe, as
the fleſh of Chriſt was; and this is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> when the actings &amp; breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of your ſoules is within the center
of the ſame ſpirit, in which the man Jeſus
Chriſt lived, acted, and breathed.</p>
               <p>If you live in the fleſh, that is, if you be
ſubject to the powers of the fleſh within
you, then you believe in the fleſh, and
bring forth the fruit of the fleſh, which is
ſelf-conceit, covetouſneſs, envy, pride, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:119616:48"/>
But if you live in Chriſt, that is, in that
mighty and ſpirituall man of truth,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> then
you believe in him, and bring forth the
fruit of the ſpirit, which is love, joy peace,
humilitie, obedience, ſincerity, and the
like: If Jeſus Chriſt that mighty King rule
in you, he will check, and condemne every
unrighteous thought, as well as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
words, and looſe actions, though no
other man ſee and know your ſecret wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
but your ſelves; and he will ſpeake
peace, and Juſtifie you within, when your
fleſh in any things is ſubject to him, though
you are hated, ſlandered, and mightily
oppreſſed by the injuſtice of others.</p>
               <p>But if King-fleſh rule, then you go on
in ſecret and open wayes of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with greedineſs and delight, and
have no checks within at all: Now the
ſtrong man of ſin keeps the houſe, your
bodies, and every thing enjoyes a ſeeming
peace within you: But this is not the peace,
nor the liberty, but a fore runner of great
torment in the day of Judgment; that is,
when the Judge, the King of righteouſneſs
ſhall appeare to ſit upon the throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, judging and condemning this
ſerpent, or man of ſin within you, and ſo
bruiſing his head, that you who have been,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119616:49"/>
and are piſoners thereunto, may live in the
light &amp; peace of the father, &amp; ſo ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from bondage, &amp; aſſure your ſelves,
you that glory in fleſh, you ſhall not go
ſcot-free, you ſhall be caſt into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
burnings as well as others, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that fire, as gold in the furnace.</p>
               <p>And this fire is the father himſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> into
whom, when any creature fals, he burns up
the droſſe in the creature, which is the
curſe that came in through unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which is all the imaginary glory of
the fleſh, and ſo makes man to appeare and
ſtand bright before him; you cannot burne
away the droſſe, but the gold muſt ſuffer
the heat of the fire, the father cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the ſerpent, the man of ſin, out of
my body, but I that have been incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into that nature of the ſerpent, muſt
needs ſuffer paine; this droſſe and gold
in man is ſo mixed together, that nothing
can ſeparate them but the fiery orb, which
is the father himſelfe, that tries all things.</p>
               <p>And here likewiſe lies a great deluſion
within mankinde;<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 42.</note> you call the father your
God, and the word God is much in your
mouths; but here you deceive your ſelves,
for you know not the father to be your
God, nor Lord, neither can you call
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119616:49"/>
him your God, till you ſee and feele by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that he rules and governs in you,
and that your proud and coveteous fleſh
ſtoopes, and is made ſubject to him.</p>
               <p>When the ſpirit within you doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
your fleſh in rightouſneſſe, and will
not ſuffer frowardneſs, covetouſneſs, pride,
hypocriſie, and the like, to ariſe and act,
but preſently checks and condemns, and
ſhames you; you can then ſpeake in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that the father, who is the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
governour, is your God, and your Lord,
for the powers of your poyſoned fleſh are
made ſuctject to him.</p>
               <p>But ſo long as King-fleſh raignes,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 2.</note> &amp; doth
act pride, envy, covetouſneſs, hypocriſie,
unrighteouſneſſe within you; then he that
you call God, is the devill, that curſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or poyſoned fleſh, even the power of
darkneſs is your God; and you cannot ſay
the father is your God, for if you do, you
deceive your ſelf, you are ſubject to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
you are not ſubject to the father.</p>
               <p>He that looks for a God without himſelf,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note>
and worſhips God at a diſtance, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
he knows not what, but is led away,
and deceived by the imaginations of his
own heart, which is <hi>Belzebub</hi> the great
Devill; but he that looks for a God within
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119616:50"/>
himſelf, and ſubmits himſelfe to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of righteouſneſſe that ſhines within;
this man knows whom he worſhips, for he
is made ſubject to, and hath communitie
with that ſpirit that made all fleſh, that
dwells in all fleſh, and in every creature
within the globe.</p>
               <p>And this is the law and the teſtimony,<note place="margin">Ier. 23 6.</note>
even the law of the ſpirit of righteouſneſſe
within, and teſtimony of the ſpirit within
a man, when a man can ſay, I ſee, feel, and
know that my fleſh is in part ſubject, and
is daily ſubjecting to the great power that
dwels in the whole creation; what I heare
another man ſpeak or write, it is nothing
to me till I finde the ſame experience
within my ſelf; this is the law and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Jeſus, and if any man ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this rule, it is becauſe there is
no knowledge in him, not in the booke
of ſcriptures, which is another mans teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the teſtimony of others is
known to be a truth by the teſtimony of
the ſame ſpirit within your ſelf, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way whatſoever.</p>
               <p>There is one ſcripture hath been often
laid before me by others, and I knew not
the meaning of it; if I went about to ſtudie
or imagine the meaning, I was loſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119616:50"/>
and trouble took hold upon me.
Well, after I found the ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe
to come with power, and
made me quiet within, ſo that I ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my ſelf, let my father give me the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this, or any other truth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me the knowledge of it, his will be
done; I can know nothing till he teach
me, therefore I will lie down before him,
and wait with a quiet ſpirit upon him; I
ſay, I was no ſooner brought into this
waiting frame of ſpirit, not only this, but
divers other truths was, and I can almoſt
ſay, daily is given into me from the father,
to the abundant ſatisfaction of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture is this:<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 28. where
the two men that were poſſeſſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,
cryed out to Jeſus, Art thou come to
deſtroy us before the time?</p>
               <p>I deny not the hiſtory; but that there
were two men really filled and tormented
with devils, or diſtempers, which is the
curſe in mankinde; and that at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Chriſt thoſe troublers in them,
went into the heard of ſwine, and the
ſwine ran into the ſea, and periſhed there.</p>
               <p>But now the matter in this hiſtory ſettles
peace within my ſpirit, as it is ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; and that is this;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119616:51"/>
By the two poſſeſſed, is pointed out to
me, Firſt, the earth (mankinde) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his unrighteouſneſſe is filled
with thornes and bryers, that is, with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
diſtempers of all ſorts, which
are called devills, or ſerpent, or the curſe
of the earth, or the wicked man that
ſowes tares in Gods vineyard (mankinde)
ſo that here is mankinde, or fleſh full
of troublers, or devills diſtempering the
creation; for do but croſſe the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fleſh, and the man grows more or
leſſe diſtracted. This is pointed at by one
of the two that were poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the righteous law of God,
even the ſpirit which is full of love, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and peace in it ſelfe, is enforced
daily to be checking, condemning, and
burning up that power of darkneſs,
or devills in the fleſh; to this end, that the
fleſh may be brought into a oneneſſe with
the father, and be made ſubject to the
ſpirit that made it, and that dwels in it,
though the imaginarie powers of the fleſh
have trod down the ſpirit, and would not
ſuffer him to appear and raign for many
years paſt: I, but now the fullneſs of time
is come for the ſpirituall appearance of
Chriſt, and the ſpirit, who is the Lord our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119616:51"/>
righteouſneſſe, is beginning to tread proud
and covetous fleſh under his feet, and will
take the Kingdome, and raigne himſelf in
man, yea in every man, for every man and
woman, though they be as branches of the
earth, yet they are every one a perfect
creation of themſelves and the ſpirit of
the father dwells ſupremely in every man,
as in the whole globe.</p>
               <p>So that conſidering that mankinde
(through unrighteouſneſſs) hath been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
&amp; ſtands in need of a reſtauration
before he can ſee the father dwell ſuprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him; and that the ſpirit muſt be the
cleanſer &amp; purger of this poyſoned earth,
for he is the everlaſting fire that tries all
things, and that ſeperates the droſs from
the gold; and this ſpirit, or father, is pure
reaſon, which the unreaſonableneſs of the
fleſh cannot ſtand before, but falls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
as chaffe cannot endure the flames
of fire.</p>
               <p>It appears plain, that the righteous
law,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note> the ſpirit, which though it be full of
peace in it ſelfe; yet having ſo powerfull
an enemy as the devill in fleſh, that daily
fights againſt him, he cannot be at reſt,
but is at work continually, though it be a
work wherein he takes delight. As the fire
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119616:52"/>
never ceaſes burning, ſo long as there is
fuell to work upon: ſo that the ſpirit of
burning may be ſaid to be full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in reſpect of the great and varietie
of his work, for he is to deale with every
man and woman in the creation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
when I ſpeak after the manner of
men; for while two parties fight to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
one another, there is a declaration of
troubles on both ſides, to the beholders;
and yet the ſpirit is not full of troubles,
becauſe he kils and deſtroys the devill with
delight, and works the reſtauration of
mankinde with abundance of love and
cheerfulneſs. And this ſpirit is pointed
out to me, to be the other man poſſeſſed:
For the ſcripture is to me but the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a hiſtoricall truth, pointing out
this higher myſterie.</p>
               <p>And as the corrupt power in fleſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to be acting,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 33.</note> and ſhewing it ſelf, ſo
the holy Law, (which is not the letter of
the ſcriptures) but the ſpirit, which is the
law of righteouſneſs, delights to be acting
and ſhewing himſelfe, in deſtroying that
filthy power, or devill.</p>
               <p>And as it is a torment to a man to be
croſſed of his humor or will, ſo it is here
ſpoke after the manner of men: As to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119616:52"/>
a torment to the devill in mankinde, as
indeed it is, to be quite deſtroyed; and as
it were a torment to the righteous Law, as
it is not, but his delight to be taken off his
work of burning and conſuming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>For as it is the devills heaven to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unrighteouſneſs, ſo it is the heaven
to the law of the ſpirit to be flaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
and burning up the devill.</p>
               <p>Now the creature man looks upon theſe
two as they fight one againſt the other
within his heart and fleſh, as a murtherer
of him, for hereby his earthly peace is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
ſo that, Art thou come to deſtroy us
before the time, is a voice proceeding
from the diſtempered man, but it doth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically
point out the voice of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
murtherer in man; for when Chriſt,
who is the mighty man of truth dwells
bodily in his own houſe, the fleſh of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
then all fightings within, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
in the fleſh ſhall ceaſe, and there ſhall
be perfect peace; but two enemies that
ſeek the death one of the other, are both
to be parted, therefore the devill he would
not be taken off vexing the fleſh, becauſe
he would be King in the fleſh: And the
ſpirit of righteouſneſs would not be taken
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119616:53"/>
off, till he hath quite ſubdued the devill
under his feet, and made fleſh ſubject to
him, which ſhall and muſt be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the reſtauration of all things.</p>
               <p>And therefore there being much work
to be done in mankinde, as well as in theſe
two particular men; and the work of the
devill will not ceaſe, ſo long as he hath any
power in fleſh, and the work of the ſpirit
wil not ceaſe, til this ſerpents head be quite
bruiſed, &amp; the fleſh of the whole creation
(mankinde) be made ſubject to the ſpirit,
the Lord that made it; therefore this voice,
Art thou come to deſtroy us before the
time, declares, that Chriſt is the Anointing,
or power of the father, that ſhall end
this quarrell, and that ſhall eſtabliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peace in every man as a branch, and
in the whole creation it ſelf (mankinde)
when the time of the father is come, that
the myſterie of the great governor, God,
is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>So that this hiſtorie of the two men
poſſeſſed with devills, which Chriſt Jeſus
made quiet, doth declare the great work
of the anointing in the latter dayes, when
he ſhall have finiſhed his work, and deliver
up the Kingdome to the father, that is,
he will eſtabliſh love, and peace, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119616:53"/>
between mankinde and the ſpirit
of righteouſneſſe that made it, and the
ſame anointing will deſtroy all this enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is between the fleſh and ſpirit, by
reaſon of the curſe that is in the fleſh,
which is to be burned up, that ſo peace
may be made.</p>
               <p>By the ſwine in the Hiſtory are pointed
out to me, to be men that live upon the
earth, in the imaginary delights and glory
of it, which is a life below God; as the
life of a ſwine, ſnudling up his food from
among the filth of the earth, is below the
life of a man: And this ſwine runs down
the hill, that is, theſe earthly minded
men run lower and lower from God, who
is called <hi>Sions</hi> hill; in hunting after cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
ſelf-love, temporal glory, fleſhy
imaginations, and thoughts.</p>
               <p>Theſe, I ſay, run downwards, further
and further from the life of the ſpirit; they
do not run up the hill of ſelf-denial, and
love of righteouſneſſe, where God dwels.
Now Gods dwelling is not in any locall
place above the skies, as men fancie, and
ſay, God dwels above the heavens.</p>
               <p>But he is ſaid to dwell above, in reſpect
of the fleſhes wiſdom and power; as thus,
Gods wiſdom is above the wiſdom of the

peace and life of the fleſh; for covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
pride, luſt, and envy feeds below,
and licks the duſt of the earth under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and diſtemper: But the love, faith, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and righteouſneſs of the ſpirit lives
above, in liberty, freedom, &amp; perfect peace.</p>
               <p>And God is ſaid to live above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
that is, the ſpirit that is the life and
peace of all things, which is reaſon, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible,
fleſh cannot comprehend
the largeneſſe of it; nay, the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which are the heavens that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
cannot contain him, nor finde out
the heigh, depth, length, and breadth of
that pure ſpirit; therefore he is ſaid not
only to live above the earthy, and
imaginary minded men, but above the
heavens likewiſe; ſpirituall men that live
in the ſpirit, and whoſe fleſh is ſubject to
the ſpirit, theſe are not able to reach the
incomprehenſibleneſſe of him. And ſo he
is ſaid to be above all, to live in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the Saints, yea, and to live above the
heavens in wiſdom and power, yea, and
to tread the earth under his feet, for the
wiſdom of the earth or fleſh is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
not worthy the name of wiſdom,
when it ſtands before the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:119616:55"/>
The ſwine ran into the waters and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
there. By waters, are pointed out
to me the wiſdom of poyſoned fleſh,
which is branched forth into eſtabliſhed
doctrines of the fleſh, into formes, cuſtoms,
and governments of the fleſh, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
men conform unto for fear, and
ſhame of others. And ſo the doctrine and
practiſes of Rome, being altogether after
the fleſh, is called the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
multitudes of people that are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the fleſh, and follow after the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
&amp; luſt thereof, are called ſeas, or great
waters, for theſe indeed are the waters
whereupon the Whore, the diſloyal fleſh
ſits, &amp; makes war againſt the ſpirit in them.</p>
               <p>Now ſwiniſh men, that <hi>Iohn</hi> cals the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the earth, that live in the
fleſh,<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 3 4, &amp;c.</note> not in the ſpirit of the father, they
are drowned, and they periſh in this ſea,
into which they are run, that is, they live
in this ſea which the fleſh hath made, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
and delighting in that ſea, and in
thoſe waters, as a fiſh doth in the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
water, his proper element; they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the life of God, and are
dead to him. But it is ſaid, <hi>Suffer us to go
into the ſwine, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning given to me is this, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119616:56"/>
all the diſtempers that trouble the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 9, 10.</note> man, is hereby declared, that they
ſhall be caſt out of mankinde (the pure
creation,) into the very body of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
which is King fleſh, a ſwiniſh nature,
a herd of ſwine; for all the branches of it
are like ſo many filthy ſwine ſnudling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, as covetouſneſſe ſnuddles
upon the earth, pride licks the duſt of the
earth, envy lives in the filth of the earth,
hypocriſie and ſelf-conceit, with the
imaginary glory of the fleſh, do tumble,
and dwell, and live in the mire of the earth,
that is, delight in nothing but the filth of
mankinde, like ſo many ſwine as they are;
they do not delight in God, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt him.</p>
               <p>And this corrupt power of darkneſſe,
and ſwiniſh nature ſhall run into the ſea,
and confuſion of his own invention, and
imagination, and periſh together, while
as mankinde, by the power of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
ſhall ſit down in peace in the
father, the Lord our righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And where it is ſaid, Chriſt ſuffered
them to go, it points out this, that though
King fleſh rule vvith povver in mankinde,
yet he is but ſuffered ſo to do for a time
by the King of righteouſneſſe: and this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119616:56"/>
ſufferance is for his deſtruction, and mans
deliverance from the bondage of the
fleſh; for the two men were made quiet
by Jeſus Chriſt, while the ſwine periſhed
in the ſea; that is, the creation, man, and
the righteous Law, the ſpirit, ſweetly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
each other, while the filthy powers,
and wiſdom of the fleſh do periſh in
the ſea of his own invention, forms, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
governments, and imaginary
glory.</p>
               <p>So that the Devill is not a third power
between God and man, but he is the curſe
in fleſh; and the power of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is this, when the father ſhines
forth in man, and lets him ſee his curſe,
and ſo begins to condemn, and burn
up the curſe; now the poor creature
not knowing the myſterie of the father,
dieth preſently under ſorrow, beholding
no way of comfort, but miſery on every
ſide; for the ſpirit of brightneſſe hath ſo
beſet the power of darkneſſe within a
man, that the poor heart ſees there is no
poſſibility of peace and comfort, till one
ſide be ſubdued, or a reconciliation be
made. By this means, which is a means,
or work of the ſpirit within, not any
outward means of preaching, &amp;c. the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119616:57"/>
kils, and deſtroyes the powers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
fleſh, and at length made the
created fleſh to ſubmit to him, and live
before him.</p>
               <p>And for proof of this, I will appeal
to the experience of any of you that have
been ſenſible of your bondage, through
the combate that hath been between fleſh
and ſpirit in you, whether you have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon your troubles, as inflicted upon you
by the devill, and adverſe power between
God and you, or have not rather beheld
the anger of God upon you through the
bright ſhining Law of righteouſneſſe in
you, ſhaming, condemning, and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of you for diſobediences ſake.</p>
               <p>It may be the thought of the Law of
God hath not been in your minde, but the
ſenſe of anger and wrath hath lien upon
your ſpirit;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> and whence comes that
wrath, but from the ſhining of the Law
of the ſpirit within you? and wherefore
through this Law? but becauſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the fleſh in you ſeek to advance
ſelf above the ſpirit, or at leaſt to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with him.</p>
               <p>And ſo long as the powers of ſuch aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
ſelf-ſeeking luſts, and ſin rules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, ſo long will the power of the Law,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119616:57"/>
in diſpenſations of wrath and anger,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> in
your apprehenſion, rule in you, and over
you; ſo that this compound murtherer is
of a mighty power, and may be well called
a power of darkneſſe, for it holds you
under darkneſſe and death, and you live
far below both the comforts and life of
God:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 15.</note> As ſoon as diſobedient fleſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
againſt the Law of the ſpirit in you,
the ſpirit appears preſently againſt the
powers of the fleſh in you, and ſo holds
you in fear of death all your life time.</p>
               <p>For indeed your diſobedient fleſh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> which
rules powerfully in all the branches of it,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 2.</note>
which you take pleaſure in, as in pride,
covetouſneſſe, uncleanneſſe, envy, ſelf-conceipt,
hypocriſie, in their ſeverall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
till they riſe up to a number of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of devils: You think this is your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to have your filthy wils ſatisfied herein,
and alas, this is your bondage, and it is
that Devill that was a liar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that never gave true peace to his
children, though he promiſed much; he
carries you away from God by his ſtrong
deluſions, to believe his lies.</p>
               <p>And this power of darkeeſſe in you
caſts you under a more powerfull bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the Law of the ſpirit within you,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119616:58"/>
yea, in utter darkneſſe, wherein you ſtick
faſt, as in mire and clay, or, as in a deep
pit, and cannot get out, it throws you
under wrath, and makes God appear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
which is the greateſt darkneſſe the
poor creature can lie under: What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
darkneſſe can there be, then for a man
never to ſee nor feel the light, heat, nor
warmth of the ſun, but alwaies to live in
ſome dungeon, where the ſun never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p>A meek and humble ſpirit fights againſt
thy raſhneſſe, and ſelf-conceit; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
envy, and grudging oppoſes the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of love; covetouſneſs, and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
fights againſt freedom, and liberty of
ſpirit; and chaſtitie fights againſt unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
the Law of righteouſneſſe fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
unrighteouſneſſe of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>So that if at any time thy heart begins
to deviſe any unrighteouſneſſe within thy
ſelf, the Law of the ſpirit of truth breakes
forth in thee, and lets thee ſee it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,
and ſhames thee for it, and thy
whole ſoul is filled with diſtemper and
horror; And if at any time the power of
unclean fleſh begins to break forth in
thee, the Law of chaſtitie appears, and
ſhews thee thy filthineſſe, and condemns
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119616:58"/>
thee for it, but gives thee no ſtrength for
the preſent againſt thy luſt, ſo that the
power of thy uncleane fleſh, luſting after
folly, is ſtrong in thee; and the power of
the law of chaſtitie ſhewing thee that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination,
is ſtrong in thee likewiſe,
which fills thee with torment.</p>
               <p>And if at any time unrighteous thoughts
and purpoſes riſe up in thee, or unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
actions proceed out of thy hands,
and thou delight therein; yet when the
law of the ſpirit of truth appears in thee,
and ſhews thee thy abominable practiſe,
thy delight in the fleſh dies, peace is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thee, and thy ſpirit is filled with
trouble. I could inſtance in every power
of the fleſh in this kinde.</p>
               <p>And now preſently thou concludeſt, That
the devil, which thou thinkſt is a third pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
diſtinct between God &amp; thee, comes &amp;
torments thee. But no: for it is the very
power of the ſpirit, which is pure reaſon,
which governs the whole globe in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
that ſhews thee thy wickedneſſe,
&amp; the light therof diſcovers thy darkneſs,
and fills thee with ſhame and torment.</p>
               <p>For if the ſpirit ſhine upon thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and trouble thee, it is not barely to
trouble, but to burn up thy luſts, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119616:59"/>
to make thee bright, is the fathers end; but
while thou lieſt between theſe two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
thy peace is gone, all feeling of life
is taken away, and thou lieſt under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yea utter darkneſſe; for thou ſeeſt
no light of peace of any ſide.</p>
               <p>If thou follow the powers of thy fleſh,
as thy uncleanneſs, unrighteouſneſs, envy,
frowardneſs, pride, hypocriſie, and the
like, thou hereby accknowledgeſt that the
fleſh is God, for thou maintaineſt the being
of that wicked man, as though he were
the only one beeing, that dwells in the
globe; but if the father of all things, which
is reaſon, be the only one beeing, that
gave beeing to all, and that keeps all in
peace; then certainly, while thou followeſt
the way of King fleſh,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> thou walkeſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
for thou ſetteſt up another King,
which makes diviſion, which the creation
knowes not, and thou denieſt the King of
righteouſneſſe, which unites the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the creation into a oneneſs of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>That ſpirit that knits all creatures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in peace and ſweet communion of
love and meekneſs, muſt needs be King:
And this doth reaſon, who is the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
father: but that power that makes one
creature a tyrant over another; nay, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119616:59"/>
the creature man within himſelf, and
ſo pulls the creation in pieces, breaking
the bonds of peaceable love, and filling
the creature with torment, and diſtraction,
muſt needs be a divell, or troubler, and
this doth that curſe, that is in the fleſh,
and therefore no King, but a murtherer, a
deceiver, a devill, the ſerpent that muſt
be killed, and the wicked man, that muſt
be taken out of the way.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a condition of bondage doth
this compound power caſt you under; you
are abſent from the liberty, peace &amp; life of
heaven, &amp; you lie tumbling in hell &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to be incorporated into the power of
the wicked one, &amp; to act from his unclean
principles, is the fleſh and blood that ſhall
never enter heaven; never enjoy union and
peace with the ſpirit of righteouſneſs; for
light and darkneſs can never live together.
This is the bond woman &amp; her ſonne, that
ſhall never be heire, nor live in the houſe
with the free woman. And whatſoever is
of this nature, or under this bondage, leſs or
more, doth not taſte of heaven, which is
perfect peace, for that which is bondage
cannot be ſaid to be liberty.</p>
               <p>But for your comfort, poor enſlaved
ſoules: Chriſt, the wiſdom and power of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119616:60"/>
the Father is come to open the priſon
doors,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note> to pull you up out of the earth of
covetouſneſs,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> and ſelf imagination, under
which you have been, and are buried, and
will ſet you even as a corne of wheate that
lies buried under clods of earth, till the
warme, cheriſhing, meeke, and loving ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the earth cauſe it to ſprout, and
ſpring, and ſhoot out, and ſo bring
forth fruitlike himſelf in great abundance;
therefore waite patiently, till you be able
to ſing Allaluia, and to ſay, The Lord God
omnipotent raigneth, and aſſure your
ſelves the viſion will not ſtay long, for
when your fleſh is made ſubject to the
ſpirit, he will ſpeak peace to you, and in
you.</p>
               <p>Since unrighteouſneſs was acted in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
fleſh againſt his maker, every ſon
and daughter of that diſobedient fleſh is
like a man, upon whom two fierce band-dogs
hath laid hold, tearing, and pulling
to pieces: And theſe two are firſt, the curſe,
or ſin in fleſh, which is called the ſerpent,
the father of lies, the wicked man, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the appearance of the
righteous law, dwelling in that fleſh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
as a ſeed buried under the weight
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119616:60"/>
of that curſed earth; and his appearance
is ſo terrible to the diſobedient fleſh, that
it deſtroys at his appearing all the joy
and peace thereof, and is called the
ſeverity of the Law.</p>
               <p>So that firſt the curſe, or ſin, this hath
faſtened upon the man, and puls him from
owning the ſpirit, and ſo makes created
fleſh to rebell againſt his maker.</p>
               <p>And then the father (which the curſe
in the fleſh hath deſpiſed) maintains his
own prerogative in man, and deſtroys,
and kils that rebellion, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the creature, man, is filled with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And this act of the ſpirit is called the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of wrath,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note> or the Law, or the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that kils; for indeed the diſobedient
man ſees, and feels nothing but wrath on
every ſide.</p>
               <p>For let the creature look within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſees and feels no peace; for the
appearance of the ſpirit of righteouſneſſe
is like the offended Law of a King, that
ſpeaks death to the offender which way
ſoever he turn himſelf; it flaſhes like the
flaming ſword every way, and ſo takes
peace from that particular earth.</p>
               <p>And if he look abroad, the ſame decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119616:61"/>
of wrath follows the eye of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and flames out fire in every place, even
as the father is pleaſed viſibly to appear
in outward manifeſtations of juſtice, to
the terrifying of the diſobedient, that he
may know himſelf, and his works, that
they have been unrighteous.</p>
               <p>As in loſſes, ſad accidents, death of
friends, or cattell, caſualties by fire, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
unſeaſonable weather, or the like, and
ſo taking an outvvard peace from the
earth, that is, from divers branches of
diſobedient earth, men and vvomen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them to ſit dovvn in ſorrow.</p>
               <p>And poor ſinners, when they feel, and
ſee ſuch inward and outward miſery, they
cry out, Oh, this is the devill that troubles
them! And ſo look upon the Devill as a
third powerfull beeing, diſtinct between
God and them, working their miſery.</p>
               <p>Alas poor ſinners, this is the devil indeed,
a great troubler,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> but not ſuch a devil as you
fancie; for this Devill, or murtherer, that
takes away your peace is within you, it
is your ſin, and the curſe of your fleſh, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, the fury of the King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
hath ſeiſed, and taken faſt hold;
and now expect no peace in earth, that is,
in your fleſh, till there be peace in heaven,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119616:61"/>
that is, till your fleſh be made ſubject to
the ſpirit, and the Father and you become
one.</p>
               <p>For truly let me tell you, and you ſhall
finde it true, That as the curſe, or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
fleſh in you doth riſe up in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the ſpirit, by ſcoffing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ſelf-loving, deſpiſing, expreſſion
of bitterneſſe and diſcontent againſt the
way of the ſpirit, and ſo ſeeking to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
your ſelves, or your fleſhy luſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Even ſo the Law of the ſpirit will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and the flaſhings of this flaming
ſword will ſpread the more, to advance
the ſpirit, even the King of glory, and ſo
will hedge in your way, and croſſe you at
every turning: And truly, if you ſee the
fury of the Lord to appear more hot and
fierce then formerly, then ſay, and ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That the breakings out of ſin and curſe
is more violent in theſe dayes then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
And it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>For now the bottomleſſe pit is opened,
that is, The curſe, or ſerpent in humane
fleſh is let looſe, to act, and ſhew it ſelf
in his own likeneſſe, and it makes himſelf
manifeſt to be the power of darkneſſe,
the father of lies, the enemies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119616:62"/>
and the Whore, the Beaſt, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all abominations.</p>
               <p>And the four evill Angels, that is, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
Hypocriſie, Envy, and Cruelty,
backed and ſtrengthened with all the
power of Hell, or Curſe, are let looſe, that
is, the ſtrength of theſe are manifeſt, and
act powerfully in theſe dayes; and aſſure
your ſelves that the diſpenſations of
wrath do, and muſt increaſe to the view
of creatures more then formerly.</p>
               <p>But theſe ſad appariſions of inward and
outward wrath will not laſt long, the
time ſhortens apace, and the work of the
Father haſtens apace; for righteouſneſſe
and peace hath begun to take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to raign, whoſe dominion ſhall
have no end.</p>
               <p>When your eyes are opened, you ſhall
ſee that it is the righteous Law, or rule of
truth that thwarts, and croſſes the ſinfull
and curſed principles that rule, and that
ſtill would rule a King in your fleſh.</p>
               <p>And this Law works ſometimes within,
condemning a man within his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
without any outward means, but
the light of the ſpirit within riſes up, and
declares the darkneſſe of the curſe within
the fleſh; and ſometimes it condemns the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119616:62"/>
man within himſelf through the ſight or
hearing of other mens words and actions
without, nay, the very actions of other
creatures are made to be whips to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him.</p>
               <p>Sometimes thou haſt had vain glorious
imaginations riſing up within thee, puffing
up thy mind with big thoughts of thy ſelf,
as if thou wert ſome great body for thy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
riches, parts, prayers, faſting, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to whom every man muſt give reſpect.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt thoughts of covetouſneſſe, of
injuſtice, of uncleaneſſe, and thinkeſt thou
maieſt take thy pleaſure herein, and if any
diſcover thy lewdneſſe in theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which thou ſeeſt no evill in perſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thou haſt thoughts of revenge ariſes in
thee, to make ſuch and ſuch know what
they do to croſſe thee in that thou ſaieſt
and doeſt.</p>
               <p>And thereupon purſues thy reſolution
to get a power, to put thy envious
thoughts (which thou thinkeſt is zeal) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
execution, but thou doſt not do it, and
why? becauſe the opportunities of the
earth will not give thee power: Well, all
this is the ſwelling up of the curſe within
thee, which thou thinkeſt is the ſpirit of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119616:63"/>
holineſſe; a ſtrong deluſion.</p>
               <p>But within a ſhort time after, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(or rather the ſpirit) within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to trouble thee, and fils thy face with
ſhame, and thy heart with a king diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
becauſe thou that art a profeſſor of
a meek and loving ſpirit, which is true
godlineſſe, ſhould have ſuch exalting
thoughts in thee againſt thy fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and conſent unto them.</p>
               <p>Or it may be ſome others may caſt out
jeers againſt thy very thoughts, yet not
knowing thy heart, and thereby thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
multiplie, and peace vaniſheth
from thy proud lifted up heart; and now
thou concludeſt, that this is the devill that
firſt put ill thoughts into thee, &amp; now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
thee for them.</p>
               <p>It is true, it is the devill indeed, but not
ſuch a devill as thou thinkeſt of; for firſt,
the father of lies, thy unclean fleſh, that
was he that inticed thee to envy; and now
the righteous Law of the ſpirit within
thee, ſhews thee thy evill, and ſhames,
and troubles thy minde, and throws thee
under vexation and ſorrow of ſpirit, and
kils all thy comforts, and daſhes all thy
contentedneſſe to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:119616:63"/>
And no man knowes of theſe inward
ſorrowes, but thy own heart; this is the law
and the teſtimony, even the perfect rule
of holineſs that appears in thee, &amp; to thee,
and hedges in the way of the fleſh with
thornes, &amp; throws thee under bondage; this
is the murtherer which thou calleſt the devill;
he is a murtherer indeed of the curſe, though
thou, who art dead under the curſe, maiſt
be made alive in the ſpirit, and live in the
father of peace.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes the Law works without,
and opens the mouthes of others, to ſpeak
againſt thy ſelfe-conceit, in preaching,
praying, or carnall uſe of ſcriptures, and
againſt thy covetouſneſs, and pride, that
makes thee lift up thy ſelf above thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
creatures; and thou thinkſt this is the
devill that tempts thee to forſake God
and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Alas friend, it is the righteous law that
croſſes thy fleſhie hypocriſie, and that
ſends theſe meſſengers as diſpenſers of
wrath to thee, to make thee not to looke
after the letter, but the ſpirit of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to burne up thy droſſe, to conſume
the curſe out of thee, to refine thee, and
make thee pure gold; that is, to make
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119616:64"/>
thee live in, and after the ſpirit; and to
pull thee out of the fleſh; In which, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which thou liveſt.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſpoken. I queſtion
not but the father will let light ſhine into
the ſpirits of his ſervants, that they may ſee
what the devill or murtherer is; which is
the ſerpent, ſin, or curſe, dwelling within
a man, or the power of deceived fleſh
imbittered, and made a ſtinging Scorpion
by the law of righteouſneſſs. <hi>The ſting of
ſin is death,</hi>

                  <hi>and the ſtrength of ſin is the

               </p>
               <p>Now there is none that can free the
creature from this compound murtherer,
or from theſe two band-dogs,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 5.</note> but (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt) who is not a ſingle man at a
diſtance from you;<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 36.</note> but who is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and power of the father, who ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
the whole creation, dwelling and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
King of righteouſneſſe in your very
fleſh. And he it is that comes and puls
off theſe fierce devouring powers, &amp; heals
the creature that they were faſtened upon,
and ſets him free.</p>
               <p>And how doth he doe that? Why, firſt
he deſtroyes the curſe that is in man,
and puls away that ſelfiſhneſs that was in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119616:64"/>
him, which made him to prefer the fleſh
above the ſpirit, and ſo delivers the ſinner
from his envy, covetouſneſſe, diſcontent,
pride, hypocriſie; and makes him patient,
humble, content under Gods hand; makes
him to love, to delight, and to glory
only in God, and ſo makes the creature to
advance God above all, and to ſet the
crown of glory upon his head. And now
that devouring band-dog ſin, or curſe, is
pulled off.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, when ſin or ſerpent
is thus pulled off, and the creature man is
made one with the father,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> and reconciled
in nature and ſpirit to him; then the
other band-dog wrath, or offended law,
which was the ſtrength of ſin, in working
the creatures miſerie, hath nothing left to
faſten upon; But being a righteous law,
now becomes the creatures friend, ſince
the creature by Chriſt is made one with
the righteous father; and thus Chriſt, who
is the wiſdome and power of God, hath
ſet the ſinner free; <hi>And if the ſon make us
free, we are free indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:119616:65"/>
But what is to be underſtood by this
power of God? Why, truly I conceive
this; by the power of God, is not a power
without us only, as it was in the man Chriſt
Jeſus, when he ſuffered death in his own
ſingle perſon, and thereby conquered
hell and death, and overcame the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and caſt the accuſer out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that is, out of fleſh, that the
father might dwell bodily in fleſh, and
tread the curſe under mans feet.</p>
               <p>But the ſame Anointing,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 20. &amp;c.</note> or power
in-dwelling, and ruling whithin us,
and thus the power of love in man,
is the power of God in man; and
this ſets us free from envy; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of patience, and of a meeke ſpirit
in man, is the power of God in man,
and ſets us free from diſcontent; the
power of humilitie in us, is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God in us, and ſets us free from
pride; the power of peace, joy, and
ſweet reſting of heart in God, is the
power of God in us, which ſets us free
from ſorrows, and inward bondage of
minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:119616:65"/>
And thus the power, life, and peace
of the father,<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 5, 6.</note> ruling as God, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
governor in us, and being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

ſpoken of, or the Lord our

power of God (or that Chriſt) that
ſets us free from ſin, and death; for
this is Chriſt in you, which is the hope
of glory, or the earneſt of the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
               <p>And truly theſe,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> and ſuch like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of God within a man, are thoſe
Glorious Angels, in their ſeverall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which the Father hath ſent to
guard his children, and to keep them
in all their wayes, that they daſh not
their foot againſt the rock, even God
himſelf.</p>
               <p>For Love, Humility, Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Joy, and a ſweet reſting of
heart in GOD, makes the creature
ſubmit cheerfully to God in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Let a Son of the Father
meet with Loſſes, Straights, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſious
in the world, and his heart
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119616:66"/>
preſently anſwers, Thy will be done
Father, thou knoweſt I want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
thou knoweſt what thoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
for me are, my heart waits upon
thee, let times be peace or war, let
weather be fair or fowl, ſtill the poor
believing ſoul ſaith, All this is good,
becauſe it is the will and pleaſure of
my Father, who will have it to be
thus.</p>
               <p>And thus the power of the Spirit,
who is the King of righteouſneſſe within
every man, treads down fleſh, and ſets
the creature free from Hell, Death, and
Devill.</p>
               <p>And the wiſdom of the Father is in all
this likewiſe, for he doth this in wiſdom,
to make himſelf known, and that his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being delivered by ſuch a ſtrong
hand, may, out of a feeling experience,
own him, and magnifie his name.</p>
               <p>Well, if you caſt your eyes abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ſons and daughters of men,
you ſhall ſee very few that are ſaved,
and very few in whom Chriſt dwels;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119616:66"/>
And now the ſon of man comes to ſave,
he findes no faith in earth, he findes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
ruling in no man, but King fleſh
ruling in every one.</p>
               <p>But this is comfort to the earth, The
ſon of righteouſneſſe is comming, and
hath begun to heal the earth, he is tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the powers of the fleſh, and he
goes on mightily, conquering, and taking
up ſons and daughters out of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
earth, under which they have lien
buried, to enjoy the Father, and to live
in the oneneſſe of that ſpirit that made
all things, ſo that ere long, the ſweet
ſong that is ſung in private, ſhall be ſung
publickly upon the houſe tops: Rejoyce,
for the Lord God omnipotent raigns.</p>
               <p>Yea, when this mighty power, Chriſt,
is lifted up, he will draw all men after
him, that is, when he is exalted, and known
to be the only ſpirit that dwels in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and that knits every creature into
the one ſpirit, himſelf, then is the time
(which indeed is beginning in theſe
dayes) that he will draw all men after
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:119616:67"/>
So that every one ſhall ſee themſelves in
a loſſe, and ſhall enquire the way to Sion,
even to this ſpirit, the dwelling place of
reſt; they ſhall ſee that books are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
mens words and teachings, ſtudies,
and imaginary thoughts and conjectures
are nothing, but the Lord alone, even
this ſpirit, is all in all, and ſhall be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
honored, and lifted up by all in this
day of his power.</p>
               <p>And how is the ſpirit lifted up? Why
truely, when the fleſh is ſubject to the
ſpirit. And how is that? VVhy thus,
Firſt, to know that this ſpirit which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
God, or Father, or Lord, is Reaſon:
for though men eſteem this word Reaſon
to bee too mean a name to ſet forth the
Father by, yet it is the higheſt name that
can be given him.</p>
               <p>For it is Reaſon that made all things,
and it is Reaſon that governs the
whole Creation, and if fleſh were but
ſubject thereunto, that is, to the ſpirit of
Reaſon within himſelf, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
act unrighteouſneſſe; for if raſh,
froward, and mad anger riſe up in a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119616:67"/>
man, and makes him walk according to
the haſty violence of that Devill, now
he is ſaid truly to be an unreaſonable
man, or a man that is not ſubject to
Reaſon. But if Reaſon be King in a
man, then he moderates the man both
within and without, ſo that he may be
truly ſaid to be a reaſonable man, or
a man ſubject to reaſon, and ſo a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
man amongſt his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>For let reaſon rule the man, and he
dares not treſpaſſe againſt his fellow
creature, but will do as he would be
done unto: For Reaſon tels him, is
thy neighbour hungry, and naked to
day,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 35.</note> do thou feed him, and cloath
him, it may be thy caſe to morrow,
and then he will be ready to helpe
thee.</p>
               <p>VVhen the Curſe in fleſh moves a
man to oppreſſe or deceive his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or to take away his rights, and
liberties, to beat, or abuſe him in any
kinde, reaſon moderates this wicked
fleſh, and ſpeaks within, Wouldeſt thou
be dealt ſo by thy ſelf? Wouldeſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119616:68"/>
thou have another to come and take
away thy Goods, thy Liberties, thy
Life? No, ſaid the fleſh, that I would
not: Then ſaith Reaſon, Do as thou
wouldeſt be done unto; and hereby the
envious, and covetous, and proud fleſh
is killed, and the man is made very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.
And this ſpirit of Reaſon is
not without a man,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 27.</note> but within every
man, he needs not run after others, to
tell him, or teach him, for this ſpirit is
his maker, he dwels in him, and if the
fleſh were ſubject to him, he ſhould finde
daily teaching thereform, though he
were alone, and ſaw the face of no
man.</p>
               <p>And truly let me tell you, That you
cannot ſay the ſpirit is your God, till
you feel, and ſee by experience that the
ſpirit doth govern your fleſh; for if
Envy be your Lord that rules your fleſh,
if Pride and Covetouſneſſe rule your
fleſh, then is Envy, Covetouſneſſe, or
Pride your God: If you fear men ſo
greatly, that you dare not do righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
for fear of angering men, then ſlaviſh
fear is your God: If raſh anger govern
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119616:68"/>
your fleſh, then is anger your God: If
Uncleanneſſe rule in you, that is your
God: Therefore deceive not your ſelves,
but let reaſon work within you, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and ſee what your fleſh is ſubject to;
for whatſoever doth govern in you, that is
your God: If the curſe in the fleſh
govern you,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> then the devill is your God,
and you are ſervants to him, for the curſe
is the devill: But if your fleſh be ſubject
to the ſpirit within it, which is Reaſon,
and which made the fleſh, then is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your God, and you may lawfully call
him your God, for you know now what
you ſpeak, and that your words are
words of experience; but if you act
contrary to reaſon, you act like a beaſt,
and not like a man, according to his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for by his creation he is made Lord
of all creatures, and therefore the ſpirit
dwels ſupreamly in him; but when he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the way of the fleſh, then he acts
like a beaſt, below the creation of a man,
and ſo hath loſt the honor of his creation.</p>

               <p>THere be three Scriptures that were
brought to me, and the light that
ſhined forth, gave much ſtrength to my
ſoul. I ſhall only mention them, and
then conclude.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>The firſt is Rev. 9. 4</bibl>
And it was commanded them,<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 4.</note> that they
ſhould not hurt the green graſſe of the
earth, neither any green thing, neither
any tree, but only thoſe men that have
not the ſeal of God upon their fore-heads;
and theſe were not to be killed neither,
but that they ſhould be tormented five
moneths by thoſe Locuſts that came out
of the ſmoke that riſe up out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit, that was now opened, or made
manifeſt what it is.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:119616:69"/>
By green graſſe, and trees that were
not to be hurt, were ſhewed to me
to be the tender ſons and daughters
that Chriſt hath newly called out of
the earth, to grow up towards him:
And likewiſe the tender plants of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
life, that Chriſt had planted in that
tender earth.</p>
               <p>As love branching out into hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and thirſting after righteouſneſſe;
and this tender green graſſe, nor the
earth whereupon is grows, is not hurt;
for in the mideſt of any trouble what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
the breathings of love after
the father, in hungering and thirſting
after him, is ſtill kept alive in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſoule.</p>
               <p>And why muſt not theſe be hurt?
Why? becauſe theſe have the ſeal of
the ſpirit upon them, as tender plants,
as ſuch as are dear unto him.</p>
               <p>I, but pride, envy, covetouſneſſe, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
and the earth upon which theſe,
and ſuch like weeds grow, are to be
tormented; and why? becauſe they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119616:70"/>
have not the ſeal of the ſpirit upon
their foreheads, and they are to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
five moneths, before ſuch time
as theſe weeds be burned up, and that
poyſoned earth become fruitfull for good
ſeed.</p>
               <p>I, but theſe are called men, not ſinfull
qualities that are to be tormented; it
is true, but a man is called according
to his qualitie and manners; take a
proud, covetous, or envious man, and
croſſe any of theſe wicked qualities, and
you torment the man.</p>
               <p>For when envy raignes in a man, if
it be croſt, the whole man is croſt; and
if pride, or ſelfe will raigne in a man,
and be croſt, the man is tormented;
ſo that the quality declares the man;
and the man is declared what he is by
his quality.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the ſecond Scripture,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15. It is ſaid,</p>
               <p>Whoſoever was not written in the Lambs
book of life,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 15.</note> was caſt into the lake of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:119616:70"/>
By <hi>Lambs book of life,</hi> is ſhewed to
me to be his very divine nature and
ſpirit, wherein Love, Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Peace, and ſuch like are written,
and theſe ſhall enter into life, and the
men in whom this Spirit rules ſhall
enter into heaven, and live in the
Father.</p>
               <p>For theſe fruits of the Spirit prove a
man to be a ſon of light, and every ſon
of light is known by theſe qualities
that was engraven in the Lambs Nature,
or Spirit.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever was not written in
the Lambs book, as Envy, Pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
Self-will, and the like, theſe
ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of burning, to be conſumed, and the
men in whom theſe curſed powers rule,
ſhall be tormented, while that droſſe is
in burning up, and vexed day and
night, and are reſtleſſe, and cannot be
quiet, but fretts, and are troubled conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:119616:71"/>
Therefore whatſoever is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Lambs nature, ſhall never
live in reſt in the father; but envy,
pride,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22, &amp;c.</note> covetouſneſſe, ſelf-will, and the
like, were not written in the Lambs
booke, or Spirit, for he was full of love,
and patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore thoſe ſhall
never live in the father, and never ſit
down in reſt in the ſpirit; but the
ſpirit will ſtill be burning them, as
chaffe in the fire, till they be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</p>
               <p>Another thing obſerve, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did appeare to dwell in the Lamb,
is, nor ſhall never be tormented, as
love, patience, humility, contentedneſſe,
theſe are never tormented,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 7.</note> though I have
thought many times, that love, being
croſt grows angry. But I ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
it is improper, for love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be angrie, it beareth all things.</p>
               <p>And as we ſee in our Lord Chriſt, in
whom love, patience, humilitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe,
did dwell and rule; he was
never tormented, nor troubled with
any fretting or diſquiet fit. For truly I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119616:71"/>
ſpeake what I have and do finde, it is only
the fleſh and ſerpent that is troubled and
tormented, and the more a man is vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fretted, the more ſtrength of
fleſh dwells and rules in him. But when
the ſpirit of the Lamb is ſent into the
heart, he ſwallows up that froward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the fleſh, and ſaves the man from
diſtemper, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The third ſcripture I ſhall mention,
is that old puſling ſcripture, that hath
tormented many a ſoule, which is this.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Mat. 12. 31.</bibl>
He that ſins againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall
not be forgiven in this world, nor in the
world to come.</q>
               <p>By ſin here, is ſhewed to me, to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or the curſe in the fleſh; branching
himſelfe forth into pride, covetouſneſſe,
envy, uncleanneſſe, ſelf-will, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and all ſuch like; and this ſerpent
dwells in the fleſh of every ſonne and
daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince the fall: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the man Chriſt Jeſus; for though
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119616:72"/>
this ſerpent tempted him, and ſtrived
to rule in him, as he overcame and ruled
in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> yet Chriſt trod him
under foot, and caſt him out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
that is, out of humane fleſh, that
part of the creation,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 10.</note> in whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dwelt bodily.</p>
               <p>And by holy Ghoſt here, it is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me, to be the Anointing, or the
Spirit ruling in fleſh,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 2, 3.</note> either in the
fleſh of Chriſt, or in the fleſh of his
Saints.</p>
               <p>Now the ſerpent or curſe, which is
called the power of darkneſſe; this is
the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; for
the father made the humane fleſh to
be his houſe to dwell in;<note place="margin">Luke 11. 22.</note> And this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
took poſſeſſion, and fights againſt
the ſpirit, and will not ſuffer him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in fleſh at all.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaith the father, this ſin or
curſe ſhall never be pardoned; that is,
the father will never reconcile that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one to him;<note place="margin">Gen. 3 15.</note> the father and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
will never become one, but will
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119616:72"/>
alwayes be fighting, till the ſerpents head
be bruiſed; for this is that wicked one
that the father is angrie with ever; he is
not ſimply angry with his creature, but
with this ſinne or curſe in the creature,
with which the creature hath made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and become one with it, and ſo
fights againſt his maker.</p>
               <p>I, but the father will bruiſe this head
of Rebellion, and conſume this ſinne in
the fire, that ſo be may reconcile his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to himſelfe; but I ſay the ſinne or
curſe ſhall never be reconciled; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will ever be a conſuming fire to
that, and will be ever taking peace from
that earth that gives this wicked one
entertainment.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit will be ſtill bruiſing the
head of this ſinne, till he hath deſtroyed
it, and redeemed his creature from the
power and bondage of it; and it is true,
every man is guilty of this ſinne againſt
the ſpirit; and though the father will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make this ſinne one with himſelf, yet
he will make his creature man, one with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119616:73"/>
him, when this curſe is ſwallowed up of
life.</p>
               <p>And why will he not pardon this ſin?
becauſe it was not written in the Lambs
book, or nature, but is that power of
darkneſſe that makes war againſt the
Lamb, and will not have the ſpirit to
dwell in fleſh, but would caſt him out.
Therefore the ſpirit will caſt him out,
though he were a ſtronger power then
he is. And ſo for this time I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
