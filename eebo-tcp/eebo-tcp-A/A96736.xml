            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE WITCH of WAPPING.</head>
            <p>MAny are of opinion, that there are no Witches, but let them read in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and they ſhall find that in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> there were Magitians and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers; and that <hi>Saul</hi> went to the Witch of Endor: This is enough to confirm that there were Witches in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the world; and that this latter Age hath produced ſuch creatures, this following Relation will ſufficiently teſtifie; wherein is fully related the Life and Practiſes of one <hi>Joan Peterſon,</hi> who lived in Spruce Iſland, near Shadwel, all which was proved againſt her at the Seſſions holden at the Old Baily on Wedneſday <hi>Apr.</hi> 7. 1652.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Witches, which the Vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſtinguiſh by the names of the Good Witch, (I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how that can be,) and the Bad; by reaſon, when one bewitcheth a party, the other unwitcheth him again: Now this <hi>Joan Peterſon,</hi> it ſhould ſeem, was both; for as it was clearly proved, that ſhe had done much miſchief, ſo there were divers that came to witneſſe that ſhe had cured them of ſeveral diſeaſes, amongſt the reſt I heard one of them ſay, that he had been ſo grievouſly troubled with the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166122:3"/>
that he could take no reſt for 5 Weeks together, and that he had made tryal of many Doctors, but could have no redreſs, and comming to <hi>Peterſon,</hi> ſhe gave him a Drink, which after he had drunk of thrice, he was as well as ever he was; I demanded of him if the Drink did purge him, and ſo removed the humours, and he anſwered, it did not purge him at all; which ſeemed very ſtrange to me, the man being ſo grievouſly tormented with that intolerable pain.</p>
            <p>Alſo there was a Cow-keepers Wife, that had one of her Cows lay in ſuch a condition, that ſhe and all that ſaw the Cow did verily perſwade themſelves that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched; whereupon ſhe came to this <hi>Peterſon,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her a reward, if ſhe would cure her Cow: She deſired the woman to ſave her water, and bring it to her, which ſhe did; then taking the water, ſhee ſet it on the fire, and it had not been on long, but the water roſe up in bubbles, in one of the which ſhe ſhewed her the face of the woman which the Cow-keepers wife ſuſpected to have bewitched it, and ſo preſcribing what ſhe ſhould do to recover it, ſhe took her leave; divers other things of this nature, and ſeverall cures ſhe hath performed, but whether they were done in Gods name, or whether ſhe uſed unlawfull means, I ſhall leave that to the charitable reader to judge of, my ſelf deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to wave my judgement herein.</p>
            <p>Now concerning her evil actions I ſhall relate only ſuch as were clearly proved againſt her, by very credible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes at the Old-Bayly on the 7 of <hi>April,</hi> and for which ſhe was condemned to die, <hi>viz.</hi> One <hi>Chriſtopher Wilſon,</hi> being very ſick and weak came to this <hi>Peterſon</hi> and agreed with her for a certain ſum of money to cure him, which ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to do, and in a ſhort time cured him, but demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her money of him, he denied to pay her ſo much as they had agreed for, whereupon ſhe burſt out into theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166122:3"/>
               <hi>you had been better you had given me my money for you ſhall be ten times worſe then ever you were;</hi> and very ſuddenly after he fell into very ſtrange fits, and for twelve hours together would rage and rave like a mad man, and afterwards for twelve hours more would ſlabber out his tongue, and walk up and down like a meer changeling; in this condition he remained certain days, and then he fell very ſick, and at this inſtant (if he be not dead) languiſheth away, and rots as he lies.</p>
            <p>Alſo there was one of her neighbours, who had a young child, which was very ſtrangely torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having ſuch ſtrange fits that the like was never known and had continued certain days in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the great grief of the Parents, and the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe that beheld it, and it was brought ſo low, that they expected every hour when it ſhould depart the world, and the Parents were forced to procure one or other every night to watch with it, whereupon two women that were neighbours, deſired that they might watch with it, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thankfully accepted of; about midnight, they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied (to their thinking) a great black cat come to the cradles ſide, and rock the cradle, whereupon one of the women took up the fire-fork to ſtrike at it, and it immediately vaniſhed, about an hour after the cat came again to the cradle ſide, whereupon the other woman kicked at it, but it preſently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and that leg that ſhe kicked with, began to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166122:4"/>
ſwell and be very ſore, whereupon they were both afraid, and calling up the maſter of the houſe, took their leave; as they were going to their own homes they met a Baker, who was likewiſe a neighbours ſervant, who told them that he ſaw a great black cat that had ſo frighted him, that his hair ſtood an end, whereupon the women told him what they had ſeen, who ſaid he thought in his conſcience that Peterſon had bewitched the aforeſaid child, for (<abbr>qd</abbr> the Baker) I met the witch a litle before going down the Iſland: the Baker witneſſing of this which is formerly related, was demanded whether he had not at other times as well as that been afraid of a cat, who anſwered no, and that he never ſaw ſuch a cat before, and hoped in God he ſhould never ſee the like again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was one likewiſe who had been a Maid-ſervant to the foreſaid</hi> Peterſon, <hi>witneſſed that one night lying with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, being in bed ſhe told her that a Squirrel would come to her, but wiſhed her not to be afraid, for it ſhould do her no harm, and accordingly about midnight there came a Squirrel (or a Familiar in that likeneſſe) and went over the wench to</hi> Peterſon, <hi>which ſo affrighted her that ſhe lay as if ſhe were in a trance; and ſhe further affirmeth, that her Miſtreſſe and it talkt together a great part of the night; but being demanded what they diſcourſed on, ſhe replied, that ſhe heard her conference very perfectly, but ſhe was ſo bewitched by it, that ſhe could not remember one word. Alſo her ſon (a boy of about</hi> 7 <hi>or</hi> 8 <hi>years of age) being askt by ſome of his School-fellows how his mother could do ſuch ſtrange things, he ſaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166122:4"/>
that ſhe had a Squirrel that taught her what ſhe ſhould do. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it was affirmed by a man that lived by her, that ſitting by the fire ſide late one evening talking with her, on a ſudden</hi> Peterſon <hi>ſhrieked and cried out, who asking her what ſhe ailed, ſhe ſaid do you ſee nothing? not I replied the other, look where it comes, ſaith ſhe, and then he perceived as it were a black dog, who went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to</hi> Peterſon, <hi>and put his head under her arm-pits, whereat the man was ſo aſtoniſhed, that he ran out of the houſe as if he had been frighted out of his wits. Theſe and other ſtrange things being proved againſt her, ſhe was condemn'd to be hanged at Tyborn on Munday the</hi> 12 <hi>of</hi> April, 1652.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 10 of this inſtant April, one Prudence Lee, was burned in Smithfield for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Philip Lee her husband, who was a Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, and lived in Bell-Alley in Golding-Lane. She came from Newgate to Smithfield on foot, between two of the Sheriffs Officers, attired in a Red Waſte-coat; and being brought to the Stake, and death preſenting himſelf before her, ſhe confeſſed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>That ſhe had been a very lewd liver, and much given to curſing and ſwearing, for which the Lord being offended with her, had ſuffered her to be brought to that untimely end, ſhe further confeſſed that being jealous of her husband, and ſome unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words paſſing between them, in her paſſion ſhe ſtabbed him, for which ſhe earneſtly prayed to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166122:5"/>
Lord that he would forgive both that all her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grievous ſins, deſiring than as ſhe was a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo ſhe might be a warning to all women, that they attempt to do nothing raſhly, eſpecially againſt their husbands. Then the Executioner ſetting her in a pitch barrel, bound her to the ſtake, and placed the ſtraw and Faggots about her; whereupon ſhe lifting up her eys towards Heaven, deſired all that were preſent to pray for her; and the Executioner putting fire to the ſtraw, ſhe cried out; Lord Jeſus have mercy on my ſoul; and after the fire was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhe was heard to ſhrike out terribly ſome five or ſix ſeveral times.</p>
            <p>It is reported that her husband was a very wicked liver, and that he kept company with ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and that when ſhe committed this abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable murther, ſhe found him in company with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other woman, at the ſign of the Laſt, an Ale-houſe in Rotten-Row in Old-ſtreet; which occaſioned very evil language to paſs between them; upon vvhich ſhe drew her knife and ſtab'd him.</p>
