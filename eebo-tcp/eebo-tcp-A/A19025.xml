            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who vpon better information of his friendes, replied, that it was in vaine now any longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect in that Religion, ſeeing after the death of the late Queene, the inauguration of a moſt religious King, forced the tide &amp; ſtreame againſt the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> ſo that both hap and hope, were drowned and periſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>Perhaps they imagined (as the Prophet<note place="margin">Pſal, 50, 21</note> ſpeaketh) <hi>that GOD was like vnto themſelues,</hi> and would participate with them in any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,

if they could make him ſmell to theyr bloody vnbleeding ſacrifice.

And doubting that hee had not throughly diſpatched him, tooke vp a barre of yron, &amp; ſtrooke him with maine force and brake his backe, ſo that hee preſently died of thoſe wounds.</p>
            <p>Then this <hi>Inigo Ieanes,</hi> leauing his Father groueling on the ground, and wallowing in his owne blood, immediatly fled to a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (called Saint <hi>Sauiours</hi>) neere <hi>Padſtowe,</hi> and haſtily vnclothing himſelfe, with a bad and blunt knife (adding all his force thereto) gaſtly in two or three places gaſhed his own belly athwart, that his bowels were to be ſeene.</p>

            <p>Vpon ſome ſpeeches and conference, the ſaid <hi>Inigo</hi> confeſſed the murthering of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wounding himſelfe: and was very deſirous to ſpeake with Maiſter <hi>Nicholas Prideaux</hi> (then and nowe high Sherieffe of <hi>Cornwall,</hi>) dwelling neere the ſaid Towne of <hi>Padſtow,</hi> to the intent he might reueale ſome ſpeciall matters vnto him, where-with it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his conſcience was ſurcharged.

            <p>Before I proceed further in examining the innumerable impieties in this one fact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, I may not omit to note vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, what a blinde &amp; ſenceleſſe guide they had for theyr Prieſt, that from ſuch a director, no hope of better fruites could bee conceiued. This paltry Popeling, was well knowne a little before to be a badde and rude Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, and a fellow of ſuch noted ſtupidity, that young Gentlemen, ſeruingmen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for an exerciſe and recreation, would practiſe to haue him ſtand ſtill, whiles they with all theyr force, quoyted ſbillings or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes at his blockiſh browe, which for a ſmall peece of mony he would as quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, as if a Stoicall ſtupidity had poſſeſſed his braines and body, euen till his face and fore-head was often-times moſt grieuouſlie gaſhed, moouing many beholders to pittie

him, which did not pitty himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Dorus,</hi> was now lately become like one of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Prieſts, <hi>taken as one out of the<note place="margin">1, Reg. 13, 13 2, Chro, 11 15 Iudges, 17, 10, 11,</note> baſeſt of the people, &amp; conſecrated with the Popes vnguent, a prieſt of the deuill, or Maſſe-monging Catholick.</hi> This calfe of <hi>Dan,</hi> beeing now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Bell-wether to the ſcabbed flocke, it is doubted whether the ſheepe infected him more with the hope of hire, to become a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahs prieſt,</hi> or hee with his Ramme-like fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, had hardned the faces of his flock vnto this extreame impudencie and impiety: but ſure the prouerbe was well ſhared amongſt them, <hi>ſuch a prieſt, ſuch people.</hi> Theyr mother was <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> theyr nurſe <hi>Ignorance, Darknes</hi> theyr dwelling, and <hi>Confuſion</hi> theyr inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
