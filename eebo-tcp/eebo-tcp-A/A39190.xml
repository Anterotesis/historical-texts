            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>PRaiſes of him (when dead) are juſtly due,</l>
               <l>Who living, was, by th' grace of God, found true:</l>
               <l>Faithful to Chriſt, and Uſeful in his Station;</l>
               <l>Bleſt,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> and a Bleſſing made, to Chriſt's own Nation.</l>
               <l>And as a great Ambaſſador for him,</l>
               <l>Hath woo'd and won full many to come in,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 5.20.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Even from the Eaſt and Weſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.11.</note> and North and South,</l>
               <l>Sit down at's Feet, and learn from Chriſt's own Mouth,</l>
               <l>The care of Grace, ſound Faith and Holineſs,</l>
               <l>And him 'fore Men and Angels to confeſs.</l>
               <l>Fearful of Sin,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.32.</note> but fearleſs of all thoſe,</l>
               <l>Who are Chriſt's Enemies,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> and him oppoſe:</l>
               <l>Whom neither Men, nor Devils could afright,</l>
               <l>From ſending forth's burning and ſhining Light,</l>
               <l>In darkeſt Times and Places, where Death's ſhade</l>
               <l>Had covered Souls, and them a Prey had made</l>
               <l>To Sin and Satan, World, and Death and Hell;</l>
               <l>He reaſon'd by the Goſpel-light, to tell</l>
               <l>In <hi>Zion,</hi> what the Lord had done for them,</l>
               <l>And Glory give to God 'fore Sons of Men.</l>
               <l>A Fiſher-man he was, at Chriſt's Command</l>
               <l>He caſt his Net, and wand'ring made a ſtand</l>
               <l>To ſee what Multitudes,
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.47, 48.</note> by Grace were caught,</l>
               <l>'Mong which were many good, tho' ſome prov'd naught.</l>
               <l>His Fellow Fiſher-man, God took firſt away,</l>
               <l>Grief whereof, and other things, I'll not ſay</l>

               <l>And where his Works moſt ſure him follow ſhall.</l>
               <l>He's gain'd the Point and into the Harbor's gone,</l>
               <l>Welcom'd by Angels, and by Saints each one;</l>
               <l>By <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and the reſt</l>

               <l>With Viſion of the Face and Sight of God,</l>

<note place="margin">Jam. 5.11.</note> happy, happy <hi>Holcroft,</hi> thou'ſt endur'd</l>
               <l>The Croſs,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.12.</note> and now the Crown to thee's ſecur'd.</l>
               <l>And hence let th' Miniſters of Chriſt, learn to know</l>
               <l>Their Times and Seaſons, and improve them too;</l>
               <l>And Work whilſt 'tis their Day, for Night will come,</l>

<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.10.</note>

               <l>They ſhall receive a Crown of Life,

               <l>'Tis not the Man we prais'd, but Grace alone;</l>
