            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BLessed be the God of mercies, who hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my spirit, that it is not the power of
Argument, the force of Dispute or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
nor the efficacy of humane Reason that
can more clearly make out <hi>the things that are freely

from these mysts, so he hath led me forth to give
my testimony with the rest of his Saints in behalf
of his Cause and Truth, against all perversness, and
unrighteousness of men. For after the Lord about
eighteen years ago, had in his wonderfull mercy
brought me to the sad experience of mine own

This is only to preach for hire, not for the love of the truth,

With what faces can or dare you exact Tythes or pay from poor

Is there any other maintenance for a Gospel-Ministry,
but what those freely give, that feel, and confess the benefit of
the same, thinking it a small matter to give carnal things for
spiritual: Did ever the Apostles compel (or declare it lawfull
so to do) any to lay down the price of their sold possessions at their
feet, but only received that which according to the motion of
every ones spirit, was voluntarily brought in unto them? Or
did they ever force any (or declare it lawfull so to do) to give

               <p>And if it be objected,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> that though Humane Learning be
an enemy to the Law of God while it is in a natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
heart: yet when the heart is once sanctified, and
truly turned to God, then it becomes a sanctified instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a good handmaid to Theologie.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> that though the heart be truly sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in which human learning doth inhere as in its subject; yet
doth it not follow that learning it self is, no more then sin
can be said to be sanctified, though the heart of a sinful man
may be truly said to be sanctified: for acquired learning by
it self, and of its own nature is nothing else but sin, and
therefore remains so still, and cannot truly and properly be
said to be sanctified no more then sin. But if by being san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
they mean that the providential wisdom of God doth
order it, or make use of it for the good of his People, I opose
it not, so that it be understood, that that good flows not from
the nature of acquired knowledg it self; but from the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

even as he;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9 15, 16 17, 18.</note> and that he might make the Gospel of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

(as it is upon all those that are truly sent) and therefore
whether he received any thing or nothing, a <hi>wo</hi> belonged

               </p>
               <p>If it be objected,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> That in those days the Magistrates were
Heathen, and so took no care for those that were Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet now in our Nation the Magistrates are Christians, and
therefore ought, and may make a law and appoint wages
and maintenance for their Ministers.</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> if suppositions were Apodictical proofs, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would make ready conclusions,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> and the way to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
would be very facile: for it is easie to suppose that all
the Magistrates in a Commonwealth, inferior and superior,
are all Christians, nay the whole body of the Nation it self,
because they have a national worship, and are all promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
called by that glorious name: but there is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt names &amp; things being so, and being called so;
It is one thing to suppose, and another to prove, and but
weak from the denotation to argue to the thing, as though
<hi>Iudas</hi> might truly be concluded one of the true Disciples of
Christ, becaus he is called <hi>one of the twelve.</hi> No, external forms
do not demonstratively prove the verity of internal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
For <hi>he is not a Iew that is one outwardly, neither is that
circumcision that is outward in the flesh;<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 28, 29,</note> but he is a Iew that is
one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit,
and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</hi>
Therfore when the supposition is proved, then it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
in the mean time <hi>ex suppositis suppositio, sequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if some of the Magistrates were truly Christians,<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note>
yet <hi>Christs kingdom being not of this world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 36.</note> but a Spirituall
one, they ought not to intermeddle with carnal constitutions
in his spiritual things, which he makes good by his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Wisdom and Providence, and not by the counsel or <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Princes of this world, which comes to nought;</hi> and
his servants are to wait upon him by a simple believing,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33. 2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> and
to <hi>walk by faith, and not by sight.</hi> Moreover, if they were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
they might every one of them in his single condition
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50047:19"/>
give to him that taught him what proportion of his own
good things he had an heart to bestow, but not to set down
a law to judge over the conscience of his brother, because
these things ought to be done out of a principle of love,
and not from the law of au externall command.</p>
               <p>If they were all Christians,<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> it was never yet that I could
see proved, that they had power to settle a maintenance for
the Ministery of the Gospel; and the contrary to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
an undeniable truth, and that from these grounds,</p>
               <p>1. Because the Rule of Christ, and the practice of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were only for a free &amp; voluntary contribution from
the free will offering of those whose spirits were wrought
upon by that particular Ministery to which they should
contribute: now for Christians to pretend to have power to
make a law for the maintenance of his Ministry, and the
good of his cause, and walk contrary to the Rule of Christ
himselfe, to me seems strange that it should be accounted
lawfull.</p>
               <p>2. There is no Magistrate hath any power to make a law
of those things he perfectly understands not; for how can a
right judgment be given where the intellect is not clearly
formed? Now it no where appears that the Magistrates
have the spirit of discerning to know the Ministers of
<hi>Christ</hi> infallibly from the ministers of <hi>Satan;</hi> &amp; therefore
might as soon maintain &amp; advantage the one as the other.</p>
               <p>3. As was said before, it crosseth the way of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
confidence, and simple believing and waiting upon
God, and so cannot be lawfull for them to do.</p>

               <p>But now the grand scruple is,<note place="margin">Position 2.</note> what power the Magistrate
hath in those things that are called spiritual: And by things
spiritual I understand those things that the Apostles &amp; other
Saints taught and practised as Christians; for as men, they
were in their words and actions (as is proved before) under
the power of the Magistrate. And in all those things that
they held, taught, or practised, I finde evidently these two.
1. They never required any thing of the Magistrates (as they
were Christians) but only liberty to speak out the things that
Christ had manifested unto them; and quietly to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>I never read that they desired of the Magistrate honour
or riches,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> Lordships or dominions, nor to be called Doctors,
Masters, Rabbies, or to have the pre-eminence and chief seats
one above another, as ours now-a-dayes that call themselves
Christians, must have a Law to make them Masters, Doctors
and Batchelors of Divinity (as they are pleased vainly to stile
them) and that not had but with a vast expence to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
(in allowing such large Revenues of Lands and
Tithes to maintain an hive of Drones, Wasps and Hornets in
their Monkish Cells) which might be better employed for
enabling men in Arts and Sciences to fit them for Civil em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and not to paint up a blader-blown Clergy (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fals title they have assumed to themselvs) with such idle
Terms and vain Epithites. It is true that the Disciples being
but earthly and carnal, had much ado among themselvs <hi>Who

but he that would be greatest should become least, and he that

could <hi>desire to sit the one at his right hand, and the other at his

and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> but the Disciples
were forbidden these things.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> or any other Saints
desired of the Magistrates tithes, or augmentations, mony or
maintenance for their pains taken about the things of <hi>Christ.</hi>
They desired not of the Magistrates any Authority, Licenses
Commissions or Orders for their preaching the Message that
God had put into their mouths. But now our <hi>Sons of Belial</hi>
will <hi>strike their fleshbook with three teeth into the pan and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
and if the people will not give them of the Sacrifices they

people; but the judgement of <hi>Elies</hi> sons is hastening upon
them, and if they make not a great uproar and noyse, their
great <hi>Diana</hi> falls for ever.</p>
               <p>I never read that the Disciples, or Christians in their days,<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note>
did desire the Magistrate to punish kill, accuse, condemn or
imprison any that received not their doctrine: no, they were
but <hi>to shake off the dust of their feet as witness against them.</hi>

                  </note>
Nor did they desire to have the Magistrate to punish any
that fell away from their doctrine into other opinions,
though never so gross; but all that they did was by spiritual
power to deliver them to Satan, and that also for this end,
even <hi>for the destruction of the flesh,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>All that I find that they declared the Magistrate had no power to hinder them of,<note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note> was the speaking the things of
God, wherein they were bound to obey God rather then
men, and in this case the counsel of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was both good
and pretious, <hi>That they should abstain from these men, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that was destructive,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> or any way hurtfull to the power of the

they pluck up the wheat also, but both must be let alone untill
the harvest</hi> and then the Lord will send messengers that shall
make a sepration: Therefore the Magistrate ought not to
meddle with the plucking out of the Tares of errors, heresies
&amp; false worships; for therby usually the wheat is pluckt up,
and the tares left; for the Saints of God have always been
persecuted and slain under the pretence of rooting forth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50047:23"/>
and destroying false ways of worship, and under colour
of <hi>doing God good service:</hi> For it is evident, that since the
Magistrates have assumed to themselves the title of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and pretended power, nay also will, &amp; skil of promoting
the cause of Christ, of setting up forms, professions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Creeds, Confession, and Articles of Religion by the
power of civill authority; as also to eradicate errors, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and false worship, Antichrist hath by that means had his
growth and increase; Apostasie hath entred and prevailed,
Truth almost in all Ages hath been stissed and suppressed,
and the Saints persecuted and butchered, as is too evident in
Martyrologie and Church History. And this is all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that the truth of Christ ever gained, or can have from
the authority of men, and the power of the world.</p>
               <p>Also the record of truth doth witness that God in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable

thereby many are forced to become hyporites, and to sin
against the light of their own conscience, or else to undergo
loss of goods, or liberty, bodily hurt, or death, which is cruel

power, if not in the Magistrates at least in the Ministers and
Churches, and therefore it is lawfull to exercise that.</p>
               <p>1. It is true,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> that the Apostles and primitive Churches had
by their directions a power to retain sins, and to deliver to
<hi>Satan;</hi> but this was not an externall power of man, or the
sword, but was spirituall, and stood in the power of Christ;
for the Apostle saith, <hi>In the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,
when ye are gathered together,<note place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>struction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Now this was done in the power of
Christ, and so as no Church now can shew the like, though
they seem to imitate it.</p>
               <p>2. This was not done by inflicting any external punishment
upon him, but that the rest of the saints were to forbear such
an ones company,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>even to eat with him,</hi> and consisted not in
some violent thrusting out such an one from their houses or
company, but in withdrawing themselvs away from him: for
the Apostle warns and commands the believing <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in <hi>the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 6. 14.</note> that they should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

if any did not obey his word in that Epistle, they should note such
an one, &amp; have no company with him, that he might be a shamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For that of the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a very high &amp; great mystery, more then mans wit can
conceive by the letter; yet it is clear that they should not
have suffered her: but what was it they should have restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or resisted her withall? not with carnall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weapons (for
the Saints wear not such) but with spirituall, which were
mighty and powerfull in Christ.</p>
               <p>2. Those rebuked there were such as <hi>had her doctrine,</hi>

those threatned were such as had <hi>committed fornication with

her,</hi> and therefore by <hi>suffering her,</hi> was to have embraced her
doctrine; but those that had it not, nor had known the
depths of Satan, they were not reproved not threatned at all,
but exhorted only <hi>to hold fast untill Christ should come.</hi>
