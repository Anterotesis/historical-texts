            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Through the want of the exerciſe

In the ſpiritual and myſticall, it pleaſes

and the fruit from the branch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we by nature have no part in the
Son of God; take that clearer reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109037:17"/>
which the Apoſtle fetches from
the ſtock and the griffe, or cion: The
branches of the wilde olive (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.)
are cut off; and are graffed with choice
cions of the good olive; thoſe imps
grow, and are now, by this inſition,
no leſſe embodyed in that ſtock then
if they had ſprouted out by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
propagation: neither can be any
more ſeparated from it then the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
bough that nature puts forth:
In the mean time that cion alters the
nature of that ſtock; and whiles the
root gives fatneſſe to the ſtock, and
the ſtock yeelds juice to the cion, the
cion gives goodneſſe to the plant, and
a ſpecification to the fruit: ſo as
whiles the impe is now the ſame thing
with the ſtock, the tree is different
from what it was; ſo it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Chriſt and the beleeving ſoul:
Old <hi>Adam</hi> is our wilde ſtock, what
could that have yeelded but either
none, or ſowre fruit? we are imped
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109037:17"/>
with the new man, Chriſt; that is
now incorporated into us, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one with him; our nature is
not more ours, then he is ours by
grace; now we bear his fruit, and not
our own; our old ſtock is forgotten,
all things are become new; our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
life we receive from <hi>Adam;</hi> our
ſpirituall life and growth from Chriſt,
from whom after the improvement
of this bleſſed inciſion we can be no
more ſevered, then he can be ſevered
from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Look but upon thy houſe (that
from vegetative creatures, thou maiſt
turn thine eyes to thoſe things which
have no life) if that be uniform, the
foundation is not of a different matter
from the wals; both thoſe are but one
piece; the ſuperſtructure is ſo raiſed
upon the foundation, as if all were
but one ſtone; Behold Chriſt is the
chief corner ſtone, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6.) elect
and precious; neither can there be any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109037:18"/>
other foundation laid then that which
is laid on him; (1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. 2 Pet.</hi>
2. 5.) we are lively ſtones built up to
a ſpiritual houſe, on that ſure and firm
foundation; ſome looſe ſtones perhaps
that lye unmortered upon the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may be eaſily ſhaken down,
but whoever ſaw a ſquared marble
laid by line and levell in a ſtrong wall
upon a well-grounded baſe, flye out
of his place by whatſoever violence;
ſince both the ſtrength of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
below, and the weight of the
fabrick above, have ſetled it in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
utterly unmovable? Such is
our ſpirituall condition, O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
thou art our foundation, we are
laid upon thee, and are therein one
with thee; we can no more be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from thy foundation, then the
ſtones of thy foundation can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
from themſelves: So then, to
ſum up all; as the head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are but one body, as the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109037:18"/>
and wife are but one fleſh, as
our meat and drink becomes part of
our ſelves, as the tree and branches are
but one plant, as the foundation and
wals are but one fabrick; ſo Chriſt
and the beleeving ſoul are indiviſibly
one with each other.</p>

Can they affain to the Son of God a

think that body perfect that hath loſt

the beſt joynts may be ſubject to
ſtrains, yea, perhaps to ſome painfull

in the naturall body of Chriſt, when
it was in death, moſt expoſed to the

perhaps ſome bruiſes, and gaſhes, but
no bone can be ſhattered in pieces,

                     <p>Can they acknowledge the faithfull

which do neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109037:22"/>
upon, and attend this heavenly
conjunction. Whereof the firſt is that,
which we are wont to account ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
<hi>Life:</hi> Not this naturall life,
which is maintained by the breath of
our noſtrils; Alas, what is that but
a bubble, a vapour; a ſhadow, a
dream, nothing? as it is the gift of
a good God, worthy to be eſteemed
precious; but as it is conſidered in its
own tranſitoryneſſe, and appendent
miſeries, and in compariſon of a
better life, not worthy to take up our
hearts. This life of nature is that
which ariſeth from the union of
the body with the ſoul, many
times enjoyed upon hard termes; the
ſpirituall life which we now ſpeak
of, ariſing from the union betwixt
God and the ſoul, is that wherein
there can be nothing but perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and joy unſpeakable and
full of glory. Yea, this is that life
which Chriſt not only gives, but is:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109037:23"/>
he that gave himſelf for us, gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to us, and is that life that he gives
us; <hi>When Chriſt, which is our life, ſhall
appear;</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4.)
And <hi>Chriſt is to me, to live: (Phil.</hi> 2.
21.) and moſt emphatically, (<hi>Gal.</hi>
2. 20.) <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt;
Nevertheleſſe I live; yet not I, but
Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> Lo, it is a common
favour, that in him we live, but it is
an eſpeciall favour to his own, that he
lives in us: <hi>Know you your own ſelves,</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.)
<hi>how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except
ye be reprobates?</hi> and whereſoever he
is, there he lives; we have not a
dead Saviour, but a living, and where
he lives, he animates: It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe alone; it is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beleevers; who may truly ſay, <hi>I

Know then, my ſon, that every
faithfull mans boſome is a <hi>Rebeceaes</hi>
womb, (<hi>Gen</hi> 25. 22.) wherein there
are twins: a rough <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the ſeed
of promiſe; the old man, and the new;
the fleſh, and the ſpirit; and theſe
have their lives diſtinct from each
other; the new man lives not the
life of the old, neither can the old
man live the life of the new; it is not
one life that could maintain the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
ſtruglings of both theſe: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature is it that gives and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
the life of the old man, It is Chriſt
that gives life to the new; we cannot
ſay but the old man, or fleſh is the man
too: <hi>For I know</hi> (ſaith the choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18.) <hi>that in me, that is, in
my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing:</hi> but the
ſpiritual part may yet better challenge
the title. <hi>For I delight in the Law of
God after the inward man: (Rom.</hi> 7. 22.)
That old man of ours is derived from
the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> as we ſinned in him,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109037:24"/>
ſo he liveth in us; The ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
both gives, and is the life of our
regeneration, like as he is alſo the life
of our glory; the life that followes
our ſecond reſurrection: <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>the reſurrection and the life.</hi> What is
it then whereby the new creature
lives? ſurely no other then the Spirit
of Chriſt, that alone is it, that gives
beeing and life to the renued ſoul.
Life is no ſtranger to us, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherewith we are ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
yea, we feel continually
what it is, and what it produceth; It
is that, from whence all ſenſe, action;
motion floweth, it is that, which gives
us to be what we are: All this is
Chriſt to the regenerate man: It is
one thing what he is, or doth as a
man; another thing what he is, or doth
as a Chriſtian: As a man, he hath
eyes, ears, motions, affections, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
naturally as his own: as a
Chriſtian he hath all theſe from him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109037:24"/>
with whom he is ſpiritually one, the
Lord Jeſus; and the objects of all
theſe vary accordingly: His naturall
eyes behold bodily and materiall
things; his ſpirituall eyes ſee things
inviſible; his outward ears hear the
ſound of the voice; his inward ears
hear the voice of Gods Spirit, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to his ſoul; his bodily feet move
in his own ſecular wayes; his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
walk with God in all the wayes
of his Commandements. His naturall
affections are ſet upon thoſe things
which are agreeable thereunto; he
loves beauty, fears pain and loſſe,
rejoyces in outward proſperity, hates
an enemy; his renued affections are
otherwiſe, and more happily beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
now he loves goodneſſe for its
own ſake; hates nothing but ſin, fears
only the diſpleaſure of a good God,
rejoyces in Gods favour, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then life: his former thoughts
were altogether taken up with vanity,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109037:25"/>
and earthed in the world; now he
ſeeks the things above, where Chriſt
ſitteth at the right hand of God; (<hi>Col.</hi>
3. 1.) Finally, he is ſuch, as that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
ſees nothing but man in him,
but God and his ſoul finde Chriſt
in him, both in his renued perſon and
actions; in all the degrees both of his
life, and growth of his ſufferings, and
glory: <hi>My little children</hi> (ſaith Saint
<hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4. 19.) <hi>of whom</hi> I <hi>travell
in birth again untill Chriſt be formed
in you.</hi> Lo, here Chriſt both concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and born in the faithfull heart;
Formation followes conception, and
travell implies a birth: Now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
is a new-born babe in Chriſt,
(1 <hi>Cor. 3. 1. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 2.) and ſo mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Chriſt in him; from thence he
grows up to (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 14.) ſtrength
of youth; &amp; at laſt to perfection, even
towards the meaſure of the ſtature of
the fulneſſe of Chriſt; (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109037:25"/>
he is dead with Chriſt; (<hi>Rom.</hi>

(<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11.) He is alive again unto
God through Chriſt; (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1.) he is

more then ſo, his (<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24.) ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are Chriſts, Chriſts ſufferings
are his; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.) He is in Chriſt
an heir of glory, (<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27.) and
Chriſt is in him, the hope of glory.</p>

theſe words that I am now uttering?
would he be thus diſpoſed as I now

to own: Let him be pleaſed ſo to

righteouſneſſe it ſelf; Of our ſelves,
we are not righteous, we are made ſo;
In our ſelves, we are not righteous, but
in him; we made not our ſelves ſo, but
the ſame God in his infinite mercy who
made him ſin for us, hath made us his

How free then, and how perfect is

were we capable of his juſtification?
ſinfull, as in the term from whence
this act of his mercy moveth, not, as
in the term wherein it reſteth; his

our perſons: Repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
do not lag one after another;
both of them meet at once in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
ſoul: at once doth the hand of
our faith lay hold on Chriſt, and the
hand of Chriſt lay hold on the ſoul to

And what but ſins can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

But at the beſt this righteouſneſſe of

(Pſal.</hi> 130. 3.) <hi>Behold we are before thee

If he will contend with him, he cannot
anſwer him one of a thouſand. (Job</hi> 9. 2,

is righteous,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 7.) but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

is perfectly righteous by a

gracious acceptation, by a free impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of abſolute obedience. Wo were
us, if we were put over to our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments;
for, <hi>Curſed is every

there be truth in us, we muſt confeſſe

we violate the Law; and if we vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

But here is our comfort, that our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath paid our debt: It is true, we
ſay forfeited to death; Juſtice had
ſaid, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die:
(Ezek.</hi> 18. 4.) Mercy interpoſeth, and
ſatisfies; The Son of God (whoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
drop of bloud was worth a world)
payes this death for us: And now,
<hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109037:38"/>
who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt
that dyed, yea, rather that is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
who is even at the right hand of
God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for
us. (Rom.</hi> 8. 33. 34.) Our ſin, our death
is laid upon him, and undertaken by
him; <hi>He was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
he was bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the chaſtiſements of our peace
were upon him, and with his ſtripes we
are healed; (Eſa.</hi> 53. 5.) His death,
his obedience is made over to us; So
then, the ſin that we have committed,
and the death that we have deſerved
is not ours; but the death which he
hath endured, and the obedience that
he hath performed, is ſo ours, as he is
ours, who is thereupon made of God
our righteouſneſſe. Where now are
thoſe enemies of grace that ſcoffe at
imputation; making it a ridiculous
paradox, that a man ſhould become
juſt by another mans righteouſneſſe?
How dare they ſtand out againſt the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109037:38"/>
word of truth, which tels us expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Chriſt is made our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
What ſtrangers are they to
that grace they oppugn? How little
do they conſider that Chriſt is ours?
his righteouſneſſe therefore by which
we are juſtified, is in him our own;
He that hath <hi>borne the iniquity of us
all (Eſa.</hi> 53. 6.) hath taught us to call
our ſins our <hi>debts; (Mat.</hi> 6. 12.) thoſe
debts can be but once paid; if the
bounty of our Redeemer hath ſtaked
down the ſums required, and cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the bonds; and this payment is
(through mercy) fully accepted as
from our own hands, what danger,
what ſcruple can remain? What doe
we then, weak ſouls tremble to think
of appearing before the dreadfull tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
of the Almighty? we know
him indeed to be infinitely, and infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xibly
juſt; we know his moſt pure
eyes cannot abide to behold ſin; we
know we have nothing elſe bnt ſinne
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109037:39"/>
for him to behold in us: Certainly,
were we to appear before him in the
meer ſhape of our own ſinfull ſelves,
we had reaſon to ſhake and ſhiver at
the apprehenſion of that terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
but now that our faith aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us, we ſhall no otherwiſe be
preſented to that awfull Judge then as
cloathed with the robes of Chriſts
righteouſneſſe, how confident ſhould
we be, thus decked with the garments
of our elder brother, to carry away a
bleſſing? whiles therefore we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with the conſcience of our own
vileneſſe, we have reaſon to lift up our
heads in the confidence of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
righteouſneſſe which Chriſt is
made unto us, and we are made in

                     <p>REdemption was the great errand
for which the Son of God came
down into the world; and the work
which he did whiles he was in the
world; and that, which (in way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it) he ſhall be ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing,
till he ſhall deliver up his
Mediatory Kingdome into the hands
of his Father; in this he begins, in
this he finiſhes the great buſineſſe of
our ſalvation: For thoſe who in this
life are enlightned by his wiſdome,
juſtified by his merits, ſanctified by his
grace, are yet conflicting with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
temptations, and ſtrugling with
varieties of miſeries and dangers, till
upon their happy death, and glorious
reſurrection, they ſhall be fully freed,
by their ever-bleſſed and victorious
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109037:41"/>
Redeemer: He therefore, who by
vertue of that heavenly union, is made
unto us of God, Wiſdome, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
Sanctification; is alſo upon
the ſame ground made unto us our full
Redemption. Redemption implies a
captivity; We are naturally under the
wofull bondage of the Law, of ſinne,
of miſeries, of death: The Law is a
cruell exactor; for it requires of us
what we cannot now do; and whips
us for not doing it; <hi>for the Law wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
wrath; (Rom.</hi> 4. 15.) and, <hi>as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as are of the works of the Law, are
under the curſe. (Gal.</hi> 3. 10.) Sinne is a
worſe tyrant then he, and takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to exerciſe his cruelty by the
Law; <hi>For when we were in the fleſh,
the motions of ſins, which were by the
Law, did work in our members to bring
forth fruit unto death; (Rom.</hi> 7. 5.)
Upon ſin neceſſarily followes miſery,
the forerunner of death; and death
the upſhot of all miſeries; <hi>By one man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109037:42"/>
ſin entred into the world, and death by
ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men,
for that all have ſinned. (Rom.</hi> 5. 12.)
From all theſe is Chriſt our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
from the Law; <hi>for Chriſt hath
redeemed us from the curſe of the Law,
being made a curſe for us: (Gal.</hi> 3. 13.)
From ſin; <hi>for we are dead to ſin, but
alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt
our Lord; (Rom.</hi> 6. 11.) <hi>Sin ſhall not
have dominion over you, for ye are not
under the Law, but under Grace. (Rom.</hi>
6. 14.) From death, and therein from
all miſeries: <hi>O death where is thy ſting?
O grave, where is thy victory? The
ſting of death is ſin; and the ſtrength
of ſin is the Law: But thanks be to God
which giveth us victory through our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56,
57.) Now then let the Law do his
worſt, <hi>we are not under the Law, but
under Grace. (Rom.</hi> 6. 14.) The caſe
therefore is altered betwixt the law
and us. It is not now a cruell Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109037:42"/>
to beat us to, and for our
work; it is our Schoolemaſter, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and to whip us unto Chriſt: It
is not a ſevere Judge, to condemn us,
it is a friendly guide to ſet us the way
towards heaven. Let ſinne joyne his
forces together with the Law, they
cannot prevail to our hurt; <hi>For what
the Law could not do, in that it was
weak through the fleſh, God ſending his
own Son in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh,
condemned ſin, in the fleſh, that the
righteouſneſſe of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in us, who walk not after the fleſh
but after the ſpirit. (Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.) Let
death joyn his forces with them both,
we are yet ſafe; <hi>For the Law of the
ſpirit of life, hath freed us from the
Law of ſin, and of death; (Rom.</hi> 8. 2.)
What can we therefore fear, what can
we ſuffer, while Chriſt is made our
Redemption?</p>
                     <p>Finally, as thus Chriſt is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>But take heed, my ſon, of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
thy claim to what, and in what
manner thou ought'ſt not. There is a
civill right, that muſt regulate our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
to theſe earthly things; our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
right neither gives us poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, nor takes away the right
and propriety of others; Every man
hath and muſt have what by the juſt
Lawes of purchaſe, gift, or inheritance
is derived to him; otherwiſe there
would follow an infinite confuſion in
the world; we could neither enjoy nor
give our own; and only will, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109037:44"/>
might muſt be the arbiters of all mens
eſtates; which how unequall it would
be, both reaſon and experience can
ſufficiently evince. This right is not
for the direption or uſurpation of that
which civill titles have legally put
over to others; there were no theft,
no robbery, no oppreſſion in the
world, if any mans goods might be
every mans: But for the warrantable
and comfortable injoying of thoſe
earthly commodities in regard of God
their originall owner, which are by
humane conveyances juſtly become
ours; The earth is the Lords, and the
fulneſſe of it; in his right what ever
parcels do lawfully deſcend unto us,
we may juſtly poſſeſſe, as we have
them legally made over to us from
the ſecondary and immediate owners.
There is a generation of men who
have vainly fanſied the founding of
Temporall dominion in Grace; and
have upon this miſtaking outed the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109037:44"/>
true heirs as intruders, and feoffed the
juſt and godly in the poſſeſſion of
wicked inheritors; which whether
they be worſe Common-wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or Chriſtians is to me utterly
uncertain; ſure I am they are enemies
to both; whiles on the one ſide, they
deſtroy all civill propriety, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and on the other, reach the
extent of the power of Chriſtianity ſo
far, as to render it injurious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
both to reaſon and to the
Lawes of all well-ordered humanity.
Nothing is ours by injury and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
all things are ſo ours, that we
may with a good conſcience enjoy
them as from the hand of a munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
God, when they are rightfully
eſtated upon us by the lawfull conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or bequeſt of men. In this regard
it is that a Chriſtian man is the Lord of
the whole Univerſe; and hath a right to
the whole creation of God: how can
he challenge leſſe? he is a ſon; and in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109037:45"/>
that an heir; and (according to the
high expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt) a
co-heir with Chriſt; As therefore we
may not be high-minded, but fear; ſo
we may not be too low-hearted in the
under-valuing of our condition; In
God we are great, how mean ſoever in
our ſelves: In his right the world is
ours, what ever pittance we enjoy in
our own; how can we go leſs when we
are one with him who is the poſſeſſour
of heaven and earth?</p>
                     <p>It were but a poor comfort to us,
if by vertue of this union we could
only lay claim to all earthly things:
alas, how vain and tranſitory are the

one ſong, and in that one harmonious

ſouls here on earth profeſſe to
bend our eyes directly upon the ſame
holy end, the honour of our Maker
and Redeemer, but, alas, at our beſt,
we are drawn to look aſquint at our

profeſſe to ſing loud praiſes unto God,
but it is with many harſh and jarring
notes; above, there is a perfect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in an unanimous glorifying of
him that ſits upon the throne for ever;
<hi>Oh, how ye love the Lord, all ye his
Saints, (Pſal.</hi> 31. 23.) <hi>Oh how joyfull
ye are in glory! (Pſal.</hi> 149. 5.) <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

<hi>The City of the living God, the

the innumerable company of Angels, and
the generall Aſſembly and Church of

the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and</hi> (whom they all adore) <hi>God
the judge of all; and Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of the New Teſtament: (Heb.</hi> 12.
22.) All theſe as one, as holy: Thoſe
<hi>twenty thouſand chariots</hi> of heaven
(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 17.) move all one way;
When thoſe four beaſts <hi>full of eyes,
round about the throne give glory, and
honour, and thanks to him that ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the throne, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come; then the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Elders fall down before him, and caſt
their crowns before the throne; (Rev.</hi>
4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.) No one wears his
crown whiles the reſt caſt down theirs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109037:49"/>
all accord in one act of giving glory
to the Higheſt. After the ſealing of
the Tribes, <hi>A great multitude, which
no man could number, of all Nations,
and kindreds, and people, and tongues
ſtood before the throne, and before the
Lamb cloathed with white robes and
palmes in their hands, And cryed with
a loud voice, Salvation to our God,
which ſitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb; And all the Angels ſtood
about the throne, and about the Elders,
and the four beaſts, and fell before the
throne on their faces and worſhipped
God, ſaying, Amen; Bleſsing, and glory,
and wiſdome, and thankſgiving, and
honour, and power, and might be unto
God for ever and ever. (Revel.</hi> 7. 4,

It is not the variety of by-opinions
that ſhould or can exclude them from

that can ſet them off from God, or his

be granted, that they have much to
anſwer for to the God of peace and

their own intereſſe, as to raiſe and
maintain new Doctrines, and to ſet

I muſt needs ſay, this age into

upon the view of theſe wilde

that the world now grown old, is full
of doting fancies; if not rather that the

How arbitrary ſoever theſe ſelf-willed

to themſelves this liberty of thinking

you, brethren, mark them which

the doctrine which you have learned,

Woe is me, into how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

If Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when his <hi>Corinthians</hi>
did but ſay, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
I am of Cephas,</hi> could ask, <hi>Is Chriſt
divided?</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12, 13.) when there
was only an emulatory magnifying of
their own teachers, (though agreeing

he now ſay, if he ſaw hundred of Sect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters
and Hereſiarchs (ſome of
them oppoſite to other, all to the
Truth) applauded by their credulous
and divided followers? all of them
claiming Chriſt for theirs, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to their gain-ſayers; would
he not ask, Is Chriſt multiplied? Is
Chriſt ſub-divided? Is Chriſt ſhred
into infinites? O God! what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Chriſtianity? How do evill
ſpirits and men labour to deſtroy that
Creed which we have alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
profeſſed? For, if we ſet up more
Chriſts, where is that one? and if we
give way to theſe infinite diſtractions,
where is the communion of Saints?

But be not too much diſmaid, my ſon;
notwithſtanding all theſe cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartnings,

He that is truth it ſelf hath ſaid, <hi>The
Gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt
his Church: (Mat.</hi> 16. 18.) In ſpight of
all Devils, there ſhall be Saints, and
thoſe are, and ſhall be as the ſcales of
the <hi>Leviathan, whoſe ſtrong pieces of
ſhields are his pride, ſhut up together as
with a cloſe ſeal; one is ſo near to another,
that no air can come betwixt them; They
are joyned one to another, they ſtick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they cannot be ſundred: (Job</hi>
41. 15, 16, 17.) In all the main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion, there is an univerſal
and unanimous conſent of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and theſe are they that conſtitute
a Church: Thoſe that agree in theſe,
Chriſt is pleaſed to admit (for matter
of doctrine) as members of that body
whereof he is the head: and if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not of each other as ſuch, the fault
is in the uncharitableneſſe of the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109037:58"/>
no leſſe then in the error of the
refuſed: And if any vain and looſe
ſtraglers will needs ſever themſelves,
and wilfully chooſe to go wayes of
their own; let them know that the
union of Chriſts Church ſhall conſiſt
entire without them; this great Ocean
will be one collection of waters, when
theſe drops are loſt in the duſt: In the
mean time it highly concerns all that
wiſh wel to the ſacred name of Chriſt,
<hi>to labour to keep the unity of the ſpirit
in the bond of peace; (Eph.</hi> 4. 3.) and to
renue and continue the prayer of the
Apoſtle for all the profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
<hi>Now the God of patience and
conſolation, grant you to be like-minded
one towards another, according to Chriſt
Jeſus; That ye may with one minde, and

of the hearts of Gods Saints
upon earth can be idle and ineffectuall;
but where ever it is, it puts forth it

                     <p>We cannot be ſingle in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

What member of the body
can complain, ſo as the reſt ſhall not
feel it? Even the head and heart are
in pain, when a joynt of the leaſt toe
ſuffers; no Chriſtian can be afflicted
alone; It is not Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe only;

is offended, and I burn not?</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109037:59"/>
29.) Our ſhoulders are not our
own, we muſt bear one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:
(<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2.) There is a better
kinde of ſpirituall good fellowſhip in
all the Saints of God: They hate a
propriety of paſſions, <hi>Rejoyce with
them that rejoyce, and weep with them
that weep. (Rom.</hi> 12. 15.) Their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not more communicative
then their gifts and graces; thoſe, as
they are beſtowed with an intuition of
the common good, ſo they are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
Wherefore hath this man quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of wit, that man depth of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
this, heat of zeal, that, power
of elocution; this, skill, that, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
this, authority, that ſtrength;
but that all ſhould be laid together for
the raiſing of the common ſtock? How
rich therefore is every Chriſtian ſoul;
that is not only furniſhed with its own
graces, but hath a ſpeciall intereſt in
all the excellent gifts of all the moſt
eminent ſervants of God through the
the whole world? Surely he cannot be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109037:59"/>

                     <p>Neither are or can theſe gifts be in
the danger of concealment; they are

As therefore no true Chriſtian
is his own man; ſo he freely layes out
himſelf, by example, by admonition,
by exhortation, by conſolation, by
prayer, for the univerſall benefit of
all his fellow members; By example,
which is not a a little winning and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent;
<hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before

of a crooked, and perverſe nation, among
whom ye ſhine as lights in the world,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109037:60"/>
holding forth the word of life;</hi> Lo, the
world ſits in darkneſſe, and either ſtirs
not, or moves with danger; good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is a light to their feet, which
directs them to walk in the wayes of
God, without erring, without ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
ſo as the good mans actions
are ſo many copies for novices to take
out; no leſſe inſtructive then the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt

The ſinner is already in the fire, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
admonition ſnatches him out
from the everlaſting burnings, (<hi>Jude
v.</hi> 23.) The charitable Chriſtian may
not forbear this (oft times thankleſſe,
but) alwayes neceſſary and profitable
duty: <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in
thy heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke
thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon
him. (Lev.</hi> 19. 17.</p>

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:109037:60"/>
By exhortation; The fire of Gods

damps, and dangers of quenching;
ſeaſonable exhortation blowes it up,
and quickens thoſe ſparks of good
motions to a perfect flame; Even the
beſt of us lies open to a certain dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and obduredneſſe of heart,
ſeaſonable exhortation ſhakes off this
perill, and keeps the heart in an holy

daily, whiles it is called, to day; leſt
any of you be hardned through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe
of ſin. (Heb.</hi> 3. 13.)</p>
                     <p>By conſolation; We are all natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubject to droop under the preſſure

lift, and ſtay us up: It is a ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

<hi>They have heard that I ſigh;

Reproach hath broken my heart, and I
am full of heavineſſe; and I looked for
ſome to take pity, and there was none,
and for comforters, but I found none.
<hi>Wherefore hath God given to men
the tongue of the learned, but that
they might know to ſpeak a word in
ſeaſon to him that is weary?</hi> (Eſa. 50.
3.) That they may ſtrengthen the weak
hands, and confirm the feeble knees; and
ſay to them that are of a fearfull heart,
Be ſtrong, fear not. (Eſa. 35. 3.) <hi>The

(Luk. 22. 32.) <hi>holds univerſally;</hi>
Thou when thou art converted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
thy brethren.</p>
                     <p>By prayer: ſo as each member of
Chriſts Church ſues for all; neither
can any one be ſhut out from partaking
the benefit of the devotions of all Gods
Saints upon earth: There is a certain
ſpirituall traffique of piety betwixt
all Gods children, wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109037:61"/>
prayers with each other; not
regarding number, ſo much as weight:
Am I weak in ſpirit, and faint in my
ſupplications? I have no leſſe ſhare in
the moſt fervent prayers of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſuppliants, then in my own; All
the vigour that is in the moſt ardent
hearts ſupplies my defects; whiles
there is life in their faithfull devotions,
I cannot go away unbleſſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, where there is a communion
of inward graces, and ſpirituall ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
there muſt needs be much more
be a communication of outward, and
temporall good things as juſt occaſion
requireth; Away with thoſe dotages
of <hi>Platonicall,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſticall</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities;
Let proprieties be, as they
ought, conſtantly fixed where the
lawes, and civill right have placed
them; But let the uſe of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bleſſings be managed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the neceſſities of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
<hi>Withhold not thy goods from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109037:62"/>
the owners thereof, when it is in the
power of thy hand to do it: Say not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy neighbour, Go, and come again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow,
and I will give it, when thou
haſt it by thee, (Prov.</hi> 3. 27, 28.) Theſe
temporall things were given us not to
engroſſe, and hoard up ſuperfluouſly,
but to diſtribute and diſpenſe; <hi>As we
have therefore opportunity, let us do
good untoall men, eſpecially them who
are of the houſhold of faith. (Gal.</hi> 6. 10.)</p>
                     <p>Such then is the union of Gods
children here on earth, both in matter
of judgement, and affection; and the
beneficiall improvement of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
whether in ſpirituall gifts, or
good offices, or communicating of our
earthly ſubſtance; where the heart is
one, none of theſe can be wanting, and
where they all are, there is an happy
communion of Saints.</p>

(in the behalf of thine <hi>Epheſians</hi>) unto
the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?
Even this, that they may know the
love of Chriſt, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109037:69"/>
(<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14. 19.) Give me
leave firſt to wonder at thy ſuit; and
then, much more, at what thou ſueſt
for: Were thine affections raiſed ſo
high to thine <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that thou
ſhouldſt crave for them impoſſible
favours? Did thy love ſo far over-ſhoot
thy reaſon, as to pray they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the knowledge of that which
cannot be known? It is the love of
Chriſt which thou wiſheſt they may
know, and it is that love which thou
ſayeſt is paſt all knowledge; What
ſhall we ſay to this? Is it for that there
may be holy ambitions of thoſe
heights of grace, which we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hope actually to attain? Or is it,
rather, that thou ſuppoſeſt, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
they may reach to the knowledge
of that love, the meaſure whereof they
could never aſpire to know: Surely,
ſo it is, O bleſſed Jeſu; that thou haſt
loved us, we know; but, how much
thou haſt loved us, is paſt the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109037:69"/>
of Angels: Thoſe glorious
ſpirits, as they deſire to look into the
deep myſtery of our redemption, ſo
they wonder to behold that divine
love whereby it is wrought, but they
can no more reach to the bottome of
it, then they can affect to be infinite.
For ſurely, no leſs then an endleſs line
can ſerve to fadome a bottomeleſſe
depth: Such, O Saviour, is the abyſſe of
thylove to miſerable man: Alas, what
dowe poor, wrethed duſt of the earth
go about to meaſure it by the ſpans,
and inches of our ſhallow thoughts?
Far, far, be ſuch preſumption from
us; Onely admit us, O bleſſed Lord,
to look at, to admire, and ad ore that
which we give up for incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
What ſhall we then ſay to this
love, Oh dear Jeſu, both as thine, and
as caſt upon us; All earthly love ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
ſome kinde of equality, (or
proportion at leaſt) betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that loves, and is loved; Here is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109037:70"/>
none at all; ſo as (which is paſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
extreams meet without a mean:
For, lo, thou, who art the eternall and
abſolute Being, God bleſſed for ever,
lovedſt me that had no being at all;
thou lovedſt me both when I was not,
and could never have been, but by
thee: It was from thy love that I had
any being at all: much more that
when thou hadſt given me a beeing,
thou ſhouldſt follow me with ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mercies? who but thou (who art
infinite in goodneſſe) would love that
which is not? Our poor ſenſuall love
is drawn from us by the ſight of a
face, or a picture; neither is ever raiſed
but upon ſome pleaſing motive: thou
wouldſt make that which thou wouldſt
love, and wouldſt love that which
thou hadſt made; O God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was there
ever love ſo free, ſo gracious, as this
of thine? Who can be capable to love
us but men or Angels? Men love us
becauſe they ſee ſomething in us
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109037:70"/>
which they think amiable; Angels
love us becauſe thou doſt ſo: But why
doſt thou (O bleſſed Lord) love us,
but becauſe thou wouldſt? There
can be no cauſe of thy will, which is
the cauſe of all things; Even, ſo Lord,
ſince this love did riſe only from thee;
let the praiſe and glory of it reſt only

I loſt in a juſt amazement? It is that
which fetcht thee down from the

the boſome of thine eternall Father to
this lower world, the region of ſorrow
and death: It is that which (to the
wonder of Angels) cloathed thee

thee (who thoughtſt it no robbery to
be equall with God) to an eſtate lower

tranſcending the admiration of all the

thoſe celeſtiall powers ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacted

that all this goodly frame of creation
ſhould run back into its firſt confuſion,
or be reduced to one ſingle atome; it
is not ſo high a wonder as for God
to become man thoſe changes (though
the higheſt that nature is capable of)
are yet but of things finite; this is
of an infinite ſubject, with which the

moſt excellent of finite things can
hold no proportion: Oh the great
myſtery of godlineſſe; God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the fleſh, and ſeen of Angels!
Thoſe heavenly ſpirits had ever
ſince they were made, ſeen his moſt
glorious Deity, and adored him as
their omnipotent Creator; but to ſee
that God of ſpirits inveſted with fleſh,
was ſuch a wonder, as had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

pleaſure, magnificence, but if it be

But as it was with thine <hi>Iſraelies</hi> of
old, that it would not content them
that thou promiſedſt, and wouldſt
ſend thine Angell before them, to
bring them into the Land flowing
with milk and honey, unleſſe thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
O Lord, ſhould alſo go along
with them; ſo is it ſtill with me and
all thine, wert not thou with, and in
us, what could thine Angels do for
us? In thee it is that they move and
are; The ſame infinite Spirit which
works in, and by them, works alſo in
me: From thee it is, O thou bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and eternall Spirit, that I have
any ſtirrings of holy motions, any
breathings of good deſires, any life
of grace, any will to reſiſt, any power
to overcome evill; It is thou, O God,
that girdeſt me with ſtrength unto
battell; thou haſt given me the
ſhield of thy ſalvation; thy right
hand hath holden me up; thou haſt
alſo given me the necks of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109037:89"/>
Glory and praiſe be to thee, O
Lord, which alwaies cauſeſt us to
triumph in Chriſt; who crowneſt us
with loving kindneſſe, and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and haſt not held us ſhort of the
beſt of thy favours.</p>
                     <p>Truly, Lord, hadſt thou given us
but a meer beeing, as thou haſt done
to the loweſt rank of thy creatures, it
had been more then thou oweſt us:
more then ever we could be able to
requite to thy divine bounty; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beeing is good, and the leaſt degree
of good is farre above our worthineſs;
But, that to our beeing thou haſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
life, it is yet an higher meaſure of
thy mercy; for certainly, of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
favours, life is the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
yet this is ſuch a benefit as may
be had and not perceived; for even the
plants of the earth live and feel it not;
that to our life therefore thou haſt
made a further acceſſion of ſenſe, it
is yet a larger improvement of thy
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109037:90"/>
beneficence: for this faculty hath
ſome power to manage life; and makes
it capable to affect thoſe means which
may tend to the preſervation of it,
and to decline the contrary; but this
is no other then the brute creatures
enjoy equally with us, and ſome of
them beyond us: that therefore to
our ſenſe thou haſt bleſſed us with
a further addition of reaſon, it is yet
an higher pitch of munificence; for
hereby we are men; and, as ſuch, are
able to attain ſome knowledge of thee
our Creator, to obſerve the motions
of the heavens, to ſearch into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of our fellow-creatures, to paſſe
judgement upon actions, and events,
and to tranſact theſe earthly affairs to
our own beſt advantage. But when all
this is done, wo were to us if we were
but men; for our corrupted reaſon
renders us of all creatures the moſt
miſerable: that therefore to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thou haſt ſuperadded faith; to our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109037:90"/>
nature grace; and of men haſt made us
Chriſtians; and to us, as ſuch, haſt
given thy Chriſt, thy Spirit; and
thereby made us of enemies, ſons, and
heirs; co-heirs with Chriſt of thine
eternall and moſt glorious kingdome
of heaven; yea, haſt incorporated us
into thy ſelf, and made us one ſpirit
with thee our God; Lord, what room
can there be poſſibly in theſe ſtrait
and narrow hearts of ours for a due
admiration of thy tranſcendent love
and mercy? I am ſwallowed up, O
God, I am willingly ſwallowed up in
this bottomeleſſe abyſſe of thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
love; and there let me dwell in
a perpetuall raviſhment of ſpirit, till
being freed from this clog of earth,
and filled with the fulneſs of Chriſt,
I ſhall be admitted to enjoy that,
which I cannot now reach to wonder
at, thine incomprehenſible bliſſe, and

                  <head>An Exhortary Preface to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of infallible rules and long
experience have I gathered up
this true character of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:
A labour (ſome will think) might
have been well ſpared: Every man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
both to know and act this part;
Who is there that would not be angry,
if but a queſtion ſhould be made either
of his skill, or intereſt? Surely, ſince
the firſt name given at <hi>Antioch,</hi> all
the beleeving world hath been ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the honour of it; how happy
were it, if all that are willing to wear
the livery, were as ready to do the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But it fals out here, as in the caſe
of all things that are at once honourable,
and difficult, every one affects the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
few labour for the truth of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement.
Having therefore leiſure
enough to look about me, and finding
the world too prone to this worſt kinde
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109037:93"/>
of hypocriſie, I have made this true
draught, not more for direction, then
for tryall. Let no man view theſe lines
as a ſtranger, but when he looks in this
glaſſe, let him ask his heart whether
this be his own face; yea, rather when
he ſees this, face, let him examine his
heart whether both of them agree with
their pattern. And where he findes his
failings, (as who ſhall not?) let him
ſtrive to amend them; and never give
over, whiles he is any way leſſe fair then
his copy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I would it were
leſſe eaſie, by theſe rules, to judg even of
others beſides our ſelves; or, that it were
uncharitable to ſay, there are many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
few Chriſtians; If words and
forms might carry it, Chriſt would have
Clients enow: but if holineſſe of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and uprightneſſe of carriage muſt
be the proof, woe is me, <hi>In the midſt of
the Land, among the people, there is
as the ſhaking of an Olive tree, and as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109037:93"/>
the gleaning Grapes where the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is done.</hi> (Eſai. 24. 13.) For where
is the man hath obtained the maſtery of
his corrupt affections, and to be the Lord
of his unruly appetite? that hath his
heart in heaven, whiles his living car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe
is ſtirring here upon earth? that
can ſee the inviſible, and ſecretly enjoy
that Saviour, to whom he is ſpiritually
united? That hath ſubdued his will and
reaſon to his beleefe; that fears nothing
but God; loves nothing but goodneſſe;
hates nothing but ſin; rejoyceth in none
but true bleſsings? Whoſe faith triumphs
over the world; whoſe hope is anchored
in heaven: whoſe charity knows no leſſe
bounds then God, and men: whoſe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
repreſents him as vile to himſelf, as
he is honorable in the reputation of God;
who is wiſe heaven ward; however he
paſſes with the world; who dares be no

                     </gap> who is even a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109037:94"/>
thrifty manager of his houres, ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the day betwixt his God, and his
Vocation, that neither ſhall finde fault
with a juſt neglect, or an unjuſt partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
whoſe recreations are harmleſſe,
honeſt, warrantable, ſuch as may refreſh
nature, not debauch it: whoſe diet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by health, not by pleaſure, as one
whoſe table ſhall be no altar to his belly,
nor ſnare to his ſoul: who in his ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
repoſe lies down, and awakes with
God, caring only to relieve his ſpirits;
not to cheriſh ſloth. Whoſe carriage is
meek, gentle, compliant, beneficiall in
whatſoever ſtation; in Magiſtracy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
juſt; in the Miniſtery conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
faithful; in the rule of his family
wiſely provident, and religiouſly exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary;
Shortly, who is a diſcreet and
loving yoke-fellow, a tender and
pious parent, a dutious and awfull
ſonne: an humble and obſequious
ſervant, an obedient and loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Whoſe heart is conſtantly ſetled
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109037:94"/>
in the main truthes of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
ſo as he cannot be removed;
in litigious points, neither too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
nor too peremptory: whoſe
diſcourſe is ſuch as may be meet for
the expreſsions of a tongue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to a ſound, godly, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
heart; whoſe breaſt continually
burnes with the heavenly fire of an
holy devotion; whoſe painfull ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are overcome with patience, and
chearfull reſolutions; whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
are attended with undaunted
courage, and crowned with an happy
victory: Laſtly, whoſe death is not
ſo full of fear and anguiſh, as of
ſtrong conſolations in that Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who hath overcome and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it; nor of ſo much dreadfulneſſe
in it ſelfe, as of joy in the preſent
expectation of that bleſſed iſſue of a
glorious immortality, which inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſucceeds it. Such is the Chriſtian
whom we doe here characterize, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109037:95"/>
commend to the world both for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and imitation; neither know I
which of theſe many qualifications
can be miſsing in that ſoul, who layes
a juſt claim to Chriſt, his Redeemer.
Take your hearts to task, therefore
my dear brethren, into whoſe hands
ſoever theſe lines ſhall come: and,
as you deſire to have peace at the
laſt, ranſack them thoroughly; not
contenting your ſelves with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory,
and faſhionable over-ſight
(which wil one day leave you irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediably
miſerable) but ſo ſearch, as
thoſe that reſolve not to give over
till you finde theſe gracious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in your boſoms, which I have
here deſcribed to you: ſo ſhall we be,
and make each other happy in the
ſucceſſe of our holy labours; which
the God of heaven bleſſe in both our
hands, to his owne glory; and our
mutual comfort in the day of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Whiles all the reſt of the world ſits
in darkneſſe, he lives in a perpetuall
light; the heaven of heavens is open
to none but him; thither his eye
pierceth, and beholds thoſe beams
of inacceſſible glory, which ſhine in
no face but his: The deep myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of godlineſſe which to the great
Clerks of the world are as a book
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109037:96"/>
claſped and ſealed up, lye open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him fair and legible; and whiles
thoſe book-men know whom they
have heard of, he knowes whom he
hath beleeved: He will not ſuffer
his Saviour to be ever out of his
eye; and if through ſome worldly
interceptions, he loſe the fight of that
bleſſed object for a time, he zealouſly
retrives him, not without an angry
theck of his own miſ-carriage; and
is now ſo much the more fixed by
his former flackning; ſo as he will
hence forth ſooner part with his ſoul,
then his Redeemer. The termes
of entireneſſe wherein he ſtands with
the Lord of life, are ſuch as he can
feel; but cannot expreſſe, though
hee ſhould borrow the language of
Angels: it is enough that they two
are one ſpirit: His reaſon is willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
captivated to his faith; his will
to his reaſon; and his affections to
both: He fears nothing that he ſees
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109037:97"/>
in compariſon of that which he ſees
not; and diſpleaſure is more dreadfull
to him then ſmart: Good is the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
object of his love; which he du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proportions according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of its eminence; affecting the
chief good, not without a certain ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment
of ſpirit; the leſſer with
a wiſe and holy moderation. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he do more hate ſin, or the evill
ſpirit that ſuggeſts it, is a queſtion;
Earthly contents are too mean
grounds whereon to raiſe his joy;
theſe, as he baulks not when they meet
him in his way, ſo he doth not too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
purſue; he may taſte of them,
but ſo, as he had rather faſt then ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet.
He is not inſenſible of thoſe loſſes
which caſualty, or enmity may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;
but that which lies moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
upon his heart, is his ſin: This
makes his ſleep ſhort and troubleſome,
his meals ſtomachleſſe, his recreations
liſtleſſe; his every thing, tedious; till
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109037:97"/>
he finde his ſoul acquitted by his
great Surety in heaven: which done,
he feels more peace and pleaſure in
his calm, then he found horrour in the
tempeſt. His heart is the ſtore-houſe
of moſt precious graces: That faith
whereby his ſoul is eſtabliſhed, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over the world, whether it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
or threaten; and bids defiance
to all the powers of darkneſſe; not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be foiled by any oppoſition:
His hope cannot be diſcouraged with
the greateſt difficulties; but bears up
againſt naturall impoſſiblities; and
knows how to reconcile contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
His charity is both extenſive, and
ſervent; barring out no one that bears
the face of a man; but pouring out it
ſelf upon the houſhold of faith; that
ſtudies good conſtructions of men,
and actions; and keeps it ſelf free both
from ſuſpicion, and cenſure: Grace
doth not more exalt him, then his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109037:98"/>
humility depreſſes him: Were it not
for that Chriſt who dwels in him, he
could think himſelf the meaneſt of all
creatures; now, he knows he may not
diſparage the Deity of him, by whom
he is ſo gloriouſly inhabited; in whoſe
only right he can be as great in his own
thoughts, as he is deſpicable in the
eyes of the world. He is wiſe to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
however it be with him for the
world; and well knowing he cannot
ſerve two maſters, he cleaves to the
better; making choice of that good
part which can never be taken from
him; not ſo much regarding to get
that which he cannot keep, as to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
himſelf of that good which he
cannot loſe. He is juſt in all his dealings
with men; hating to thrive by injury,
and oppreſſion; and will rather leave
behind ſomething of his own, then
filch from anothers heap. He is not
cloſe fiſted, where there is juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his diſtribution; willingly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109037:98"/>
parting with thoſe metals which he
regards only for uſe; not caring for
either their colour, or ſubſtance; earth
is to him no other then it ſelf, in what

good cauſe he is bold as a Lion; and
can neither fear faces, nor ſhrink at
dangers: and is rather heartned with
oppoſition, preſſing ſo much the more
where he finds a large door open, and
many adverſaries; and when he muſt
ſuffer, doth as reſolutely ſtoop, as
he did before valiantly reſiſt. He is
holily temperate in the uſe of all
Gods bleſſings, as knowing by whom
they are given, and to what end;
neither dares either to miſ-lay them,
or to miſ-ſpend them laviſhly: as
duly weighing upon what tearmes he
receives them; and fore-expecting an
account. Such an hand doth he carry
upon his pleaſures and delights, that
they run not away with him; he knows
how to ſlacken the reins without a

debauched kind of diſſoluteneſſe, and
how to ſtraiten them without a ſullen

Chriſtian then, is this; He ſees ſtill
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109037:99"/>
heaven open to him, and beholds and
admires the light inacceſſible; he ſees
the all-glorious God ever before him;
the Angels of God about him; the
evill ſpirits aloof off enviouſly groyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and repining at him; the world
under his feet, willing to rebell, but
forced to be ſubject; the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ready to tender their ſervice to
him; and is accordingly affected to all
theſe; he ſees heaven open with joy and
deſire of fruition; he ſees God with an
adoring awfulneſſe; he ſees the Angels
with a thankfull acknowledgement,
and care not to offend them; he ſees the
evill ſpirits with hatred and watchfull
indignation; he ſees the world with
an holy imperiouſneſſe, commanding
it for uſe, and ſcorning to ſtoop
to it for obſervance; Laſtly, he ſees
the good creatures, with gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and care to improve them to
the advantage of him that lent them.</p>
                     <p>Having thus gathered up his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109037:100"/>
thoughts, and found where he is, he
may now be fit for his conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
which he fals upon, not
without a trembling veneration of
that infinite and incomprehenſible
Majeſty, before whom he is proſtrate;
now he climes up into that heaven,
which he before did but behold; and
ſolemnly pours out his ſoul in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thankſgivings, and humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
into the boſome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
wherein his awe is ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with his faith, that whiles he
labours under the ſenſe of his own
vileneſſe, he is raiſed up in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an infinite mercy; now he
renues his feeling intereſt in the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt his bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
and labours to get in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
breath new pledges of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
entireneſſe; ſo ſeaſoning his
heart with theſe earely thoughts of
piety, as that they ſtick by him all
the day after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:109037:100"/>
Having thus begun with his God,
and begg'd his bleſſing: he now finds
time to addreſſe himſelf to the works
of his calling; To live without any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to live in an unwarrantable vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
not to labour in the vocation
wherein he lives, are things which his
ſoul hateth: Theſe buſineſſes of his
calling therefore, he followes with a
willing and contented induſtry; not
as forced to it by the neceſſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, or as urged by the Law of
neceſſity, out of the ſenſe or fear of
want: nor yet contrarily, out of an eager
deſire of enriching himſelf in his eſtate,
but in a conſcionable obedience to that
God who hath made man to labour as
the ſparks to flye upward; and hath
laid it upon him both as a puniſhment,
and charge: In the ſweat of thy brows
ſhalt thou eat thy bread. In an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
alacrity he walks on in the way,
wherein his God hath ſet him; yet not,
the while, ſo intent upon his hands, as
not to tend his heart; which he lifts
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109037:101"/>
up in frequent ejaculations to that
God, to whom he deſires to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in all his endevours; aſcribing
all the thanks both of his ability, and
ſucceſſe to that omnipotent hand: If
he meet with any rubs of difficulty in
his way, hee knows who ſent them,
and who can remove them; not leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
any prudentiall means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
he is not to ſeek for an higher
redreſſe.</p>
                     <p>If he have occaſion of trading with
others; his will may not be the rule of
his gain, but his conſcience; neither
dares he ſtrive for what he can get, but
what he ought: Equity is here the
Clerk of the Market; and the meaſure
which he would have others mete out
to himſelf, is the ſtandard whereby he
deſires to be tryed in his menſurations
to all other. He hates to hoiſe prices
upon occaſion of his neighbours need;
and to take the advantage of forfaits
by the clock. He is not ſuch a ſlave to
his trade, as not to ſpare an hour to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109037:101"/>
his ſoul; neither dares he ſo laviſh as
utterly to neglect his charge upon
whatever pretence of pleaſure, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
Shortly, he takes his work at
the hand of God, and leaves it with
him: humbly offering up his ſervices
to his great Maſter in heaven; and after
al his labour fits comfortably down in
the conſcience of having faithfully
done his task, though not without the
intervention of many infirmities.</p>

ſome quick and ſavory ſauce to a liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and cloyed ſtomach; like unto a
ſweet nap after an over-watching. He
is far from thoſe delights that may
effeminate, or corrupt the mind; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
to ſit by thoſe pleaſures, from
which he ſhall not riſe better: He hates
to turn paſtime into trade; not abiding
to ſpend more time in whetting, thèn
till his edge be ſharp; In the height of
his delectations he knows to enjoy
God; from whom as he fetches his
allowance, ſo he craves and expects a
gracious acceptation, even whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lets
himſelf moſt looſe. And if at any time
he have gone beyond his meaſure, he
chides himſelf for the exceſſe, and is
ſo much the more carefull ever after to
keep within compaſſe. He can onely
make a kind of uſe of thoſe content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherewith light minds are
tranſported: and can manage his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
without paſſion; and leave a loſer
without regret. A ſmile to him is as
much as a loud laughter to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;

neither doth he entertain mirth

neither the meat that he eats, nor the

he dares not loſe himſelf in his feaſt;

man then himſelf; He hath an hand
ready upon every occaſion to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to his neighbour; as if he thought
himſelf made to do good; He hates
to ſell his breath to his friend, where
his advice may be uſefull; neither is
more ambitious of any thing under
heaven, then of doing good offices;
It is his happineſſe if he can reconcile
quarrels, and make peace between diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
friends. When he is choſen an
Umpire, he will be ſure to cut even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both parties; and commonly
diſpleaſeth both, that he may wrong
neither; if he be called forth to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
he puts off all private intereſts,
and commands friendſhip to give
place to juſtice; Now he knows no
couſens, no enemies; neither couſens
for favour, nor enemies for revenge;
but looks right forward to the cauſe,
without ſquinting aſide to the perſons.
No flattery can keep him from brow-beating
of vice; no fear can work him
to diſcourage vertue: Where ſeverity
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109037:105"/>
is requiſite, he hates to enjoy anothers
puniſhment; and where mercy may
be more prevalent, he hates to uſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:

                     <p>If he be called to the honour of
Gods Embaſſie to his people, he dares
not but be faithfull in delivering that

fear faces, or reſpect perſons; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
odious to him to hide and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of Gods counſell, and to foiſt
in any of his own to ſuppreſſe truth
and to adulterate it; He ſpeaks not
himſelf, but Chriſt, and labours not
to tickle the ear, but to ſave ſoules: So
doth he goe before his flock as one
that means to feed them no leſſe by
his example, then by his doctrine; and
would condemn himſelf, if he did not
live the Goſpel, as well as preach it;
He is neither too auſtere in his retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor too good-cheap in his ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109037:106"/>
but carries ſo eaven an hand
that his diſcreet affableneſſe may be
free from contempt, and that he may
win his people with a loving converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
If any of his charge be miſcarried
into an errour of opinion, he labours
to reclaim him by the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
ſo as the miſ-guided may
reade nothing but love in his zealous
conviction; if any be drawn into
a vicious courſe of life, he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
him back with a gentle, yet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
hand; by an holy importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
working the offender to a ſenſe
of his owne danger, and to a ſaving
penitence.</p>
                     <p>Is he the maſter of a family? he
dares not be a Lion in his own houſe;
cruelly tyrannizing over his meaneſt
drudge: but ſo moderately exerciſes
his power, as knowing himſelf to be
his apprentices fellow-ſervant; He is
the mouth of his meiny to God, in his
dayly devotions; offering up for them
the calves of his lips, in his morning
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109037:106"/>
and evening ſacrifice and the mouth
of God unto them in his wholeſome
inſtructions, and al godly admonitions:
he goes before them in good examples
of piety, and holy converſation,
and ſo governs, as one that hathmore
then meer bodies committed to his
charge.</p>
                     <p>Is he the husband of a wife? He
carries his yoak even; not laying too
much weight upon the weaker neck,
His helper argues him the principall;
and he ſo knows it; that he makes a
wiſe uſe of his juſt inequality: ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
himſelf to be the ſuperiour,
as that he can be no other then one
fleſh: He maintains therefore his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
authority with a conjugall love,
ſo holding up the right of his ſexe, that
in the mean time he doth not violently
claſh with the britler veſſel: As his
choice was not made by weight, or by
the voice, or by the hiew of the hide,
but for pure affection grounded
upon vertue; ſo the ſame regards
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109037:107"/>
hold him cloſe to a conſtant conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of his chaſt love; which can
never yeeld either to change or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                     <p>Is he a father of children? he looks
upon them as more Gods then his
own; and governs them accordingly:
He knows it is only their worſe part
which they have received from his
loins, their diviner half is from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of lights, and is now become the
main part of his charge. As God gave
them to him, and to the world by him:
ſo his chief care is, that they may be
begotten again to God; that they may
put off that corrupt nature which they
took from him, and be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that divine nature which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them in their regeneration. For
this cauſe he trains them up in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and religious education: he ſets
them in their way, corrects their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances,
reſtraines their wilde deſires
and labours to frame them to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſitions; and ſo beſtows his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109037:107"/>
care upon, and for them, as one
that had rather they ſhould be good
then rich, and would wiſh them rather
dead, then debaucht: he neglects not
al honeſt means of their proviſion, but
the higheſt point he aims at, is to leave
God their patrimony. In the choice
of their calling, or match, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,
but forces not, as knowing
they have alſo wils of their own, which
it is fitter for him to bow, then to
break. Is he a ſon? he is ſuch as may
be fit to proceed from ſuch loins.</p>
                     <p>Is he a ſervant? he cannot but be
officious: for he muſt pleaſe two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
though one under, not againſt
the other; when his viſible maſter ſees
him not, he knowes he cannot be out
of the eye of the inviſible; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dares not be either negligent, or
unfaithfull. The work that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
he goes through, not out of
fear, but out of conſcience, and would
doe his buſineſſe no otherwiſe then
well, though he ſerved a blind maſter;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109037:108"/>
He is no blab of the defects at home,
and where he cannot defend, is ready
to excuſe: He yeelds patiently to a
juſt reproof, and anſwers with an
humble ſilence: and is more carefull
not to deſerve, then to avoid ſtripes.</p>
                     <p>Is he a ſubject? He is awfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to Soveraignty, as knowing by
whom the powers are ordained; He
dares not curſe the King, no not in his
thought; nor revile the Ruler of his
people, though juſtly faulty: much
leſſe dare be ſclander the footſteps of
Gods anointed. He ſubmits not only
for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake,
to every Ordinance of God, yea,
to every Ordinance of man for the
Lords ſake; not daring to diſobey
in regard of the oath of God; If he
have reacht forth his hand to cut off
but the skirt of the Royall robe, his
heart ſmites him: He is a true payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and willingly renders tribute to
whom tribute, cuſtome to whom cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
honour to whom honour is due;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109037:108"/>
and juſtly divides his duties betwixt
God and <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, in what ever relation he

obſervant of his rule, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be approved ſuch, both to God
and men.</p>

                     <p>He is not apt to ſpend himſelf in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
but as for revilings, and curſed
ſpeakings againſt God, or men, thoſe
his ſoul abhorreth. He knowes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his thoughts by locking them up
in his boſome under a ſafe ſilence, and
when he muſt ſpeak, dares not be too
free of his tongue, as well knowing
that in the multitude of words there
wanteth not ſinne. His ſpeeches are no
other then ſeaſonable, and well fitted
both to the perſon, and occaſion;
Jigges at a funerall, Lamentations at
a feaſt, holy counſell to ſcorners, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to the dejected, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109037:110"/>
to the prophane, are hatefull
to him; He meddles not with other
mens matters, much leſſe with affairs
of State but keeps himſelf wiſely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own compaſſe: Not thinking his
breath well ſpent, where he doth not
either teach, or learn.</p>

whiles other cold ſuiters that come
thither but in ſome good fits of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
obtain nothing but denials; He
dares not preſſe to Gods foot-ſtool in

he comes in the gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

in whom he knows he cannot but be

                     <p>His prayers are ſuited according to
the degrees of the benefits ſued for;
He therefore begs grace abſolutely;
temporall bleſſings with limitation;
and is accordingly affected in the
grant: Neither is he more earneſt in
craving mercies, then he is zealouſly
deſirous to be retributory to God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

ſuing to be rich in grace, then to
improve his graces to the honour and

advantage of the beſtower: With an
awfull and broken heart doth he make
his addreſſes to that infinite Majeſty,
from whoſe preſence he returns with
comfort and joy: His ſoule is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fixed there whither he powres it
out; diſtraction and diſtruſt are ſhut
out from his cloſet; and he is ſo taken
up with his devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as one that makes
it his work to pray: And when he
hath offered up his ſacrifices unto
God, his faith liſtens and looks in at

Chriſtian is in ſuffering; any man
may ſteer in a good gale, and clear ſea,

tempeſt: Herein the Chriſtian goes
beyond the Pagans, not practiſe only,
but admiration; We rejoyce in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109037:111"/>
ſaith the choſen Veſſell; Lo
here a point tranſcending all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of Heatheniſm. Perhaps ſome
reſolute ſpirit, whether out of a natural
fortitude, or out of an ambition of
fame or earthly glory, may ſet a face
upon a patient enduring of loſſe, or
pain, but never any of thoſe heroick
Gentiles durſt pretend to a joy in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
Hither can Chriſtian courage
reach; knowing that tribulation work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
patience, and patience, experience,
and experience, hope, and hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not aſhamed.</p>
                     <p>Is he bereaved of his goods and
worldly eſtate? he comforts himſelf
in the conſcience of a better treaſure
that can never be loſt; Is he afflicted
with ſickneſſe? his comfort is that the
inward man is ſo much more renued
daily, as the outward periſheth: Is he
ſlandered and unjuſtly diſgraced? his
comfort is that there is a bleſſing,
which will more then make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends;
Is he baniſhed? he knows he is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109037:112"/>
on his way home-ward; Is he impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
his ſpirit cannot be lockt in; God
and his Angels cannot be lockt out; Is
he dying? To him to live is Chriſt,
and to dye is gain; Is he dead? He reſts
from his labours, and is crowned with
glory: Shortly, he is perfect gold that
comes more pure out of the fire then it
went in; neither had ever been ſo great
a Saint in heaven, if he had not paſſed
through the flames of his tryall here
upon earth.</p>

                     <p>HE knows himſelf never out of
danger; and therefore ſtands
ever upon his guard; neither of his
hands are empty; the one holds out
the ſhield of faith; the other manageth
the ſword of the ſpirit; both of them
are employed in his perpetual conflict.
He cannot be weary of reſiſting, but
reſolves to dye fighting: He hath a
ward for every blow; and as his eye
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109037:112"/>
is quick to diſcern temptations, ſo is
his hand and foot nimble to avoid
them: He cannot be diſcouraged with
either the number or power of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
knowing that his ſtrength is out
of himſelf, in him in whom he can do
all things; and that there can be no
match to the Almighty; He is carefull
not to give advantage to his vigilant
adverſary; and therefore warily avoids
the occaſions of ſinne: and if at any
time he be overtaken with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainneſſe,
or ſubtilty of a temptation,
he ſpeedily recovers himſelf by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
repentance; and fights ſo much the
harder becauſe of his foil. He hates to
take quarter of the ſpirituall powers;
nothing leſſe then death can put an
and to to this quarrell; nor nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

ſoul within his teeth, as to ſend it
forth well addreſſed for happineſſe: as
knowing therefore the laſt brunt to be
moſt violent, he rouzeth up his holy
fortitude to encounter that King of
fear, his laſt enemy, Death; And now
after a painfull ſickneſſe, and a reſolute
expectation of the fierceſt aſſault, it
fals out with him as in the meeting
of the two hoſtile brothers, <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Eſau,</hi> in ſtead of grapling he finds a
courteous ſalutation, for ſtabs, kiſſes;
for height of enmity, offices of love;
Life could never befriend him ſo
much, as Death offers to do: That
tenders him (perhaps a rough, but) a
ſure hand to lead him to glory; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a welcome accordingly: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any cauſe to marvell at
the change; The Lord of life hath
wrought it; he having by dying ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109037:113"/>
death, hath reconciled it to his
own; and hath (as it were) beaten it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe fair tearms with all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his myſticall body: ſo as whiles
unto the enemies of God, Death is ſtill
no other then a terrible executioner
of divine vengeance, he is to all that
are in Chriſt, a plauſible and ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
unto bleſſedneſſe; The Chriſtian
therefore now laid upon his laſt bed,
when this grim meſſenger comes to
fetch him to heaven, looks not ſo much
at his dreadfull viſage, as at his happy
errand: and is willing not to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what death is in it ſelf, but what
it is to us in Chriſt; by whom it is
made ſo uſefull and beneficiall, that
we could not be happy without it;
Here then comes in the laſt act, and
employment of faith; (for after this
brunt paſſed, there is no more uſe of
faith, but of viſion) that heartens the
ſoul in a lively apprehenſion of that
bleſſed Saviour, who both led him the
way of ſuffering, and is making way
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109037:114"/>
for him to everlaſting glory: That
ſhews him Jeſus the Authour and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
of our faith, who for the joy that
was ſet before him, endured the
Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet
down at the right hand of the throne
of God; That clings cloſe unto him,
and lays unremoveable hold upon his
perſon, his merits, his bleſſedneſſe;
upon the wings of this faith is the ſoul
ready to mount up toward that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is open to receive it; and
in that act of evolation puts it ſelf into
the hands of thoſe bleſſed Angels who
are ready to carry it up to the throne
of Glory.</p>
