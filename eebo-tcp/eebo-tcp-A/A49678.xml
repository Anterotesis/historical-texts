            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READERS.</head>
            <p>MAny have been the <hi>Sham-Plots</hi> (of late) to conceal the <hi>True One;</hi> a ſubtil Age (no doubt) we live in, <hi>Plot</hi> upon <hi>Plot.</hi>

            <p>Amongſt other <hi>Contrivances,</hi> certainly this of <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Dirt</hi> and endeavouring to blemiſh Mr. <hi>Hickerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s Reputation by a grand Conſpiracy againſt him (and that by no ſmall Fools neither;) to convict him for a <hi>Common-Barretor,</hi> and conſequently a whisking Fine <hi>(ad libitum Judicium)</hi> to ruine him; is none of the leaſt, nor leaſt worthy the Publiſhing, for the benefit of every true <hi>Free-born En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-Man.</hi> Many have ſet the <hi>Fine</hi> before hand, ſome voted to fine him one thouſand pounds, ſome two thouſand, ſome four thouſand pounds, nay, ſome <hi>(went further)</hi> prognoſticated that it would cost him <hi>all his Temporal Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither would this content ſome of them, but his Benefice muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited into the Bargain, (ſo true is that in the <hi>Naked Truth,) — The Mercies of the Wicked are cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly conſidering the very many pretty Intrigues, the crafty Quirks in Law and Jingo's (hereafter diſcover'd in this Tryal) and the methods of proceeding againſt him, you may perhaps find as much Pleaſure and Diverſion, as Profit in this Publication.</p>

Some there were ſo magically zealous, as to conſult the <hi>Delphine Oracles,</hi> (I mean) the <hi>Wiſe-men, Magicians,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> about the happy Event of this ſo much noiſed Tryal.</p>
            <p>And one <hi>G</hi>— erecting a Scheme (in anſwer to an Horary Question to that Purpoſe) found the Face of the Heavens <hi>to their Wiſh</hi> (or at least he made the Fools believe ſo.)</p>
            <p>For the Queſtion being put — <hi>Whether the Rumors and Reports a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defendant Mr.</hi> Hickeringill, <hi>were true or falſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord of the Aſcendant</hi> (which ſignifies the <hi>Querent</hi>) and alſo the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> together with the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpoſitor</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> were in an <hi>Angle,</hi> and the <hi>Succedent Houſe</hi> in a <hi>Fixed Sign,</hi> and in good <hi>Aſpect</hi> with the Fortunes <hi>Jupiter, Sol,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which ſignifies that the Reports and Rumors were many and great, and alſo very true, and would prove ſo upon Tryal.</p>
            <p>Beſides, The <hi>Angles</hi> of the Figure were <hi>Fixed Signs,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Fixed Signs,</hi> ſeparating from the Infortunes <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and applying to good Fortunes poſited in the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Figure.</p>
            <p>Nay, All the <hi>Planets (from Top to Toe)</hi> from ſurly Grim-Fac'd <hi>Saturn,</hi> to the Fickle <hi>Moon,</hi> look'd <hi>aſquint,</hi> upon the Defendant, and his <hi>Significator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only <hi>Mercury</hi> was <hi>Retrograde,</hi> which portended that the nimbleſt Wits would be fool'd and baffled, and <hi>loſe Ground</hi> and Credit in the World from that time following, and (like a Crab) go backward ever after.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Mercury</hi> was otherwiſe afflicted, which put <hi>my Man of Magick</hi> into a Dumps, and made him knit his Brows, and ſcratch his Logger-head; But he was almoſt out of his (little) Wits, when he fatally cast his Eye again upon the <hi>Horiſcope,</hi> and found <hi>Jupiter</hi> there (the <hi>Significator</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant) And <hi>Luna</hi> alſo was at that time unfortunate, which portended that Rumours and Reports (how lowd and many ſoever) either in City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt the Defendant would ſpeedily vaniſh and come to nothing, and that his Fame, like the Sun recovering from a Cloud, would but thereby ſhine the more illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100134:3"/>Nay, <hi>Luna</hi> too was void of Courſe and in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and neither of them caſt either <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> to the <hi>Aſcendent;</hi> which put <hi>the Wiſe-Man</hi> to a notable Plunge, he was <hi>in a Quandare,</hi> and knew not well what to think on't.</p>
            <p>However, <hi>in good earneſt,</hi> falſe Rumours, Reports, and <hi>ſlanderous</hi> Aſperſions, are certainly not only the moſt <hi>common,</hi> but the moſt <hi>effectual Engine</hi> that the Devil or Deviliſh Men can make uſe off to <hi>batter</hi> any honeſt Man, or Man of Honour: for though ſuch an one acquit himſelf never ſo well, yet Hell has alſo broach'd a <hi>Proverb,</hi> that ſhall always fix a little upon him, namely — <hi>There is never any Smoak, but there is ſome Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if Slander could not invent a Lye, a groundleſs Lye; Slander! I had almoſt ſaid — Almighty Slander, that ſeems to be able to baffle almost the Principles of Divinity and Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy ſays — <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing can come nothing. <hi>'Tis falſe,</hi> Slander can produce ſomething out of nothing, as you may ſee in this enſuing Tryal; of all the many and loud Clamours wherewith Malice and Slander charged Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> there was nothing, juſt nothing proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>Divinity ſays, That <hi>God (alone) can create ſomething of nothing, but here and often</hi> we find that <hi>Slander can create</hi> ſomething out of nothing; <hi>ſuch a ſomething,</hi> that there were very few but gave up Mr. <hi>Hickeringhill</hi> for <hi>a gone-Man,</hi> dead, dead, or as bad; to be <hi>bury'd alive</hi> in perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
            <p>O most <hi>Mighty and Potent Slander!</hi> King <hi>David</hi> could not tell how to reſiſt it, It non-pluſt him— <hi>What ſhall be given thee, and what ſhall be done unto thee? O thou falſe Tongue!</hi> and the Wiſdom of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> could not tell who was able enough to ſtand againſt Envy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King's-Guards</hi> cannot keep Slander out of the Court, ſhe dares ſtrike Princes upon the Throne, and the Reverend Judges upon the Bench; and tho her Neck be ſometimes broke, yet ſhe's an <hi>Hydra</hi> and revives.</p>
            <p>The following Verdict for Mr. <hi>Hickeringhill</hi> has <hi>broke her Neck,</hi> and made an end of all thoſe ſlanderous Clamours, which to give colour unto, the Conſpirators againſt him have rak'd into all the Actions of his Life, for fifteen years laſt paſt, wherein he had any conſiderable dealings with any Man.</p>
            <p>And as the Waters of a City <hi>(clean</hi> and <hi>unclean)</hi> diſgorge and diſembogue themſelves into the great <hi>Sink,</hi> and <hi>Common-Shore;</hi> And as all the little Diſeaſes, nay, all the Humours of the Body, good and bad, in time of the Plague, turn to the Pestilence: So all the late Actions that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> has done, or Books that he has writ (except <hi>Curſe ye Meroz</hi>) you will find here jumbled together (by the <hi>malignity and peſtilential</hi> Malice of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries) to make up this <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>plaguy</hi> Crime of <hi>Barretry.</hi> A Crime
<pb facs="tcp:100134:4"/>
that not one of a Thouſand knows what it is, but it will ſerve, and has ſerv'd to make an ugly noiſe withal— <hi>Barretry, Barretry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If one Man call another Whoremaster, or a Woman a Whore, and if he was neither Bolſter nor Pillow, and cannot prove it, this is <hi>Barretry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man writes a Book, or tells falſe News, to the prejudice or hurt of any of the Kings Subjects, this is <hi>Barretry;</hi> and in a thouſand Particulars more (ſo that they be frequently done, for twice or thrice will not do the Feat) Men may be indicted for <hi>Barretry;</hi> or elſe, if his Adverſaries (like the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Adverſaries) be Purſe-proud and mighty, and dare venture the hazard of being overthrown; (for it will ruine the Informer if the Defendant be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit; and the Pit that he dig'd for another, he muſt fall into himſelf,) then an <hi>Information</hi> in the <hi>Crown-Office</hi> is the <hi>Mode,</hi> like <hi>this</hi> which follows.</p>

To which Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> reply'd, I will interrupt you, when you tranſgreſs the bounds of Truth and Modeſty; you have no Authority, nor can any Body give you Authority to abuſe me. Whereupon the Judg candidly reply'd, in theſe Words; <hi>Brother, Brother,</hi> when you touch a Man's Reputation, you touch him in a tender Part; I cannot blame a Man for being ſenſible of it, prove ſomething upon him, and leave off your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming; or Words to the like Effect. Go on to your Proofs, open no more than you can prove. Note by the way, That the Judg had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100134:8"/>
                  <hi>with much ado</hi> given the Defendant leave to plead his own Cauſe, and make his own Defence; The Defendant alledging that he had not time to inſtruct his Counſel, and tho he mov'd in the beginning of the laſt Term by Mr. <hi>Sampſon Ward</hi> at the King's-Bench-Bar, that the Judges there, would be pleaſed to let the Defendant know the Particulars and Heads of the ſaid Articles, yet the Juſtices of the King's-Bench would not allow him more than one Fort-night before the Aſſizes, to know the particular Crimes of which he was accuſed, and to which he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Defence; I know not for what Reaſons, but longer time would not be granted him: and that time had been ſpent in preparing and bringing 20 Witneſſes, and in diſcharging his publick Duty as a Miniſter of the Goſpel in his Rectory in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> (which he neither did, nor would neglect for any private Concern of his own.) And the Defendant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged that the Articles againſt him were many and large, and all the Actions of his Life good and bad for 15 Years laſt paſt, rip'd up, to make him appear a <hi>Common-Barreter,</hi> and that the Breviate (which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant held then in his Hand) was rather a Volumn than a Breviate, and that ſince he had no Counſel, that his Lordſhip would (though it be great diſadvantage for any Man to plead his own Cauſe, and much more the Defendant that had no Skill, no Practice, no Ability in Pleading another Man's Cauſe) yet that his Lordſhip would with Patience, hear him make his own Defence, our Law condemning no Man before it hear him; and the Defendant alledging that it was his Birth-right to have his Lordſhip's Patience and an indifferent Hearing, in making his own Defence: To which his Lordſhip paſſionately reply'd in theſe very Words, <hi>Your Birth-right, Your Birth-right, this I meet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where amongſt theſe Men, they tell me of their Birth-right, their Birth-right, and that they are Free-born Engliſh-men.</hi> Yes, my Lord, reply'd the Defendant; I ſay again, <hi>my Birth right,</hi> and if your Lordſhip will not permit me your Patience to hear my Defence, then go on, and hear but of one Ear; I'le not ſpeak one Word more, if you will not hear me with Patience; I need no other Favour, I have Innocence enough to protect me againſt the Skill, and Eloquence of all the Counſellors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and to defeat them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You are very confident,</hi> replyed his Lordſhip, <hi>I will give you a fair Hearing</hi>; (and ſo he did (ever after that) a tollerable Hearing) <hi>But</hi> (ſaith his Lordſhip) <hi>to ſtop his Mouth, and to ſilence his Plea of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, prove upon him ſome Article that may be Evidence of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; begin with ſomething you can prove.</hi> Whereupon the Counſel skip't over the firſt eight Articles for that time, and began with the ninth Article; Namely,
<q>
                     <hi>Article 9.</hi> For maintaining divers Suits in another's Name, againſt one <hi>Sadler,</hi> his Servants, and Agents, and Tenants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To prove this, they produced one <hi>Lawrence</hi> that told a blind Story of a Covenant; and ſometimes he called it a Bond, that one <hi>William Sadler</hi> made to the Defendant; but not able to make any thing of it, at laſt they produced one Mr. <hi>Thomas Earl</hi> an Attorney in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> who ſwore, that there were Horſes, Lands, and Tenements in <hi>Horkeſley
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100134:8"/>
Magnâ,</hi> that were in the quiet poſſeſſion of one <hi>William Sadler</hi> for ten or twelve Years; and that he, together with the Mother of the Son and Heir of one <hi>Peter Sadler,</hi> did perſwade the Tenant of the Premiſes, to turn Tenant to the ſaid Widow, in the right of her ſaid Son; which the Tenant did, knowing or believing it to be right and juſt; and that there was afterwards an admittance of the ſaid Heir to the ſaid Lands, being Copy-hold by the Lord of the Mannor, and 25 <hi>l.</hi> paid down in Court for a Fine in part, and 15 <hi>l.</hi> more was to be paid in full; and that there was a Tryal at the Aſſizes for the ſaid Land, and the Right was found to be in the ſaid Widow and her Son, who enjoy the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to this day. Whereupon the Judg, in much indignation (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him) ſaid, <hi>What is all this to the Matter in hand charged againſt the Defendant, Mr.</hi> Hickeringill? <hi>Did he perſwade you to take poſſeſſion? Earl</hi> replied, He could not ſay that, but he believed Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> had ſome Mony of the Widow <hi>Sadler,</hi> but he had almoſt <hi>forgot how much, or for what</hi> the Mony was paid unto him. Then the Counſel for the King produc'd a Receipt of 15 <hi>l.</hi> under Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s own hand, (which was read) namely, for part of the Fine due (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) to the Lord of the Mannor (for a Fine) for the ſaid Copy-hold-Lands: which put the Judg again <hi>into a Fret,</hi> that they ſhould make ſuch a-do and Circumſtance for nothing; and thereupon the Judg bid them go to ſome other Article, if they could thereby prove that the Defendant had done ſome Dammage (according to the Information) or Detriment, or Injury (by way of Maintenance or Barretry) to any of the King's Liege People. <hi>A heavy Toſs there was</hi> then amongſt the King's Counſel, which Article of the 24 to inſiſt upon, to make good their grievous Charge; and ſome named the 23, ſome the 18, ſome the 13, at laſt, with <hi>much a-do,</hi> it was agreed to urge the 10<hi>th</hi> Article; which they did, and called their Witneſſes thereunto; but ſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, that the Cauſe began to cool, and they were all at a loſs which Article ſhould next be improv'd to prove the Charge. For they produc'd (to prove this) a Fellow that could make a demure long Prayer, as well as a thumping falſe Oath, one <hi>John Wheely</hi> of the Town of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Brazier, in the Article mentioned, and he ſwore home, or (as we ſay, through an Inch-board) againſt Records; ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he had had divers Suits at Law for the Premiſes, with the ſaid <hi>Mary Living,</hi> in the Article mentioned, and he always got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her, and recovered both at <hi>Common-Law</hi> and in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What's this to the purpoſe? (ſaid the Judg) Did the Defendant bear the Charges of the Suit by Maintenance, to have part of the ſame when recovered? <hi>No,</hi> quoth <hi>Wheely,</hi> I cannot ſay that, but only that he once gave me a <hi>Subpoena</hi> out of <hi>Chancery,</hi> where ſhe was Plantiff a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. What, (ſaid the Judg to the Counſel) are theſe your Witneſſes to prove Barretry againſt Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> only for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Subpoena</hi>; for ſhame go on to ſomething that may ſtick upon him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Defendant produc'd an <hi>Exemplification</hi> (under the King's Broad Seal of <hi>England</hi>) to prove that the ſaid <hi>Wheely</hi> was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Wretch in Swearing, that he always recover'd and got the better of the ſaid <hi>Mary Living</hi> at <hi>Common-Law</hi> and <hi>Chancery</hi> for the Premiſes; whereas in truth the ſaid <hi>Mary Living</hi> had a Verdict againſt the ſaid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100134:9"/>
                  <hi>Wheely</hi> for the Premiſes, at the Aſſizes for the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judg <hi>Keeling, John Robinſon</hi> Attorney for the ſaid <hi>Mary Living</hi> Plantiff Leſſor, and one <hi>Richard Tiplacts</hi> Plantiff Leſſee in Ejectment, and Attorney for the ſaid <hi>John Wheeley, Thomas Ruſe</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter</hi>; the Exemplification beginning, <hi>Carolus Secundus, &amp;c.</hi> and concluding, <hi>J. Vaughan apud Weſtm.</hi> 30. <hi>Novembris, Anno Regni Regis viceſſimo primo.</hi> Wyrley. But the Judg ſaid there was no occaſion for reading it at that time, for <hi>Wheely</hi> had ſwore nothing of harm that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant had done; for in the firſt Inſtance, <hi>(Article</hi> 9.) all that could be gathered, was rather to the honour of the Defendant, in helping an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant and an Orphan to an Eſtate, of which ſhe was unjuſtly deprived; and now in endeavouring to help a Widow to an Eſtate that once ſhe recover'd, and had a Verdict for: and very angrily took up the King's Counſel, and bid them go to ſomething that might ſtop the Defendants Plea of his Innocence; for the Defendant all the while, with chearful Countenance, ſmil'd to ſee them ſo angry and paſſionate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in keeping ſuch a-do for nothing.</p>
               <p>After a great puther, it was unanimouſly agreed by all the Learned Counſel, that the <hi>twelfth Article</hi> ſhould next be urg'd; and to prove it, they brought two Bum-Bayliffs, <hi>Thomas Martin,</hi> and <hi>John Groom,</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> (Raſcals that be too much honour'd by naming of them) but, the miſchief was, they were too hot in their mettle, and ſwore too home, for they ſwore that the Defendant granted an Adminiſtration to <hi>Thomas Shortland,</hi> (in the <hi>Article</hi> mentioned) being Surrogate of the Court; but that alſo he refuſed to grant the ſame, till <hi>Shortland</hi> had firſt entred into Bond to pay him twenty <hi>Guinies.</hi> Theſe Fellows did the Buſineſs for which they came; and <hi>diſgrace enough it was</hi> to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, to take 21 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> for an Adminiſtration, when (in the <hi>Naked-Truth</hi>) he finds ſuch fault in the Regiſters for taking ſo many <hi>Shillings</hi> for an Adminiſtration. Great hopes and jollity there was in the whole Court, when theſe pregnant Teſtimonies were produc'd, which were thought unanſwerable; and the Judg demanded of the Defendant, What he could ſay for himſelf?</p>
               <p>The Defendant anſwered, That if he did take ſuch a mighty Bribe, it might be Extortion, but yet not Barretry. Secondly, That it was impoſſible but that the Fellows were perjur'd; for if the Defendant, Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> did never grant any Adminiſtration to <hi>Shortland,</hi> nor that <hi>Shortland</hi> ever had any Adminiſtration, either from the Defendant, or any other Judges of any Eccleſiaſtical Court in all the Dioceſs of <hi>London</hi>; then it was impoſſible that he ſhould take a Bribe, or commit Extortion, in granting what was never granted. But to that the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſwore; one of them ſaid, the brought he Seal; and the other ſwore, he <hi>ſaw</hi> ſuch an Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>Then to prove them perjur'd, the laſt Will of <hi>Thomas Shortland</hi> was immediately produc'd by the Defendant, and read, (and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being Quakers, revoking the Executorſhip) an Adminiſtration <hi>with the Will annext,</hi> was granted (in the <hi>Prerogative-Court</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> under the Name and Seal of <hi>Gilbert</hi> late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) and where the ſame ought to be granted, (it being a Prerogative-Caſe) and a Court where Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> had no more Power, Authority, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100134:9"/>
Concern, than any other Man in <hi>England,</hi> ſigned, <hi>Marcus Cottle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtarius;</hi> and beginning with theſe words,—<hi>Gilbertus Providentia Divinâ Cant. Archiepiſcopus totius Angliae Primas &amp; Metropolitanus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecto nobis in Chriſto, Thomae Shortland Filio naturali &amp; Legitimo Thomae Shortland nuper de villâ Colceſtriâ,</hi> &amp;c. And dated, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 7. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1676. <hi>Noſtraeque Tranſlationis Anno</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Here was an apparent and wilful Perjury in theſe Witneſſes Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the King, and I believe the whole Court began to be aſham'd of them; but to make them more appall'd, the Defendant produc'd a Record, prov'd by Mr. <hi>George Catesby,</hi> Town-Clerk of <hi>Sudbury</hi>; where one of the Rogues (called <hi>Thomas Martin</hi>) was whipt for a Thief; and the Defendant ſaid, That tho his Name was not <hi>Whipping-Tom,</hi> yet he was <hi>Whipt-Tom.</hi> But the Judg made ſome wonder at the ſaid Record, becauſe the Clerk of the Court, reading the ſame in Engliſh (out of the Latin) ſaid, That he was whipt from the Girdle <hi>downwards.</hi> Downwards, ſaid the Judg, ſure that cannot be! 'Tis <hi>Deorſum,</hi> ſaid the Clerk: That's more than ever I knew, quoth the Judg, to whip <hi>a Man</hi> from the Girdle downwards at the Carts-Arſe; <hi>That's the way to whip a Woman, quoth Baron</hi> Weſton, <hi>but I never knew a Man order'd to be ſo whipt.</hi> Nevertheleſs it paſt off with a Jeſt, and the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with much Edification, learn'd from the Judges own Mouth, the right way how and where to <hi>whip a Woman,</hi> namely, from the Girdle downwards; the new Mode belike!</p>
               <p>In ſhort, notwithſtanding all this comical Diſcourſe, the Judg began to be <hi>in good earneſt angry</hi> with the Learned Counſel, that (after all this loud noiſe in Court, City, and Country, againſt the Defendant, as a <hi>Common Barreter</hi>) they ſhould thus trifle and abuſe his patience, (with which he is not over-loaded) at length he told the Counſel, that if they were thus bafled in all their Attempts, they ſhould not need to charge the Defendant (as in the 21<hi>th</hi> Article) <hi>that he could give as good. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as any Counſel</hi>; for at this rate, it would prove true, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant would baffle them all.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Learned Counſel <hi>laid their Heads together,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go backward, and try what work they could make with the ſecond and ſeventh Articles together; but here they had worſe luck than before, producing two Witneſſes, one Widow <hi>Blois,</hi> and one <hi>Rolf</hi> her Son-in-Law, two more infamous Witneſſes than the former; for ſuch ſhameful and abominable uncleanneſs (betwixt them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) was proved againſt them then and there, in open Court, that it would offend any modeſt Ear to repeat the ſame.</p>
               <p>Beſides, The Woman, <hi>Elizabeth Blois,</hi> ſwore ſuch damnable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth's too; as that the Land the Defendant bought of her, (for which ſhe had but 210 <hi>l.</hi>) did rent for 40 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and now for 30 <hi>l.</hi> and that ſhe could not tell whether Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> gave her <hi>the laſt Will</hi> of <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi> in open Court.</p>
               <p>And yet ſhe has ſworn in the Prerogative-Court at <hi>London,</hi> that the Defendant did give her the <hi>ſaid Will</hi> in open Court, the ſame is alſo in the ſame Court ſworn by the ſaid wicked <hi>Rolf</hi> her Son-in-Law, and he alſo ſwore the ſame at this Tryal, againſt her falſe Teſtimony; and ſo did her own Siſter alſo, <hi>Mary Couch,</hi> teſtify the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100134:10"/>Beſides, it is as true, as that there is a Sun in the Firmament, that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> never had, nor has any more Land or Houſes bought of her (in <hi>Thorp</hi> nor in any other place in the World bought of her) than 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and yet ſhe ſwore 30 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which all the Countrey knows to be falſe; and yet Sir <hi>Francis Withins,</hi> kept a little huſſing with it, as if Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> bought ſuch a Penny-worth, and yet Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> proffer'd in Court to loſe 20 <hi>l.</hi> by the Bargain he made with her; and I am ſure he will yet willingly loſe 40 <hi>l.</hi> to any Man that will buy it again of him: Tho he, I am ſure, has no need to ſell, for at this Day all the Men in the whole World, cannot demand 5 <hi>l.</hi> of him, as juſtly due to them, or any of them from him, to my certain Knowledg: Therefore what need has he of a Protection from three Lords (as in Article 17<hi>th</hi> objected againſt him) that is no more indebted than a Lord? Yet the Judg willing to reprove Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> for ſomething, <hi>if he could have told what,</hi> at laſt told him that there was cauſe enough for the Biſhop to <hi>deprive him</hi> of his Benefice, <hi>for medling with Law Matters ſo much,</hi> and in Temporal Affairs, and perhaps if the Judg had the keeping of his Spiritualſhip, Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſo Rich, nor ſo Fat and Corpulent as he is.</p>
               <p>Kind Man! How ſoon and how ready was he to ſhoot his Bolt at the Defendant, if he could have told how, and for which he was not unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to improve any thing againſt him to render him <hi>an ill Man,</hi> ſince he could not make a common <hi>Barreter</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>But (alas!) the Defendant only ſmil'd all the while to ſee them tugg and labour in vain, and pitying the Judg when he ſaw him <hi>in a fret,</hi> and moſt eſpecially when he talk'd of the Biſhop's <hi>depriving a Miniſter for dealing in Temporal Affairs,</hi> when the Biſhop himſelf (being a Parliament-Man and a Privy-Councellor) is forc'd (above any other Prieſt in the Dioceſs) to <hi>deal in Temporal Affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, That Man talks <hi>without-Book,</hi> and <hi>againſt Law,</hi> and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that <hi>dare</hi> avouch that any Man <hi>can deprive</hi> another of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold (in this Kingdom) but by <hi>Judgment of twelve Men of his Equals.</hi> The Biſhop can deprive no Miniſter in the Dioceſs, but by the Law of the Land; namely, by the Judgment and Verdict of twelve Men of his Equals; other Doctrines are dangerous, and deſtructive: And ſo much the more, when ſpoken by one that ſhould tell the Law in Truth, and not in Sycophantry; no Man is too great to be good, and ſubject to the Laws.</p>
               <p>The Counſel, in brief, made ſome little Aſſay with the 17<hi>th,</hi> 18<hi>th,</hi> and 24<hi>th</hi> Articles which proving more unſucceſsful than the former, and worſe and worſe, the Learned Counſel in as great Rage and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Deſpair (without the leaſt mention of the <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> in the 22<hi>th</hi> Article, or offering at any other Article) furiouſly threw away their <hi>Breviate</hi>'s at the Teeth of the Proſecuter, that Proctor <hi>Morris</hi> then in Court, and as much diſmay'd, as the <hi>Learned Counſel</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and aſhamed. <hi>The Thunder ceaſed,</hi> the Judg himſelf could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear reproving that <hi>loud ſpeaking</hi> Man, Sir <hi>George Jeffreys,</hi> that kept <hi>ſuch a blunder</hi> at firſt in his <hi>noiſy-way</hi> of defaming and huffing Men (that have not the luck firſt to retain his Tongue) with which he kept <hi>ſuch a ſplutter</hi> at the beginning of the Tryal; but by this time he was become as Patient as any Ram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though he did at firſt (<hi>claſſicum canere ante
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100134:10"/>
Triumphum</hi>) wind his Horn before the Victory; yet by this time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be almoſt as tame as he was at <hi>Kingſton</hi> the laſt Aſſizes, before the ſame Judg <hi>Weſton</hi>; who gave him ſuch ſmart Repartees, and royl'd his <hi>Welſh-Blood,</hi> that for very madneſs he ſat down and Wept, (Good Man!) His Courage being ſo cool'd, that his boyling Blood turn'd to Phlegm and Water in ſuch abundance, his Body could not contain the ſame, but it found vent and run out at the Rivulets of his Eyes; And the ſadder he was and heavy, the more Jocund was the by-ſtanding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, who could not forbear to laugh when he cryed (poor Man!) And <hi>the more</hi> he Cryed, <hi>the more</hi> they Laugh'd, <hi>hard hearted that they were!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, the Judg (very calmly too) upbraiding ſome of the Counſel with Folly, and the Witneſſes with Impertinency, told the Jury that they muſt find for the Defendant; which they did, after a little, a very little Pauſe, without ſtirring from the Bar.
