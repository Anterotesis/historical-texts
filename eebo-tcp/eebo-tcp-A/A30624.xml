            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what good I am able: I may
reaſonably deſire that you would
afford it an Impartial and Candid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal,
and read it with a Reſolution not
to condemn any thing in it, without

               <p>You are like to find nothing here, that

Nothing, but what proceeds from a

Your Indignation; I ſhall be ſorry for

laſt, in which the Controverſy between

                  <p>I. All <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be United
in the ſame Faith.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 5.</note> For there is but <hi>One

before taught his Diſciples, to love their
Neighbour, and even their Enemies. He
now gives them a New Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to love one another, as they were
his Diſciples. He had before inſtructed
them to love all Mankind; but now it
was matter of a <hi>New</hi> and a Diſtinct
Precept, that they ſhould love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with a higher degree of Affection,
as being <hi>Fellow-Chriſtians,</hi> and teſtifie it
all poſſible ways, even to the hazard of
their Lives.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord did not pray <hi>for the World,</hi>
as he did for thoſe that <hi>were given Him</hi>
out of the World:<note place="margin">John 17. 9.</note> Nor is it his Will
that we ſhould be alike affected to both.
We muſt exerciſe <hi>Charity</hi> towards all,

Worſhip and Communion. And
to this they are obliged both by their

                     <hi>By this ſhall
all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if
ye have Love one to another.</hi> And this
could not be a meer inward Love, for
that was not capable of being a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Badge of their Profeſſion. Nor could
it be ſuch a Love as would permit them
to be broken into various Sects and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
For it could not be gather'd
from thence, that they had the ſame
Teacher. But then only could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
to the World by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
that they were under the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the ſame Maſter, in matters of
Religion; when diſpers'd, as they were,
over the face of the Earth, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59674:8"/>
Aſſemblies that were held in
his Name; every where profeſſing the
ſame Faith, and Communicating in the
Ordinances which were of his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>When He pray'd that they might be
One,<note place="margin">John 17. 21.</note> it was for this purpoſe, <hi>that the
World might believe that the Father had
ſent Him.</hi> But the World would have
diſcover'd no ſuch thing, if they had
been divided into many Parties, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
to have Communion with one
another. The World would then have
been ready to conclude, that if they had
the ſame Inſtructer, he had taught them
different Religions, or given them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Precepts; and conſequently that
He was inconſiſtent with Himſelf, and
not much to be regarded. But when
they liv'd as Members of the ſame Body,
making it manifeſt that they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards one another with the
tendereſt <hi>Charity,</hi> and unanimouſly
joyning together in the ſame Acts of
Worſhip; they then took the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
way to raiſe in the Adverſaries an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and to convince
them that the Author of it, who had
ſuch an Influence on the Converſation
of his <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> was from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59674:8"/>
For my part, I ſee not what juſt cauſe
there can be, that they ſhould be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in Worſhip, who are united in
Faith and Love. On the contrary, it
ſeems to me moſt reaſonable, and I am
ſure it is agreeable to Scripture, that
they who are of one Soul, ſhould be
of One Body; that they who are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be of the Same Heart and Mind,
ſhould Speak and Do the Same things,
and ſo <hi>keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the
Bond of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To confirm this, and to proceed, in
what I deſign'd, I ſhall prove that the
Church is a Viſible and Regular Society;
and then ſhew, that however it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
in the World, it is one Political
Body. And if I make theſe things clear,
it will be eaſy to infer from thence, that
our Communion with it ought to be
Viſible and Regular, or ſuitable to our
Station; and that the Unity of the
Whole, as well as of every part, ought
to be aſſerted and preſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>I. The Church is a Viſible Society;
and Perſons are admitted into it, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in it, expell'd from it, and reſtor'd
to it, in a Viſible manner: Such things
being openly tranſacted in this, as in
other Communities.</p>

                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59674:9"/>
1. Perſons are Viſibly admitted into
the Church by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> They are <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized

they are <hi>Baptized into One Body.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> The

them to all the Benefits of the Covenant

                  <p>2. They that are admitted into the
Church, are continued in it in a Viſible
manner. In the ſeveral places where
they reſide, they are oblig'd to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

                  <p>It is here to be conſider'd, that as by
one viſible Rite, which is Baptiſm, we
were admitted into the Church, and
made Members of Chriſt; So by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is the Euchariſt, we do not
only communicate with our Brethren,
but alſo with Chriſt himſelf. For as

                  <p>2. Offenders were expell'd from the
Church in as viſible a manner as other
Criminals are disfranchis'd or depriv'd
of the freedom of a City. The Church
diſmiſſing them, mourn'd for them as

well as others, were ſenſible of this,
that they were no longer Members, nor
intitled to the Priviledges of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
from which they were expell'd.
If they repented of their Enormities,
they were far from believing, that their
condition was the ſame that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fall. They eſteem'd the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
paſs'd upon them, as indeed it
was, a ſad anticipation of the future
Judgment. They<note n="b" place="bottom">Vid. Tertul. de Poenit. <hi>c.</hi> 9. &amp; Pamelii Annot. in locum.</note> ſpent the day in
Lamentation, and the night in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of Mourners, and with Tears and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59674:11"/>
grievous Cries they bewail'd their, own
folly. They humbled themſelves in
Sackcloth and Aſhes, and mortified
their Bodies with rigorous Faſtings.
They threw themſelves at the feet of
thoſe that went into the Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
begging them with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to intercede for them, that
they might be reſtor'd to the Peace of

own Repentance.</p>
                  <p>4. The Penitents were reſtor'd to

manner as they have been expell'd from
it. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had given order to

through their Hands, it may be very
fit to conſider, what Authority they
received from him; for from thence
we may gather, what they tranſmitted
down to Poſterity for the Government
of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Now we find, that the Apoſtles were
the Stewards of <hi>the Myſteries of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1.</note>

Mankind unto God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> upon the Terms

                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 18, 20, 21.</note> and accordingly having ſo high
a Commiſſion, they went about and
labour'd to bring all Nations under his

                  <p>When their Work increas'd, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

And thus a Government diſtinct from
that of the Secular Magiſtrate, and a
long time oppos'd by it, was eſtabliſh'd
in all places where-ever Chriſtianity did
prevail.</p>
                  <p>There is, no need that I ſhould here
diſcourſe of the <hi>Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
having prov'd in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
That this Government from the
beginning, was <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and that the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> were Succeſſors to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
And this I have done by ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as, I verily believe, cannot be
anſwer'd, if it be but granted, That
there is any ſuch thing as an <hi>Evangelical

Were all Paſtors and Teachers? No,
certainly; but there was a Faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
diſtinct from them, and under their
Care and Charge; and what the Duty
of the People was, may be gather'd from
theſe places of Scripture.</hi> We beſeech
you Brethren, <hi>ſays St.</hi> Paul, to know
them which labour among you, and are over

The ground of this Interpretation I

The Wife is the Glory of her Husband.
She is, ſays <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as it were the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of that Image, and as ſuch, ſhe
hath power over the reſt of the Family.
It follows, that Biſhops being the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates

I. The Government of the Univerſal
Church is One. According to St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Epiſcopatus unus eſt cujus, à ſingulism ſolidum pars tenetur. Cypr. Tract. p. 108. Vid. Epiſcop. Oxon. Not. in locum.</note>who underſtood this matter

And this is poſſeſs'd by the Biſhops in
ſuch a manner, that they are all legally
One, and every one of them is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
all. But both theſe Propoſitions
may require ſome Explication.</p>
                  <p>1. All the Biſhops of the Univerſal
Church are Legally One! That is, as a

the Perſon of Chriſt, and if Chriſt
<hi>be not divided,</hi> neither are they. They
are not divided, I mean, ſo far as they
act according to his Will and the Rules
of their Order.<note n="c" place="bottom">Copioſum corpus eſt Sacerdotum concordiae mutuae glutino at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que unitatis vinculo copulatum. Cypr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

2. Every Biſhop is vertually all; or
hath vertually the power of the whole
Epiſcopal Order: And ſo United he is
with the other Biſhops in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Government, that what
he does in ſeveral Caſes, which I ſhall
mention, is as Obligatory to all the reſt,
and of as much force, as if it had been
done by their actual Conſent and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
For Example.</p>
                  <p>1. A Biſhop Ordaining <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
does it as effectually, as if all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
had aſſiſted at it, and his Act is
as Obligatory to them all. For the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo Ordain'd do not part with their
Office when they change Climates, but
ought to be receiv'd in all Churches as

For it is plain,</p>
                  <p>I. That if there be but <hi>One Faith</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Saints, for which they

offend who add New Articles to it, or

To their own Maſter they muſt ſtand

Allowances he will make for their

or the like. This <hi>hidden thing
belongs to him,</hi> and therefore cannot be
the Rule of our Actions But ſince it
appears from what he hath revealed,
that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a Sin, a hainous Sin, a Sin
that, without pardoning Mercy, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
leads to Perdition as any other;
I thought the greateſt piece of Charity
I can do you, would be, not to flatter
you in your Way, which, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
is <hi>Schiſmatical;</hi> but to ſhew you
the great danger of it, and do what lies
in me, to reſcue you from the Wrath to
come.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
                  <p>I. What is the Nature of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
                  </p>

II. What Grounds I have to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that you are deeply concerned in
it.</p>
                  <p>III. Examine the Arguments that
have been offer'd on your part, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
you from the Guilt of it.</p>
                  <p>IV. I ſhall repreſent to you the ſaid
Conſequences of it; and ſo proceed to
the Concluſion. And may Almighty
God inlighten your Minds, and diſpoſe
your Hearts to an attentive peruſal of
what I write for your Advantage.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in the Notion of it that
we are now upon, is a cauſleſs Breach
of <hi>Outward Eccleſiaſtical Communion.</hi>
Not but that it is ſinful before it breaks
out into Action, when it is only form'd
in the Heart, or is only in deſign; but
that we cannot take cognizance, or judge
of it, before it appears abroad in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi> and when
it does ſo, there are ſeveral degrees of
it.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometimes there is a <hi>Schiſm within</hi>
a <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes <hi>from</hi> a <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59674:34"/>
3. Sometimes it proceeds to ſet up
<hi>Oppoſte Churches and Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Sometimes it goes yet further, and
Conſtitutes <hi>Paſtors without any Lawful
Authority, or Ordination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not how it can go higher; but
all theſe particulars may be aggravated
with many Circumſtances, which do
not come under our preſent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometimes there is a <hi>Schiſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
a <hi>Church;</hi> when its <hi>Outward Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
is in ſome Meaſure continued, but
ſhatter'd and broken, ſo that it appears
not with the Beauty and Strength of a
<hi>Regular Society.</hi> Thus it was amongſt
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<hi>When ye come together in the Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 18</note> 
                     <hi>I
hear that there are Diviſions among you.</hi>
Being very Contentious, they brought
great Diſorders into their <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi>
Being Factious, and much given to ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making Parties,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>One ſaid, I am
of</hi> Paul; <hi>another, I am of</hi> Apollos. The
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore reproves them as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi>
and beſeeches them by the <hi>Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> that they would <hi>all ſpeak
the ſame thing, and that there ſhould be
no Diviſions among them.</hi> And in another
place he puts them in mind, that there
ſhould be <hi>no Schiſm in the Body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 25.</note> but <hi>the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59674:35"/>
Members ſhould have the ſame care one of
another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Owen <hi>of</hi> Schiſm, p. 42.</note> contends,
that the Notion of <hi>Schiſm</hi> is only to be
taken from the Inſtances of it at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
and conſequently that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is only a
Diviſion <hi>in</hi> a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> but not
<hi>from</hi> it; it may ſeem very ſtrange, and
is, I believe, of his own Invention.
He declares, That he went <hi>out of the
Common Road;</hi> and would perſuade us,
that he made conſiderable Diſcoveries.

of Admiration, That</hi> the whole
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, from the Apoſtles Times,
never knew ſuch a Notion of the Nature
of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> till the Dr. taught it them:
<hi>Which, I ſuppoſe, is very true: But he
might have added, as another</hi> Diſſenter
<hi>thinks,</hi>

                  <p>But is <hi>Schiſm</hi> a Sin? Is it a thing,

<hi>That being unrepented of, will ruine

Body knew wherein it did conſiſt? Were
all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> careful to avoid it under

the Peril of their Souls? And did none

of the <hi>Novations</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> And
might theſe be Innocent all the while?
Are the Scriptures ſo plain in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
about things that are neceſſary
either to be done or avoided? And are

                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Doctor is of no ſmall
Reputation amongſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> let us
conſider a little the force of his Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The <hi>Schiſm</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> was a
Diſorder <hi>in</hi> a <hi>Church;</hi> and from hence
he infers, That a Separation <hi>from a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59674:36"/>
Church,</hi> is not <hi>Schiſm;</hi> and that for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt
to be a <hi>Schiſmatick, is</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
But can you really believe, that
one would do you wrong, if he made a
ſmall Rent in your Garment, and none
if he ſhould tear it in pieces? That he
would be injurious if be Wounded your
Hand, and Innocent if he cut it off?
Can you imagine, that a Mutiny begun
in a Camp, or Kingdom, is Seditious;
and that an open Revolt is not ſo? But as
well may you be perſuaded of all this,
as that <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Diſorder in a Church,</hi>
is a Sinful Diviſion, and to <hi>Deſert</hi> it, as
unworthy of Communion, is none.</p>
                  <p>Whether ſuch a Deſertion be expreſly
ſtiled <hi>Schiſm</hi> in Scripture, is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
if it be a greater Diviſion than
that which is call'd by that Name. For,
as I have always thought, when any
thing is forbidden as ſinful, others that
are worſe, but of the ſame kind, come
under the ſame Prohibition. Otherwiſe
things that for their Filthineſs, are not
fit to be Nam'd, may be very fit to be
done; and Holineſs may be conſiſtent
with the moſt deteſtable Pollutions.</p>
                  <p>2. A farther degree of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> is a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Separation <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Church:</hi> For it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59674:37"/>
is worſe in its own Nature, to renounce
a Society with which one is obliged to
live in Communion, and ordinarily
more tends to the Diſſolution of it, than
it does to create ſome Diſturbances <hi>in</hi>
it, as it alſo gives more Scandal in the
Eye of the World.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Diſturbances may
ſometimes be ſo great, that the Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe that raiſe or keep them
up, may be more deſirable, or a leſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to the <hi>Church,</hi> than their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in it; but to the Offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
it can be of no advantage, but is
rather an Addition to their Guilt and
Miſery. <hi>I would,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the

Convictions for it; for theſe could not
have been Ground of his Rejection, or

                  <p>I. It concerns you to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have not contracted the Guilt
of <hi>Schiſm</hi> by your Separation from the

ceaſe to be ſo? Or was Conformity
then a Duty, and is it now become a

Counſel together, and walked to the

of you we did partake of the <hi>Lord's

That we were all as One Bread, all
Members of the ſame Body. And hath
any juſt cauſe been given you of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off your ſelves from it? Are you
not Self-condemn'd by ſuch contrary

you have made proceed from that <hi>One

with your ſelves in conſidering what I
have offer'd to your Thoughts, and I

that your preſent Separation is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi>

have not added to your Sin, by ſetting
up Oppoſite Churches and Officers, or

hath not more alienated your Minds

But do you find any ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

Have not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> inform'd you
right, That however there were ſuch
great Numbers of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in one City
as made up many <hi>Congregations;</hi> yet
they were all <hi>One Church,</hi> and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

Nevertheleſs, let us ſuppoſe that by
the <hi>Presbytery</hi> we are to underſtand the
Perſons that did bear the Office; we
are not certain from the Expreſſion it
ſelf, who are here intended by it. For
it is a Name of Dignity, not always

And now the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the
Supream, or Inferiour Presbyters, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi>
Timothy? That is, Whether
they did it, who had power to Ordain
him; or they, who, as far as we can
find, never had any ſuch Authority.
And this, I think, admits of an eaſie
Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>We do not find in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that to
mere <hi>Presbyters</hi> any ſuch Authority
was ever committed; nor are there any
Footſteps of it in Antiquity. But if
they muſt be thought to have quitted
it preſently after the <hi>Apoſtles Days,</hi> there
were never Men that at ſuch a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

tamely, without any Complaint. Yet
with ſo much Artifice muſt they be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
to have betray'd their Truſt and
cover'd their Shame, that no Diſcovery
was made of it for Fifteen Hundred
Years. We hear of no claim of any
ſuch Power made by any <hi>Presbyters</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> when <hi>Aerius</hi>
and others oppos'd <hi>Epiſcopacy:</hi> But they

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Epiphan. Haereſ. 75. c. 3.</note> and
could no where gain an Eſtabliſhment;
nor are they of ſuch a Character as may
give Reputation to any Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet if mere <hi>Presbyters</hi> might Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
others of their own Character, it
doth not follow that they could Ordain
<hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and had
Juriſdiction over them, as I have ſhew'd
in another place. They could not give
what they never had, nor communicate

                     </gap>villing as much

not grant, That the Perſons in the Text
were mere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> it does not prove
that others, who at this time aſſume
that Title, have the Power of <hi>Ordaining
Presbyters;</hi> and if they attempt it, there
is nothing in the Text, that may be for

                  <p>1. It is to be obſerv'd, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelf Ordain'd <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſays to

of <hi>Ordination,</hi> when they are ſuppos'd
to have confer'd it on <hi>Timothy,</hi> it may

the <hi>Fathers,</hi> is the greateſt Favourite of
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſays, <hi>That originally,
a Presbyter was the ſame as a Biſhop;</hi> and
that at firſt, <hi>the Churches were govern'd
by the Common Council of Prieſts, till by

did ariſe; and one ſaid, I am of</hi> Paul,

of</hi> Cephas; <hi>and then it was decreed all
over the World,</hi> That <hi>one choſen out of
the</hi> Presbytery, <hi>ſhould be placed over the

Church might be committed, and ſo the
Seeds of</hi> Schiſm <hi>be extirpated.</hi> And if
he has truly related the Matter, this
Change muſt have been made when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were alive, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by themſelves. And we need not
doubt, but when the New Prelates were
Conſtituted, they were Diſtinguiſh'd
from all Inferiour Officers, by the
Power of <hi>Ordination.</hi> Certain it is,
that afterwards this Power was every
where thought peculiar to the <hi>Biſhops;</hi>
and when they had been in poſſeſſion of
it, much above a Thouſand Years,
common Equity requires, that we
ſhould judge them to have had it by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59674:52"/>
Right, unleſs the contrary do appear.
But there is no Ground to believe that
they were Uſurpers of it: No probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that they would ingroſs it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
eſpecially in the early Times,
when they were generally ſuch Mighty

that they ſhould ſo univerſally attempt

take upon them the Power to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi>
having never receiv'd it from

in the wrong of the <hi>Lawful Poſſeſſors,</hi>

and <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> cut off all the Succour
which they would draw from this place,
for the Vindication of their <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
For according to their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

I know not what they can reply to this,
unleſs they would ſhift their Principles,

I cannot but take notice, that when the

Subſcriptions: Amongſt other Articles
of that Union, it was aſſerted, that
Ordination was to be perform'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Impoſition of Hands; but this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
left out in the Printed Copy,
to the great Surprize of many Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that had approv'd it. And leaving
you to judge of the Sincerity of the
Managers of this Affair, I ſhall think it
no great Digreſſion to make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
That there is amongſt the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts,
a prevailing Party, who would
say aſide a Ceremony which is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
or Apoſtolical Inſtitution, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59674:55"/>
which has been of conſtant uſe in all
Churches. But whether they reject it
as ſinful, or whether they are ſenſible
that their Ordainers have no Right to
it, or what other Inducement they had
to diſcharge it, I pretend not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
I only urge them to prove by
any good Authority, that a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may Ordain their own Paſtor, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without that Rite, or with it. If
they are not able to do this, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be decided, whether they have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the <hi>Pattern in the Mount,</hi> which
they would be thought to follow with
ſo much exactneſs; or whether they
have not forſaken it in a Matter of the

their own Inventions.</p>
                  <p>I have now enquir'd what Title your
Paſtors have to the Miniſtry; whether
they pretend to it, as being Ordain'd by
Presbyters, or by the People, and can
find nothing of Validity in it. If they
can demonſtrate it to be good, let them
produce their ſtrong Reaſons for it.
But if no juſt Defence can be made of it;

There may be other Caſes of Schiſm
which are perplex'd and difficult, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>urs is not of that number. For to
ſum up all,</p>
                  <p>1. You have forſaken a Church to
which, by your own Confeſſion, your
Conformity was Lawful. You have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
the whole Epiſcopal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and thereby in effect you renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all Right to the Miniſtry and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>2. You have not only deſerted thoſe
who by your own acknowledgment are
Lawful Paſtors, but to their great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
and a farther Breach of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
you have brought within their
Line, and in oppoſition to them, other
Guides of your own chuſing.</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe, for the moſt part, are ſuch
as had no Epiſcopal, or Real Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that you have exceeded the
<hi>Novatians, Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Meletians,</hi>
who had their proper Biſhops; and theſe,
upon their Repentance of their Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
were received by the Church
into the ſame Station which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
before in the time of their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
But no part of the Ancient
Church ever admitted of a Paſtor of
your way. None ever approv'd your
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Popular Ordinations.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59674:57"/>
When one of the former ſort did firſt
appear, it was condemn'd as null and
<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Athanaſ. Apolog. 2. p. 570.</note>void, by the third Council of

                  <p>Thus have I laid before you a juſt
Account of your State, as you are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from us; and to clear it, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you the true Character of your
Preachers; I mean as they are ſuch, and
bear their part in the Schiſm: It is only
on this occaſion that I have modled
with them, and now exhort you with
all earneſtneſs, to <hi>depart from the Tents
of thoſe Men, left ye be conſumed in their
Sins.</hi>

                  <p>HAVING ſhew'd what Grounds
I have to apprehend that you are
deeply engaged in <hi>Schiſm,</hi> I come now
to examine the Arguments that have
been offer'd on your part to excuſe you
from the guilt of it, and I ſhall ſet
them down in this Method.</p>
                  <p>I. It has been ſaid, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
your preſent <hi>Separation</hi> from
us, yet you are <hi>One</hi> with us, becauſe
we both adhere to the ſame Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>II. That in the Apoſtles Days there
were Independent and Seperate Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
planted in the ſame City.</p>
                  <p>III. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath declar'd,
That <hi>when two or three are gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his Name, there</hi> He <hi>is in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59674:58"/>
midſt of them;</hi> and that you aſſemble in
this manner, and are therefore aſſur'd
of his favourable Preſence.</p>
                  <p>IV. That <hi>Paul rejoyced that Chriſt
was Preach'd</hi> even by thoſe Men who
did it out of <hi>Envy and Strife;</hi> and if
the caſe of your Teachers were as bad
as this, you have no reaſon to be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
about their Call, nor we to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
about their Work.</p>
                  <p>V. That you are only return'd to
thoſe whom you had forſaken before,
and that you might do this ſince you
had the Indulgence, or the Liberty
granted to you by the Law.</p>
                  <p>VI. That the uſe which you make of
this Liberty, is not only Lawful, but
your Duty: And that having your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
you ought to make choice of the
way of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> becauſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be better than that of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and to be prefer'd before it;
as enjoying purer Ordinances; as afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Communion with a better People;
and as moſt conducing to your Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59674:58"/>
This I think is the Sum of what has
been ſaid in your Defence, and whether
it may ſufficiently clear you from the
imputation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> is the Subject of
our preſent Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>I. It hath been ſaid, That <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
your preſent Separation from us,
yet ye are One with us, becauſe we both
adhere to the ſame Doctrine:</hi> And I know
nothing hath been more commonly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of late in your Vindication. So that
we may ſeem to have gain'd this by
your late Conformity, that we are now
treated with ſofter Language than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
we were. Yet the rude Aſſaults
which before were ſo frequently made
upon the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> by the Adverſaries
that call'd them <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi>
and thereby expos'd their own
Malice or Folly, did leſs hurt to the
Church, than this ſeeming compliance,
which would make Communion with
it an indifferent thing, and ſo diſſolve
its Government, as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>How far you are at an Agreement
with us in Doctrine, I know not. But
if the ſame be taught in your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
that is, publiſhed by many of
your Party in their Printed Books, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59674:59"/>
even in their Catechiſms, I think it is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to great Exceptions. Yet if it were
every way Pure and Apoſtolical, and the
very ſame with that of the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi>
Can this be a reaſon for your Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them? Or may not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
bring you back to them? But I fear
it is only to ſerve a Turn, and to be
laid aſide on other occaſions. If you
pleaſe to conſult your Teachers, and
demand of them, Whether you may:
not return to us? Since, as 'tis thought,
your Doctrine is the ſame with ours,
doubtleſs they would preſs you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
where you are: They would
thunder againſt <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as others have
done; and terrifie you with the great
Evil of Separation, notwithſtanding it
lies at their own Door.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure the <hi>Independants,</hi> who made
ſo light of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> when they were
drawing Congregations out of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
did afterwards endeavour to
ſecure to themſelves their own Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.

you, without giving any ſatisfaction to

                  <p>What your Teachers will ſay to this;
I know not; but it ſeems they would
have you believe, that an Agreement
with us in Faith is ſufficient, but an
Union with them in Worſhip is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
You may forſake us without any
Permiſſion, but not depart from them
without their Conſent. The Liberty
they allow you in one caſe, they take
away in another, and reject it as a thing

                  </p>
                  <p>What I ſhall add, will be farther to
prove,</p>
                  <p>1. That it is moſt Abſurd to affirm,
that you are <hi>One with</hi> us, being <hi>divided
from</hi> us, as you are.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Pretence, that Unity of
Doctrine is ſufficient to make us <hi>all one,</hi>
is inconſiſtent with Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would be deſtructive of the
Church it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>3. That it is inconſiſtent with the
Notion of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as expreſs'd in the
Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>4. That it would take away the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
which the Scripture makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and thoſe that
are Approved.</p>
                  <p>1. It is moſt Abſurd to affirm, that
you are <hi>One with</hi> us, being <hi>Divided
from</hi> us, as you are. I have proved,
that the Univerſal Church is a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body; and that a Particular Church
is ſo, I think, is generally granted.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59674:62"/>
And then if a Company withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from it, and ſhake off all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on it, and Communion with it,
they cannot be of the ſame Body which
they deſerted; but being Aſſociated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by themſelves, they become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was One
Body under <hi>Darius;</hi> but it was not ſo,
when it was divided into ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
under the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
A City is One Body, yet if it ſends out
Colonies, which afterwards are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Cities, living by their own Laws,
having full Juriſdiction in themſelves,
they are no longer the ſame with the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> from which they<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Grot. de Jure B. &amp; P. Lib. 2. c. 9. Sect. 10.</note> came.
And much leſs can it be ſaid, that ſome
part of the Citizens ſhaking off their
Obedience to their Governours, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
others into their places, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to thoſe from whom they made
the Revolt. Now a Church hath this
common with a City, and with all
Corporations, that if ſome of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
withdraw themſelves from it, and
make up a Separate Congregation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Model, they are not
then of the Community which they
have deſerted. It is evident, that they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59674:63"/>
are of a Society which is oppoſite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
it; and to ſay that they are <hi>One,</hi> when
the contrary is ſo viſible to every Eye,
is to renounce the uſe of Words, and to
affront the Common Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>2. The Pretence that the Unity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Doctrine is ſufficient to make us <hi>all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </hi>
notwithſtanding ye are ſo <hi>Divided</hi> from
us, is inconſiſtent with Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and being admitted, would
be deſtructive of the Church it ſelf.
Pretences like that, would never be
wanting, if they might juſtifie the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
and it is eaſie to perceive what
ſad Effects they would produce. If ſuch
as are mutinous in an Army ſhould lay
aſide their Officers, and put into then
places, others of their own chuſing,
they might ſay in their own Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That under their preſent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
they acted according to the ſame
Military Rules as they did before, and
therefore 'tis <hi>all One,</hi> which they obey'd.
If in a Kingdom, or Common-wealth,
ſome of the Subjects, upon any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſhould depoſe their Magiſtrates,
and elect others in their ſtead out of
their own Company, they might make
the like defence and ſay, that they had
ſtill the ſame Laws as before the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59674:63"/>
Change, and lived according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Cuſtoms; only the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Affairs was put into other Hands,
which was not material. If in a Houſe
ſome of the Children and Servants
ſhould conſpire againſt the Father and
Maſter of the Family, and take into it
another Perſon to be their Governour,
they might alſo plead for themſelves,
that they receiv'd the ſame direction for
Buſineſs as they had before, and that
their Work was ſtill the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was <hi>all one</hi> to whom they
paid their Submiſſion. But 'tis obvious
that ſuch an Army muſt be put into
miſerable Confuſions, that ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would be brought to Deſolation,
that ſuch a Houſe cannot ſtand. And
'tis no leſs manifeſt, that if the People
may forſake their Lawful Paſtors, and
at their pleaſure heap to themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Teachers; if ſome Members of a
ſound Church may make a cauſeleſs Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from it, and joyn together in
oppoſition it, this would make all
Church-Government a precarious and
uſeleſs thing; it would ſoon weaken the
Church, and puſh it on to deſtruction.
And it will be a vain Excuſe for Men to
ſay, That they are at an Agreement
with the Church in Doctrine, when by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59674:64"/>
their Diviſions they are tearing the
Church in pieces.</p>
                  <p>3. The Pretence that you are free
from the Guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> becauſe you
are of the ſame Faith with the <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
is inconſiſtent with the Notion of
<hi>Schiſm,</hi> as it is expreſs'd in the Holy
Scripture. It is plain from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and it is granted on all Hands,
that there was a <hi>Schiſm</hi> at <hi>Corinth:</hi> But
this was not about an Article of Faith,
or Matter of Doctrine. What was laid
to the Charge of the Dividers here, is,
That <hi>every one ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>or I
of</hi> Apollos, <hi>or I of</hi> Cephas. There is no
doubt but all theſe three did teach the
ſame Doctrine, but the People were
Schiſmatical, and made uſe of thoſe
great Names to give reputation to their
ſeveral Parties. It may ſeem ſtrange,
that ſome are cenſur'd for ſaying. <hi>They
were of Chriſt:</hi> But I take the meaning
to be this; they profeſs'd themſelves to
be Followers of Chriſt, but it was in
oppoſition to his Miniſters; as ſome may
pretend to be for the King, when they
affront thoſe that are in Authority under
him; or they would be for him as the
Head of their own Faction. But all
theſe are condemned as Carnal,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> and as
Dividers of Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> And this may let
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59674:64"/>
you ſee, that their Offence was great,
notwithſtanding the plauſible things,
that on the account of the Excellent
Yeachers to which they laid claim,
might be ſaid in their defence.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
takes away the diſtinction of the
<hi>Schiſmatick</hi> from the <hi>Approved;</hi> as will
appear by conſidering the Caſe of both,
as it is repreſented in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>1. It is evident from Scripture, that
the Approved, who are the Beloved of
God, add this to the practice of other
Duties, that they live in Conformity to
the Church, and are of a Regular Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>There muſt be Hereſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that they
which are Approved may be made manifeſt
among you.</hi> That is, as I noted before,
as long as Mens Minds are deprav'd
there will be Diviſions, as there were
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> about Matters of Diſcipline;
and the Almighty permits this for the
Tryal of his Servants, that by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
thoſe things their Sincerity may
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59674:65"/>
be known; that having this mark of
Diſtinction upon them, it might appear
to all with whom they were converſant,
that they were of the Number of the
faithful.</p>
                  <p>2. From hence it is plain, that the
Dividers and Diſturbers of the Church,
however they agree with it in Doctrine,
are not to be reckon'd amongſt the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:</hi>
But it will yet be plainer, if
they proceed to a Separation from thoſe
that are ſo. Theſe Words of St. <hi>John,</hi>
which I alſo cited before, are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But they went out, that they might be made

had they been of the Opinion of your
Advocates, they might have reply'd:
<q>Our Deſertion can never make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt

we went out from you, and did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

II. It has been ſaid, that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

                     </note> has
been cited by ſome, who at other times
expreſs little regard for it. And it is
true, he tells us, that as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, and
St. <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo <hi>whenſoever
theſe two great Apoſtles came to the ſame
City, the one conſtantly applied himſelf to
the</hi> Jews, <hi>received Diſciples of ſuch, form'd
them into a Church, left them, when he
departed that Region, to be govern'd by
ſome Biſhop of his own Aſſignation; and
the other in like manner did the ſame to the</hi>
Gentiles. To prove this he urges from
Ancient Writers, <q>That the Church of
<hi>Antioch</hi> was founded and inſtructed by
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> part of it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and Rul'd by one, and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
by the other: That the Decrees of

ſent, and inſcrib'd, <hi>To the Brethren
at</hi> Antioch, <hi>&amp;c.—Thoſe of the</hi> Gentiles,

Church in that City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

that <hi>Euodius,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> at the

<hi>Linus</hi> being conſtituted Biſhop of the
<hi>Gentiles, Clemens</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Chriſtians</hi>
there: And that from hence unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably
grows that variety and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
obſerv'd amongſt Writers,
ſome making St. <hi>Peter,</hi> others St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
the Founder of that Church, but others
both of them: Some making <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59674:67"/>
others <hi>Linus,</hi> the firſt Biſhop after the
Apoſtles; both Affirmers ſpeaking the
truth, with this <hi>Scholion</hi> to interpret
them: <hi>Linus</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of
the <hi>Gentile Chriſtians</hi> after St. <hi>Paul;
Clemens</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> after
St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </q> This is the Sum of the moſt
material things that he has ſaid on this
Subject; but it ſeems all too infirm to
ſupport his Opinion; which yet out of
the reſpect that is due to the Authority
of ſo great a Man, I ſhall not reject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving the Reaſons of my Diſſent
from him. And they are theſe that
follow.</p>
                  <p>I. However the Work of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
was ſo diſtributed by conſent that
the care of the <hi>Jews</hi> was eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> yet they were not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to either. For,</p>
                  <p>1. St. <hi>Peter</hi> being ſent for by <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
a <hi>Gentile,</hi> inſtructed him and thoſe
that were come together at his Houſe,
in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> and when they
had received it,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 34.</note> he <hi>commanded them to be
baptized in the Name of the</hi> Lord: And
after this he declar'd in the Council of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15. 7.</note> That God had choſen him
for this <hi>purpoſe, that the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59674:67"/>
his Mouth, ſhould hear the Goſpel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preach'd in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Salamis</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13. 5, 14.</note>And at <hi>Corinth</hi> he <hi>reaſon'd in the
Synagogue every Sabbath, and perſuaded
both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks.<note place="margin">Acts 18. 4.</note> At <hi>Rome</hi> alſo
he <hi>expounded and teſtified to the</hi> Jews,
<hi>the Kingdom of God, perſuading them out
of the</hi> Law of Moſes, <hi>and out of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>from Morning till Nighs, and ſome
believed the things that were ſpoken, tho'
ſome believed not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 28. 23, 24.</note> Now as it cannot be
thought that when he had converted
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> together, he divided
them into Separate Congregations, ſo
neither is it probable that when St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and he were in the ſame City, Matters
were ſo nicely managed between them,
that the One pickt out the <hi>Jews,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his Province, and gather'd
them into a Church by themſelves, and
that the Other did the like for the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
No ſuch thing, I am ſure can be
gather'd from the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>II. Both theſe Apoſtles might be Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as alſo
of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet neither of
theſe Churches be divided into ſeparate
Societies. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf had two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and yet it was but one City. And
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59674:68"/>
manifeſt it is by many other Examples,
that different Perſons acting as one, may
conſtitute a Corporation, either Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
or Civil, which is United in all
its parts.</p>
                  <p>III. The Inſcription of the Epiſtle <hi>to
the Brethren of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>that were at</hi>
Antioch,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does only ſuppoſe them
to have been chiefly concern'd in the
Contents of it, and not that they were
of a Church diſtinct from the <hi>Jewiſh
Chriſtians.</hi> It may rather ſeem, if they
had been ſo, that the Zealots <hi>who came
from</hi> Judea,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 1.</note> would not have preſs'd them
to be Circumcis'd after the manner of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> but left them to enjoy their own
way, as a Separate Body. But the
Council having decided the Matter in
Debate between them, remov'd from
both ſides all pretences of Diviſion.</p>
                  <p>IV. The Writer of the <hi>Apoſtolick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi>
no where affirms, that <hi>Euodius</hi>
and <hi>Ignatins</hi> ſate at the ſame time Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Antioch.</hi> He only introduces
<hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, that one of them was <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd</hi>
by him, and the other by<note n="a" place="bottom">Conſtitut. Apoſtolic. L. 7. c. 46. p. 372.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi>

diſtance of time. <hi>Malata</hi> informs<note n="b" place="bottom">Malat. Chronograph. p. 325.</note> us,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59674:68"/>
that after the Death of <hi>Euodius, Peter</hi>
being then at <hi>Antioch, Ignatius</hi> receiv'd
the Epiſcopal Dignity; and if this be ſo,
it may help to put an end to the Diſpute
about the Order in which he was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to that Office.</p>
                  <p>V. That <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> were at
the ſame time Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no
better ground than the Teſtimony of
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> which ſignifies but little when
oppos'd, as it is in this caſe, by the whole
Stream of Antiquity. There are indeed
Differences amongſt the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <p>Yet do I not reject this Opinion,
merely becauſe it hath no good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
I ſhall produce ſuch Arguments
againſt it, as being duly conſider'd may
help to determine this Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59674:69"/>
1. My firſt Argument is taken from
the Deſign of Chriſt; for that was, to
Unite both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in <hi>one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Epheſ. 2. 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>and to make <hi>of the Two, one New
Man.</hi> And accordingly, he made of
Both One People; preſcrib'd to them
the ſame Law, and confer'd on them
Equal Priviledges. It is not therefore
to be imagin'd, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
were to be drawn out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Believers of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and gather'd into Churches apart by
themſelves; Churches that excluded all
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> from their Communion, who
ſubmitted not to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For
this had been to <hi>Divide</hi> thoſe whom our
Lord had made One, and to revive the
Enmity which he had <hi>ſlain:</hi> It had been
to treat thoſe as <hi>Forreigners,</hi> whom he
would have to be <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> and to
expel them as <hi>Aliens,</hi> who are his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks,
and of <hi>the Houſhold of Faith:</hi>
It had been to caſt thoſe out as <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi>
whom he had call'd to be Heirs <hi>of</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and to rebuild the <hi>Wall of</hi> Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he had <hi>broken down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. According to the Mind of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> labour'd to reſtore Peace and
Conformity between the <hi>Judaizers</hi> and
other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they might live
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59674:69"/>
together as Members, one of another.
And to this purpoſe, when ſome belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they <hi>might eat all things,</hi> and
others <hi>being Weak did eat Herbs;</hi> he
ſhews that this difference ſhould be no
cauſe of a Breach of Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. For, ſays he to the
<hi>Strong,</hi> who were apt to deſpiſe others,
<hi>Him that is weak in Faith receive to you,</hi>
Rom. 14. 1. That is, notwithſtanding
the Scruples of ſuch a Perſon about
Meats and Drinks, and other things of
that nature, admit him into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
as a Brother. He is not fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to hear <hi>doubtful Diſputations,</hi> or to
be engaged in them, but he ought to
joyn with you in the Publick Worſhip.
The Apoſtle himſelf leads us to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
in the following Chapter,
where having put up his Requeſt for
thoſe that Diſſented about the <hi>Moſaical</hi>
Rites, that they might <hi>with one Mind,
and one Mouth, glorifie God, even the
Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
addreſſes his Diſcourſe to them,
and ſays, <hi>Wherefore receive ye one another?</hi>
For what end was it that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
one another? He himſelf has
given a ſufficient intimation of it. It
was that they might <hi>glorifie God with
one Mind, and with one Mouth.</hi> The
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59674:70"/>
thing then requir'd of them was, that
both the Weak and Strong, both the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, ſhould
meet together in the ſame Aſſemblies,
and unanimouſly joyn in the ſame Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Praiſes, as if they had been A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
by one Soul.</p>
                  <p>3. However the Apoſtle us'd great
Tenderneſs towards the Diſſenting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whether they underſtood their
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Liberty, and did eat things
forbidden by the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they did not: Yet when the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
withdrew themſelves from the
Communion of thoſe that would not
come up to their Rigours, and labour'd
to ſeduce as many as they could into the
way of Separation; he then treated
them in another Style. He repreſented
them as Perſons that <hi>corrupted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galat. 1. 7, 8.</note>and pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. Speaking of them to the
<hi>Philippians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 2.</note> he ſays, <hi>Beware of thoſe
Dogs; beware of Evil-workers; beware
of the Conciſion;</hi> that is, of thoſe that
cut the Church in pieces. And to
the <hi>Romans</hi> he ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> I <hi>beſeech you</hi>
Brethren, <hi>mark them which cauſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
and Offences contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which ye have learn'd, and avoid
them.</hi> So far was this Apoſtle from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59674:70"/>
or allowing of their Separate
Congregations.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>We may gain farther Light into
this Matter, and what I have ſaid of it,
may be confirm'd from a Remarkable
Tranſaction, which the ſame Apoſtle
relates in theſe words;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> When <hi>Peter, ſays he</hi>
was come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> I withſtood him
to the Face, becauſe he was to be blam'd:
For before certain came from <hi>James,</hi> he did
ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but when they were
come, he withdrew, and Separated himſelf,
fearing them which were of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And the other <hi>Jews</hi> diſſembled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with him; inſomuch that <hi>Barnabas</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was carried away with their Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But when I ſaw that they walked
not uprightly, according to the Truth of
the Goſpel, I ſaid unto <hi>Peter</hi> before them
all; If thou, being a <hi>Jew,</hi> liveſt after
the manner of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not as do
the <hi>Jews,</hi> why compelleſt thou the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
to live as do the <hi>Jews? From
hence it is plain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Peter</hi> liv'd at <hi>Antioch</hi> after
the manner of the <hi>Believing Gentiles;</hi>
uſing the ſame Chriſtian Liberty as they
did; and not withdrawing himſelf
from them, before the <hi>Judaizers</hi> came
thither from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59674:71"/>
2. When he ſtruck in with the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizers,</hi>
it is not to be imagin'd, that
they had alter'd his Judgment, or that
he had received any new Illumination
to direct him; but the Change he
ſhew'd, proceeded from his Fear; a
Fear, as we may well ſuppoſe, that if
he yielded not to thoſe Obſtinate Men,
they would renounce the <hi>Chriſtian
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Converts at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
were not of a diſtinct Church by
themſelves, ſeparate from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
Certainly they were not ſo before the
coming of the Zealots, with whom
they comply'd, not out of Conſcience,
but <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. With their <hi>Diſſimulation Barnabas</hi>
was carried away; and this intimates,
that his Concurrence with the Dividers,
was a new thing to him, or a departure
from his former practice. Upon the
whole, he and the reſt, whom he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
in this Action, may ſeem to have
had a good intention, which was not
to provoke thoſe of the Circumciſion;
but to do what they were able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them from Apoſtacy. Yet in their
Conduct there was more of the Policy
of the World, than of true Chriſtian
Wiſdom and Sincerity. Wherefore
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59674:71"/>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeing that they <hi>walked not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
according to the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
withſtood</hi> Peter <hi>to the Face, becauſe
he was to be blam'd,</hi> and reprov'd him
<hi>before all,</hi> that they might ſee their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
who had been drawn into it by his
Example. And if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Separation,</hi> when St. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was at the Head of it, and when
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> an Apoſtle alſo, together with
the Multitude, was engaged in it; if
he oppos'd it when it came with ſo
ſtrong a Torrent, doubtleſs he reſiſted
it with like Courage wherever he met
it, in any part of the World.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile Chriſtians,</hi>
together at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13. 1.</note> are ſtiled a Church,
and ſo are they that reſided at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clem. Rom.</note>
But to call them ſo,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. c. 1.</note> if in the ſame City
they had been divided into ſeveral Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Congregations, is not agreeable
to the Language of that Age. Nor
could they with any propriety of Speech
be mention'd as one Society, or Body, if
they were ſeparate, and had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with one another.</p>
                  <p>6. In the time when this Diviſion
is ſuppos'd to have been between the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

But to this I need return no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

                  <p>Theſe Corrupters of the Goſpel, and

held on the end of a Diſcourſe, and omit
what went before. Part they remember,

                  <p>
                     <hi>IV. It hath been ſaid,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
that Chriſt was Preach'd, even by
thoſe Men who did it out of Envy and
Strife,<note place="margin">Philip. 1. 15, 18.</note> and if the caſe of your Teachers
were as bad as this, as long as they preach
Chriſt, you have no reaſon to be ſolicitous
about their Call, nor we to be offended at
their Work. <hi>But to this I reply;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59674:73"/>
1. That it does not appear that they
who preach'd Chriſt out of Envy and
Strife, did take on them the Work of
the Miniſtry without a Call to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And if they were lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into it, it only proves that Ill
Men may be ſo, and yet be uſeful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but not that any may uſurp the
Sacred Function; and how far this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
your Teachers and their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
I have ſhew'd before.</p>
                  <p>2. Neither doth it appear that they
Preach'd Chriſt to any other than the
Infidels; and this can never juſtifie your
Paſtors for gathering Diſciples out of
ſound Churches; or your ſelves for
breaking the <hi>Bond of Peace,</hi> in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with them. It is one thing to add
Members to a Church, taken out of the
Unbelieving World, and for Members
to withdraw themſelves from it, and
joyn together in an Oppoſite So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <p>3. What the Apoſtle rejoyced at was
the good that his Envyers did, <hi>beſide
their intention:</hi> The Benefit that did
ſpring from the Evil they deſign'd, and
not the Evil that ſet them on Work. So
that notwithſtanding this Example, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Strife are as hateful as ever, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59674:74"/>
ſo are Church-Diviſions, and all things
elſe condemn'd in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>4. What they acted out of Envy and
Strife, did no hurt to any but themſelves.
'Tis true, they were guilty of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
and Cruelty towards St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
yet their Malice had no ill effect on him,
but reſted on their own Heads. How
it was that they ſuppos'd that they
ſhould <hi>add Affliction to his Bonds,</hi> is not
ſo clear, but that it hath given occaſion
to ſeveral Conjectures. But to me it
ſeems moſt probable that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
the Glory which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by many Converſions; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him by themſelves, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
it would be a grievous thing to
him to hear, that they ſhar'd with him
in that Honour, the Faith being prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by their Diligence. Whereas i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
was great ſatisfaction to him, that when
he was under Confinement, they carried
on the Work in which he himſelf ſhould
have been employ'd, had he been at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Indeed their manner of doing
it did exerciſe his Patience and Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
yet even that was for his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and he was aſſur'd that their
Preaching would turn to his Salvation.
And as it was beneficial to him,<note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note> ſo it
was alſo to the Church, as being a means
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59674:74"/>
of gaining Proſelytes, and both to <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as an Inſtrument of their
Converſion. But on the contrary,
Church-Diviſions are prejudicial to all
ſorts of Perſons; to the Paſtors of the
Church, and to the Flock: To thoſe
that are within the Church, and to thoſe
that are without. This I might fully
prove, but I refer it to a more proper
place, and ſhall only here ſet down the
Words of the Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi>
who ſays in his Eſſays,<note n="a" place="bottom">

So that nothing doth ſo much keep

                  </p>
                  <p>V. It hath been ſaid, That <hi>you are
only return'd to thoſe whom you had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before; and that you might do this,
ſince you had the Indulgence, or the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
granted to you by the Law.</hi> But if
your <hi>Separation</hi> was ſinful before you
<hi>Conform'd,</hi> your Return to it muſt be ſo
too: For the Law hath not alter'd the

Caſe, nor done any thing that can
make it innocent.</p>
                  <p>1. We are therefore to enquire in the
firſt place, whether your <hi>Separation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you <hi>Conform'd,</hi> was not Sinful;
and this may eaſily be reſolv'd, for it is
clear from what went before, that it
was cauſeleſs, and conſequently <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi>
Perhaps it may be objected, That
many of you had never been Members
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be Deſerters of it. But
to this I reply, That if you only joyn'd
with the Society that made the Revolt
from it, you were Partakers in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

were as a corrupt Fountain, and you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Philometer.</hi> And thus not
only they that are firſt in a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but
their Followers, and ſuch as come into
it in ſucceeding times, contract the guilt
of it. The new Members that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59674:76"/>
to the former Schiſmaticks, are, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them, of One Body; as
they that from time to time are added
to the Church, are of another.</p>
                  <p>One thing on which the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Advocates for the Temple at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and for that at <hi>Garizin,</hi> did
mainly turn, was the Queſtion, on which
ſide was the Ancient Succeſſion of
Prieſts? but this was eaſily determin'd
for the former. And now if the whole
Iſſue of the Controverſiae between the
<hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this; Whether of them have the beſt
Title to a Succeſſion of Lawful Paſtors,
it would not be difficult to decide it:
For you grant, I ſuppoſe, and it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
evident, that ſuch a Succeſſion
is continued with us: But it appears
from what has been ſaid, that in your
way of Separation, you neither had,
nor can have any ſuch thing. Indeed
many of the Separatiſts had Epiſeopal
Ordination, but ſome of them renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it; and, as in Mockery, <hi>Ordain'd
one another:</hi> Others made no ſuch Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
as the former; yet withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves from their Biſhops, they
exercis'd their Office in ſuch a manner
as is directly againſt their own Solemn
Promiſe, and Sacramental Engagement.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59674:76"/>
But none of them had power to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or in the Language
of<note n="a" place="bottom">Hareſ. 75. N. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to give <hi>Fathers to
the Church.</hi> As for the reſt of your
Teachers, they are meer Laymen, and
act under a falſe Character in Matters
of the higheſt importance to the Souls
of Men. So that you could be Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of none of the Diſſenting Guides,
without <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and a breach of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
where it was due; but with ſome
of them you could not Communicate
without bearing a part in their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.</p>
                  <p>2. If your former Separation was
Sinful, your Return to it muſt be Sinful
alſo. It muſt be ſo in a higher degree,
becauſe a Relapſe into Sin after Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
is a greater Offence than the
firſt Commiſſion of it. It had been
better therefore that you had not known
the way of Peace, than after you had
experience of it, to forſake it: Better
that you had not come into the Unity of
the Church, than to break it again.
You are now become more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than you were before, and thus far
your <hi>latter end is worſe than your begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59674:77"/>
3. If your Separation was otherwiſe
Sinful, the Law hath not alter'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it Innocent. I need ſay nothing of the
Toleration which was granted to you
by the Diſpenſing Power, and drew
you into the Snare: For I ſuppoſe you
ground your preſent Liberty on the Act
of Parliament. But if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

you where it found you; and can a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
nothing for your Juſtification
The Act it ſelf will beſt ſatisfie you of
this, and upon peruſal of it you will
find, that it was only deſign'd to give
eaſe to <hi>Tender Conſciences;</hi> but yours
are not of that Number. Indeed we
cannot penetrate into your Hearts, but
Charity obliges us to believe, that you
did not come to our Churches with
Doubts and Fears upon you, that your
Conformity was unlawful, but were
generally well aſſur'd, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with your Duty, and agreeable
to the Holy Scriptures. But this is the
very thing which cuts you off from the
Indulgence which you claim by the
Law; That being deſign'd only for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ns
of another Character.</p>
                  <p>But what hath the Law done for the
Scrupulous? Hath it approv'd their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59674:77"/>
ways, or ſet them all in the
right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That cannot be; for they are
inconſiſtent and contradict one another.
It only tolerates them; and we may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
Pain and Sickneſs and other Evils,
from which we have a great averſion.
But they remain Evils ſtill; and ſo muſt
<hi>Church-Diviſions</hi> under any Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The Law ſays this for the Scrupulous,
that upon the Conditions to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by them, they ſhall not be liable
to any <hi>Pains, Penalties, or Forfeitures
laid on them by ſome</hi> former Acts; nor
ſhall they be <hi>Proſecuted in any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Court for their Nonconforming to the
Church of</hi> England. But this can never
juſtifie their Nonconformity: For if the
Puniſhments againſt profaning the <hi>Lord's
Day,</hi> and common Swearing, and other
things of that Nature, were taken off,
they would ſtill be criminal as they were
before; and the like may be ſaid of
<hi>Schiſm.</hi> As long as it is condemn'd in
Scripture, no humane <hi>Allowance</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;</hi>
can make it Lawful.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> were enjoyn'd
by a Law, which is more than an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi>
or <hi>Toleration</hi> of them, they
would not be freed from their Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or ceaſe to be Sinful. But to the

Impoſers of things ſo contrary to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation and Inſtitution, we

                  </p>
                  <p>I am far from derogating from the
Authority of Secular Princes, but I am

They cannot make Falſhood to

                        </gap>: And that having your freedom,
you ought to make choice of the way of the

of this is already remov'd, for I have
prov'd that the Law hath granted you

of them, yet is your <hi>Separation</hi> ſinful,
as it was before. It ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be matter of your choice upon
the proſpect of any Advantages what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>We ought indeed to deſire and ſeek
after the moſt excellent things, but we
muſt do it in a ſuitable way. What
we are infinitely to value above other
things, is the Favour of God: But we

us,</p>

to which thoſe Priviledges are aſcrib'd,
and therefore I might diſmiſs them

much is built upon them, that I thought
fit to bring them under a diſtinct Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>I. It hath been ſaid, That <hi>in the way
of Separation you enjoy purer Ordinances:

and the addition of things not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
that ſet you at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

the more to be eſteem'd. But the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this way of arguing, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
if you reflect on the Abſurdities
which they fall into, who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the Aſſertions of
the more <hi>Rigid Separatiſts,</hi> which I
have not produc'd with an intent to
reproach you, who, I believe, abhot
them; but only to let you ſee, that as
thoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> were deluded by this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59674:80"/>
                     <hi>Falſe Principle,</hi> that whatſoever in the
Worſhip of God is not commanded by
himſelf, eſpecially if it has been abus'd
by the <hi>Pipiſts,</hi> is ſinful and execrable;
ſo you are in danger of being led into
grievous Miſtakes, if you entertain a
Perſwaſion, that <hi>that</hi> is the pureſt
Church, or Society, which hath the
loweſt Ceremonies not enjoyn'd in
Scripture. This may eaſily be gather'd
from the Influences already mention'd;
but I leave them to your own Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, and it is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> that nothing
is to be receiv'd as an Article of Faith,
that is not reveal'd in Scripture: Nor is
any thing to be admitted as an Eſſential
part of Divine Worſhip, that is not the
Subject of a Divine Precept: But exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rites and Circumſtances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
are of another Nature, and being
not forbidden of God expreſly, or by
conſequence,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> are not ſinful: For <hi>where
there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
But about this, I ſuppoſe, we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed:
And if you thought our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which are innocent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo great a burthen for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that to eaſe your ſeves of it, you
muſt deſert our Communion, as ſoon
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59674:81"/>
as you had opportunity, I intreat you
to conſider, how very few were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of you as Private Men, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
it would be to preſerve Peace
and Order in the Church, if, for ſuch
things, it may be divided and all be put
into confuſion.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> as many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
were uſed, as now are required
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and if they
are now ſufficient to excuſe your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
they would have juſtified a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from the beſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the
Pureſt Ages. Even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Days
ſeveral things were appointed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd,
and for ſome time were not to
be neglected or omitted, which yet
were only Temporary Inſtitutions, and
not deſign'd to be of Perpetual Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Such were the <hi>Feaſts of Charity,</hi>
and <hi>the Kiſs of Peace;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Veil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> by which her Head and Face
were cover'd in ſign of her Subjection.
And if the Church had Power to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
ſuch Rites, ſo it hath power alſo to
appoint others of the like Nature, and
is obliged to do ſo upon emergent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prudence may direct.
Particular Ceremonies are liable to ſuch
alterations, that when they have been
expreſſive of reſpect in one Age or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59674:81"/>
Country, they become Inſtances of the
contrary in another: But there are Rules
about them that are conſtant and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in all Times and Places.</p>
                  <p>1. It is certain that the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God ought to be celebrated with
ſuch Ceremonies as are ſuitable to the
Dignity and Solemnity of the Work,
and agreeable to the general directions
of the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. According to the Holy Scripture
the Ceremonies that are us'd in the
Church, ought to be expreſſive of ſome
Duty. So were they that I produced
from Scripture; ſuch were alſo the <hi>ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the Breaſt,</hi> the <hi>lifting up the
Hands in Prayer, Kneeling</hi> on the ſame
occaſion, and the putting on ſome <hi>New
Garment</hi> at the time of <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> All
which things are recommended or allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to as things approved in Scripture.
And one of theſe was a viſible ſign of
Contrition and Indignation againſt Sin;
another, of the elevation of the Mind
to Heaven; the third, of Humiliation;
the fourth of putting on Chriſt, or the
New Man. This may ſhew, how weak
the Objection is againſt our Rites, that
they are <hi>Symbolical;</hi> for if they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
they would be diſagreeble to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59674:82"/>
the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> and ſignifying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
they would be good for nothing,
but were fit to be rejected as uſeleſs and
impertinent.</p>
                  <p>3. The Holy Scripture directs us in
general <hi>to do all things decently and in
order;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40.</note> To diſtinguiſh between our own
<hi>Houſes</hi> and the <hi>Churches of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 22.</note> To <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi>
him with our <hi>Bodies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> as well as our
<hi>Spirits;</hi> and particularly it requires us
to <hi>Worſhip,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and fall down, and kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord our Maker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. That External Rites be ſignificant
and decent, there ought to be ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
between them and the End for
which they were appointed. Yet for
thoſe that uſe them it is not always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to know the reaſonableneſs of
their Inſtituion. They may take an
Oath ſafely by kiſſing the Book, who
know nothing of the Original of that
Ceremony, nor are ſatisfied of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it. Whatſoever it had at firſt,
Cuſtome hath now impreſs'd a fitneſs on
it; and it ſignifies a Solemn Appeal to
God the Searcher of Hearts, as much as
Words could do, and is by the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before them.</p>
                  <p>5. The ſignificancy of Ceremonies,
and the Meaſures of Decency are to be
taken from Cuſtome, which gives Rules
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59674:82"/>
not only for ſpeaking, but alſo for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Habits, and Geſtures. Thus as
by Cuſtome the putting off the Hat,
bowing and kneeling are Marks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
amongſt Men, ſo they are in
our Addreſſes to God. Indeed the
Uncovering of the Head was formerly
a Badge of Authority.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, &amp;c.</note> But Cuſtome
hath quite alter'd that ſignification, and
yet hath made it fit to be retain'd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and I think you have no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt our uſing of it at preſent, as
a ſign of our Veneration and Subjection
to the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>6. The more early that a Ceremony
was us'd, and the longer it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd;
the more univerſally it hath
been receiv'd and approv'd, eſpecially
by good Men, and the greater good it is
expreſſive of, the fitter it is for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
And this may be ſaid for the
<hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> which hath been
much oppos'd by the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> That
in the next Age after the Apoſtles, if
not in their Days, it was every where
in uſe amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by it to the World, that they
were <hi>not aſham'd of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi>
but rather gloried in it, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſuffer for it. So that it was a
compendious Confeſſion of their Faith,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59674:83"/>
or a Viſible Creed in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to the Eye the ſame Truth, and
their Reſolution to adhere to it, that
by Words they profeſs'd to the Ear. And
if this laſt way ought to be approved,
the other may not be condemn'd; nor
was it by any but the Infidels, or open
Enemies of the Goſpel. From the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church it was tranſmitted down
to our own, and being freed by our
Reformers from the Abuſes which Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
had added to it by the way,
it is preſcrib'd in our Liturgy, in the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Baptiſm,</hi> as ſignifying the <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of the Baptized to <hi>him that Died
on the Croſs for them.</hi> We have good
reaſon therefore not to lay aſide a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
that is come to us thus recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
and is ſo ſuitable to the end
for which it was employ'd. As for thoſe
that caſt it out as an <hi>Idol,</hi> they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
us, that we cannot comply with
them in reproaching, as Idolaters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Saints and Martyrs that are
now <hi>with God:</hi> And that being no <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> we do not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the <hi>Sign</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>7. It follows from what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that when things indifferent are
againſt <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> they are alſo againſt
<hi>Decency,</hi> and to be avoided. For a Man
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59674:83"/>
to wear Long Hair, had no Moral Evil
in it, nor had the Scripture decided any
thing about it, yet the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
it as ſhameful, and againſt the
Dictate of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 14.</note> Not as if it was
forbidden by any Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo call'd; but the meaning is, it was
againſt <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> which is a Law in ſuch
caſes. It is no ſmall matter then to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> that have been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
receiv'd, and long continued in the
Churches, as the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> have done,
whilſt they have been labouring to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their own Diſcipline; which, till
of late, was never heard of in any part
of the World. Charity would teach
them not to <hi>behave themſelves ſo unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note>But if they will not learn that Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor ceaſe to be <hi>Contentious,</hi> but
obtrude on us their own Novelties, it
may be ſufficient for us to ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 16.</note> That <hi>we
have no ſuch Cuſtoms, neither the Churches
of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. It alſo follows from what was ſaid
before, that things which, according to
<hi>Cuſtome,</hi> are ſigns of Irreverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men, are marks of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Contempt when they are us'd
towards the Almighty. <hi>If ye offer the
Blind for Sacrifice, is it not Evil? And
if ye offer the Lame and Sick, is it not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59674:84"/>
Evil? Offer it now to thy Governour, will
he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy
Perſon? Saith the Lord Amighty,</hi> Mal.
1. 8. And this may afford us very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Advice; for from hence it is clear,
that if we rudely ruſh into his preſence
without any thing of Ceremony; if
we refuſe him all outward Reſpect when
he ſpeaks to us in the Aſſemblies of his
People, and will not bow the Knee
when we put up our Prayers to him,
but call on him in the ſame Poſture as
we would talk to our Servants, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
him in ſuch a Behaviour as we
would not offer to our <hi>Governour,</hi> and
may juſtly fear that he will puniſh our
Inſolence and Preſumption.</p>
                  <p>If you lay theſe things together, you
may find, that what you call the Purity
of your Ordinances, is their defect:
That you have acted againſt the known
Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in rejecting the
laudable <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of Antiquity, and of
the Church which you have deſerted;
and that the way which you have
forſaken, expreſſing much more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Almighty than that in
which ye are now engaged, is, for
that reaſon, to be prefer'd before
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59674:84"/>
As for outward Bodily Worſhip, it is
particularly forbidden by the <hi>Directory</hi>
at one time, and never ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
at any time,<note n="a" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s View of the New Directory, Sect. 23.</note> nor do I
find that it is as much as permitted in
any part of the Publick Service. I know
not whether kneeling be at all uſed in
your Meetings; but I have reaſon to
think, it is not much. And yet you
cannot be ignorant, that it is a fit Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
for Prayer, and I ſuppoſe in your
Family-Prayers you do not reject it. But
if this be ſo, it may ſeem ſtrange, that
you ſhould think the Houſe of your Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip the only place wherein you
would ſhew Irreverence to the Divine
Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>I need not here treat of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in debate between us; but one
thing I will not omit, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
to the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Exceptions againſt the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Church, and ſhews the
Irreverence that is us'd in your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in a thing of very great moment.
What I mean is the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which
in your way is appointed to be received
<hi>Sitting.</hi> But is there any Precept for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59674:85"/>
this in Scripture? Or if none can be
found, is it not againſt the <hi>Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi>
Is it not an <hi>Idol?</hi> That is
the way of reaſoning us'd by many <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
and this inſtance may ſhew them
the folly of it. To make up this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Way of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> c. 4. Sect. 2.</note> gives us a reaſon for
<hi>ſitting</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> which is, that
it is of <hi>Symbolical uſe to teach the Church
their Majority over their Miniſters,</hi> who
if they be their true Paſtors, are <hi>over
them in the Lord.</hi> He alſo tells us, <hi>That
Chriſt adminiſtred it to his Diſciples ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi>
but the Learned amongſt you will
inform you, that this is a miſtake. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
contend that a <hi>Table-geſture</hi> is to
be us'd, but neither hath this any ground
in Scripture. It is certain the matter is
not decided there; and if it were not
determin'd by our Superiours, the beſt
way would be to enquire which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
would be moſt expedient for ſo
great a Solemnity. Now your Table-geſture
being the ſame that you uſe <hi>at
home in your own Houſes,</hi> ſeems very unfit
for a Religious Feaſt, at which we are
entertain'd by the Almighty King, the
Lord of Men and Angels. It argues a
great piece of Familiarity with him,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59674:85"/>
which he hath no where approv'd. He
hath no where requir'd you to ſit
down, but ye will do it without his
Call. And if this ſeems decent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful,
<hi>Offer</hi> the like <hi>to your Governour:
Will he be pleaſed with it, or accept your
Perſons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Publican,</hi> that would <hi>not ſo
much as lift up their Eyes to Heaven, but
ſmote upon their Breaſt,</hi> did that which
was ſuitable to his Condition: But
your Behaviour at the Sacrament, is
very different; for rejecting the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Geſtures which are expreſſive of
Reverehce, you only admit of that
which hath nothing in it of Reſpect;
and which you would not preſume to
uſe before a <hi>Governour,</hi> without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Command, or Invitation.</p>
                  <p>As for the Geſture of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> I
think it is very proper for this occaſion.
It is fit that we ſhould be then in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Praying, when we joyn with
the Miniſter in the Petition, That <hi>the
Body and Blood of Chriſt, may preſerve
our Bodies and Souls unto Eternal Life.</hi>
And ſince Chriſt is to be Worſhipped,
ſurely it is very fit that we pay Him
our Adoration, when He comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
over to us, the Ineſtimable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59674:86"/>
of His Croſs and Paſſion. And now
I leave you to judge, with which of us
this Ordinance is celebrated with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reverence, or in a Way more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Dignity of ſo Venerable
a Myſtery? Or which of us does moſt
appear to <hi>diſcern the Lord's Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. It hath been ſaid, <hi>That the Way
of the Separation affords you Communion
with a better People than thoſe which you
have deſerted.</hi> And not to enquire how
juſtly this Compariſon is made Partial,
as it appears, but to make as ſhort
Work as may be, I think we may agree
in this; That the <hi>Conforming Churches</hi>
conſiſt of a Mixture of Good and Bad
Men. And ſince the laſt are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Queſtion is, Whether this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies
your Separation? For if That be
Sinful, the Pretence of your joyning
with a better People, muſt fall to the
Ground. And ſo I might diſmiſs this
Debate, having ſaid enough for the
Deciſion of it before. Yet to ſet the
preſent Caſe in a clearer Light, I ſhall
further ſhew,</p>
                  <p>1. That for Private Perſons to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themſelves from a Church, becauſe
Ill Men are tolerated in it, and that they
may form a Purer Congregation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59674:86"/>
only of <hi>Viſible Saints,</hi> as they

                  <p>1. It is not according to Scripture,
which indeed gives us an Account of
the Corruptions, and want of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in many Churches, yet ſays not
a Word to juſtifie a <hi>Separation</hi> from
them, but much for the Condemnation
of it; whatſoever might be pleaded in
its Defence. To give an Inſtance out
of many: In the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
the Inceſtuous Man who had committed
a Crime that was not <hi>ſo mnch as Nam'd
among the</hi> Gentiles, was tolerated; and
they <hi>mourned not</hi> that he might have

him, there were many others that
were guilty of great Immoralities; and
the Apoſtle was afraid that he ſhould
have cauſe <hi>to bewail them,</hi> as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>repented of the Vncleanneſs, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Laſciviouſneſs which they had
committed.</hi>

their <hi>coming together was not for
the better, but for the worſe.</hi> Now here
was a very ſad Face of Affairs: And
what Remedy doth the Apoſtle apply
on this occaſion? Doth he ſay, That
their Conſtitution was diſſolv'd, and
they were no longer a Church? Or
doth he ſay, That the better part ſhould
deſert the worſe, and make up a <hi>Church</hi>
by themſelves, conſiſting only of <hi>Viſible
Saints?</hi> No ſuch matter: He conſiders
them all together as a Society gather'd
out of the World, and Conſecrated to
God, and addreſſes his firſt Epiſtle to
them in this Style; <hi>To the Church of
God which is at</hi> Corinth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>to them that are
Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be
Saints:</hi> And he directs the ſecond in
like manner; ſuppoſing them to have a
Federal Holineſs as a Church, when of
Inherent Piety there was ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
among them, and when ſo many
of them were guilty of great Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
He labours to inform them, and
for that purpoſe he charges them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the Inceſtuous Man from their
Communion. He reproves the Vicious,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59674:87"/>
and threatens them with Eccleſiaſtical
Cenſures. He admoniſhes the Litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

and warns them not to come irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> but to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,</hi>

he ſays not a Word that might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
any of them to forſake the Publick
Aſſemblies on the Account of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals

                  <p>2. The Pretence of Separating from
the Church, becauſe Wicked Men are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59674:88"/>
tolerated, being admitted, it would be
attended with great Evils. What they
are, will better appear when I come to
treat of the Conſequence of <hi>Schiſm,</hi>
but the Conſideration of ſome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to our preſent Caſe, may not here
be omitted.</p>
                  <p>1. If this Pretence were allow'd, it
would lay a Foundation for perpetual
<hi>Diviſions.</hi> For then any Party profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
greater Sanctity, how unjuſtly
ſoever, might withdraw themſelves
from the Church, and ſay, <hi>Stand from
us, for we are more Holier than you.</hi> And
then others might ſay the like to the
firſt Dividers, and a third ſort to the
ſecond, and ſo on, as long as it was
poſſible to make any farther Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Eminent Nonconformiſt</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ball.</hi> See his Anſwer to <hi>Can.</hi> p. 137, 138.</note> has given
us this Account of a Perſon, who would
reform his Bible in ſuch a manner, that
<q>he cut out the Contents, Titles, and
every thing elſe but the Text it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them to be Humane Devices,
and conſequently Idolatrous.</q> And
agreeable to this Action was the reſt of
his Converſation. For <q>he would come
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59674:88"/>
at no Man, nor ſuffer any Man to come
at him. But having ſhut up himſelf and
his Children in his Houſe, Suſtenance
was brought to them, and put in at
ſome Hole, or Window; but he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
no Man to come and Miniſter
unto them; no, not when he and they
lay Sick, and in great Miſery. And
when, by Order, his Houſe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
open, two of his Children were
found Dead; and one of them had
been ſo long unburied, that the Body
was corrupted, and it did annoy the
Room.</q> This Man lived up to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and purſued them as far as they
would go. And his Example may teach
us, that if we think our ſelves obliged,
when the Law permits us, to forſake
the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe it admits of a Mixt
<hi>Communion,</hi> and that we may joyn with
a better People, we ſhould ſoon ſee the
like occaſion to deſert theſe alſo. And
then we muſt ſeek out other Company,
and ſo go on till we are pent up within
ſo narrow a compaſs that we could
move no farther.</p>
                  <p>2. This Pretente being admitted,
Men profeſſing much Religion, when
they have little of the Senſe or Power
of it, would be encouraged to raiſe and
keep up ſuch Diſturbances as might
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59674:89"/>
ſerve the deſigns of their, Ambition, or
other Worldly Ends. And whilſt the
Meek and Lowly <hi>would ſtudy to be quiet,</hi>

if it meets with great Encouragement,
as it does too often, there is no doubt to
be made of its readineſs to furniſh the
World with Reformers in all Societies

that would condemn Miſcarriages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and beſtow bitter Invectives on
them at a diſtance, but cheriſh them at

who were Raſh and Confident, ſuch as

                  </p>
                  <p>3. This Pretence for Separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted, it would put Men upon a

caſts a Reproach upon the Deſerted.

You have need therefore to be

when you did forſake the <hi>Church of

and prefer'd before it, the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59674:90"/>
                     <hi>Diſſenting Congregations.</hi> It will not be
ſufficient for you to ſay, That amongſt
the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> many were guilty of
great Immoralities; for it would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for them to recriminate, and the
truth is, there have been and are on
both ſides, great Numbers of Men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
Vicious, but we muſt leave
them to <hi>bear their own burthen. Offences
will come,</hi> and ſuch there were in the

Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Yet on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no allowance was given to any of
the Faithful to withdraw themſelves
from the Publick Aſſemblies. It is
therefore to be ſuppos'd that you can
prove ſome very hainous thing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt particular Perſons, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

the <hi>Conforming Churches</hi> as ſuch; ſome
great thing, for which they ought to be
forſaken, or you are very injurious to

It is now your Buſineſs to exalt the
Societies with which you are at preſent
in Communion, as well as to depreſs
thoſe which you have deſerted; a thing
very uſual in ſuch caſes. But that you
may ſtate the Account aright, when
you are comparing the <hi>Old Churches</hi>
with the <hi>New,</hi> as they are call'd, you
ought carefully to examine, whether
the laſt be Churches in reality, or in
Name only: Whether any of your
Paſtors have Right to exerciſe their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Separate Way; and whether
the far greater part of them are not
meer Uſurpers, that have no juſt Title
to the Miniſtry, and the Adminiſtration
of the Sacraments. All theſe are things
of great weight; and what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
may help you in your Enquiries
into them, and convince you, if you
pleaſe to conſider it attentively, that
you have been miſtaken about
them; and that where you thought

dividing it, is no wiſer than to cut out the
Liver, or Spleen, or Gall, to cleanſe them
from the Filth that doth obſtruct them,
and hinder them in their Office: You may
indeed thus cleanſe them, but it will be a
Mortal Cure. As he that ſhould divide the
Kingdom into two Kingdoms, diſſolveth
the old Kingdom, or part of it at leaſt, to
erect two new ones: So he that would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> into two,
muſt thereby deſtroy it, if he could ſucceed,
or deſtroy that part which divideth it ſelf
from the reſt. Can a Member live that
is cut off from the Body, or a Branch that
is ſeparated from the Tree? <hi>And to
theſe Queſtions I ſhall leave you to

Way of the Separatiſts conduces more to

                     <hi>That</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions

all the benefit of each others Gifts, and of

<hi>James</hi> calleth Earthly, Senſual, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh;
which corrupteth all their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and turneth their Food to the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of their Diſeaſe, and maheth their
very Worſhipping of God to become the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of their <hi>Sin.</hi> Where Diviſions and

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59674:92"/>
grow up in Humility, Meekneſs, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
Holineſs and Love, do grow in Pride
and perverſe Diſputings, and paſſionate
Strivings, and envious Wranglings. The
Spirit of God departeth from them, and an
Evil Spirit of Malice and Vexation ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
place; though in their Paſſion they
know not what Spirit they are of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                  <p>To ſpeak more diſtinctly to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <p>I. What is the True Notion of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>II. What you underſtand by it, and
whether you rightly judge, how it is
beſt promoted.</p>
                  <p>III. Whether according to your ſenſe

or ought to follow thoſe Teachers, by

                  <p>IV. Whether this may juſtifie your
preſent Separation.</p>
                  <p>I. I am firſt to enquire, What is the
True Notion of <hi>Edification.</hi> And to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59674:93"/>
clear this, it is to be conſider'd, that the
word which is Literally render'd <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
is often in the Holy Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Spiritual Matters; and being
taken in a good Senſe, as commonly it
is, it ſignifies the Advancement of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in ſome Spiritual Good: And to
<hi>Edifie</hi> them, is to do that Work of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
whereby we become beneficial to
their Souls. <hi>Knowledge puffeth,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>but Charity Edifieth,</hi> 1 Cor.
8. 1. <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and
Edifie one another,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 11. <hi>Let no
corrupt Communication proceed out of your
Mouth, but that which is good to the uſe
of Edifying, that it may miniſter Grace
to the Hearers,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 29. <hi>Let us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

Rom. 15. 2. In which places, it is the
<hi>Edifying</hi> of our Neighbours that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us; and that of our ſelves is
never enjoyn'd under this Expreſſion,
nor can it well be ſought but in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the Publick good.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That he
that <hi>ſpeaketh in an unknown Tongue Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 4. But this is
mention'd but as a mean uſe of his Gift;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59674:93"/>
and one that Prophefied and inſtructed
others, was for this reaſon prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

that the Church may receive Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
1 Cor. 14. 5.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that the Buſineſs of <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
duly managed, hath a principal
regard to the Church. And by how
much more any thing is beneficial to
that, by ſo much more it ought to be
eſteem'd. <hi>Foraſmuch,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle,
<hi>as ye are zealous of Spiritual Gifts, ſeek
that ye may excel to the Edifying of the
Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 12.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt to be made, but
the uſe of this Word <hi>Edification</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from another <hi>Metaphor,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the <hi>Church.</hi> For the <hi>Church</hi> being
in Scripture call'd a <hi>Houſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it being ſaid to be <hi>Living Stones,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note>
the adding to it ſuch Materials, and the
poliſhing and perfecting thoſe that are
in it, are the <hi>Edification</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Houſe</hi> is already built and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<hi>upon the Foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

And we ſhall be reckon'd amongſt the
<hi>Builders,</hi> or <hi>Edifiers</hi> of it, if we repair
its Breaches; if we enlarge it, or raiſe
it higher, or contribute any thing to its
ſtrength, or ſplendor: That is, if we
bring new Proſelytes into the Church,
or confirm thoſe that are in it; if we are
inſtrumental in the Converſion of ſome,
or in advancing any in Knowledge and
Piety, in Faith and Practice.</p>
                  <p>Without Practice there is no true <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
but all that are duly exercis'd
in Holineſs, are perfected by it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are invited and drawn into the
Church by their Example. <hi>The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
ſays St. <hi>Luke, had reſt throughout
all</hi> Judea, <hi>and</hi> Galilee, <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and
were Edified, and walking in the fear of
the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy
Ghoſt, were multiplied,</hi> Acts 9. 31.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church,</hi> in many reſpects, may
be compar'd to a Houſe, but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of
Building. But on both theſe I have
treated before; and what I ſhall add,
will only be farther to explain what is
meant by <hi>Edification,</hi> and to remove the
Miſtakes about it.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is required in this Spiritual
<hi>Houſe,</hi> and all the parts of it ought to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59674:94"/>
be <hi>compacted,</hi> like thoſe of an Artificial
Building, or a Natural Body. The
more they are ſo, the better they are
prepar'd for <hi>Edification</hi> and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in things Divine. They are <hi>call'd
to Peace in One Body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3. 15</note> and <hi>being knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <p>As <hi>Diviſions</hi> are the cauſe of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Deformity in this Body; ſo on
the contrary, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> helps to ſtrengthen
and adorn it. Thus when the <hi>Schiſm,</hi>
which I mention'd before, was broken

Juſtice and Peace were far from them.
Every one did forſake the Fear of God,
and in his Faith became blind. None
of them lived according to the Rule of
his Precepts, or walked worthy of
Chriſt. But they all followed their
own depraved Luſts, having taken
up an Unjuſt and Impious Envy, by
which Death entred into the World.</q>

it appears, that the Unity of the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<hi>is highly beneficial to them. And
we may add, That it alſo promotes the</hi>

Mr.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Chr. Direct. p. 739.</note> Baxter, that the Deſign and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
beſeeming God, and deſirable to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59674:96"/>
Man, when they ſee it does produce ſuch good
Effects, as the Love, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of Manknd. And it is an exceeding
great and powerful help to the Converſion
of the World in this reſpect, becauſe it is
a thing ſo conſpicuous in their ſight, and
ſo intelligible to them, and ſo approved
by them. They are little wrought on by
the Doctrine of Christ alone, becauſe it is
viſible, or audible but to few, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by fewer, and containeth many things
which Nature doth diſtaſte. <hi>But</hi> the
Holy Concord of <hi>Believers,</hi> is a thing that
they are more able to diſcern and judge of,
and do more generally approve. The
<hi>HOLY CONCORD</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
muſt be the <hi>CONVERSION</hi> of
the <hi>Unbelieving World,</hi> if God have ſo
great a Mercy for the World; which is a

Enemies, both Spiritual and Corporal, are

underſtand by <hi>Edification,</hi> and whether
you rightly judge, how it is beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.
Now as far as I can learn from
thoſe that pretend to it for the Defence
of their Separation; you take that to be
<hi>Edifying</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Devotion, that excites in you ſome
Religious Affections, ſuch as Love, Joy,
Fear, or the like. Other things might
be added, but I ſuppoſe, you have theſe
chiefly in view, when you prefer the
Service in your Meetings, before that
of our Churches. The way of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your Aſſemblies, we are told, is
more Edifying, becauſe you can be
warmer, or more ſervent in it, than in
the uſe of the preſcribed Forms. The
Preaching amongſt you is more Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Powerful than that of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Clergy, becauſe you feel the
working of it more upon your Hearts;
and to argue againſt this, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to diſpute
againſt your own Experience. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59674:97"/>
I ſhall examine, whether there
are ſuch Advantages in your way as are
pretended; and whether the things on
which you fix ſo high an eſtimate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Preference which you have
given them.</p>
                  <p>1. To begin with the way of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us'd in your Meetings, give me
leave to tell you, That it may be, the
Effects of it are not of ſuch a Nature as
you conceive, nor any Argument of
its Excellency. It cannot well be
thought, that a Perſon ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make better choice of the matter
of Prayer, or expreſs it better, or in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
terms, when he ſpeaks with little
Deliberation, or none at all, than he
himſelf, or wiſer and better Men, can
in a Form of Words, when they have
long meditated on the Subject, and
employ'd many and ſerious Thoughts
about it. It muſt be therefore the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of of his Expreſſions, and probably
ſomething in the Tone of his Voice,
which makes his Performance ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and has ſuch an influence upon
you. But you are not to think, that
God is at all wrought upon by the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Phraſes, or the Modulations of
them. Nor are theſe things apt to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59674:98"/>
make any deep Impreſſions on the Nobler
Faculties of the Soul; but having done
their Work in the Fancy, or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they ſeldom riſe higher; nor can
they do it by any thing of Vertue in
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers may have more
Power than <hi>Forms</hi> to produce in ſome
Ill Men a kind of <hi>Extempore</hi> Devotion;
ſome Appearances of Religious Love,
and Fear, and Joy. But theſe being
rais'd by Surprize, when the Surprize
is over, they are gone. And yet there
are many that put great Confidence in
ſuch vaniſhing things: Many that live
comfortably on the reflection on thoſe
delightful Dreams, eſteeming them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities,
and clear Evidences of their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
                  <p>Many have been famous for what they
call the <hi>Gift of Prayer.</hi> who have miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
deceiv'd themſelves, and been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>Sounding Braſs,</hi> when they were
eſteem'd as <hi>Oracles.</hi> And many that
have thought themſelves much Edified
by hearing the <hi>Extempore Prayers</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men, have been under the ſame
Deluſion. In ſuch caſes I doubt not
but both Speakers and Hearers feel ſuch
Motions within them, as bear a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of true Devotion: And theſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59674:98"/>
they do not impute to Natural Cauſes,
as a little Philoſophy would teach them,
but to Inſpiration, or the Effectual
working of Sanctifying Grace: And ſo
they grow up into a ſtrong Opinion,
that they are the Favourites of Heaven,
when they allow themſelves in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Injuſtice, of Cruelty, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and other grievous Sins.</p>
                  <p>I deny not, that ſome Perſons, who
have the Gift of Elocution, may, upon
occaſion, expreſs the Matter of Prayer
in ſuitable Terms: Nor do I queſtion
but to hear them, when they do ſo, may
be of benefit to others. Yet if they put
too high a value upon this, and if it
brings them into a contempt of all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
what they took to be a peculiar
Priviledge, becomes a dangerous Snare
to them; and inſtead of promoting,
cannot but hinder their Edification.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I think a well
compoſed Liturgy, has much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of your way of Praying, and
is much fitter, in Publick Aſſemblies. It
beſt ſecures the Honour of Religion in
the Solemnities of Worſhip, and affords us
the greateſt help in the part that we bear
in it. In the uſe of it we have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be in pain, or fear, about the next
Words that may fall from the Miniſter,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59674:99"/>
however he be a Perſon of mean Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
nor have we cauſe to condemn
thoſe that before came from him, or any
need to revolve them in our Minds, as
being uncertain whether we may ſay
<hi>Amen</hi> to them. Having approv'd of all
before, we have nothing to do but to
keep our Minds intent on the Matter,
as it comes before us, and to exerciſe
our Devotion as it directs us, and then
we may have a comfortable aſſurance,
that we perform a Service that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, and agreeable to his
Will.</p>
                  <p>As for our own Liturgy, the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi> hath very well ſhew'd
the Excellency of it, and its Uſefulneſs
for Edification. And could I prevail
with you to perſue the Sermon<note n="a" place="bottom">Sermon on 1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively,
wherein he treats of this
Subject, I ſhould hope it would give
you much Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>What I ſhall ſay more of our Liturgy
is taken from a great Authority, and
expreſs'd in theſe Words: <q>The Book
of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> was compil'd in the
Times of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> by the moſt
Pious and Learned Men of that Age,
and defended and confirm'd by the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59674:99"/>
Martyrdom of many; and was firſt
Eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament in the
Time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI, and never
repeal'd, or laid aſide, ſave only in the
ſhort time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign,
upon the return of Popery and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition:
And in the firſt Year of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was again reviv'd,
and Eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament,
and the Repeal of it then declar'd by
the whole Parliament, to have been
to the great decay of the due Honour
of God, and Diſcomfort of the true
Profeſſors of the Truth of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And ever ſince it hath been
us'd and obſerv'd in the beſt Times of
Peace and Plenty that ever this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
enjoy'd, and contains in it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Form of Worſhip and Service
of God, grounded upon the Holy
Scriptures, and is a ſingular Means
and Help to Devotion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It hath been ſaid, That the Way
of Preaching in your Meetings, is more
Edifying than that which you heard in
the Conforming Churches. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
there would be no denying of this,
if we may believe ſome of your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who have pretended, that till they
had their Liberty to Preach, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
was impriſon'd, or the Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59674:100"/>
of it. But few of you, I ſuppoſe,
are thus perſwaded. And yet I know
not whether you have any better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the Preference which you give to
your Paſtors, and for having their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo much in admiration.</p>
                  <p>I deny not but there are amongſt
them Perſons of great Abilities. But I
think ſome of their Brethren, much their
Inferiour, have had the Reputation of
more Powerful Preachers, who acquir'd
it only by the uſe of a Set of Phraſes, in
which they had no meaning, or a bad
one. And many have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much Edified by ſuch a Sound of
Words, when they underſtood nothing
by it; or, which is much worſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
under it ſome falſe Doctrine.
Such a Doctrine is that of the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi>
which being wrapt up in Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Scripture, hath paſs'd without
any great Examination, and gain'd an
eaſie admiſſion amongſt many; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the plain oppoſition that
it bears to the Deſign of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion but the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi>
Doctrine being deliver'd in a
pathetick manner, and with agreeable
Geſtures, may heat the Imagination,
and work powerfully upon the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59674:100"/>
of thoſe that embrace it; how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſoever it is to the Holy Scripture.
And this may give you ſome intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that you are not to judge of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of Sermons, by ſuch Effects as
may proceed from Falſhood as well as
Truth, or may be owing to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
or Action of the Speaker:
But that which is fitteſt to convince the
Reaſon, and inform the Judgment in
<hi>Things Divine;</hi> That which ſets theſe
things in the cleareſt Light, and defends
them beſt; That which beſt ſhews the
Neceſſity of Obedience, and urges the
Practice of all <hi>Chriſtian Duties</hi> with the
ſtrongeſt Motives; That which moſt
conduces to the <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi>
and to the <hi>Perfecting of Holineſs in the
Fear of God,</hi> is the beſt Preaching:
And that this is wanting in the <hi>Church
of</hi> England, or more abounds in your
Meetings, is, in my Opinion, what
will not gain an eaſie Credit amongſt
Equal Judges.</p>
                  <p>Yet let us ſuppoſe that you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you better Praying and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Is there any thing wanting with
us that is neceſſary to Salvation? This
is not pretended by you. Only you
think you may receive greater benefit
in your <hi>Congregations,</hi> than was to be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59674:101"/>
expected in our <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> What you
ſeek then in frequenting thoſe <hi>Meetings,</hi>
is your own Advantage, without due
regard to the Publick Good. But the
<hi>Edification</hi> which the Scriptures require
you to promote, is that of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and eſpecially that of the <hi>Church
of Chriſt.</hi> So that your Notion of the
Thing is at beſt defective, and too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
What other Faults it has we ſhall
ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>III. The next Enquiry is, <hi>Whether it
be a good Rule, that you may, or ought to
follow thoſe Teachers, whoſoever they are,
by when you can moſt be Edified, or whoſe
Praying and Preaching you approve,</hi> as
moſt <hi>Beneficial to your ſelves.</hi> To which
I anſwer, That a Rule which would
give you Liberty or make it your Duty
to ſhift Communions as often as you
expect ſomething better for your ſelves,
or more <hi>Edifying,</hi> as you call it, in the
next Change, ought to be rejected as
Abſurd, and as a Ground of perpetual
Diviſions. A numerous Congregation
acting by this Rule, might ſoon be ſplit
into Twenty, or many more; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Members of it differ'd about
the <hi>beſt</hi> Means of their <hi>Edification.</hi> And
of every one was left to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59674:101"/>
who is the moſt <hi>Edifying Miniſter;</hi>
and all thought that they might admit
of none but the <hi>Beſt,</hi> the Number of
their Teachers muſt be equal to that of
their own Opinions about them; and
there would be no fixing them under
One unleſs they could All be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this One is the Beſt for them
All. But as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays,<note n="a" place="bottom">Cure of Church-Diviſions, p. 359.</note> 
                     <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all have a very ſtrange diverſity of
Apprehenſions. One thinks that this is
the</hi> Beſt <hi>way, and another that the other
is the</hi> Beſt: <hi>And let them Reaſon and
Wrangle it out never ſo long, uſually each
Party ſtill holdeth its own, and hardly
yieldeth to anothers Reaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Corinth</hi> ſome ſaid they were of
<hi>Apollos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> as well as others did that they
were of <hi>Paul:</hi> And as far as we can
find, both theſe Parties thought they
did the Beſt, and contended with equal
Zeal. Which yet might ſeem very
ſtrange, were it not uſual with Men in
ſuch Debates, to be govern'd by Fancy
more than Judgment. For <hi>Paul</hi> was in
nothing inferiour to <hi>the very chiefeſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 11.</note>and in his Labours and Sufferings
he exceeded the reſt. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>caught
up in the Third Heaven,</hi> and had ſuch an
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59674:102"/>
                     <hi>abundance of Revelations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2, 7.</note> that he was in
danger of being <hi>exalted by them above
meaſure.</hi> And it might well have been
thought, that he was the Perſon upon
Earth, from whom one ſhould have
been moſt willing to receive Inſtruction.
Nevertheleſs ſome prefer'd <hi>Apollos,</hi> who
had no ſuch Priviledges, before him:
And probably the reaſon was, becauſe
<hi>Apollos</hi> was an <hi>Eloquent Man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 18. 24.</note> as well as
Mighty in the Scriptures. But of <hi>Paul</hi>
it was ſaid, That <hi>his bodily Preſence was
weak,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and his Speech contemptible.</hi> And
for this reaſon, it ſeems, he was eſteem'd
amongſt them a <hi>weak Preacher.</hi> And
ſuch Ill Judges would the People often
be in like Caſes, if theſe were left to
their Deciſion.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle, to ſet the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
right about the Matter in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
informs them, that he himſelf
and <hi>Apollos,</hi> were not deſign'd to be
Leaders of Factions, but were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in their Work in the Service of
the ſame Maſter: That they were both
<hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and both employ'd
by Him, the one in <hi>Planting,</hi> the other
in <hi>Watering.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7.</note> But, ſays he, <hi>Neither is
he that Planteth any thing, nor he that
Watereth any thing, but God that giveth
the Increaſe.</hi> And from Him they might
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59674:102"/>
have expected a Bleſſing either by <hi>Paul,</hi>
or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or much weaker Inſtruments
in a way of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Order:</hi> But in
their Factions preferring of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
before one another, they were <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and walked as Men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> They hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their own benefit, when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
the Churches Peace.</p>
                  <p>Probably they expected ſome great
Benefit from their Zeal which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in their ſeveral Parties, and their
endeavours to have the Beſt Teachers:
But they took wrong Meaſures to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and were reprov'd for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
And many there are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
who oppoſe the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and break
the <hi>Order</hi> of the Church, in hopes of
better <hi>Edification.</hi> But I ſhall ſhew
that the Means which they uſe, are
contrary to the End which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and therefore muſt fruſtrate their
Expectation, and bring guilt upon their
Souls. This indeed may be gather'd
from what went before; and theſe two
things which I ſhall add for illuſtration
of it, are only Conſequences of what I
have already prov'd.</p>
                  <p>1. It follows from that which was
ſaid before, that what is againſt the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church, is alſo againſt the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59674:103"/>
                     <hi>Edification</hi> of it; and conſequently, of
the parts whereof it conſiſts. That which
ſeparates the <hi>Stones</hi> of this <hi>Building</hi>
from one another, hinders the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Vital Spirit, which would
animate them all. That which divides
this <hi>Body,</hi> weakens it, and puts it into
a Sickly Condition. The Members that
make a Schiſm <hi>in</hi> it, throw it into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Convulſions: And they that
make a Schiſm <hi>from</hi> it, give it a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Wound; and afterwards can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grow up with it, nor without
it.</p>
                  <p>If therefore they that make Diviſions
could ſpeak with the <hi>Tongue of Angels,</hi>
we ought to <hi>avoid</hi> them. If in ſome
things we might arrive at great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by their Inſtruction, we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
them notwithſtanding. Such <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
would be apt to <hi>puff us up,</hi> but it is
<hi>Charity that Edifieth.</hi> And <hi>Charity,</hi> ſays
<hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Admits of no
Schiſm. Charity is not Seditious, but
doth all things in Concord. All the Elect
were perfected by it, and without it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is acceptable unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:59674:103"/>
2. What is againſt <hi>Order,</hi> is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Edification</hi> of the Church, and
conſequently, of the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it. That which juſtles the <hi>Stones</hi>
of this <hi>Spiritual Building</hi> out of their
places, hinders it as much as poſſible,
from growing <hi>unto a Holy Temple in the
Lord.</hi> That which diverts the parts of
this Body, from their proper Offices, or
puts them out of Joynt, hinders the
Nouriſhment, abates the Strength, and
deſtroys the Comelineſs and Beauty of
it. That which brings Confuſion into
my Society Eccleſiaſtical, or Civil, tends
to the Ruine of it, and fails not of doing
Miſchief to it.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this, even they that
were inſpir'd from Heaven, and had
<hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Doctrines, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
and <hi>Interpretations</hi> by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
were yet limited in the Exerciſe of
their Gifts, and to reſtrain them, theſe
two Precepts were given by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26, 40.</note>
                     <hi>Let all things be done to Edification:
Let all things be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
Decency and Order have ſuch a
connexion with <hi>Edification,</hi> that what
promotes <hi>Them,</hi> advances <hi>This:</hi> What
is contrary to <hi>Them,</hi> is contrary to <hi>This</hi>
alſo.</p>

                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:59674:104"/>
It is no wonder then that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was ſo much concern'd, when he heard
that among the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> there
were ſome that walked <hi>diſorderly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 11.</note>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> or
did break their Ranks.<note place="margin">See alſo v. 6. and 1 Theſſ. 5. 14.</note> For as ſuch Men
might be uſeful in their proper Places,
ſo out of them they hinder the <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Church, and are wont to be
Diſturbers of the Publick Peace. Many
in the way of their Vocation might have
excell'd, who going <hi>beyond their Line,</hi>
intrenching on the Rights of others,
and aſſuming an Authority which did
not belong to them, have become great
Incendiaries; and Perſons of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
have been moſt pernicious to the
beſt Societies.</p>
                  <p>When ſuch Diſturbers invade the
Offices of the Church, it is not enough
to ſay, That they Act the Part well,
which they have taken upon them,
when it is none of their own; or that
they have great Gifts, and are well
qualified for the Sacred Function, when
their aſſuming it is a meer Uſurpation.
There were many, doubtleſs, in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
who could have managed the Buſineſs
of Sacrificing, more de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trouſly than
ſome of the Prieſts themſelves: But it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59674:104"/>
                     <hi>appertained</hi> not to them; and if they
undertook it, they incurr'd the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Almighty. And in a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Congregation</hi> there may be ſome
Private Perſons, who are of better Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
or much fitter for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>
than the Miniſter himſelf. But having
no Lawful Call to it, it <hi>appertains not</hi> to
them: And if, in Confidence of their
own Abilities, they ſet up for Spiritual
Paſtors, they are ſo far from promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Edification,</hi> that they become open
Enemies to the Church, and liable, as
are alſo their Followers, to a juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>IV. The fourth Enquiry is, <hi>Whether
your hopes of being better Edified, may
juſtifie your Separation.</hi> That is, if I
have ſtated the Matter rightly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your falſe Hopes may juſtifie a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Practice. And this, I think, may
eaſily be reſolv'd. It appears from what
was ſaid before, that your Practice is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church, as a <hi>Viſible</hi> and a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi>
Society: That it is againſt the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Order</hi> of it; and conſequently,
that it is againſt the <hi>Edification</hi> which
the Scripture requires; as pulling a
Houſe in pieces is contrary to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it up, and throwing it in Heaps, is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59674:105"/>
contraary to the adorning and reparation
of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Gates of Hell ſhall not
prevail againſt the Church; nor ſhall
the Fury of Man be able to deſtroy it:
But to bring <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any part of it; to Separate from any
ſound Members of it, and to form So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
or be of thoſe, that are oppoſite
to it, is to ſtrike at the Whole, and to
attempt the Ruine of it: As it is alſo to

                  <p>III. That they have greatly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

And this I take to be a very

                  <p>II. Diviſions amongſt the Reformed,
have brought a Reproach upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and hindred the Progreſs of
it. <hi>Camden</hi> informs us,<note n="a" place="bottom">Cambd. Elizab. A. D. 1583.</note> that <hi>when
the Sectaries</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
made an open Separation, <hi>The</hi>
Papiſt <hi>thereupon clapped their Hands,
and ſuggeſting that there was no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>they draw many
to their Party.</hi> By this means we have
been on the loſing Hand, and this way
they have gain'd more Proſelytes, than
by all their Books of Controverſie. You
have been often told, how their Agents
have been employ'd to <hi>refine the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
to teach them a more <hi>Spiritual
Way of Praying</hi> than that of a Liturgy,
and to free them from all <hi>Smacks of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:</hi>
It being held meritorious by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59674:109"/>
the Managers of this Affair, if under
any ſhape they could from a Party that
would help to ruine our Conſtitution.
But in the late Times, the Men of this
Character, had the Confidence to lay
aſide their Diſguiſe, and diſdaining to
act any longer behind the Curtain, they
did their Work openly, and in the Face
of the Sun: And what Aſſiſtance you
gave them in it, was viſible to all the
World. This I write, not to inſult
over you; but in great Pity, to raiſe
your Indignation againſt <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which
engaged you in a ſhameful Confederacy.
It was <hi>Schiſm</hi> that made you, and other
Diſſenters before you, the Inſtruments
of the open Enemies of our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if you perſiſt in it,
will detain you in their Service. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you intend it or not, you will be
digging in their Mines, or building up
their ſhattered Walls: And by your
Hands they will carry on their Deſigns
with hopes of Succeſs, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of accompliſhing by their own.</p>
                  <p>III. Church-Diviſions have given
occaſion to the ſpreading of many dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
Errors in Matters of Religion.

to exerciſe their Arts, when they are
remov'n, whoſe watchful Eye ſhould
diſcover their Impoſtures, and who are
appointed for that purpoſe. And thus
when the Biſhops and the Clergy that
adher'd to them were laid aſide in this
Nation, Falſe Teachers did boldly ſhew
their Heads, and made a Prey of very
many. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf<note n="a" place="bottom">Ab Epiſcopatus abolitione conſecuta eſt horrenda confuſio &amp; perturbatio Religionis, Sectis innumera bilibus quae antea Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

IV. <hi>Church-Diviſions</hi> have greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<hi>Immorality:</hi> And this Effect
they had viſibly in this Nation, in the
Times of the great Confuſion. The
Diſorders that were then introduced in
Matters Eccleſiaſtical, were attended
with others in Things of Morality:
And if we may believe the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
themſelves, the many Hereſies

with a great Corruption

which did then abound, aſcrib'd the

as They call'd them. But we
may juſtly reckon the Accuſers in that
Number, and leave a great ſhare of the
Matter in charge with them, who by
revolting from their Superiors, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59674:111"/>
their Lawful Paſtors, did break
down the Fences, and open a Paſſage
to all Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>To come nearer to the preſent Time;
It is Notorious, that ſince the laſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of your Meetings by the <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Impiety hath been gathering
Strength, and Profaneneſs hath made
ſuch Progreſs, that it is become too
hard for all our Laws. It is not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but ſome New Law is wanting to
ſuppreſs it: And if that be obtain'd, it
may be fear'd, that the Succeſs would
not anſwer our Deſires, as long as the
<hi>Schiſm</hi> remains, which is at the Root of
this Evil; and is the great cauſe, why
Immorality hath ſo much ſpread it ſelf,
and boldly ſhew'd its Head in defiance
of all Authority.</p>
                  <p>But what Affinity is there between
<hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> or how is the
laſt of theſe a Conſequence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
To which I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a Means of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>2. It inclines Men to Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>3. It brings Religion into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>4. It is deſtructive of Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:59674:112"/>
5. It weakens the Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
which was deſign'd for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Offences.</p>
                  <p>6. It hinders, and ſometimes fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
the Endeavours of the Paſtors of
the Church, for the Suppreſſion of Vice,
and the Advancement of Piety.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a means of depraving
the Conſcience; and conſequently of
promoting <hi>Immorality.</hi> For being the
occaſion of ſpreading of Errors, which
are inconſiſtent with Holineſs, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
which is govern'd by them, when
they have perverted the Judgment,
muſt be ſo too. And when Men have
been taught to <hi>call Good, Evil,</hi> and <hi>Evil,
Good,</hi> their Actions will be ſuitable to
thoſe Inſtructions. We are inform'd
by<note n="a" place="bottom">De Bello Pelopon. Lib. p. 195. Edit. Oxon.</note> 
                     <hi>Thucydides,</hi> That in the Times
of Sedition in <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Signification of
Words was alter'd:</hi> So that <hi>a Brutiſh
Hardineſs was accounted True-hearted
Courage: Provident Deliberation, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Fearfulneſs: Prudence, a pretence for
Cowardice.—In ſhort,</hi> ſays the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<hi>for Perſons to be of a Kindred, was
not ſo near as to be of a Society;</hi> on
which account <hi>they were ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59674:112"/>
any thing, without making any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
about it.</hi> And thus, when the
Church has been divided, the Dividers
have changed the Names of Things:
And what, in other caſes, they would
have approv'd, they ſuffer not to paſs
without a ſharp Cenſure, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Faction; and what they
would otherwiſe have condemn'd as a
hainous Crime, they conſecrate into a
Duty, or an Act of Worſhip, when it
is done by themſelves, and for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their Party.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Schiſm</hi> inclines Men to Infidelity,
and by degrees leads them to it. Dr.<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Owen</hi> of Schiſm, p. 55.</note>
                     <hi>Owen</hi> confeſſes; That <hi>it conſtantly grows
to farther Evil, in ſome to Apoſtacy it
ſelf.</hi> In ſome it hath this effect, That
they embrace one Errour, or Evil Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
after another, and being unſtable
and prepar'd for all Changes, they uſually
grow worſe and worſe. Thus ſome from
declaiming againſt the Common-prayer
Book as an <hi>Idol,</hi> came to call the Holy
Scripture a <hi>Golden Calf.</hi> And many who
have been accuſtomed to ſhift their
Principles upon any New Occaſion,
have turn'd Scepticks, or Atheiſts, at
laſt; and renouncing the fear of Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59674:113"/>
have lived <hi>without God in the
World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Schiſm</hi> brings Religion into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and expoſes it to deriſion. <q>The
Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaith, <hi>If an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
come in and hear you ſpeak with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Tongues, will he not ſay that you
are mad?</hi> And certainly it is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when Atheiſts and profane Perſons
do hear of ſo many diſcordant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinions in Religion: It doth
avert them from the Church, and
make them <hi>ſit down in the Chair of the
Scorners.</hi>
                     </q> Theſe are the Words of the
Lord<note n="a" place="bottom">Bac. Eſſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Bacon:</hi> And they have been
confirm'd by ſad Experience.</p>
                  <p>4. Schiſm <hi>is deſtructive of Charity.
And from hence it is, that Perſons</hi> who
provoked one another to Love and to good
Works, <hi>when they remain'd in the ſame
Communion, being divided, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in Evil, and triumph'd in the
Falls of one another. Mr.</hi> Baxter<note n="b" place="bottom">See the Preface to his Cure of Church-Diviſions.</note>
                     <hi>tells us, That</hi> he had great Opportunity
in his Time, to ſee the working of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Iniquity againſt Chriſtian Love,
and to ſee in what manner Chriſt's Houſe

under thoſe Names: But ſince then,
I have ſeen what Love-killing Principles
have done. I have long ſtood by while
Churches have been divided, and ſub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:
One Congregation of the Diviſion,
labouring to make the other Contemptible
and Odious, and this call'd the Preaching
of the Truth, and the purer Worſhipping
of God.</p>
                  <p>Charity being expell'd, it is ſucceeded
by Envy and Strife, by <hi>Confuſion, and
every Evil Work.</hi> A falſe Zeal uſurps
the place of true Piety, and often puſhes
Men on to the greateſt Enormities and
Acts of Cruelty. This effect it hath
often had amongſt Chriſtians; and in
the Days of the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi>
when they were much divided, it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
many of them into ſuch Rage

Diſcipline, which was deſign'd for the
Puniſhment of Offences; and which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59674:114"/>
put a powerful Reſtraint on Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when it remain'd in its full Vigour.
But when it is broken, it is rendred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
or ceaſes to be a Terrour to
Evil-doers. For as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would
not be prevailed with, to live according
to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> deſerted <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and reſorted to the Temple which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballet</hi>
had built at <hi>Garizin</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Joſeph. Antiq. Jud. Lib. 2. cap. 8.</note>; ſo when
a Church is divided into oppoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
Offenders that would not be
endur'd in one, fly to another for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.
And then they are like to have
no great regard for an Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when it diſmiſſes them from one, to
another Society, which will hardly fail
to call it ſelf the purer of the two, or
to pretend to better means of Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought, that a Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Separated from the Church, upon a
pretence of greater Purity, would not
receive into their Communion other
Deſerters, who are Notorious for their
Immorality. But this has been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by frequent Experience; and
particularly it was ſo in the caſe of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatianus</hi>
and his Followers: For howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they profeſs'd a very rigorous ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59674:114"/>
yet they receiv'd into their Society
<hi>Novatus,</hi> a Man of contrary Principles
and looſe Morals. But that was no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as long as he ſerv'd their Deſigns.
They could connive at his former
Crimes, when he was engaged with
them in <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and Communication of
Guilt had made them One.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Schiſm</hi> hinders, and ſometimes
fruſtrates the Endeavours of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of the Church, for the Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Vice, and the Advancement of
Piety; and renders their Condition like
that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building
the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
<hi>held a Weapon in one Hand,</hi> whilſt they
<hi>Wrought in the Work with the other.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nehem. 4. 17.</note>
They cannot lay out their whole
Strength againſt the Immoralities of the
Times, and for the promoting of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when they are diverted from it by
a neceſſary Defence of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In this Defence they muſt expect to
ſuffer many Reproaches from the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
who, when they have leaſt to ſay
for their cauſe, are uſually moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to caſt Aſperſions on the Paſtors
and People which they have deſerted,
that it may not be thought, it was for
nothing that they made a Separation.</p>

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59674:115"/>
But the Paſtors of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
bear the greateſt ſhare of this, as
well as other Perſecutions: And then if
the Calumny with which they are load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is believed, it does infinite Miſchief.
It renders their <hi>Perſons</hi> deſpicable, and
their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> uſeleſs. It makes their
Reproofs of Sin appear ridiculous; and
be they innocent as they will, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Wickedneſs, which is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on them, gives encouragement to
thoſe that are under the Guilt of real
Crimes, and becomes an Inlet to all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>

                  <hi>Alas, dear Brother, that
we ſhould not yet know that our own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Diviſions, Alienations, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
are a Crying Sin! Yea, the

and Hurtfulneſs of others. Alas, will
God leave us alſo, even to the Obdurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

with us? What have we done to Chriſt's
Kingdom, to this Kingdom, to our own
Friends, Dead and Alive, to our ſelves,
and alas, to our Enemies, by our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59674:116"/>
                  <hi>And do we not feel it? Do we not
know it? Is it to us, even to us a Crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
to call us to Repentance? Woe
to us! Into what Hardheartedneſs have
we ſinned our ſelves! Yea, that we ſhould
continue in the Sin, and paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it!</hi> But to Sum up all.</p>
               <p>Would you bring the Kingdom of
Chriſt to Deſolation, or are you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſee the Ruine of his Houſe?
Would you hinder the Unbelieving
World from receiving the Goſpel, or
would you harden them in their Inſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
Would you blaſt the Honour of

you occaſion the ſpreading of many falſe
and damnable Doctrines, which caſt
Reproach on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name, and
are pernicious to the Souls of Men?
Would you keep open a free paſſage for
all Iniquity, and encourage Vice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

Shame, or Fear? <hi>Schiſm</hi> is the direct
way to all this, and the Means which
you have choſen, anſwer the Ends
which you have in view.</p>
               <p>But would you rather ſee the Kingdom

the Houſe increaſe Strength and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
which he hath built with ſo much

care and coſt? Would you be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the Converſion of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or would you have them brought
from Darkneſs to Light, and from the
Power of Satan unto God? Would
you defeat the Deſigns of the Factors
for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have been
ſo buſie in inflaming our Differences,
and ſo ready to make their Advantage
of them? Would you hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs

ſtop the Mouths of its Advocates?
Would you help to ſtem the Torrent of

And would you ſee the open Enemies of
Religion, forced into their lurking holes,
or flying into their Retreats of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Would you do what is highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
