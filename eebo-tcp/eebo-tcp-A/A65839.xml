            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have a Witness in Heaven, That we
have Love to the Souls of all Men; and
bear no Ill-Will to these <hi>Baptists:</hi> Howbeit, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Enmity of divers of them is such; that in
Times of Quietness, it hath been the manner of some of
their Chieftains, to be Quarrelling, and spreading their
Confused Pamphlets against us, and the <hi>Light Within</hi>
confessed by us; as being Offended and Fretted at our
present Liberty, which we have Publickly to Confess the
<hi>True Light;</hi> though obtain'd through Deep Sufferings:
Howbeit, the Fruitlesness of Coertion hath not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
by these Men's Valour, or Pretended Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Suffering Times. We see, the more they Strive,
the more they involve themselves in <hi>Babylonish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions</hi>
and <hi>Self-Contradiction,</hi> to the Overthrow
of their Cause, and their own Discredit therein.</p>

            <head>Some of the Baptists Doctrines and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
Collected out of their H. G's
Book in their own words, and
briefly Observ'd as follows.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>H. G. saith, viz.</hi> I utterly deny, that this Light,
which all men have from the Glorious Creator, is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Light, <hi>page</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>H. G. <hi>in Contradiction saith,</hi> I really believe, That the
Lord Jesus, as the Eternal Word, hath given Light, or Enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
all Men and Women that come into the World, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animadversion,</hi> The Light or Life of the Eternal
Word, which is the Light of Men, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Divine, as is that Word; and therefore Saving
to all that truly Obey it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. G.</hi> The great Darkness of these Men, who cry up Light
and Power Within, this Wile of Satan, and Cheat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
<hi>p.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>H. G. <hi>Contra.</hi> The Lord Jesus, as the Eternal Word, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth
all men. This Light is the Substance of the Law—The
Candle of the Lord: It doth Convince of Sin, <hi>p.</hi> 9. If
<hi>Heathens</hi> follow it, they would shine in Just Living. The
Work of Faith with Power—I do maintain, that Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

               <hi>Anim.</hi> What Horrible Blasphemy is it then, to term
our crying up the Light and Power of Christ Within, the
Wile of Satan, and Cheat of Antichrist? And how
plainly hereby Confuted? We have Cause to look upon
those <hi>Heathens,</hi> that follow the Light or Gift of God
Within, to be More Godly and Better Christians, then
many of these <hi>Baptists.</hi>

Christ's outward Sufferings; though we cannot believe,
that Satan is bound in this man, while he is in Satans work,
Blaspheming Christ's Light Within, and Belying us.</p>

or Fruit of the Heavenly Vine, without your Shaddows;
And this is our Lord's Supper, that we partake of; and our
Baptism is Spiritual, 1. <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Eph.</hi> 4. 5. and as in

the Pourings forth of the Spirit; and therefore the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

            <p>

are confirm'd and kept up by Bread and Wine? And what
Idolatry and Diversion from the Spirit doth their Doctrine

said End, see <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. G.</hi> again is very Fierce and Rash for their Water-Baptism

<hi>Whosoever brings any other Gospel, let him be Accurst,</hi> p. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Hereby he hath Curst all the People of God, and
Sincere-Minded, both <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all others in the
World, who Oppose, and come not under the <hi>Baptists</hi> Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

believe their <hi>Baptism</hi> to be either the <hi>Baptism of Christ,</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
or of Necessity and Available to Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47190:3"/>
               <hi>H. G. denies the True Saviour to be the Light and

            <p>
               <hi>H. G. Contrad. John</hi> declared plainly, that Christ was

assert, That Jesus Christ consisteth of a Humane Body of

both with the Eternal Glory of the Son of God, which he
had with the Father before the World began, wherein he
is Glorified; and his <hi>Body</hi> is Glorious and Spiritual: They
should have said, That he took upon him that <hi>Body</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him; and not, that he consists (or is made up) of
a Humane Body of Flesh and Bone: but at length, they
are made to grant the Deity of <hi>Christ,</hi> more then formerly;

(to wit the Light of the Eternal Word, the Creator)
with Vileness and Impurity: For the Word, and its Light,
is both Divine, Eternally Pure, and Unchangeably In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</p>
            <p>

Light in all, that doth so clearly tend to the razing out the grand
Fundamentals of the Gospel, <hi>p.</hi> 52.</p>
