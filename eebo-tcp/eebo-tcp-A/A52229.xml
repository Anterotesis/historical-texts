         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief and True Account of the notorious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and wicked Practices of that Grand
Impoſtor Lodowick Muggleton, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO Trace this impious Impoſtor from his Original,
who ever takes pains but to go into <hi>Cloak Lane,</hi>
will there be informed by the Generallity of the
Inhabitants, that this <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi> was at
firſt no other than a factious Journiman-<hi>Taylor,</hi> whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
being too large for the compitent allowance
of about 10 <hi>s. p.</hi> week, began in the year 1651. to conſult
with one <hi>John Reeve</hi> (a brother both in Trade and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
how they might betake them to ſome more profitable
imployment, whoſe lurded Incomes might more kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their Lukury; to this end they made ſome ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
and progreſs into all ſorts of <hi>Hereſies</hi> (as he has
ſince confeſt to <hi>J. C.</hi> and others) but finding thoſe Chair<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
already taken up, they reſolv'd to be beholding to no
body, but to contract ſuch a competent meaſure of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
and impiety, as ſhould inable them to ſtifle all the
oppoſitions of Religion, on Conſcience, and ſet up for
themſelves. And that which gave them no ſmall incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
hereunto was the wonderful ſucceſs and almoſt
infinite Riches, two precedent impoſtors <hi>John Ro

<hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tauny,</hi> had lately gained by the ſame damnable practice.
The proſperity of theſe two rendred the private conditions
of <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> more unſufferable; ſo that the
former being the more impudent, and having with
ſome curioſity peruſed the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and
found to his extreem ſorrow that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
had never ſo much as dreampt of him throughout the

or pretended Revelation, to force in the minds of
Liſtening Ignorants, whoſe Gaping curioſity lay always
open for the reception of any Novelty, a certain belief of a
ſtrange <hi>inſpiration,</hi> and <hi>Comiſſion</hi> then delivered unto him,
whereby (for ſooth) he not only pretends a Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Mankind, but aſſumes a power to paſs (upon the leaſt
contradiction of his wicked principles) a ſentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Condemnation, even upon the bleſſed Angels

            <p>To exact this neceſſary Credulity from his Gazing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,

double Gilded with Braſs, pretended alſo to have had
left him by <hi>Reeve</hi> a double portion, both of ſpirit,

no coming to know God or ſee God, but by the faith
in this commiſſion of the ſpirit, for I having the Keys
of Heaven and Hell, none can get into Heaven unleſs
