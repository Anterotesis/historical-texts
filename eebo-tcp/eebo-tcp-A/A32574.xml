            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by the Act made in Our late Parliament, held at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the
Twelfth year of Our Reign, Entituled, <hi>An Act for a perpetual Anniversary Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
on the Nine and twentieth day of May,</hi> reciting, That for as much as Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, the King of Kings, and sole disposer of all earthly Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
had by his all-swaying Providence and Power, miraculously demonstrated
in the view of all the World his transcendent Mercy, Love, and Graciousness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Us and all Our Loyal Subjects of this Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Dominions thereunto annexed, by Our most wonderful, glorious,
peaceable, and joyful Restauration to the actual possession and exercise of Our
undoubted Hereditary, Soveraign and Regal Authority over them (after sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
years forced Extermination into Foreign parts, by the most Trayterous Conspiracies and armed
Power of Usurping Tyrants, and execrable and perfideous Traytors) and that without the least op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or effusion of blood, thorow the Unanimous, Cordial, Loyal Uotes of the Lords and Commons
in the said Parliament Assembled, and passionate desires of all other Our Subjects; which unexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
blessing (by Gods own most wonderful dispensation) was compleated on the Nine and twentieth
day of <hi>May</hi> last past, being the most memorable Birth-day not onely of Us, both as Man and Prince,
but likewise as an actual King, and of this and other Our Kingdoms, all in a great measure new-born
and raised from the dead, on this most joyfull day, wherein many thousands of the Nobility, Gentry,
<pb facs="tcp:58059:2"/>
Gentry, Citizens, and other Our Lieges of this Our Realm, conducted Us unto Our Royal Cities of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> with all possible expressions of their publick joy, and Loyal affections, in far
greater Triumph then any of Our most Uictorious Predecessors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> returned thither
from their Foreign Conquests, and both Our then Houses of Parliament, with all dutifull and joyful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of their Allegiance publickly received, and cordially congratulated Our most happy Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
and Investiture in Our Royal Throne at Our Palace at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> upon all which considerations,
that being the day which the Lord had made, and crowned with so many publick blessings, and signal
deliverances, both of Us and Our People, from all Our late most deplorable Confusions, Divisions,
Wars, Devastations and Oppressions: To the end it might be kept in perpetual remembrance in all
ages to come, and that We would with all Our Subjects of this Our Realm, and the Dominions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and Our Posterities after Us, might Annually celebrate the perpetual memory thereof, by sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
their unfeigned hearty publick thanks thereon to Almighty God, with one heart and voice in a most
devout and Christian maner, for all these publick benefits received and conferred on Us on that most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
day; It was therefore by Authority of the same Parliament Enacted, That all and singular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Gods Word and Sacraments, in every Church, Chappel, and other usual place of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and publick Prayer, which then were, or then after should be within this Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and
the respective Dominions thereof, and their Successors, should in all succéeding ages annually Celebrate
the said Twenty ninth day of <hi>May,</hi> by rendring their hearty publick Praises and Thanksgivings unto
Almighty God, for all the fore-mentioned extraordinary Mercies, Blessings and Deliverances received,
and mighty Acts done thereon, and declare the same to all the people there assembled, and the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then, and yet to come, that so they might for ever praise the Lord for the same, whose Name alone is
Excellent, and his Glory above the Earth and Heavens.</p>
            <p>And it was further Enacted, That all and every person and persons inhabiting within this Our
Kingdom, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, should upon the same day annually resort with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and devotion, to some usual Church, Chappel, or place where such publick Thanksgivings
and Praises to Gods most Divine Maiesty shall be rendred, and there orderly and devoutly abide during
the said publick Thanksgiving, Prayers, Preaching, singing of Psalms, and other Service of God
there to be used and ministred.</p>
            <p>And to the end that all persons might be put in minde of their duty thereon, and be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to discharge the same with that Piety and Devotion as becomes them, It was further Enacted,
That every Minister should give notice to his Parishoners publickly in the Church at Morning Prayer
the Lords day next before every such Twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> for the due observation of the same day, and
should then likewise publickly and distinctly read the same Act to the people, as by the same Act may
more at lage appear. We being most sensible of the great and wonderful mercies and deliverances vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
by Almighty God, mentioned in the said Act, and holding Our Self highly obliged, and being
most willing that the just tribute of praise and thanksgiving to Our great Soveraign, the King of
Heaven and Earth, be returned by Us and all Our People for the same, according to the intent of the
said Act, do straightly command and enjoyn all Our loving Subjects, of what degrée, quality, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever, solemnly and chearfully to conform themselves, and give obedience to the said Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:58059:3"/>
and to set apart and observe the Nine and twentieth day of this instant <hi>May,</hi> and so from time to
time every Nine and twentieth day of <hi>May</hi> in every year, as a day of publick Praise and Thanksgiving
to Almighty God for his said wonderful Mercies, Blessings, and Deliverances vouchsafed to Us and
Our People, as in the said Act is mentioned. And to that end We command all Archbishops, Bishops,
Parsons, Uicars, Ministers, and all other Ecclesiastical persons in their several Charges, according to
their several duties, to take care thereof, and to cause this Our Proclamation to be yearly read in all
Churches and Chappels the Lords day before the said day of publick Praise and Thanksgiving is to be
observed and celebrated as aforesaid. And We strictly command all persons whatsoever, for the better
observation of the said day, to abstain from all servile works and business on that day, and chearfully
and orderly to repair to the publick place of Gods Divine Worship, for the due performance of the Duties
of that day, according to the good intentions of the said Act.</p>
            <p>And We declare, That such persons as shall be faulty herein, shall be estéemed by Us, contemners and
infringers of Our Laws and Commands, and as prophane persons, shutting their eyes against such
evident manifestations of mercy and goodness vouchsafed by Almighty God to Us and to Our People.</p>
