            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu have here preſented to your view a
Little-great Book; Little, in reſpect of
its bulk; but Great in its Contents: Wherein
the ſad effects of a <hi>Triennial Rebellion</hi> are
epitomiz'd with candour and impartiality.
Herein whoever conſiders the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſlaine, the deſtruction of Houſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
the deſolation of Cities and Townes, the
increaſe of Widdowes and Orphanes, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determine, whether <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the white Angel or the black, whether <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova</hi>
or <hi>Abaddon,</hi> gave beginning to this
pretended Parliament: and whether hath had
the greater influence on their actions, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſpired by a fatall <hi>Genius)</hi> have plotted
to bring this late flouriſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kingdome to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine. In a word, if the repreſentment of
the crying guilt of bloud may worke any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
<pb facs="tcp:119430:3"/>
of conſcience in the Rebellious, or the
evidence of a good cauſe infuſe any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into His Majeſties loyall Subjects, it is
the utmoſt aime this labour looks to, and may
happily be a meanes of the continuance of this
Work, till ſuch time as <hi>Almighty God</hi> in his
goodneſſe ſhall pleaſe to ſet a period to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
by rewarding it with its due <hi>Guerdon;</hi>
by reſtoring <hi>Religion</hi> to its genuine purity,
freed from Sectaries and profaneneſſe; by re-eſtabliſhing
the <hi>King</hi> in his juſt rights and
prerogatives; by re-inforcing the known Laws
of the Land, freed from Fellow-Subjects Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Arbitration; and by re-eſtating the
Subject in his ancient Liberties, freed from
Rapine and Plunder. Which that wee may
quickly ſee, let it be the ſubject of every good
Chriſtians Prayer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the firſt, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſed all the men then
raiſed (being in number about 10000) to be committed to
Officers, and divided into Regiments, which men had
been raiſing ever ſince the 12 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1642. at which time
he was made Generall of the Rebels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 6. the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> having fruitleſſely
beſieged the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford</hi> in <hi>Sherburn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
for 4 dayes before, retreated to <hi>Yevell;</hi> the Noble
Marqueſſe ſallied after him, and with a ſmall number fell
on that great body of the Rebels, killed above 140 where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
9 Commanders, took divers priſoners and routed the
reſt; ſo as he marched away, and after divided his ſmall
Forces, going himſelf into <hi>Wales,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> (now Lord)
<hi>Hopton</hi> into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> of both which there followed ſo
good an effect.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> 23. Prince RVPERT with about 11 Troops

(a <hi>Scot)</hi> and diverſe other Captaines and Officers
ſlaine and drowned, Captaine <hi>Wingate</hi> a Member of
the Houſe of Commons, with four Coronets taken, and two
more torne in pieces. This body of the Rebels was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be the flower of their Cavalrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 23 was that ſignall great battell fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Keynton</hi> and <hi>Edge-hill</hi> by his Majeſties Army, and
that of the Rebels led by the Earle of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> wherein the
Rebels loſt above 70 Colours of Coronets and Enſignes,
and his Majeſty but onely 16 Enſignes and not one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet.
The exact number that were ſlaine on both ſides
<pb facs="tcp:119430:4"/>
in this Battaile is not knowne: But it is certaine that the
Rebels loſt above three for one. Men of eminence of his
Majeſties Forces, who were ſlaine in the battaile were,
the two Noble and valiant Lords, <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi>
Lord High Chamberlaine of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Lord
D. <hi>Aubigney</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and <hi>Lenox,</hi>
Sir <hi>Edmund Verney,</hi> Knight Marſhall to His Majeſty,
with ſome other worthy Gentlemen, and Souldiers, but
beſides theſe three named here was not one Noble-man
or Knight killed, which was an extraordinary mercy of
Almighty God, conſidering what a glorious ſight of
Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Viſcounts, Barons,
Knights and Gentlemen of all Orders, were not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
but engaged themſelves againſt the Rebels as much
or more then Common Souldiers, which they moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
did by example of his ſacred MAJESTY, whoſe
Royall undaunted Courage put life into every man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
His Sacred Perſon to ſo much danger as all good
men doe tremble to remember; His Royall Sonnes (the
two young Princes) CHARLES Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and
JAMES Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> being alſo in the field in very
much danger, if God whoſe cauſe it was) had not covered
their heads in the day of battaile. The Rebels as they
had few men of quality to loſe, ſo thoſe they had, were
ſenſible of their guilt, which then they expreſſed by their
flight, ſome ſculking into holes and Saw-pits, and others
running out before they were well in the field. They loſt
of note the Lord Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of
<hi>Bulling brooke,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Eſſex,</hi> with many inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 27 His Majeſty to compleat his victory in
<hi>Keynton</hi> field, drew his whole Army before <hi>Banbury;</hi> but
after the firing of one peece of Ordnance, the Rebels
ſubmitted to His Majeſties mercy (which were in number
about 800 foot (of the Earle of <hi>Peterboroughs,</hi> and Lord
<hi>Says</hi> Regiments) with 10 Colours, and a Troop of Horſe)
<pb facs="tcp:119430:5"/>
and yeelded the Town and Caſtle to the King: at which
time the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> with his ſhattered Force, were crept
over the river <hi>Aven</hi> into <hi>Warwick</hi> (full 8 miles backward
from the place where they were beaten) there to ſecure
thoſe few he had left under the protection of the ſtrong
ſcituate Towne and Caſtle, leaving behind him above 20
waggons loaded with powder and other Ammunition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 12 His Majeſty after 48 houres fight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Towne of <hi>Brainford,</hi> where Lievtenant Colonell
<hi>Quarles</hi> that commanded in chiefe was ſlaine, and at leaſt
400 more of the Rebels killed and drowned, as many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
priſoners, with little loſſe to his Majeſties part, theſe
thus taken and killed, were obſerved to be the beſt foot
ſouldiers the Rebels had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 13 (being Sunday) certain of the Rebels
had come downe the Thames from <hi>Kingſton,</hi> with 13 pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ordnance, which (ſo ſoone as they could ſee) they
fired againſt <hi>Sion</hi> houſe, and His Majeſties Traine of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery;
but did little or no harme. Whereupon Order was
preſently given for drawing downe ſome Peeces into the
Meadow and to the River ſide againſt them; which was
accordingly done: and likewiſe a Demy-Canon planted
neare the South-end of the Towne. All which were ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
plyed, that they ſhot through their Boates and
Barges, and at laſt fired the Powder in one of them, which
blew up divers of the Rebels: Thoſe Rebels which eſcaped
took them to their heeles, leaving behind them their
mangled Boats and Barges, with all their Ordnance, and
the remainder of their Ammunition, on which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
preſently ſeized, and afterwards made an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſafe retreat to the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

to <hi>Ieſus the authour and finiſher of my Faith,</hi> Hee beſt
knowes: I am now come to the end of my <hi>Race,</hi> and here
I find the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> a death <hi>of ſhame;</hi> but <hi>the ſhame</hi> muſt bee

towards the red Sea, and my feet are now upon the very

which he led his people:</hi> But before they came to it, Hee

the <hi>three children</hi> from the Furnace, and (I moſt humbly
thank my Saviour for it) my Reſolution is now, as theirs
was then; They <hi>would not worſhip the image the King had
ſet up,</hi> nor will I the imaginations which the people are
ſetting up; nor will I forſake the <hi>Temple and the truth
of God,</hi> to follow the bleating of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calfe in <hi>Dan</hi>
and in <hi>Bethell.</hi> And as <hi>for this people,</hi> they are at this day
miſerably miſſed, (God of his mercy open their Eyes that
they may ſee the right way) for at this day <hi>the blind lead
the blind,</hi> and if they goe on, <hi>both will certainly fall into
the ditch.</hi> For my ſelfe, I am (and acknowledge it in all
humility) a moſt grievous ſinner many wayes, by thought,
word, and deed, and I cannot doubt, but that God hath
mercy in ſtore for me (a poore penitent) as well as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinners, I have now upon this ſad occaſion, ranſacked
every corner of my Heart, and yet (I thank God) I have
not found (among the many) any one ſin which deſerves
death by any knowne Law of this Kingdome; And yet
hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges; for if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon proofe (by valuable witneſſes) I or any other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>naocent, may be juſtly condemned; And (I thank God)
though the weight of the ſentence lye heavie upon me, I am
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s quiet within, as ever I was in my life. And though I
am not only the firſt Arch-Biſhop, but the firſt man that
ever dyed by an <hi>Ordinance of Parliament,</hi> yet ſome of my
<pb facs="tcp:119430:18"/>
Predeceſſours have gone this way, though not by this
meanes; For <hi>Elphegus</hi> was hurried away and loſt his head
by the <hi>Danes;</hi> and <hi>Symon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi>
and his fellowes; Before theſe, Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had his
head danced off by a lewd woman; and Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſubmitted his head to a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſword. Many Examples (great and good) and they
teach me patience; for I hope my Cauſe in Heaven will
look of another dye, then the colour that is put upon it
here. And ſome comfort it is to me, not only that I goe
the way of theſe greatmen in their ſeverall generations,
but alſo that my Charge (as foul as tis made) looks like that
of the <hi>Jewes</hi> againſt Saint <hi>Paul, (Acts</hi> 25. 3.) For hee
was accuſed for the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Temple, i. e. Religion;</hi>
And like that of Saint <hi>Steven (Acts</hi> 6. 14.) for breaking
the <hi>Ordinances which Moſes gave, i. e.</hi> Law and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>the holy place and the Temple (verſ.</hi> 13.) But you will
ſay, doe I then compare my ſelfe with the integrity of
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Steven?</hi> No, far be that from me; I onely
raiſe a comfort to my ſelfe, that theſe great Saints and
ſervants of God were laid at in their times, as I am now.
And it is memorable, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who helped on this
Accuſation againſt Saint <hi>Steven,</hi> did after fall under the
very ſame himſelfe. Yea, but here is agreat clamour that
I would have brought in Popery; I ſhall anſwer that more
fully by and by; In the meane time you know what the
Phariſees ſaid againſt Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>If we let him alone,
all men will beleive in him,</hi> Et venient Romani, <hi>and the
Romans will come, and take away both our place and the
Nation.</hi> Here was a cauſeleſſe Cry againſt Chriſt that
<hi>the Romans will come;</hi> And ſee how juſt the judgement
of God was; they crucified Chriſt for feare leſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
ſhould come, and his death was it which brought
in the <hi>Romans</hi> upon them, God puniſhing them with that
which they moſt feared: and I pray God this clamour
of <hi>Venient Romani</hi> (of which I have given no cauſe) help
<pb facs="tcp:119430:18"/>
not to bring them in; for the Pope never had ſuch a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
in <hi>England</hi> ſince the Reformation, as hee hath now
upon the Sects and Diviſions that are amongſt us. In the
meane time, <hi>by Honour and diſhonour, by good report and
evill report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I paſſing
through this world, 2 Cor. 6. 8.—Some particulars alſo
I think it not amiſſe to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>And firſt, this I ſhall be bold to ſpeak of the King our
gracious Soveraigne; He hath been much traduced alſo
for bringing in of Popery; but on my Conſcience (of
which I ſhall give God a very preſent accompt) I know
Him to bee as free from this charge, as any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and I hold Him to be as ſound a Proteſtant (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed) as any man in
this Kingdome; And that he will venture His Life as far,
and as freely for it; and I think I doe, or ſhould know,
both His affection to Religion, and His grounds for it,
as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond particular is concerning this great and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
City, (which God bleſſe) Here hath been of late,
a faſhion taken up, to gather hands, and then goe to the
Great Court of this Kingdome, (the Parliament) and
clamour for Juſtice, as if that great and wiſe Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom the Cauſes come, (which are unknowne to
the many) could not, or would not doe Juſtice, but at
their appointment. Away, which may endanger many an
<hi>Innocent</hi> man, and pluck his blood upon their own heads,
and perhaps upon the Cities alſo: And this hath been
lately practiſed againſt my ſelfe; The Magiſtrates ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtil, and ſuffering them openly to proceed from pariſh
to pariſh without check; God forgive the ſetters of this
(with all my heart I begge it) but many well meaning
people are caught by it. In Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> caſe, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe would ſerve, <hi>they ſtirred up the people againſt
him;</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> went the ſame way, when hee had killed
Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> yet he would not venture upon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:119430:19"/>
till he found how the other <hi>pleaſed the people.</hi> But take
heed of having your <hi>hands full of blood,</hi> for there is a
time (beſt knowne to himſelfe) when God (above other
ſinnes) <hi>makes Inquiſition for blood,</hi> and when that Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition
is on foot, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
(but that is not all) <hi>He remembers and forgets not
the complaint of the poore,</hi> that is, whoſe bloud is ſhed by
oppreſſion, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. take heed of this, <hi>It is a fearfull thing
to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> but then eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<hi>when he is making Inquiſition for blood;</hi> And (with
my prayers to avert it) I doe heartily deſire this City to
remember the Propheſie that is expreſſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 14. 15.
<hi>As for me, behold</hi> I <hi>am in your hand: doe with me as
ſeemeth good and meet unto you. But know yee for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that if ye put me to death, ye ſhall ſurely bring inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood upon your ſelves, and upon this City, and upon
the Inhabitants thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third particular is the poore Church of <hi>England.</hi>
It hath flouriſhed and been a ſhelter to other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Churches, when ſtormes have driven upon them.
But, alas, now it is in a ſtorme it ſelfe, and God onely
knowes whether, or how it ſhall get out; and (which is
worſe then a ſtorm from without) it is become like an Oak
cleft to ſhivers with wedges made out of its own body, and
at every cleft prophaneneſſe and Irreligion is entring in,
while as <hi>Proſper</hi> ſpeakes (in his ſecond Book <hi>De vitae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu
cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Men that introduce prophaneſſe are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
over with the name</hi> Religionis Imaginariae, <hi>of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Religion;</hi> for we have loſt the Subſtance and dwell
too much in Opinion, and that Church which all the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
machinations could not ruine, is fallen into danger by
her owne.</p>
               <p>The laſt particular (for I am not willing to bee too
long) is my ſelfe; I was born and baptized in the boſome
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; in that
profeſſion I have ever ſince lived, and in that I come
<pb facs="tcp:119430:19"/>
now to dye; This is no time to diſſemble with God, leaſt
of all in matter of Religion; and therefore I deſire it may
be remembred, I have alwayes lived in the Proteſtant
Religion, eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> and in that I now come
to dye. What clamours and ſlanders I have endured for
labouring to keep an Uniſormity in the externall ſervice
of God, according to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of this
Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt.</p>
               <p>Now at laſt I am accuſed of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
a crime which my ſoule ever abhorred; this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was charged to conſiſt of theſe two parts, <hi>An endeavour
to ſubvert the Lawes of the Land,</hi> and a like <hi>Endeavour
to overthrow the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by
Law.</hi> Beſides my Anſwers to the ſeverall Charges, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
my innocency in both Houſes. <hi>It was ſaid, Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
proteſtations at the Barre muſt not be taken.</hi> I can
bring no witneſſe of my heart and the intentions thereof;
therefore I muſt come to my Proteſtation, not at the Bar,
but my Proteſtation at this houre and inſtant of my death;
in which I hope all men will be ſuch charitable Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as not to think I would dye and diſſemble, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to give God an accompt for the truth of it: I doe
therefore here in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
take it upon my death, That I never endeavoured the
ſubverſion either of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> and I deſire you all
to remember this Proteſt of mine concerning mine inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
in theſe, and from all Treaſons whatſoever. I have
been accuſed likewiſe as an enemy to Parliaments: No, I
underſtand them and the benefit that comes by them too
well to be ſo; But I did miſlike the miſgovernments of
ſome Parliaments many wayes, and I had good reaſon for
it; for <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima,</hi> there is no corruption
in the world ſo bad, as that which is of the beſt thing in it
ſelfe; for the beeter the thing is in nature, the worſe it is,
corrupted. And that being the higheſt Court, over which
no other hath juriſdiction, when tis miſ-informed or miſ-governed,
<pb facs="tcp:119430:20"/>
the Subject is left without all remedy. But I
have done, I forgive all the world, all and every of thoſe
bitter Enemies which have perſecuted me, and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be forgiven of God firſt, and then of every man,
whether I have offended him or not, if he do but conceive
that I have. Lord doe thou forgive me, and I beg forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of him, And ſo I heartily deſire you to joyne in
Prayer with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Eternall God and mercifull Father, look down upon
me in mercy, in the riches and fulnes of all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
look upon me; but not till thou haſt nailed my
ſins to the Croſſe of Chriſt, not till thou haſt bathed me in
the bloud of Chriſt, not till I have hid my ſelf in the wounds
of Chriſt: that ſo the puniſhment due unto my ſinnes may
paſſe over me. And ſince thou art pleaſed to try me to the
uttermoſt, I humbly beſeech thee give me now in this great
inſtant, full patience, proportionable comfort, and a heart
ready to dye for thy honour, the King's happineſſe, and this
Churches preſervation. And my zeale to theſe (far from
Arrogancy be it ſpoken) is all the ſinne (humane frailties
excepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all incidents thereto) which is yet known to
me in this particular, for which <hi>I</hi> now come to ſuffer; I
ſay in this particular of Treaſon; but otherwiſe my ſins
are many and great: Lord pardon them all, and thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
(what ever they are) which have drawn down this
preſent judgement upon me: and when thou haſt given me
ſtrength to beare it, doe with me as ſeems beſt in thine
owne eyes: and carry me through death that I may look
upon it in what viſage ſoever it ſhall appear to me, <hi>Amen.</hi>
And that there may be a ſtop of this iſſue of bloud, in this
more then miſerable Kingdome, <hi>(I ſhall deſire that I may
pray for the people too, as well as for my ſelfe)</hi> O Lord,
I beſeech thee, give grace of repentance to all Bloud-thirſty
people; but if they will not repent, O Lord confound all
their devices, defeat and fruſtrate all their deſignes and
<pb facs="tcp:119430:20"/>
endeavours upon them, which are or ſhall be contrary to the
Glory of thy great Name, the truth and ſincerity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the eſtabliſhment of the King and his poſterity after
him in their juſt rights and Priviledges, the honour and
conſervation of Parliaments in their juſt power, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this poore Church in her truth, peace, and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the ſettlement of this diſtracted and diſtreſſed
People under their ancient Lawes, and in their native Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
And when thou haſt done all this in meere mercy
for them, O Lord, fill their hearts with thankefulneſſe, and
with religious dutifull obedience to thee and thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
all their dayes: So <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord Jeſus <hi>Amen,</hi> and
receive my Soule into thy Boſome <hi>Amen. Our Father
which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi>

of the Members at Weſtminſter. In the hiſtory of which
execution recorded in many of their owne Pamphlets writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
then and upon that ſubject, the Reader may obſerve
two Queſtions asked by Maſter <hi>Gibbs,</hi> one of the Sheriffes
of <hi>London,</hi> and anſwered by that Lord the very inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death; The firſt was, Whether he knew of any
Commiſſion the King had granted to the Iriſh Rebels, for
the commotion they had raiſed in their countrey? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>That he never knew nor heard of any.</hi> The ſecond
was, Whether there was not ſome agreement made by the
Iriſh Commiſſioners, before the Rebellion firſt brake out
with the Recuſants of England? he anſwered, <hi>That to his
knowledge, there was never an one in England, either
Catholique or Proteſtant, that knew of it, but one, and he
was an Iriſh-man, and a Proteſtant, and he came to the
knowledge of it but by chance, not as he was an actor in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which, and out of that delivered by the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> on the Scaffold immediately before
his death, the world may evidently ſee His Majeſty irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
cleared, by two acts of the Rebels owne cruelty,
from two of the moſt ſcandalous aſperſions, by which the
malice of theſe forging Rebels hath from time to time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make His ſacred Majeſty odious to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Salutem ex inimicis noſtris,</hi> may the King well ſay,
ſeeing his enemies actions turned to his juſtification, quite
contrary to their intendments. The firſt was <hi>an imagined
inclination in His Majeſty to Popery;</hi> The ſecond, <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
commiſſionating of the Iriſh Rebellion.</hi> In the firſt, the
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> In this, the Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> both at
their very dying houres, have rendred His Majeſty as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
as the Rebels intended him odious. I ſay inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
becauſe we know the worſt of Rebels cannot but
<pb facs="tcp:119430:23"/>
credit thoſe perſons eſpecially teſtifying at ſuch time
when they were immediately after to give an account of
all their actions to the knower of all hearts. Nor can any
one beleeve, but the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who
was daily converſant with His Majeſty in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
muſt needs know the very depth of his heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
And the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> (who was privy to the firſt
motion of the Iriſh Rebellion) muſt likewiſe of neceſſity
have knowne of the Kings Commiſſion, if any ſuch thing
had been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. The Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> was broken up, though
His Majeſty ſent a particular meſſage, and his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
did earneſtly deſire that the ſame might be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.
In this Treaty His Majeſties Commiſſioners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
much, but thoſe of Weſtminſter would abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the rigour of their firſt unheard-of Propoſitions,
which was the cauſe the Treaty took no better effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. The Towne of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was (by treachery
in the night) delivered to Col. <hi>Mitton</hi> the rebellious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>VVem.</hi> Here you may ſee the Rebels maſter-piece,
in hatching this treacherous plot in the time of
Treaty, wherein they uſed the name of Peace, onely as a
maſque for their deſignes, but intended nothing leſſe. In
this Towne the Rebels did moſt barbarouſly execute 13. of
His Majeſties ſouldiers, which his Highneſſe Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
did ſoone after juſtly requite, <hi>(lege talionis)</hi> by hanging
up a like number of theirs, which he had taken without
Quarter given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> routed a great Body
of Rebels conſiſting of at leaſt 1200 Horſe and Dragoons,
commanded by Col: <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> a Scot, neere <hi>Melton Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
in <hi>Leiceſt.</hi> ſhire, killed above 30 of them, took 46 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
with 4 Colours of horſe, with the loſſe of Sir <hi>John
Girlington</hi> a gallant Knight, Capt. <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
6 or 7 common Souldiers on his Majeſties part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. Colonel <hi>Roger Molineux</hi> with a party of Horſe
<pb facs="tcp:119430:23"/>
from <hi>Newarke</hi> took the Rebels Committee at <hi>Wirksworth</hi>
in <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> where they were gathering contribution,
<hi>viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Wigfall,</hi> (Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> ſonne in law) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Edward Charleton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Buxton,</hi> Major <hi>Molins,</hi>
Captaine <hi>Harſtaffe,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Boteler,</hi> about 70 Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Dragooners, with all their Horſe and Armes,
and 400. l. in money. In this action ſome of the Rebels
were killed, whereof Maſter <hi>Sellors,</hi> a buſie Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
was one, and on His Majeſties part onely one man
loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb</hi> 26. Sir <hi>William</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Compton</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the noble Earle of <hi>Northampton)</hi> with 300 horſe
routed 400 of the Rebels horſe of <hi>Northampton</hi> neere
<hi>Daventry</hi> in that County, killed 13, wounded many, took
36 priſoners, with 50 Horſe, and good ſtore of Armes.</p>
               <p>In the latter end of this month, a party of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Forces from <hi>Hereford</hi> took <hi>Caſtle-ditch,</hi> (a Garriſon
of the Rebels on the borders of that County) and in it
Colonel <hi>Hopton</hi> the Governour, (ſonne to Sir <hi>Richard
Hopton)</hi> his Under-officers, above 60 Foot Souldiers, with
their armes and proviſions, and ſome horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March 1. Pontfract</hi> Caſtle (that had been long beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
not without much loſſe to the Rebels, by frequent ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes
made by the Defendants and otherwiſe) was relieved
by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> who there utterly defeated
the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> whole Army, killed 300 on the place,
beſides many drowned, took above 700 Priſoners, whereof
44 Officers, 22 Colours of Foot, being all the Rebels
had, and 26 Standards of Horſe, with 34 double barrels
of Powder, and a proportionable quantity of March and
Bullet, and 2500 Foot Armes, beſides Horſe Armes, and
other ſpoile. In this action were ſlain many of the Rebels
chiefe Officers, as Colonel <hi>Armyn,</hi> Col: <hi>Thornton,</hi> Col:
<hi>Malevery,</hi> with others; On His Majeſties part no Officer
ſlaine, and but very few common Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:119430:24"/>
                  <hi>March</hi> 6. Sir <hi>Charles Compton</hi> with his Regiment of
horſe took 72 Pack-horſes at <hi>Hawford</hi> on the borders of
<hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> being richly laden with the rebels wealth of
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and intended for <hi>London;</hi> with theſe Sir <hi>Charls</hi>
alſo took their Convoy of at leaſt 100 Horſe, and neere
70 Priſoners, with a Lieutenant, 1 Cornet and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
having firſt killed 12 Rebels on the place, without
loſſe of any one man, and but one hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 7. Major <hi>Abercromy</hi> a rebellious Scot was ſlain
neere <hi>Stratton Audley</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and 17 of his
men taken by a party from his Majeſties Garriſon of
<hi>Borſtall</hi> houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 14. Colonel <hi>Long</hi> the High Sheriffe of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>
with his owne Regiment of horſe onely, gallantly charged
a great body of <hi>Wallers</hi> horſe neere the <hi>Devizes,</hi> and did
good execution on them; but being much over-powered
by the Rebels numbers, was at length taken Priſoner with
ſome part of his Regiment; which was within few dayes
after ſufficiently requited by the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> who took
above 700 of <hi>Wallers</hi> horſe in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 15. A party of his Majeſties horſe from <hi>Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract</hi>
Caſtle fel on Colonel <hi>Brandlings</hi> Quarters at <hi>Badſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
foure miles from <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> took 67 rebels Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
whereof 13 Officers, 130 Horſe, and 1000. l. in
money.</p>
               <p>

<hi>Lidcote</hi> was one, and hurt many more, took 26 Priſoners,

                  <pb facs="tcp:119430:24"/>
was opportunely releeved by Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> approach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 24. The Lower Members at Weſtminſter Vote
the clauſe <hi>for preſervation of His Majeſties Perſon,</hi> to be
left out in Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his Commiſſion. Thus doe
the Rebels
<list>
                     <item>1. Sweare to live and dye with their owne General
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> yet upon ſecond thoughts they diſoblige
themſelves from that Oath, and caſheire him of
his command.</item>
                     <item>2. Covenant to preſerve His Majeſties Perſon and
Authority, and yet afterwards authorize Sir <hi>Tho:
Fairfax</hi> to kill him if he can.</item>
                     <item>3. They vow to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion,
yet condemne and diſcountenance the eſſentiall
parts thereof, and introduce Irreligion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now tell me, Reader, what Tropologicall ſenſe can
ſave this jugling from flat and literall Perjury? not all
the addition of their Abrogative to their Legiſlative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
For this is indeed to abrogate Chriſtianity as wel as
Loyaltie out of the world: To give leave to kill the Kings
Perſon in the field, and yet to cheat men into a conceipt
of preſerving His Majeſty in <hi>VVilliam Lenthalls</hi> chaire:
To make the world beleeve they are Proteſtants, when
they permit and authorize an illiterate Aſſembly of Non-Divines
to diſcountenance the 39 Articles, diſpute about
expunging the fift Article of the Apoſtles Creed: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquate
the Lords Prayer out of the Church Service, and
turne out the long-ſetled Service of Common-Prayer out
of the Church, to give way to a long-winded extemporary
non-ſenſe in the roome thereof.</p>
               <q>O tempora! O mores!</q>
               <p>Are not theſe ſine Law-makers, who violate the Lawes of
<pb facs="tcp:119430:25"/>
God and holy Church, as well as thoſe themſelves were
borne unto, to make way for their owne <hi>Chymeraes?</hi>
Would not any true Zelot pawne his ſoule upon theſe
mens conſciences, who make no conſcience of breaking
their owne oathes? Would not any wiſe man melt his
Fortunes to maintain theſe mens Cauſe, who have no cauſe
for what they doe? Yes, he that could be made to beleeve
Perjury were Fidelity; Treaſon, Loyalty; Blaſphemy,
Sanctity; Atheiſme, Religion; the Speakers Cuſhion,
the Kings Majeſty; may likewiſe poſſibly beleeve that
theſe Rebels intend the Churches, Kings, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
good.</p>

the rebels of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> at <hi>Cover</hi> on the borders of

            <p>The other in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> 1643. about which
time Colonel (now Lord) <hi>Jermyn</hi> with thoſe Forces that

<hi>Haſtings,</hi> now Lo: <hi>Lowghborough,</hi> took <hi>Burton upon Trent</hi>
