         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which I now injoy, &amp; have done these twenty five yeares. I had ever a desire to improve my knowledge not, only by traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ordinarie rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but by a more exact inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Petere fontes potius quàm ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulos,</hi> to looke into the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and originall grounds of those lawes wherewith I was to deale.</p>
                  <p>My first incouragement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I received by versing in a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worke compiled and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>Anno,</hi> 1609. by Master Iohn <hi>Skeny</hi> a great <hi>Senator</hi> and privy Counsellor in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to our late blessed Soveraigne of famous memory KING <hi>Iames,</hi> intituled <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> &amp;c. with his marginall annotations touching the Concordance of the divine law, the lawes of this
<pb facs="tcp:15432:12"/>
land, and the latter Parliamentary lawes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred an occasion unto me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow some stolne houres (amidst many distracting businesses) in the studie of our <hi>Brittish, Saxon,</hi> and English histories, wherein I observe, notwithstanding the many and often permutations of State and government in the time of the heptarchie, as also before, and after, a constant observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fundamentall rules of our Nationall lawes in <hi>Tanto,</hi> though not in <hi>Toto,</hi> and I tooke no meane felicity therein, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wishing, that they were not so much neglected and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as they are by many, who are more conversant in <hi>Turkish</hi> and other forraigne histories, than in our owne, <hi>in sua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica hospites, in aliena Gives</hi>

                     <hi>Aliens</hi> at home and Citizens abroad.</p>
                  <p>From the studie of those lawes I learned that the bodie of the common weale subsisteth by an ancient monarchicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the KING is <hi>Vicarius Dei</hi> and <hi>Caput reipubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi> GODS <hi>Vicegerent</hi> and the head of the Common-wealth. The members which make up the structure of our Republike are the LORDS spirituall and temporall, and the commons: the common-wealth hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in every mans actions, <hi>In praemium</hi> or <hi>paenam,</hi> either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the good or to punish the bad actions of men, crimes of omission, or commission; <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rei-publicae ne quis re sua malè utatur,</hi> It hath such a power over the actions and estates of men,
<pb facs="tcp:15432:13"/>
that no man must abuse or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy the talent of his minde, body, or meanes: And by the rules of contraries, Every man must well and rightly, order, and imploy them for the aid, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the head, and of that great body. Master <hi>Crompton</hi> in the dedication of his learned <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narcha,</hi> rendereth this motive; for the publication of that book. For that (saith hee) the body of the Common-wealth doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of divers parts, and every member ought to indevour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe according to his calling, for the maintenance thereof; I have studied how I might put my poore talent into the treasury; for the more safe conservation of that body. The same reason rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up some courage in me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise that work which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="tcp:15432:14"/>
in the precedent nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
                  <p>I had no sooner finished and devoted that to the view and examination of an honourable person eminently learned in the lawes, but my meditations fell amaine upon the lives, lawes and memorable actions of our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paire of peerelesse <hi>Princes,</hi> and especially of our Brittish <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> and afterwards perusing that most accurate and learned worke of Sir Henrie <hi>Wootton</hi> Provost of <hi>Eaton Colledge</hi> for the gratulation of his Majesties happy returne from <hi>Scotland.</hi> It bred a wonder in me, that two Subjects, the one noble, the other plebeian should at one and the same time, as neare as may be conjectured, concord for most things in their meditations, upon
<pb facs="tcp:15432:14"/>
the noble acts and deeds of their most glorious Soveraigne.</p>
                  <p>It seemes to me a strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevent the sinister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and criticke opinions of those who will bee too censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon my publishing of this worke: and amongst them some of my owne calling, who never had their breeding in any Innes of Court or Chauncery, such I must passe by with the <hi>Poet,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Alfred</hi> was, so is he the yonger sonne of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all King; and though not anointed King in his younger yeares, yet then by eternall providence designed to his kingdomes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15432:62"/>
His education, and studious desire of learning, his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse piety even in his tender age inferiour to none; his frequent accesse to our great provincial Councels, his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous observations there, and in the greatest Courts of Iustice, did promise of him what now he is: after the death of his most deare brother of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the burthen of our so great expectation, as his hopefull succession lay wholly on him, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he seemed not so agill and valid as his brother, yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15432:63"/>
his care of our welfare (which breathed by the breath of him) did raise up such vigor and spirit in him, that his ability and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in body, and his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble skil and facility, in eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall and other corporall exercises, did grow up and increase together.</p>
                  <p>He journied not to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Spaine</hi> he did, whence (to say no more his thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py return, entertained with such wonderfull acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ineffable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy and gladnesse (as this kingdome never knew

the like before) did quicken and reviue the life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of many sad distressed soules.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, when by our <hi>Salomon</hi> his resignation in fulnesse of time, of both life and Crowne <hi>Sol occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit,</hi> by his gracious succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>nox nulla sequuta est;</hi> for (as a great Primate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)<note place="margin">Epise.

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:15432:65"/>
in an uniformity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, in like manner publikely edicted follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay, (as if both in one divine conception) issued forth with this great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Hee was not, as <hi>Alfred,</hi> forced into the field in the very infancy of his raigne; nor into any such angusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and distressed recessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet for perlustration of his Armies, and the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his military affaires, he forced himselfe, not in a progresse of ease, but by an expeditious toilesome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15432:65"/>
to the remotest and most navigable harbour of his Westerne Region, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himselfe thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no meane dangers.</p>
                  <p>By the space of those few yeares wherein his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of defensive warre, were against two of the most potent and mightiest Christian Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> he put not his confidence in his Princes, nor in his men of warre either by Sea or Land, nor in the childe of man; he put not his trust in his bow, neither was it his sword that shold help him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15432:66"/>
nor did hee trust in his Chariots, nor his Horse, nor in his great Navies of Ships, nor in any Engines of war, nor his warlike provision (of all which his copious supply and store exceeded former times) but in God his strength, and his Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. After the sudden and miraculous deliverance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pestilence, looke upon no lesse and in as little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time, his forme of prayer prescribed, in the yeare 1626, necessary to bee<note place="margin">An. 1626</note> used in those dangerous times, for the safety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15432:66"/>
of his Majesty and his Realme: the like not long after with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fast for the preservation of his Majestie, his Realmes and all reformed Churches: God heard him, the Lord of Hostes was with us; the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> was our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, he made warres to cease, hee broke the bow and knapped the speare in sunder.</p>
                  <p>He blessed our <hi>Alf.</hi> and those two great neighbour Princes with a gratious is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of truce and peace: at unity they are, and their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15432:67"/>
Kingdomes in publike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, commerce, and affaires of State, and God grant they long may be: and (might they stand with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence) in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Church, aswell as our Common wealth.</p>
                  <p>By this you see, that upon all occasions, God is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and strength, a very present helpe in trouble: the best armour of a Christian Prince is prayer and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the strength and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes whereof, doe consist in the uniformity of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conformity of the
