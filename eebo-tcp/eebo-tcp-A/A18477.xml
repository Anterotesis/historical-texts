            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Tuesday the 18.
of March, being the
second day after his
Highnesse entrance
into the Palace, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Ambassadors
and Graundes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> desired leaue
of the <hi>Prince</hi> to come and kisse his
hands. And that day the Duke of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantado,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Cea,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> came
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8190:3"/>
accompanied with diuers Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Caualleros of their owne
Families, to see him, and to offer him
their seruice; after dinner the <hi>Prince</hi>
went abroad, and ranne some cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at the Ring.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday the 19. the King
being accompanied with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and the <hi>Infante Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,</hi>
came to visit the <hi>Prince</hi> in his
lodgings, from whence they all
went into the Kings quarter, where
hee was entertained with musicke,
and saw many rare and curious pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>The next morning being Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
the <hi>King</hi> came againe into his
<hi>Highnesse</hi> lodging, and conducted
him by a priuate way to his Coach,
with whom entred <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> the
<hi>Infante Cardinall,</hi> the Lord Marquesse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8190:3"/>
               <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Oliuares,</hi> the
Marquesse of <hi>Carpio,</hi> and the Earle of
<hi>Bristol:</hi> they went about foure leagues
from the towne to hunt the Wolfe,
where they found many hundreds
of the country people driuing the
mountaines, who brought neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the seuerall standings of the <hi>King</hi>
and the <hi>Prince,</hi> where they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with their Peeces, some Wolues;
but they had not the fortune to kill
any. That day his <hi>Maiesty</hi> and his
<hi>Highnesse</hi> dined abroad in the fields
vpon the ground, and spent the rest
of the day with shooting in their
peeces.</p>
            <p>Fryday the one and twentieth of
March, being the day whereon the
late King of <hi>Spaine</hi> died, was spent
by the <hi>King</hi> and those of his Court,
in deuotion and in performance of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8190:4"/>
such Ceremonies as are vsually eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeere done by them there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Obsequies.</p>
            <p>The next day the Cardinall <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and diuers others, Ambassadors
and Graundes came to kisse the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
hands in the morning. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>King</hi> accompanied with his
Brothers, and the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Oliuares,</hi>
came into the <hi>Princes</hi> quarter to visit
him, with whom hee went downe
into the Gardens, from whence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Coach, they passed into the
fields to see some flights of the Earle
of <hi>Bristolls</hi> high flying Hawkes: And
afterwards they ran sundry courses
at the Ring that day.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 23. of March, the
<hi>Prince</hi> remained priuate in his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
till towards the euening, and
then hee walked into the Gardens.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8190:4"/>
The <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Monterey</hi> feasted the
Lord Marquesse of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the
Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter
Aston,</hi> at dinner that day, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Crystall vessels of great worth.
And towards night there arriued the
Earle of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> the Lord <hi>Viscount
Andouer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Montioy,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The next morning the <hi>Prince</hi> was
visited againe by the President of
<hi>Castile,</hi> and the Presidents of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Counsells, who came to let
him know, that since the time that
the <hi>King</hi> their Master had giuen
them charge to receiue and obey
all such Consultas and Commands
as shall come from his <hi>Highnesse,</hi>
there had beene a stay made of all
businesses in their Courts, for that
hitherto his <hi>Highnesse</hi> had not beene
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8190:5"/>
pleased to dispose of any thing; In
regard whereof they said they had
taken the boldnesse to put him in
minde thereof, and to beseech him
to beleeue, that the Order which
they had receiued from his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
was not complementall, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
desired and intended. And
therefore they humbly intreated the
<hi>Prince,</hi> that hee would vouchsafe to
giue some speedy order for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
of bufinesse, and the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such places as were then,
or should heereafter happen to bee
void. In the euening of the same
day, there was running at the Ring,
and at the <hi>Está Firmo;</hi> his <hi>Highnesse</hi>
breaking many staues very well,
and with great applause.</p>
            <p>The day following being Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
the <hi>King</hi> carried his <hi>Highnesse</hi>
abroad a hunting to the <hi>Pardo,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8190:5"/>
where they spent all the day, and
had no very good sport, yet they
saw many Stags and Boares: They
did eat together vpon the ground
in the open fields with very good
appetites.</p>
            <p>The six and twentieth, the <hi>Prince</hi>
spent in dispatching away a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from thence hither. On which
day there arriued at <hi>Madrid</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of <hi>Inojoça,</hi> who was gouernor
of <hi>Millan,</hi> and now Vice-King of
<hi>Nauarre,</hi> from which place hee
was sent for, to prepare himselfe
to goe into England, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
extraordinary to the King
our Soueraigne. The more to honor
him in this imployment, beside his
personall merit, hee was sworne a
Counsellor of State, he is to depart
within few daies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:8190:6"/>
Thursday the seuen and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
was the first day of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
held in the <hi>Kings</hi> Palace, at
which his <hi>Maiesty</hi> was present in
the morning. After dinner hee
came vnto his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> and tooke
him into his owne lodgings, where
they spent part of that afternoone
in conuersation, and in beholding
diuers Masters of defence, who
played at seuerall weapons before
them.</p>
            <p>The next day, after dinner, his
<hi>Highnesse</hi> passed away the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
in a Garden adioyning to
his lodgings: and about foure or
fiue of the clocke he was by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
of <hi>Oliuares</hi> conducted to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in the Palace, to see diuers
Fencers play; and from thence to
the Kings Armory, where (amongst
many others which were both rich
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8190:6"/>
and curious) hee saw the Armes of
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; and
of the French King, <hi>Francis</hi> the
first.</p>
            <p>The nine and twentieth of this
moneth was his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Birth-day,
which caused much brauery and
gallantery in the Court. In the
morning of this day, the <hi>Prince</hi>
sent the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi> vnto the
<hi>King,</hi> to giue him the <hi>En hora buena,</hi>
as also to the <hi>Queene</hi> and to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi>
to congratulate with them
(as is the custome of that Court)
that his <hi>Maiesty</hi> did on that day
<hi>cumplir An<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>os:</hi> The same day the
Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had
his first audience of the <hi>Infanta,</hi>
who receiued him and those that
went with him, with much curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
In the euening the <hi>King</hi> hauing
with him the <hi>Queene,</hi> the <hi>Infanta,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8190:7"/>
Don Carlos,</hi> and the <hi>Infante Cardinall,</hi>
attended on by the whole Court,
went in a solemne manner to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
a Monastery of the <hi>Descalsas,</hi>
wherein liueth the <hi>Infanta Doña
Margarita,</hi> Daughter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Maximilian,</hi> and great <hi>Aunt</hi> to
his <hi>Maiesty.</hi> His <hi>Highnesse</hi> to see
them went priuatly in a Coach,
and was conducted in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that at their going thither, and
returning, he saw them passe by in
foure seuerall places.</p>
            <p>The next day being Palme Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
his <hi>Maiestie</hi> and all the
Court passed through some parts
of the Palace, in a solemne and
publique procession, the which
the <hi>Prince</hi> likewise beheld from a
secret place. In the afternoone the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> met to see the
fencing againe, with which they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8190:7"/>
entertained themselues some time.
And this day his <hi>Highnesse</hi> gaue one
thousand pounds sterling, to bee
bestowed and distributed in the
Holy weeke in almes, vpon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
and other poore people of
<hi>Madrid,</hi> which was greatly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and hath done him much
honour with all sorts of people
there.</p>
            <p>On Munday the <hi>Genoa</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
with all the <hi>Hombres de
Negocios</hi> of that <hi>State,</hi> which
were in <hi>Madrid,</hi> came and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his <hi>Highnesse</hi> hands. The rest
of that day hee spent in reading
Spanish and in priuate.</p>
            <p>Vpon the second of Aprill,
the <hi>Prince</hi> hauing with him the
Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and
the rest of the English Nobility
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8190:8"/>
that are there, went towards the
<hi>Pardo</hi> to see the Earle of <hi>Bristols</hi>
Hawkes flie, where they met the
<hi>Kings</hi> Hawkes, which were made
especially for the Kite and the
Crowe: But the day prouing
windie and vnfit to hawke in, his
<hi>Highnesse</hi> went to hunt, at which
he had much good sport, and
killed two wilde Boares. In the
euening, as hee returned, hee was
met vpon the way by the <hi>Conde</hi>
of <hi>Oliuares,</hi> and the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey,</hi>
who waited on him to the
Palace.</p>
            <p>The next day being Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in the Holy weeke, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and solemne exercise of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
began, and the Procession,
and the disciplinants which euery
yeere doe vsually passe through
the streets, and likewise (as their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8190:8"/>
custome is) close by the Palace,
so that the <hi>Prince</hi> beheld them out
of his owne Chamber window.
That day his <hi>Highnesse</hi> stirred not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but about the euening hee
was visited by the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Oliuares</hi>
from his <hi>Maiesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Thursday his <hi>Highnesse</hi> went
priuatly and saw his <hi>Maiestie</hi> wash
the feet of the poore, and performe
other ceremonies vsually done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day. In the afternoone
there passed by his <hi>Highnesse</hi> win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
a greater Procession then had
done the day before.</p>
            <p>Good Friday was spent by that
<hi>King</hi> in hearing Sermons, and in
deuotion; and towards the euening
when the great Procession was to
passe by, the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Oliuares,</hi> the
<hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Monterey,</hi> and others of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8190:9"/>
Counsell of State, came to the
<hi>Prince</hi> his lodgings, and attended
him all the time it was passing
by, and afterwards his <hi>Highnesse</hi>
went downe to walke in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>Satterday the <hi>Prince</hi> spent all the
morning in priuate within his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and in the afternoone desiring
to giue his <hi>Maiesty</hi> the <hi>buenas Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuas,</hi>
as the vse is there, he could not
bee permitted: But towards the
euening his <hi>Maiesty</hi> accompanied
with his two brothers, came into
the <hi>Prince</hi> his lodgings, and gaue
him the <hi>buenas Pascuas,</hi> where
they sate and discoursed a good
while.</p>
            <p>The next day being Easter day,
the <hi>Prince</hi> hauing desired leaue to
repay the Visit and the <hi>buenas Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuas,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:8190:9"/>
was accordingly about foure
a clocke in the afternoone, brought
by a priuate way vnto the <hi>King,</hi>
with whom when hee had beene
a short space, and performed that
complement, he intimated a desire
to doe the like vnto the <hi>Queene,</hi>
and was presently conducted by
his <hi>Maiesty,</hi> being also priuately
attended by all the <hi>Grandes</hi> and
great Ministers of the Court, from
his owne side, vnto the <hi>Queenes,</hi>
which is on the other side of the
Palace, and there hee found the
<hi>Queene</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> together, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by all the Ladies of the
Court; This being the first time
that hee had personally visited the
<hi>Infanta.</hi> There were foure Chaires
set; in the two middlemost sate the
<hi>Queene</hi> and the <hi>Infanta;</hi> on the right
hand of the <hi>Queene</hi> sate the <hi>Prince,</hi>
and on the left hand of them all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8190:10"/>
sate the <hi>King.</hi> When the <hi>Prince</hi> had
giuen the <hi>Queene</hi> the <hi>buenas Pascuas,</hi>
and passed some other comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of gratitude, for the fauors
he had receiued from her since his
comming to the Court, he rose out
of his Chaire, and went towards
the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who likewise rose vp to
entertaine him; and after fitting
curtesies on both sides performed,
there passed some discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, such as was fit for the
enteruiew of two such <hi>Princes,</hi>
in which it pleased the <hi>Prince</hi>
to command the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi>
to doe him seruice as Interpreter.
The <hi>Prince</hi> then retired himselfe
to his Chaire, and sate downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the Queene, with whom
he performed some short comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Afterwards they all rose vp,
and with much courtesie tooke
their leaues: in all which things
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8190:10"/>
the <hi>Prince</hi> his comportment was so
naturall and sutable to his qualitie
and greatnesse, that he gaue thereby
iust cause to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> highly to
honor him, as it appeares they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
do. From the <hi>Queenes</hi> side he was
conducted by his <hi>Maiesty,</hi> in the
same Equipage that hee came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vnto the <hi>Kings</hi> side, where
when hee had entertained his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
a while, with beholding from a
Window certaine Masters and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
that exercised Fencing before
them, his <hi>Maiesty</hi> then led him to
another window that looked vpon
a large place before the Court gate,
and telling the <hi>Prince</hi> that he would
only goe and see the <hi>Queene,</hi> tooke
his Brother <hi>Don Carlos</hi> with him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the <hi>Infante Cardinall</hi> with the
<hi>Prince,</hi> to expect his returne. But
before much time was passed, there
appeared about threescore of the
principall Nobility of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8190:11"/>
in the place before the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
who were all very richly
apparrelled with Embroyderies,
and being on horsebacke ranne two

health, hauing beene continually
from time to time exceeding
much caressed and esteemed by

for his braue and Prince-like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments.</p>
