            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ſame hand, which was here lifted vp for ſupplication, is now lift vp in tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſgiuing; Ye that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accompanied me with your tears and ſighs, accompany me now, I beſeech you, (in this happy cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of note, and time) with your ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſmiles, and acclamations to the God that hath wrought it.</p>
            <p>It is not more natural for the ſun, when it looks vpon a moiſt, and well fermented earth, to cauſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors to aſcend thence, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is for greatnes, &amp; goodnes, when they both meet together vpon an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hart, to draw vp holy deſires of gratulation.

               <hi>Alleluiahs</hi>; yea, let me ſay, now that he ſings aboue in that bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of glorious ſpirits, his ditty cannot be better then this, that he ſung here vpon earth, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are about to beare our parts at this time: Prepare, I beſeech you, both your eares for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſong, and your harts and tongues for your owne. And firſt in this Angelicall ſtraine, your thoughts cannot but obſerue, without me, the <hi>Deſcant,</hi> and the <hi>Ground</hi>; The deſcant of Gratulation, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi>; wherin is both applauſe and excitation; an applauſe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gods goodnes, and an excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others to giue that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. The ground is a threefold reſpect. Of what God is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>God and Lord.</hi> Of what God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3822:4"/>
is, and doth to vs, <hi>which loadeth vs daily with benefits.</hi> Of what hee is both in himſelfe, and to vs; <hi>The God of our ſaluation;</hi> which laſt, (like to ſome rich ſtone) is ſet off with a darke foile, <hi>To God the Lord belong the iſſues from death.</hi> So in the firſt, for his owne ſake; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for our ſakes, in the third for his owne, and ours; as God, as Lord, as a Benefactor, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and deliuerer, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not hard to obſerue that <hi>Dauids Alleluiahs</hi> are more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his <hi>Hoſannaes</hi>; his thankes more then his ſuites. Oft-times doth he praiſe God when he begs nothing: Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome euer doth he begge that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, for which he doth not raiſe vp his ſoule to an anticipation of

thanks; neither is this any other then the vniuerſall vnder-ſong of all his heauenly ditties, <hi>Bleſſed bee the Lord; Prayſed</hi> (as our former tranſlation hath it) is too low; Honor is more then praiſe; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is more then honor; neither is it for nothing, that from this word (<hi>Barac</hi>) to bleſſe, is deriued <hi>Berec,</hi> the knee which is bowed in bleſſing; and the cryer before <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> proclaimed <hi>Abrech,</hi> calling for the honour of the knee from all beholders. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.43. Euery ſleight triuiall acknowledgement of worth is a praiſe; Bleſſing is in a higher ſtraine of gratitude, that caries the whole ſway of the hart with it, in a kinde of diuine rapture: praiſe is in matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, bleſſing, of deuotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3822:5"/>The Apoſtles rule is that the leſſe is bleſſed of the greater, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> of the King of <hi>Salem</hi>; the Prophets charge is, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be bleſſed of the leſſe; yea the greateſt of the leaſt, God of man: This agrees wel; Bleſſing is an act that will beare recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; God bleſſeth man, &amp; man bleſſeth God; God bleſſeth man imparatiuely, man bleſſeth God optatiuely; God bleſſeth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the acts of mercy; Man bleſſeth God in the notions, in the expreſſions of thanks. God bleſſes man whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he makes him good and happy; man bleſſeth God when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth how good, how gracious how glorious he is: So as the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is wholly taken vp in agniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in celebration; in the one we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3822:6"/>
acknowledg the bounty of <hi>God</hi> to vs; in the other we magnifie him, vocally, really, for that bounty.</p>
            <p>Oh ſee then what high account God makes of the affections and actions of his poore, ſilly, earth-creeping creatures; that hee giues vs in them power to bleſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; takes it as an honor to be bleſſed of vs: <hi>Dauid</hi> wonders that God ſhold ſo vouchſafe to bleſſe man, how much more muſt wee needs wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at the mercy of God that will vouchſafe to be bleſſed by man, a worme, an atome, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Yet, both S. <hi>Iames</hi> tels vs that <hi>with the tongue we bleſſe God</hi>; &amp; the Pſalmiſt cals for it here, as a ſeruice of deare acceptation; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi>; Euen we me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue not (<hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>-like) with the aire of thanks;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3822:6"/>
nor feed ere the fatter with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how much leſſe our maker? O God, we know wel that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer men or Angels do, or do not, thou canſt not but be infinitely bleſſed in thy ſelfe; before euer any creature was, thou didſt equally inioy thy bleſſed ſelfe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; What can this worthles looſe filme of fleſh either adde to, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from thine infinitneſſe? Yet, thou that humbleſt thy ſelfe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things that are done in heauen, &amp; earth, humbleſt thy ſelfe alſo, to accept the weake breath of our praiſes, that are ſent vp to thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth to heauen. How ſhould this incourage the vowes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors of our hearty thankfulnes, to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graciouſly taken? Would men take vp with good words,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3822:7"/>
with good deſires, &amp; quit our bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds for thanks, who wold be a debter? With the God of mercy this cheap paiment is currant; if he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor vs ſo far as to be bleſſed of vs, Oh let vs honor him ſo far as to bleſſe him; <hi>Quare verbis parca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuita ſunt:</hi> Why do we ſpare thanks that coſt vs nothing, as that wiſe Heathen; <hi>O giue vnto the Lord, yee mighty, giue vnto the Lord the praiſes due to his name, offer to God the ſacrifice of thankſgiuing</hi>: and ſtill let the foot of our ſong, be, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for the deſcant of gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d follows; His own ſake hath reaſon to be firſt; God will be bleſſed both as <hi>Iah,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donai</hi>; the one the ſtyle of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the other of his Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Euen the moſt accurſed <hi>Deiſt</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3822:7"/>
would confeſſe, that as a pure, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, infinit, abſolute being, God is to be bleſſed; for if being be good, &amp; theſe two be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uertible, nature muſt needs teach him, that an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute &amp; infinit being muſt needs be abſolutely and infinitly good: but what do I blur the glory of this day with mention of thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe Idol is nature, whoſe religion is ſecondary atheiſme, whoſe true region is the loweſt hell; theſe damned Ethnicks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, will not conceiue of God, as he is, becauſe they impiouſly ſeuer his eſſence from his inward relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; VVe Chrſtians can neuer be ſo heauenly affected to God, as we ought, till we can riſe to this pitch of piety, to bleſſe God for what he is in himſelf, without the external
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3822:8"/>
beneficial relations to the creature; Elſe our reſpects reflect too much homeward, and we doe but look through God, at our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Neither is it for vs only to bleſſe him as an abſolute God, but as a Soueraigne Lord too; whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath no more limit then his eſſence; the great moderator of heauen and earth, giuing lawes to his creature, ouer-ruling all things, marſhalling all euents, cruſhing his enemies, maintaining his Church, adored by Angells, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at by deuills; Behold here a Lord worthy to be bleſſed. We honour, as we ought, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous greatneſſe, ô yee emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Potentates of the earth; but alas, what is this to the great Lord of heauen? When wee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3822:8"/>
looke vp thither, we muſt craue leaue to pitty the breath of your noſthrills, the ruſt of your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets, the duſt of your graues, the ſting of your felicities, and (if yee take not good heed) the blots of your memories: As ye hold all in fee from this great Lord, ſo let it be no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you, to doe your low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt homage to his footſtoole; homage, I meane, in action; giue me the reall benediction; I am ſure that is the beſt; they bleſſe God that praiſe him, they bleſſe him more, and praiſe him beſt, that obey him. There are that crouch to you great ones, who yet hate you: Oh let vs take heed of offering theſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low obſeruances to the ſearcher
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3822:9"/>

of this Torch of publicke ioy, and ſounding the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of a thankfull iubilation, and how well will it become vs to follow ſo pious, ſo gracious an example. Come therefore, all yee that feare the Lord, and let vs recount what hee hath done for our ſoules. Come, let vs bleſſe the Lord, the God of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that loadeth vs dayly with benefits; the God to whom belong the iſſues of death: Let vs bleſſe him in his infinite eſſence, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bleſſe him in his vnboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and iuſt Souerainty, bleſſe him in his maruelous benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, large, continuall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued,

bleſſe him in his preſeruations, bleſſe him in his deliuerances: VVee may but touch at the two laſt.</p>
            <p>How is our Earth ready to ſinke vnder the loade of his mercies? VVhat nation vnder heauen hath not enuied, and wondred at our bleſſings? I doe not carie backe your eyes to the ancient fauours of our God; to the memorable fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of forraine Inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the miraculous diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries of Treaſons, to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull maintenance of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed neighbourhood; That one mercie I may not forget; that in the ſhutting vp of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Queene ELIZABETH,

the Pope and the then-King of <hi>Spaine</hi> were caſting Lots for the Crowne, and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly plotting for their ſeueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-deſigned ſucceſſors, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the publicke Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume Letters of Cardinall <hi>D' Oſſat,</hi> a witneſſe beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Three ſeueral Briefes were addreſſed hither by that inclement ſhaueling of <hi>Rome</hi> for the defeating of the Title and ſucceſſion of our late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, of deare and bleſſed memorie, and his Royall iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; Yet in ſpight of Rome and hell, God brought him in, and ſet him peaceably vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this iuſt throne of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; and may He perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

            <p>If I muſt follow the times, let mee rather balke that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Sulpher-mine, then not ſearch it, and yet, who can looke at that, any otherwiſe then the Iewes doe at the Rain-bow, with horror and aſtoniſhment? VVhat doe I tell you of our long Peace, our full plentie, our whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lawes, our eaſefull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, wirh a world of of theſe common fauours; it is for poore men to reckon.

out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> Religion out of the duſt; For the one; what a winter was there in all good hearts, when our Sunne was gone ſo far Southward? How chearefull a Spring in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne? For the other, who ſaw not how Religion began (during thoſe purpoſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Treaties) to droope and languiſh, her friends to ſigh, her enemies to inſult, daring to braue vs with chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, to threaten our ruine; <hi>The Lord look't downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and viſited this poore Vine of his,</hi> and hath ſhaken off theſe Caterpillers from her then-waſting leaues; Now we liue, and it flouriſheth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:3822:25"/>Theſe would haue beene great fauours of God, euen to the beſt nation, but more to vs: VVho haue anſwered mercies with rebellions. O God, if proud diſguiſes, if gluttonous pamperings, if drunken healths, if wanton dalliances, if bloody oathes, if mercileſſe oppreſſions may earne bleſſings from thee, too many of vs haue ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; VVoe is me, theſe are the meaſures thou haſt had from too many hands; That thou ſhouldſt therefore inlarge thy bountie to an vnworthy, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, diſobedient generation, it is more then wee can won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, and wee could almoſt

            <p>Yet, the wiſe iuſtice of the Almighty meant not to cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vs vp with meere dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with a looſe indulgence, but hath thought fit to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our ſweetes with tartnes, and to ſtricke our backes, whiles he ſtroakes our heads, <hi>Ecce in pace amaritudo amariſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> the comfort of our peace, was allayed with the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death: Hee ſaw that in this common <hi>Plethorie</hi> it was fit for vs to bleed; he ſaw vs Eeles that would not bee caught, but when the waters were troubled; He therefore

            <p>VVhat could we heare but alarums of death, what could we ſee but Trophees of death? Here was nothing but groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and crying, and dying and burying: Carts were the

Beeres, wide pits were the graues, mens clothes were their coffins, and the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equies of friends were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous. The carkaſſes of the dead might ſay, with the ſons of the Prophets; <hi>Behold the place where we lye is too ſtrait for vs</hi>; new dormitories are bought for the dead, &amp; furniſhed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might the corpſes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to lye ſingle in their earthen beds, but are pyled vp like fagots in a ſtack, for the ſociety of their future reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
