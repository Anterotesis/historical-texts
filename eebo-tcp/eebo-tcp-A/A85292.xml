            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He late Execution of Witches,
at the Summer Aſsiſes in
<hi>Kent,</hi> occaſioned this briefe
Exercitation, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
it ſelfe to ſuch as have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
thought upon the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in diſcovering, <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>who</hi>
a Witch is. To have nothing but the
publique faith of the preſent Age, is none
of the beſt evidence, unleſſe the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality
of Elder times doe concur with theſe
Doctrines, which ignorance in the times
<pb facs="tcp:114652:3"/>
of darkneſſe brought forth, and credulity in
theſe dayes of light hath continued.</p>
            <p>Such as ſhall not bee pleaſed
with this Tractate, are left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to conſider, whether all thoſe Proofs
and Preſumptions number'd up by
Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> for the Conviction of a
Witch, be not all condemned, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by himſelfe to be unſufficient, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.</p>
            <p>He brings no leſſe then eighteene ſignes,
or proofes whereby a <hi>VVitch</hi> may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
Which are too many to be all
true: His ſeven firſt he himſelf confeſſeth to
be inſufficient for conviction of a <hi>VVitch;</hi>
His eight next proofes (which he ſaith,
men in place have uſed) he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be falſe or inſufficient. Thus of his
eighteen proofes, which made a great ſhew,
fourteen of them are caſt off by himſelfe;
there remaines then his ſixteenth, which is
<pb facs="tcp:114652:3"/>
the confeſsion of a Witch, yet preſently he
is forced to yeild that a bare confeſsion is
not a ſufficient proofe, and ſo he commeth
to his ſeaventeenth proof, which is, two cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
witneſſes, and he here grants that
the league between the Devill, and the
Witch is cloſely made, and the practiſes of
Witches be very ſecret, that hardly a
Man can be brought, which upon his
own knowledge can aver ſuch things.
Therefore at laſt when all other proofes
faile, he is forced to fly to his eighteenth
proofe, and tels us, that yet there is a
way to come to the knowledge of a Witch,
which is, that <hi>Satan</hi> uſeth all meanes to
diſcover a Witch; which how it can be
well done, except the Devill be bound over
to give in evidence againſt the Witch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be underſtood.</p>
            <p>And as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> weakens, and
diſcredits all his own Proofes, ſo he
<pb facs="tcp:114652:4"/>
doth the like for all thoſe of K. <hi>James,</hi>
who as I remember hath but 3. Arguments
for the diſcovery of a <hi>VVitch.</hi> Firſt, The
ſecret Marke of a <hi>VVitch,</hi> of which
M. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, it hath no power by Gods
Ordinance. Secondly, The diſcovery by a
fellow-<hi>VVitch,</hi> this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> by no
means will allow to be a good proof. Thirdly,
the ſwimming of a <hi>VVitch,</hi> who is to be
flung croſſe wayes into the water, that is, as
<hi>VVierus</hi> interprets it, when the Thumb
of the right hand is bound to the great Toe
of the left Foot, and the Thumb of the
left Hand, to the great Toe of the right
Foot: againſt this Triall by water, together
with a diſability in a <hi>VVitch</hi> to ſhed
Tears (which K. <hi>James</hi> mentions) <hi>Delrio,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> both argue, for it
ſeems they both write after K. <hi>Iames,</hi>
who put forth his Book of Doemonologie in
his Youth, being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about his
age of thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114652:4"/>
It concernes the People of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be more diligently inſtructed,
in the Doctrine of Witch-craft, then
thoſe of forraigne Countries, becauſe
here they are tyed to a ſtricter or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter
Rule in giving their ſentence, then
others are; for all of them muſt agree
in their Verdict, which in a caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
difficulty is very dangerous, and
it is a ſad thing for Men to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that extremity, that they
muſt hazard their Conſciences, or their

               <head>In this Statute theſe Points are Obſervable.</head>
               <p>1. That this Statute was firſt framed in 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and onely
the penalties here a little altered, and the laſt clauſe concerning
provoking of perſons to love, and deſtroying of Cattle, and
Goods, &amp;c. is ſo changed, that I cannot well make ſenſe of it,
except it be rectified according to the words of the former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
which ſtands repealed.</p>
               <p>2. Although the Statute runs altogether in the disjunctive
<hi>Or,</hi> and ſo makes every ſingle crime capitall, yet the Judges
uſually by a favourable interpretation take the disjunctive <hi>Or</hi>
for the copulative <hi>And;</hi> and therefore ordinarily they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
none for Witches, unleſſe they be charged with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of ſome perſon.</p>
               <p>3. This Statute preſuppoſeth that every one knowes what
a Conjurer, a Witch, an Inchanter, a Charmer, and Sorcerer
is, as being to be learned beſt of Divines; and therefore they
have not deſcribed, or diſtinguiſhed betweene them: and yet
the Law is very juſt in requiring <hi>a due and lawfull conviction.</hi>

               <p>FOr the better diſcovery of the qualities of theſe crimes, I

out of the old Teſtament, neither doth hee ſay, that the Text

onely.<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> The Text is <hi>Pſal. 58. ver. 5.</hi> of which his words
are theſe, <hi>howſoever the common tranſlation runeth in other termes,

but it is onely a falſe brag of their own to juſtifie their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
by a lie; for it is not poſſible to make a Covenant with
Death, which in it ſelfe is nothing but a meere not being; and
whereas it is called an agreement with Hell, it may be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </p>
               <p>It may be wondered that neither Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> nor the Jeſuit
have any other, or better Texts to prove this Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Witch and the Devill. But the truth is it is very
little that either of them ſay of this great point, but paſſe it
over perfunctorily. Perhaps it may be thought that King <hi>James</hi>
hath ſaid, or brought more and better proofes in this point;
but I doe not finde that he doth medle with it at all, but takes it
for granted that if there be Witches, there muſt needs be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and ſo leaves it without further proofe.</p>
               <p>A ſecond note is that the agreement betweene the Witch,
and the Devill they call a Covenant, and yet neither of the
parties are any way bound to performe their part, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
without doubt notwithſtanding all his craft hath far the
worſt part of the bargaine.<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> The bargaine runs thus in Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
the <hi>Witch as a ſlave binds himſelfe by Vow to believe in the Devill,
and to give him either Body, or Soule, or both under his hand Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or ſome part of his Bloud. The Divell promiſeth to be ready at
his vaſſals command to appeare in the likeneſſe of any Creature, to
conſult, and to aid him for the procuring of Pleaſure, Honour,
Wealth, or Preferment, to goe for him, to carry him any whither,
and doe any command.</hi> Whereby we ſee the Devill is not to
have benefit of his bargaine till the Death of the Witch, in
the meane time he is to appeare alwayes at the Witches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to go for him, to carry him any whither, and to doe
any command, which argues the Devill to be the Witches ſlave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and not the Witch the Divills.</p>
               <p>Though it be true which <hi>Delrio</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that the Devill is
at liberty to performe or breake his compact, for that not man can
compell him to keepe his promiſe;</hi> yet on the other ſide it is as
poſſible for the Witch to fruſtrate the Devills Contract, if hee
or ſhee have ſo much grace as to repent, the which there may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114652:8"/>
be good cauſe to do, if the Devill be found not to performe
his promiſe: Beſides a Witch may many times require that to
be done by the Devill, which God permits not the Devill to
do; thus againſt his will the Devill may loſe his credit, and
give occaſion of repentance though he endeavour to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of his power to bring to paſſe whatſoever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and ſo faile of the benefit of his bargaine, though he
have the hand-writing, or ſome part of the bloud of the
Witch for his ſecurity, or the ſolemnity before witneſſes as
<hi>Delrio</hi> imagineth.</p>
               <p>I am certaine they will not ſay that Witch-craft is like the
ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, unpardonable, for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>
confeſſeth the contrary,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Sect. 18.</note> and <hi>Delrio</hi> denies it not, for hee
allowes the <hi>Sacrament of the Euchariſt</hi> to be adminiſtred to a
condemned Witch, with this limitation, that there may be
about foure houres ſpace betweene the Communion, and the
Execution, in which time it may be probably thought that
the <hi>Sacramentall Species</hi> (as they call it) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Delrio</hi> in his ſecond Booke, and fourth Queſtion gives
this rule, which he ſaith, <hi>is common to all Contracts with the
Devill, that first they muſt deny the Faith, and Chriſtianiſme, and
Obedience to God, and reject the patronage of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and
revile her.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmes that <hi>Witches
renounce God and their Baptiſme.</hi> But if this be common to all
Contracts with the Devill, it will follow that none can be
Witches but ſuch as have firſt beene Chriſtians, nay and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholiques, if Delrio</hi> ſay true, for who elſe can renounce
the patronage of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> And what ſhall be ſaid
then of all thoſe Idolatrous Nations of <hi>Lapland, Finland,</hi> and
of divers parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and many other Heatheniſh Nations
which our Travailers report to be full of Witches? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what neede or benefit can the Devill gaine by contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with thoſe Idolaters, who are ſurer his own, then any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
can make them?</p>
               <p>4. Whereas it is ſaid that <hi>Witch craft is an Art working won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
it muſt be underſtood that the art muſt be the Witches
Art, and not the Devills, otherwiſe it is no Witch-craft, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114652:8"/>
Devils-craft: It is confeſſed on all hands that the Witch doth
not worke the wonder, but the Devill onely. It is a rare Art
for a Witch by her Art to be able to do nothing her ſelfe, but
to command an other to practiſe the Art. In other Arts
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Cap. 1. Sect. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Arts Maſter is able by himſelfe
to practiſe his Art, and to doe things belonging thereunto without
the helpe of an other, but in this it is otherwiſe—the power of
effecting ſtrange workes doth not flow from the skill of the Witch, but
is derived wholy from Satan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</note> To the ſame purpoſe he ſaith, that
the <hi>means of working wonders are Charmes uſed as a Watch-word
to the Devill to cauſe him to worke wonders:</hi> ſo that the Devill is
the worker of the wonder, and the Witch but the Counſellor,
Perſwader, or Commander of it, and onely acceſſary before
the Fact, and the Devill onely principall. Now the difficulty
will be how the <hi>acceſſary</hi> can be <hi>duely and lawfully convicted and
attainted</hi> according as our Statute requires, unleſſe the Devill
who is the Principall be firſt convicted, or at leaſt outlawed,
which cannot be, becauſe the Devill can never be lawfully ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
according to the rules of our Common-law. For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofe that the Devill is the principall in all ſuch wonders,
I ſhall ſhew it by the teſtimony of King <hi>James,</hi> in a caſe of
Murther, which is the moſt capitall crime our Lawes looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Firſt he tells that <hi>the Devill teaches Witches how to make
Pictures of Wax and Clay, that by the reſting thereof the perſons
that they beare the Name of, may be continually melted or dried
away by continuall ſickneſſe—not that any of theſe meanes which
he teacheth them (except poyſons which are compoſed of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall)
can of themſelves helpe any thing to theſe turnes they are
imployed in.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Cap. 5.</note> Secondly, King <hi>James</hi> affirmes that <hi>Witches can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch,
and take the life of Men, or Women by roſting of the Pictures,
which is very poſſible to their Maſter to performe, for although
that inſtrument of Wax have no vertue in the turne doing: yet
may be not very well by that ſame meaſure that his conjured Slave
melts that Wax at the fire, may he not I ſay at theſe ſame times ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely
as a ſpirit, ſo weaken and ſcatter the ſpirits of life of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
as may make him on the one part for faintneſſe to ſweate out
the humours of his body; and on the other part for the not concurring
of theſe spirits which cauſe his digeſtion, ſo debilitate his ſtomack
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114652:9"/>
that his humour radicall continually ſweating out on the one part, and
no new good Suck being put in the place thereof, for lack of digestion
on the other, he at laſt ſhall vaniſh away even as his Picture will doe
at the Fire.</hi> Here we ſee the Picture of Wax roaſted by the
Witch, hath no vertue in the Murdering, but the Devill only.
It is neceſſary in the firſt place that it be duely proved that the
party Murther'd be Murthered by the Devill, for it is a ſhame
to bely the Devill, and it is not poſſible to be proved if it be
<hi>Subtilely done as a spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Our Definers of Witch-craft diſpute much, whether the
Devill can worke a Miracle, they reſolve he can do a <hi>wonder,</hi>
but not a <hi>Miracle, Mirum</hi> but not <hi>Miraculum.</hi> A Miracle ſaith
Mr. <hi>Perkins, is that which is above, or againſt nature ſimply; a
wonder is that which proceeds not from the ordinary courſe of nature.
Delrio</hi> will have a Miracle to be <hi>Praeter,</hi> or <hi>ſupra naturae creatae
vires,</hi> both ſeeme to agree in this that he had neede be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
or profound Philoſopher, that can diſtinguiſh between
a Wonder and a Miracle; it would poſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe, to
tell us every thing that can be done by the power of Nature,
and what things cannot, for there be dayly many things found
out, and dayly more may be which our Fore-fathers never knew
to be poſſible in Nature. Thoſe that were converted by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of our Saviour, never ſtayed to enquire of their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
what the power of Nature was, it was ſufficient to
them when they ſaw things done, the like whereof they
had neither ſeene, nor heard of to believe them to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>6. It is commonly believed, and affirmed by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi>
that the cauſe which moves the Devill to bargaine with a Witch,
is a deſire to obtaine thereby the Soule and Body of the Witch.
But I cannot ſee how this can agree with another Doctrine of
his, where hee ſaith, <hi>the Precepts of Witch-craft are not delivered
indifferently to every Man, but to his owne Subjects the wicked;
and not to them all, but to speciall and tried ones, whom hee moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſteth
with his ſecrets, as being the fitteſt to ſerve his turne, both
in reſpect of their willingneſſe to learne and practice; as alſo for
their ability to become Inſtruments of the miſchiefe he intendeth to
others.</hi> All this argues the end of the Devills rules of Witch-craft
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114652:9"/>
is not to gaine <hi>Novices</hi> for new Subjects, but to make uſe
of old ones to ſerve his turne.</p>
               <p>7. The laſt clauſe of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> definition is, that <hi>Witch-craft
doth worke wonders ſo far as God ſhall permit.</hi> I ſhould
here deſire to have known whether Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had thought
that God doth permit farther power to the Devill upon his
contracting with the Witch, then he had before the Contract;
for if the Devill had the ſame permiſſion before the Contract,
then he doth no more miſchiefe upon the Contract, then he
would have gladly done before,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> ſeeing as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The Devills malice towards all Men is of ſo high a degree, that he
cannot endure they ſhould enjoy the World, or the benefits of this life
(if it were poſſible) ſo much as one houre.</hi> But yet afterwards I
finde Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> is more favourable to the Devill, where
he writes, <hi>that if the Devill were not ſtirred up, and provoked by
the Witch he would never do ſo much hu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

ſhould ſay that preſumptions do at leaſt probably, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturally
note, and are certaine ſignes to diſcover a Witch;
when he confeſſeth that though <hi>preſumptions give occaſion to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
yet they are no ſufficient cauſes of conviction: and though
preſumptions be never ſo ſtrong, yet they are not proofes ſufficient
for conviction, but onely for examination.</hi> Therefore no credit is
to be given to thoſe preſumptions hee reckons up. 1. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fame, <hi>it falls out many times,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That the innocent
may be ſuspected, and ſome of the better ſort notoriouſly defamed.
2. The testimony of a fellow Witch,</hi> hee confeſſeth, <hi>doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114652:10"/>
note one to be a Witch.</hi> The like may be ſaid of his third and
fourth preſumption, <hi>if after curſing, or quarreling, or threatning
there follow preſent miſchiefe;</hi> And the fifth preſumption is more
frivolous, which is, <hi>if the party be the Son, or Daughter, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
or Friend neer Neighbour, or old Companion of a VVitch.</hi>
The ſixt preſumption Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> dares not, or is loath to
owne, but ſaith, <hi>ſome adde, if the party Suſpected have the
Devills Marke, and yet he reſolves if ſuch a Marke be deſcried,
whereof no evident reaſon in nature can be given, the Magiſtrate
may cauſe ſuch to be examined, or take the matter into his owne
hands, that the truth may appeare,</hi> but hee doth not teach how
the truth may be made to appeare. The laſt preſumption hee
names is, <hi>if the party examined be unconſtant, or contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
here hee confeſſeth, <hi>a good Man may be fearefull in a good

have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching Examination Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> names two kindes of
proceedings, either by <hi>ſimple Queſtion,</hi> or <hi>by Torture. Torture,
when beſides the enquiry by words, the Magiſtrate uſeth the Rack,

be lawfully uſed, howbeit not in every caſe, but onely upon ſtrong,

may be noted that it is not lawfull for any perſon, but the
Judge onely to allow Torture, ſuſpitious Neighbours may not
of their own heads uſe either Threats, Terrors, or Tortures;
I know not any one of thoſe preſumptions before cited to be
ſufficient to warrant a Magiſtrate to uſe Torture, or whether
when the party conſtantly denies the Fact, it muſt be counted
obſtinacy. In caſe of Treaſon ſometimes, when the maine Fact
hath beene either confeſſed, or by ſome infallible proofes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
the Magiſtrate for a farther diſcovery of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the Time, the Place, and the Perſons, or the
like, have made uſe of the Rack, and yet that kinde of torture
hath not beene of ancient uſage in this Kingdome, for if my

From preſumptions, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proceeds to proofes of a
Witch, and here he hath a neat diſtinction of proofes, <hi>leſſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
or <hi>more ſufficient;</hi> by leſſe ſufficient he meaneth inſufficient,
but gives them this mild and ſtrange phraſe of leſſe ſufficient,
that it may not diſpleaſe ſuch friends (as I conceive) allow
thoſe leſſe ſufficient proofes for ſufficient, though he reckons
them for no better then Witch-craft. Thoſe unſufficient ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proofes are weaker, and worſe then his preſumptions which
hee confeſſeth are no proofes at all; yet wee muſt reckon them
up, his firſt leſſe ſufficient proofe is, <hi>The ancient triall by taking
red hot Irons, or putting the hand in hot ſcalding water,</hi> this hee
ſaith, <hi>hath been condemned for Diabolicall, and wicked, as in truth
it is, for an innocent Man may thereby be condemned, and a ranke
Witch ſcape unpuniſhed.</hi> A ſecond inſufficient proofe is, <hi>Scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſuſpected party, and the preſent recovery thereupon.</hi>
A third is <hi>the burning the thing bewitched, as a Hog, an Ox, or
other Creature, it is imagined a forcible meanes to cauſe the Witch
to diſcover her ſelfe.</hi> A fourth <hi>is the burning the Thatch of the
ſuſpected parties Houſe.</hi> The fift leſſe ſufficient proofe is <hi>the
binding of the party hand and foote, and caſting croſſe wayes into
the water, if ſhee ſinkes ſhee is counted innocent, if ſhee floate on the
water, and ſinke not, ſhe is taken for a Witch, convicted, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The <hi>Germans</hi> uſed this triall by cold water, and it was imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the Devill being moſt light, as participating more of
Aire then of Water, would hold them up above the Water,
either by putting himſelfe under the Witch, and lifting her up,
as it were with his backe, or by uniting himſelfe, and poſſeſſing
her whole body.</p>
               <p>All theſe leſſe ſufficient proofes, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, are ſo far
from being ſufficient, that ſome of them, if not all are after a ſort
practiſes of witch-craft, having no power by Gods Ordinance.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee condemnes point blanke King <hi>James's</hi> judgement as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
of Witch-craft in allowing of the triall of a Witch by
ſwimming as a principall proofe. And, as I take it, he condemnes
himſelfe alſo, except he can finde any ordinance of God, that
the having of an incurable, and inſenſible marke, or ſore, ſhall be
a preſumption, or certaine ſigne of a Witch.</p>
               <p>A ſixt leſſe ſufficient proofe is the <hi>Testimony of a Wiſard,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:114652:11"/>
                  <hi>Witch, or cunning Man, who is gone or ſent unto, and informes that
he can ſhew in a Glaſſe the Face of the Witch.</hi> This accuſation of
a Witch by an other Witch, Mr. <hi>Perkins denies to be ſufficient,
and he puts this caſe. If the Devill appeare to a Grand Jury, in the
likeneſſe of ſome known Man, and offer to take his Oath that the
perſon in question is a Witch ſhould the Enqueſt receive his Oath,
or accuſation to condemne the party? He anſwers, Surely No; and
yet that is as much as the Teſtimony of an other Witch, who only by
the helpe of the Devill revealeth the Witch: if this ſhould be taken
for a ſufficient proofe, the Devill would not leave one good Man
alive in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſcrediting of the Teſtimony of a Witch takes away
the other (for hee hath but two) of King <hi>James</hi> maine proofs,
for the diſcovery of a Witch, for hee ſaith, <hi>Who but Witches can
be provers, and ſo witneſſes of the doings of Witches?</hi> and to the
ſame purpoſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, that the <hi>Precepts
of Witch-craft are not delivered, but to the Devills own ſubjects, the
wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſeventh leſſe ſufficient proofe is, <hi>when a Man in open Court
affirmes, ſuch a one fell out with mee, and curſed me, threatning I
ſhould ſmart for it in my perſon or goods, upon theſe threats ſuch
Evills and Loſſes preſently befell mee; This is no ſure ground for
conviction,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, for it pleaſeth God many times to lay
his Hands upon Mens perſons and goods, without the procurement
of Witches;</hi> and yet ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, Experience ſhewes that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people will make ſtrong proofes of ſuch preſumptions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſometimes Jurors doe give their Verdict against parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt leſſe ſufficient proofe is, <hi>if a Man being ſicke, upon
ſuspition, will take it on his Death, that ſuch a one hath bewitched
him, it is of no moment,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, it is but the ſuspition
of one Man for himſelfe, and is of no more force then an other Mans
word against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All theſe proofes,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, which Men in place have
ordinarily uſed, be either falſe, or inſufficient ſignes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the laſt Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> comes to his <hi>more ſufficient proofes,</hi>
which in all are but two. The confeſſion of the Witch, or the
proofe of two witneſſes. Againſt the Confeſſion of a Witch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114652:11"/>
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>it is objected that one may confeſſe againſt
himſelfe an untruth being urged by force, or threatning, or by deſire
upon ſome griefe to be out of the World or at leaſt being in trouble,
and perſwaded it is the best courſe to ſave their lives, and obtaine
their liberty, they may upon ſimplicity be induced to confeſſe that
they never did, even againſt themſelves.</hi> The truth of this allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doth not deny, but grants it, in that his Anſwer
is, <hi>That he doth not ſay a bare Confeſſion is ſufficient, but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
after due Examination taken upon pregnant preſumptions.</hi>
But if a bare Confeſſion be not a ſufficient proofe, a pregnant
preſumption can never make it ſuch; or if it could, then it would
not be a ſufficient proofe. For the farther weakning of the
Confeſſion of a ſuſpected Witch, wee may remember what
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath formerly anſwered, when it was alleaged that
<hi>upon a melancholy humor many confeſſe of themſelves things falſe,<note place="margin">Cap 7. Sect. 13</note>
and impoſſible; that they are carried through the Aire in a moment,
that they paſſe through Keyholes, and cleffs of Doores, that they be
ſometimes turn'd into Cats, Hares, and other Creatures, and ſuch
like, all which are meer Fables and things impoſſible.</hi> Here Maſter
<hi>Perkins</hi> anſwers, that <hi>when Witches begin to make a league, they
are ſober and ſound in underſtanding, but after they be once in the
league, their reaſon, and underſtanding may be depraved, memory
weakned and all the powers of their ſoule blemiſhed, they are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſo intoxicated that they will run into a thouſand of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
imaginations, holding themſelves to be transformed into
the ſhapes of other Creatures, to be tranſported in the Aire, to do many
ſtrange things, which in truth they do not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> will confeſſe that the Examination, and
Confeſſion of a ſuſpected Witch is alwayes after ſuch time as
her Covenant is made; when ſhee is by his Confeſſion deluded,
and not fit to give teſtimony againſt her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>His ſecond <hi>more ſufficient proofe</hi> (hee ſaith, <hi>if the party will
not confeſſe, as commonly it falleth out) is two witneſſes avouching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own knowledge, either that the party accuſed hath made
league with the Devill, or hath done ſome known practiſes of Witch
craft, or hath invocated the Devill, or deſired his helpe.</hi> But if
every Man that hath invocated the Devill, or deſired his helpe
muſt have formerly made a league with him, then whole Nations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114652:12"/>
are every Man of them VVitches, which I thinke none will
ſay.</p>
               <p>As for the League, and Proofe of VVitch-craft, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>
confeſſeth, <hi>Some may ſay, if theſe be the only ſtrong proofes for the
conviction of a Witch, it will be then impoſſible to put any one to
Death; becauſe the League with Satan is cloſely made, and the
Practiſes of Witch-craft are alſo very ſecret, and hardly can a Man
be brought, which upon his own knowledge can aver ſuch things.</hi>
To this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> anſwer is a confeſſion, that <hi>howſoever the
ground and practiſe be ſecret, and be to many unknown, yet there is
a way to come to the knowledge thereof—Satan endeavoreth the
diſcovery, and uſeth all meanes to diſcloſe Witches.</hi> This meanes he
ſpeakes of ſhould be in the power of the Judge, or elſe it is no
helpe for the Diſcovery of a Witch, but onely when the Devill
pleaſeth. I do not finde hee proves that it is uſuall with Satan
to endeavour any ſuch Diſcovery; neither doe I ſee how it is
practicable by the Devill, for either hee muſt doe it by his own
relation, or report, which as it cannot be proved he ever did, ſo
it is vaine, and to no purpoſe if hee doe it, for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath
diſcredited the teſtimony of the Devill as invalid, and of no force
for conviction, or elſe the Devill muſt diſcover it by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
meanes; and if there had beene any ſuch ſecond meanes
uſuall, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would have taught us what they are, and not
have left us onely to his two more ſufficient proofes, which hee
confeſſeth are not infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</note>King <hi>James</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Devills firſt diſcovering of himſelf
for the gaining of a Witch, is either upon their walking ſolitarily in
the Fields, or elſe lying pauſing in their Bed, but alwayes without
the company of any other; and at the making of Circles and Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
none of that craft will permit any others to behold;</hi> when
the Devill and his ſubjects are thus cloſe, and ſecret in their
Actions, it cannot be imagined that hee will uſe all meanes to
diſcover his moſt ſpeciall and truſtieſt ſubjects, and though
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> that <hi>by vertue of the precontract, the Devill
is cock-ſure of his instruments;</hi> yet within a few lines he changeth
his note, and ſaith, <hi>though he have good hope of them, yet he is not
certaine of their continuance, becauſe ſome by the Mercy of God have
bin reclaimed, and freed from his Covenant.</hi> Beſides hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114652:12"/>
                  <hi>the Devill ſuffereth ſome to live long undiſcloſed, that they
may Exerciſe the greater meaſure of his Malice in the World.</hi> It
remaines that if the two true Proofes of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> which are
the Witches Confeſſion, or ſufficient witneſſes faile, <hi>we have
not warrant,</hi> as hee ſaith, <hi>in the word to put ſuch an one to
Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude this Point in the words of Mr. <hi>Perkins; I adviſe
all Jurors that as they be diligent in the zeal of Gods Glory, ſo they
would be carefull what they do, and not condemne any party ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon bare preſumptions, without ſound and ſufficient proofes, that
they be not guilty through their own raſhnes of ſhedding innocent
Bloud.</hi>

               <p>IN <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. The Witch is named with divers other ſorts of
ſuch as uſed the like unlawfull Arts, as the Diviner, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
of times, an Inchanter, a Charmer, a Conſulter with
a familiar Spirit, a Wiſard, or a Necromancer. The Text ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>all that doe theſe things are an abomination to the Lord, and
becauſe of theſe abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them</hi>
[the Nations] <hi>out from before thee.</hi> If wee deſire to know what
thoſe abominations of the Nations were, wee are told in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
in the 14. Verſe of the ſame Chapter. <hi>Theſe Nations hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto obſervers of times and unto Diviners:</hi> There is no other
crime in this Chapter laid to the charge of all, or any of theſe
practiſers of ſuch unlawfull Arts, but of <hi>lying Prophecies;</hi> and
therefore the Text addeth, <hi>the Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee
a Prophet from the mideſt of thee of thy Brethren, like unto me,
unto him ſhall ye harken, and not to the Diviners, Wiſards, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Setting aſide the caſe of <hi>Job</hi> (wherein God gave a ſpeciall
and extraordinary Commiſſion) I doe not finde in Scripture
that the Devill, or Witch, or any other had power ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permitted them, either to kill or hurt any Man, or to medle
with the Goods of any: for though for the triall of the hearts
of men, God doth permit the Devill ordinarily to tempt them;
yet hee hath no Commiſſion to deſtroy the Lives or Goods of
Men, it is little leſſe then blaſphemy to ſay any ſuch thing of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114652:13"/>
the admirable Providence of God, whereby he preſerves all his
Creatures.</p>
               <p>It was crime ſufficient for all thoſe practicers of unlawfull Arts
to delude the people, with falſe and lying Prophecies, thereby
to make them forget to depend upon God, and <hi>to have their
Soules turne after ſuch as have Familiar Spirits, and after Wiſards,
to go a whoring after them,</hi> as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 6. This
ſpirituall whoredome is flat Idolatry in the common phraſe of
the Old Teſtament; and thoſe that be entiſers to it, thereby
endeavour to deſtroy the Soules of the People, and are by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees more worthy of death, then thoſe that only deſtroy
the Bodies or Goods of Men.</p>
               <p>If there were a Law that every one ſhould be put to Death,
or puniſhed that ſhould adviſedly endeavour to perſwade Men
that they are skilfull in thoſe forbidden Arts, or in foretelling
of things to come, or that they have contracted with the Devill,
and can thereby Murder or deſtroy Mens Goods, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deny ſuch a Law to be moſt conſonant, and agreeing with
the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I may be thought by ſome a favourer of theſe
forbidden Arts, through want of underſtanding the Scripture,
about the quality of them; I have made choice of a Man who
is no friend to Witches, and whoſe learning in this point will
not be denied. In his own words I ſhall ſet downe, what either
out of the Hebrew Names of thoſe prohibited Arts, or out of
the expoſition of the Jewiſh Doctors can be gathered, for the
underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Diviner in Hebrew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ainſworth <hi>upon</hi> Deut. 18.</note> a Foreſeer, or Preſager, a Foreteller
of things to come, as doth a Prophet—the Hebrews take a
Diviner to be one that doth things whereby hee may foretell
things to come, and ſay, ſuch a thing ſhall be, or not be, or
ſay, It is good to doe Such a thing—the meanes of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
ſome doing it with Sand, ſome with Stones, ſome by lying
downe on the Ground, ſome with Iron, ſome with a Staffe—he
that asked of a Diviner, is chaſtiſed with ſtripes.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>An obſerver of times,</hi> or Soothſayer, an Obſerver of the
Clouds, a Planetary, or an obſerver of the flying of Foules,
an Augur. As the Diviners were carried much by inward, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114652:13"/>
Spirituall Motions, ſo theſe by outward Obſervations in the
Creatures. The Hebrews ſay, they were ſuch as did ſet times for
the doing of things, ſaying, Such a day is good, and ſuch a day
is naught.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>An Obſerver of Fortunes,</hi> one that curiouſly ſearcheth
ſignes of good or evill luck, which are learned by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is to finde out by Experience; Whereupon
the word here uſed is one that too curiouſly obſerveth, and
abuſeth things that doe fall out as lucky, or unlucky. The
Hebrews deſcribe it thus, as if one ſhould ſay, becauſe the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of Bread is fallen out of my mouth, or my Staffe out of my
hand, I will not go to ſuch a place: becauſe a Fox paſſed by
on my right hand, I will not go out of my Houſe this day.
Our new tranſlation renders this word an Inchanter.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A Witch</hi> a Sorcerer, ſuch as do bewitch the ſenſes, or minds
of Men, by changing the formes of things to another hew. The
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word for a Witch properly ſignifies a Jugler, and is
derived from a word which ſignifies <hi>changing or turning.</hi> and
<hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. that Witches wrought by Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that is, <hi>by ſecret Sleights Juglings, Cloſe conveyance, or of
Gliſtering like the flame of Fire, or a Sword wherewith Mens Eyes
were dazled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>A Charmer,</hi> or one that conjureth Conjurations, the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies <hi>conjoyning or conſociating</hi>—the Charmer is ſaid
to be hee, that ſpeaketh words of a ſtrange Language, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſenſe; that if one ſay, ſo or ſo unto a Serpent, it cannot
hurt him; hee that whiſpereth over a wound, or that readeth
over an Infant, that it may not be frighted, or layeth the Bible
upon a Child that it may ſleepe.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>A Wiſard,</hi> or cunning Man in Hebrew named of his
knowledge, or cunning—the <hi>Hebrews</hi> deſcribe him thus, that
he put in his mouth a bone of a Bird, and burned incenſe, and
did other things untill hee fell downe with ſhame, and ſpake
with his mouth things that were to come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>A Necromancer,</hi> one that ſeeketh unto the Dead: of
him they ſay, he made himſelfe hungry, and went and lodged
among the Graves, that the dead might come unto him in a
Dreame, and make known unto him that which he asked of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114652:14"/>
him, and others there were that clad themſelves with Cloaths
for that purpoſe, and ſpake certaine words, and burned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
and ſlept by themſelves, that ſuch a dead perſon might
come and talke with them in a Dream.</p>
               <p>8. Laſtly, <hi>The Conſulter with Familiar Spirits,</hi> in Hebrew a
<hi>Conſulter with Ob,</hi> applied here to Magitians, who poſſeſſed
with an evill Spirit, ſpake with a hollow voyce, as out of a
Bottle.—The Hebrews explaine it thus, that he which had a
Familiar ſpirit ſtood and burned Incenſe, and held a rod
of Mirtle-tree in his hand, and waved it, and ſpake certaine
words in ſecret, untill he that enquired did heare one ſpeak unto
him, and anſwer him touching that hee enquired with words
from under the Earth, with a very low voyce, &amp;c. Likewiſe
one tooke a dead Mans Skull, and burnt Incenſe thereto, and
inchanted thereby till hee heard a very low voyce, &amp;c. This
Text in our Engliſh tranſlation being expounded a Familiar
Spirit, and ſeconded by the Hiſtory of the Woman of <hi>Endor,</hi>
may ſeeme a ſtrong evidence that the Devill covenanted with
Witches; But if all be granted that can be deſired, that this
Familiar Spirit ſignifies a Devill, yet it comes not home to
prove the maine point, for it is no proofe that the Familiar
Spirit enter'd upon Covenant, or had or could give power to
others to kill the perſons, or deſtroy the Goods of others,
Kings <hi>James</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>the Devill can make ſome to be poſſeſſed,
and ſo become very Demoniaques, and that ſhe who had the ſpirit
of</hi> Python <hi>in</hi> Acts 16. <hi>Whereby ſhe conquested ſuch gaine to her
Master that ſpirit was not of her own raiſing, or commanding as
ſhe pleaſed to appoint but spake by her Tongue as well privately as
publiquely.</hi> Wee do not finde the <hi>Pythoneſſe</hi> condemned or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
but the uncleane Spirit commanded <hi>in the name of Jeſus
Chriſt to come out of her. The Child which was</hi> too young to make
a Covenant with the Devill was <hi>poſſeſſed with a dumb and deafe
Spirit, and the Devill charged to come out, and enter no more into
him</hi> Marke 9. <hi>A Daughter of Abraham</hi> (that is, of the Faith
of Abraham) <hi>was troubled with a ſpirit of infirmity 18 years,
and bowed together, that ſhee could not lift her ſelfe up.</hi> Luke 13.
10. 16.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. where all the unlawfull Arts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114652:14"/>
are reckoned up, and moſt fully prohibited, the crime of them
is charged upon the practiſers of thoſe Arts, but the crime of
having a Familiar Spirit is not there condemned, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulter
of a Familiar Spirit, ſo in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 31. the prohibition is,
<hi>Regard not them that have Familiar Spirits,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Levit. 20. 6.
The Soule that turneth after ſuch as have Familiar Spirits,</hi> ſo
that it was not the having, but the conſulting was condemned.</p>
               <p>If we draw neerer to the words of the Text, it will be found
that theſe words a Conſulter with a Familiar Spirit are no other
then <hi>a Conſulter with Ob.</hi> Where the queſtion will be what <hi>Ob</hi>
ſignifieth. Expoſitors agree that originally <hi>Ob</hi> ſignifieth a
Bottle, and they ſay is applied here to one poſſeſſed with an
evill Spirit, and ſpeaketh with a hollow voyce as out of a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
but for this I finde no proofe, they bring out of Scripture
that ſaith, or expoundeth that <hi>Ob</hi> ſignifieth one poſſeſſed with
a Familiar Spirit in the Belly; the onely proofe is that the
Greeke Interpreters of the Bible Tranſlate it <hi>Engaſtromuthi,</hi>
which is, ſpeaking in the Belly, and the word anciently, and
long before the time of the Septuagint Tranſlators was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed for one that had the cunning or ſlight to ſhut his mouth,
and ſeeme to ſpeake with his Belly, which that it can be done
without the helpe of a Familiar Spirit, experience of this Age
ſheweth in an Iriſh-man; We do not find it ſaid that the Woman
of <hi>Endo</hi> did foretell any thing to <hi>Saul,</hi> by the hollow voyce of
a Familiar Spirit in her Belly; neither did <hi>Saul</hi> require, nor the
Woman promiſe ſo to anſwer him, but hee required, <hi>bring me
him up who I ſhall name unto thee, and ſhe undertooke to do it;</hi> which
argues a deſire in <hi>Saul</hi> to conſult with the dead, which is called
<hi>Necromancy,</hi> or <hi>conſulting with the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it hath beene ſaid, ſhee raiſed the Devill in <hi>Samuels</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yet there is no ſuch thing ſaid in the Text: when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
went about her worke, the firſt thing noted is, that <hi>when
ſhe ſaw</hi> Samuel, <hi>ſhe cried out with a loud voyce:</hi> an Argument ſhee
was frighted with ſeeing ſomething ſhee did not expect to ſee;
it is not ſaid that when ſhee knew <hi>Saul,</hi> but when ſhee ſaw <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
She cryed out with a loud voyce:</hi> when ſhee knew <hi>Saul</hi> ſhee
had no reaſon to be afraid, but rather comforted, for that ſhee
had his Oath for her ſecurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114652:15"/>
It may well be that if either ſhee had a Familiar Spirit, or the
Art of hollow-ſpeaking, her intention was to deceive <hi>Saul</hi> and
by her ſecret voyce to have made him believe that <hi>Samuel</hi> in
another roome had anſwered him; for it appeares that <hi>Saul</hi>
was not in the place where ſhe made a ſhew of raiſing <hi>Samuel,</hi>
for when ſhee cried out with a loud voyce, <hi>Saul</hi> comforted her,
and bid her not be afraid, and asked her <hi>what ſhe ſaw? and what
forme is he of?</hi> which queſtions need not have beene if <hi>Saul</hi> had
beene in the Chamber with the Witch. King <hi>James</hi> confeſſeth
that <hi>Saul was in another chalmer at the conjuration,</hi> and it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Woman had told <hi>Saul</hi> ſhee had ſeene ſome fearfull ſight,
which made him aske her what ſhe ſaw? and her anſwer was, <hi>She
ſaw Gods aſcending out of the Earth,</hi> and it may be underſtood that
Angels waited upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was raiſed by God, and not
any Puppets, or Divells that ſhee conjured up: otherwiſe the
words may be tranſlated as <hi>Deodat</hi> in the Margent of his <hi>Italian</hi>
Bible hath it, <hi>She ſaw a Man of Majesty, or Divine Authority
aſcend, un' huomo di Majeſta è d' Authorita Divina,</hi> which well
anſwers the queſtion of what forme is he of? which is in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
not in the plurall number.</p>
               <p>Wee finde it ſaid in <hi>Eſay 29. 4. thou ſhalt be brought downe, and
ſhalt speake out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall be low out of the
duſt, and thy voyce ſhall be as one that hath a Familiar Spirit out of
the ground and thy ſpeech ſhall whiſper out of the Earth;</hi> which
argues the voyce of <hi>Ob</hi> was out of the Earth, rather then out
of the Belly, and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Expoſition which I cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
affirmes; ſome learned have beene of Opinion that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reaſon may be given why in ſome places certaine exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
out of the earth may give to ſome a propheticall ſpirit.
Adde hereunto that ſome of the Heathen Oracles were ſaid to
ſpeake out of the Earth: and among thoſe five ſorts of <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi>
mentioned by Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his 76 Lecture of his
cenſure of the <hi>Apocryphals,</hi> not any of them is ſaid to have any
Spirit in their Belly. The Ronaniſts who are all great affirmers
of the power of Witches agree, that the ſoule of <hi>Samuel</hi> was
ſent by God to the Woman of <hi>Endor:</hi> to this not onely <hi>Delrio,</hi>
but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> before him agrees. That true <hi>Samuel</hi> did appear
as ſent by God, as hee ſent <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Ochoſias King of Iſrael. who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114652:15"/>
being ſick ſent to conſult with Belzebub the God of Echron,</hi> may
appeare, for that <hi>Samuel</hi> is ſo true, and certaine in his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Saul,</hi> which no Witch, no Devill could ever have told;
for though the Wiſdome, and Experience of the Devill doe
enable him to conjecture probably of many events, yet poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to ſay, <hi>to morrow thou and thy Sonnes ſhall die,</hi> is more then
naturally the Devill could know.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth the Devill could not foretell the exact
time of <hi>Sauls</hi> death; and therefore hee anſwers that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the Devill as his inſtrument <hi>Sauls</hi> overthrow, by
which meanes, and no other the Devill was inabled to foretell
the death of <hi>Saul.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proves not, that Satan was
appointed by God to worke <hi>Sauls</hi> overthrow, or that it was
made known to him, when it ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>As the reſt of the Speech of <hi>Samuel</hi> is true, ſo theſe words
of his, <hi>Why haſt thou diſquieted me to bring me up?</hi> may be alſo
true, which cannot be if it be ſpoken by the Devill; or why
ſhould the Devil tell truths in all other things elſe, and lie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, I know no reaſon. Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> preſſeth theſe
words againſt the appearing of <hi>Samuel</hi> thus, <hi>If Samuel I had ſaid to
them he had lied, but Samuel could not lie, for Samuel could not be
diſquieted, nor raiſed by Saul.</hi> It is true God only raiſed <hi>Samuel
effectually,</hi> but <hi>occaſionally Saul</hi> might raiſe him. But ſaith
Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> though <hi>Saul was the occaſion, yet Samuel could
not truely ſay that</hi> Saul <hi>had diſquieted him, for bleſſed are they that
die in the Lord ſaith the spirit, becauſe they reſt from their labours;
and</hi> Samuel <hi>was no more to be diſquieted (if he were ſent by God)
then</hi> Moſes <hi>aad</hi> Elias <hi>were when they appeared to ſhew the Glory
of Christ. Mat.</hi> 17. Anſwer, it did not diſpleaſe <hi>Samuel</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Office of an Angell, but hee obeyed God gladly;
yet ſince the occaſion of his appearing diſpleaſed God, it might
for that cauſe diſpleaſe alſo <hi>Samuel.</hi> Beſides wee neede not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the diſquieting of <hi>Samuels</hi> mind, but of his body by
not ſuffering it to reſt in peace after death, according to the
common, and uſuall condition of Mankinde, this ſenſe the
Originall will well beare. Againe, it cannot be believed that the
Devill would ever have preached ſo Divine and excellent a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to <hi>Saul,</hi> which was able to have converted, and brought
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114652:16"/>
him to Repentance, this was not the way for the Devill to bring
either <hi>Saul,</hi> or the Woman to renounce God. Laſtly, the Text
doth not ſay that the Woman raiſed <hi>Samuel,</hi> yet it calls him
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſaith that <hi>Saul perceived, or underſtood that it was
Samuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and many others eſteeme <hi>Balam</hi> to have beene a
Witch, or Conjurer, but I finde no ſuch thing in the Text;
when hee was required to curſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his anſwer
was, <hi>I will bring you word as the Lord ſhall speak unto me. Numb 22.
8.</hi> and God came unto <hi>Balaam</hi> in <hi>v. 9.</hi> and in <hi>v. 13. Balaam</hi>
ſaith, <hi>the Lord refuſeth to give me leave,</hi> and when <hi>Balak</hi> ſent
a ſecond time, his anſwer was, if <hi>Balak would give me his houſe
full of ſilver and gold I cannot goe beyond the Word of the Lord my
God to do leſſe or more,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> the <hi>20.</hi> God commeth to <hi>Balaam,</hi>
and ſaid, if <hi>the Men come to call thee, go, but yet the words which
I ſhall ſay unto thee, that ſhalt thou do.</hi> And when <hi>Balaam</hi>
came before <hi>Balak</hi> hee ſaid, <hi>v. 38. Lo I am come unto thee, have
I now any power at all to ſay any thing? the Word which God putteth
into my mouth, that ſhall I ſpeake:</hi> and in the <hi>23 Chap. v. 18. Balaam</hi>
ſaith, <hi>how ſhall I curſe whom God hath not curſed?</hi> and in <hi>v. 12.</hi> hee
ſaith, <hi>muſt I not take heed to speake that which the Lord hath put
into my Mouth?</hi> Theſe places laid together prove <hi>Balaam</hi> to
have beene a true Prophet of the Lord, and hee propheſied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to the Lords command, therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls
him a Prophet.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe it is true that <hi>Balaam</hi> finned notoriouſly,
though not by being a Witch or Conjurer, or a falſe Prophet,
his faults were, that when God had told him hee ſhould not go
to <hi>Balak,</hi> yet in his covetous heart hee deſired to go, being
tempted with the rewards of Divination, and promiſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion;
ſo that upon a ſecond Meſſage from <hi>Balak</hi> hee ſtayed
the Meſſengers to ſee if God would ſuffer him to go, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord in his anger ſent <hi>Balam.</hi> Alſo when God had
told <hi>Balam</hi> that hee would bleſſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet <hi>Balam</hi> did ſtrive to
tempt God, and by ſeverall Altars and Sacrifices to change
the mind of God. Againe when <hi>Balam</hi> ſaw God immutable
in bleſſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee taught <hi>Balak to lay a ſtumbling block before
the Sonnes of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to Idolls, and to commit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114652:16"/>
Fornication. Rev.</hi> 2. 4. Whereas it is ſaid that <hi>Balaam went not up as
other times to ſeek for Enchantments, Num.</hi> 24 2. the Originall is
<hi>to meete Divinations,</hi> that is, he did not go ſeek the Lord by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
as he did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>An exact difference betweene all thoſe Arts prohibited in
<hi>Deut.</hi> no Man I thinke can give, that in ſome they did agree,
and in others differed, ſeemes probable. That they were all ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and falſe Prophets, though in ſeverall wayes, I thinke none
can deny; That they differed in their degrees of puniſhments is
poſſible, there are but three ſorts that can be proved were to
be put to death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Witch, the Familiar Spirit, the Wiſard.
As for the Witch there hath beene ſome doubt made of it. The
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that were skild in the Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> obſerve
that whereſoever one was to die by their Law, the Law alwayes
did run in an <hi>affirmative precept;</hi> as, the the Man ſhall be ſtoned,
ſhall die, ſhall be put to death, or the like; but in this Text, and
no where elſe in Scripture the ſentence is onely a <hi>Prohibition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live,</hi> and not Thou ſhalt put
her to death, or ſtone her or the like. Hence ſome have beene of
Opinion that not to ſuffer a Witch to live, was meant not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
or maintaine her by running after her, and rewarding her.
The <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſeeme to have two ſorts of Witches, ſome that did
hurt, others that did hold the Eyes, that is, by jugling and
ſleights deceived Mens ſenſes. The firſt they ſay, was to be
ſtoned, the other which according to the proper notation of the
word, was the true Witch, was only to be beaten.</p>
               <p>The Septuagent have tranſlated a Witch, an Apothecary, a
Druggiſter, one that compounds poyſons, and ſo the Latin word
for a Witch is <hi>venefica,</hi> a maker of poyſons: if any ſuch there
ever were, or be that by the helpe of t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Devill do poyſon, ſuch
a one is to be put to death, though there be no Covenant with
the Devill, becauſe ſhee is an Actor, and principall her ſelfe,
not by any wonder wrought by the Devill, but by the naturall,
or occult property of the Poyſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the time of Christ,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, though there be no
particular mention made of any ſuch Witch, yet thence it followeth not
that there were none, for all things that then happened are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and I would faine know of the chiefe Patrons of them, whether</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:114652:17"/>
                  <hi>thoſe perſons poſſeſſed with the Devill, and troubled with ſtrange
Diſeaſes, whom Chriſt healed, were not bewitched with ſome ſuch
people as our Witches are? if they ſay no, let them if they can prove the
contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be thought that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> puts his Adverſaries
to a great pinch; but it doth not prove ſo, for the Queſtion
being onely, whether thoſe that were poſſeſſed in our Saviours
Time were bewitched. The Oppoſers of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> ſay they,
were not bewitched, but if hee or any other ſay they were, the
Proofe will reſt wholy on him, or them to make good their <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative;</hi>
it cannot in reaſon be expected that his Adverſaries
ſhould prove the <hi>Negative,</hi> it is againſt the Rules of Diſputation
to require it.</p>
