         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE intent of
the following
<hi>Experiments</hi>
is twofold.
The one, To be as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>
of the Truth
of one, amongst other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi>
laid down in my
Discourse of <hi>Mixture,</hi> sc.
<hi>That it would be a Key
<pb facs="tcp:34721:5"/>
to let us easily into the
knowledge of the Nature
of Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
<hi>To be as a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen
of a Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica:</hi>
that is to say, a
multifarious Scrutiny into
the intrinsick Properties of
all those Materials, which
have been, or may be used
in <hi>Medicine:</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
whereof, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Method</hi> is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as one, amongst others,
necessary to be insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="tcp:34721:5"/>
For what Dominion a
<hi>Prince</hi> hath over the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
that a <hi>Physician</hi> hath,
as one of God Almighty's
<hi>Vice-Roys,</hi> over the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>
World. Whence
therefore nothing can more
import, than a particular
knowledge of the <hi>Genius</hi>
of all his <hi>Subjects,</hi> those
several <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi>
supposed to be under his
Command.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Experiments</hi> may
seem too numerous to be of
one <hi>make.</hi> But no less a
number would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb facs="tcp:34721:6"/>
the design of an
<hi>Universal Survey;</hi> which,
though less pleasing, proves
the more instructive in the
end: not being like ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with a single Hook;
but like casting a Net a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a shole; with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of drawing up
something. Besides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>comparing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
together;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus joyned, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
like <hi>Figures,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
ten times more, than
standing alone, they would
have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:34721:6"/>
How far the <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
all along subjoyned
have made this good, is
left to the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge.
And also, to add to them,
so many more, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for I make my own
thoughts no mans <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Those I have set
down, if compared, will, I
presume, appear easie and
natural; which is all I
shall say for them. Let
them go and take their
fortune without a <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau;</hi>
which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
to things of so glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
<pb facs="tcp:34721:7"/>
a shew, would not
serve to blazon, but extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, which they are,
that make <hi>any,</hi> or <hi>no Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</hi>
For, as some
which seem to promise it,
make none: so, many,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34721:9"/>
contrary to expectation,
make a considerable one.</p>
                  <p>Next, the <hi>manner</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Luctation</hi> is made;
being with much variety
in these <hi>five</hi> sensible <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Bullition;</hi> when the

                  <p>2. <hi>Elevation;</hi> when,

sometimes two or more
are concomitant. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Luctation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
presently upon mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and sometimes not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34721:10"/>
till after some intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In some bodies, it
continues a great while;
in others, is almost instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous:
Examples of all
which I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
beginning with
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> as affording
the least variety.</p>
                  <p>And first, if we take
Spirit or Oil of Salt, Oil of
Vitriol, Spirit of Nitre, or
Aq. fortis, and pour them
severally upon the several
parts of Vegetables, as
Roots, Woods, Stones, &amp;c.
we shall find, that they are,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34721:11"/>
generally far less apt to
make a Luctation, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal, or subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Whence, as from one
argument, it seemeth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That in most <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi>
and in most of
their parts, the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>Salt</hi> is an <hi>Acid.</hi> But
that, on the contrary, the
predominant <hi>Salt</hi> in most
<hi>Minerals,</hi> and parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi>
is an <hi>Alkaly:</hi> in
the former, usually a <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
in the latter, a <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:34721:11"/>
Again, although the
Luctation which most Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
and most of their
parts make with Acids, be
but small, yet some they
make; especially with some
Acids, as with Spirit of
Nitre and Aqua fortis.</p>
                  <p>Whence it seemeth
plain, That there is an
<hi>Alkalizate Salt</hi> existent
in many <hi>Vegetables,</hi> even
in their <hi>natural estate;</hi> and
that it is not made <hi>Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate,</hi>
but only <hi>Lixivial,</hi>
by the <hi>fire.</hi> Or, there is
some quantity of a <hi>Salt,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34721:12"/>
call it what we will, in
the said Bodies, which is
so far different from, as to
make a <hi>Luctation</hi> with an
<hi>Acid.</hi> But to give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
instances of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>proportions</hi> wherein
it appears to be in several
<hi>Vegetables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first, of all vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Bodies, Date-stones are
amongst the least apt to
make a Luctation with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
if they may be said
to make any at all.</p>
                  <p>Hence they are not so
potent <hi>Nephriticks,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34721:12"/>
other Stones, which
make a more sensible <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ginger makes a small
Bullition with Aq. fortis,
only observable by a Glass.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>pungency</hi> of
Ginger lyeth in a <hi>sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous</hi>
and <hi>volatile Salt,</hi>
which yet is very little
<hi>Alkalizate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scurvygrass-seed makes
a very small Bullition with
Aq. fortis, like that of Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
So doth also the seed
of Purslane.</p>
                  <p>Hence, although there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34721:13"/>
is much more of a certain
kind of <hi>volatile Salt</hi> in
Ginger or Scurvygrass,
than in Purslane; yet
there is as much of an
<hi>Alkaly</hi> in any one, as the
others.</p>
                  <p>Colocynthis, Fruit-stones,
the stony Covers of the seeds
of Elder, white Bryony,
Violets, and others, with
Aq. fortis make a Bulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
just perceivable without
a Glass.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, That
the great <hi>Cathartick</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Colocynthis</hi> lyeth not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34721:13"/>
in an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> but an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid;</hi>
as making a much
less <hi>Bullition,</hi> than some
other vegetable Bodies,
which are less <hi>Cathartick.</hi>
For which reason likewise
it is, That the best Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,
or Refractors of
the force of <hi>Colocynthis,</hi>
are some kinds of <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
as particularly that
of <hi>Vrine,</hi> as <hi>Riverius</hi> hath
somewhere observed.</p>
                  <p>The Root of Pyrethrum,
with Aq. fortis, makes a
Bullition and huff, in a
short time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34721:14"/>
Hence, the Cause of a
<hi>durable Heat,</hi> upon the
Tongue, is an <hi>Alkalizate
Sulphur.</hi> For the Heat of
Ginger, though <hi>greater;</hi>
yet abideth <hi>nothing near
so long</hi> as that of Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or <hi>Pyrethrum;</hi> which,
as is said, maketh also a
more sensible <hi>Bullition</hi>
with <hi>Acids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kermes-berries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
but ignorantly, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
with the said Liquor,
huff up to an equal height,
but in a somewhat longer
time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34721:14"/>
Hence they are gently
<hi>astringent; scil.</hi> as their
<hi>Alkaly</hi> binds in with some
preternatural <hi>Acid</hi> in the
stomach.</p>
                  <p>Hawthorn-stones, with
Aq. fortis, huff up equally
with the former Body; but
the Bullition is not so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The like is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
of Medlar-stones.</p>
                  <p>Hence, as they contain
a middle quantity of an
<hi>Alkaly,</hi> they are not insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
used against
the <hi>Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeds of Staphisagria,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34721:15"/>
with Aqua fortis, make a
Bulliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n still more visible.
But it quickly ends.</p>
                  <p>This confirms what was
said before, <hi>sc.</hi> That the
cause of a <hi>durable Heat</hi> is
an <hi>Alkalizate Sulphur;</hi>
these Seeds producing a
<hi>durable Heat,</hi> as doth the
Root of <hi>Pyrethrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The seeds also of red
Roses, Borage, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
do all with Aq. fortis
make a considerable Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and huff; and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quickly.</p>
                  <p>So that amongst all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34721:15"/>
Shells and Stones, those
generally make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Bullition,</hi> which are
the hardest and the brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlest.</p>
                  <p>Euphorbium makes a
Bullition yet more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
with much froth, and
very quickly.</p>
                  <p>From which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
compared with two
of the former, it appears,
That <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is not
an <hi>acid,</hi> but an <hi>alkalizate
Gum.</hi> As also, that the
cause of its so very <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heat,</hi> is an <hi>alkalizate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34721:16"/>
Sulphur,</hi> as of <hi>Pyrethrum</hi>
and <hi>Staphisagria</hi> hath
been said.</p>
                  <p>It seems also hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the power of
all great <hi>Sternutatories</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in their <hi>Acid,</hi> but
their <hi>Alkalies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arenulae or little
stones in Pears, cluster'd
round about the Coar, with
Aq. fortis, presently huff
up, and make a great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
and Effervescence,
much greater than do any
of the Bodies above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34721:16"/>
Whence, although, so
far as I know, they have
never yet been used in
<hi>Medicine;</hi> yet is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that they are a
more potent and effectual
<hi>Nephritick,</hi> than any of
the Bodies aforesaid, and
some of them usually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                  <p>It is hence also mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
That, according to
what I have elsewhere
<note n="*" place="margin">First Book of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Plants.</note> said, for the
sweetening of
the Fruit and
Seed, the <hi>tartareous</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34721:17"/>
                     <hi>alkalizate</hi> parts of the <hi>Sap</hi>
are <hi>precipitated</hi> into their
<hi>stones, stony parts, and
shells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last Instance shall
be in the shells of the seeds
of Milium Solis; which
not only with Aq. fortis,
but some other Acids, make
a greater and quicker Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
and Effervescence,
than any other vegetable
Body, upon which I have
yet made tryal, in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
estate.</p>
                  <p>Hence, as well as from
divers of the last fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34721:17"/>
Instances, we have a
clear confirmation of
what I have, towards the
beginning of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
asserted; <hi>sc.</hi> That
there is an <hi>alkalizate Salt</hi>
existent in <hi>Plants,</hi> even in
their <hi>natural estate.</hi> As
also, that they are as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
used against the
Stone, <hi>quatenus alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate,</hi>
as <hi>Millepedes, Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells,</hi>
or any other <hi>testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Bodies</hi> of the same
strength.</p>
                  <p>To these I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
one or two Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34721:18"/>
of Vegetable Bodies
which are more or less
alter'd from their <hi>natural
estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither Crystals of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
nor Tartar it self (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have some
store of alkalizate mixed
with their acid parts)
make any Effervescence
with Acids, but only with
Alkalies, as Spirit of Harts
Horn, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>calculous se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment</hi>
of <hi>Vrine,</hi> not so
properly called the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous
part</hi> of the <hi>Vrine;</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34721:18"/>
from the quite contrary
events following its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the aforesaid
<hi>Salts;</hi> as will be seen
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Scurvygrass
maketh no Luctation with
any acid.</p>
                  <p>Hence (as from a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Experiment was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-noted)
it seems,
That there may be a kind
of <hi>volatile Salt,</hi> which is
neither <hi>acid,</hi> nor <hi>alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate;</hi>
such as this of <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass</hi>
and other like
<hi>Plants</hi> seems to be: <hi>scil.</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34721:19"/>
such a <hi>Salt</hi> as is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>alkalizate,</hi> and yet
contrary to an <hi>acid;</hi> as
experience shews in its
efficacy against the <hi>acid
Scurvy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rectified Spirit of Wine,
both with Spirit of Nitre,
and with Oil of Vitriol, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
maketh a little
Luctation.</p>
                  <p>Which argues, that there
is contained, even in this
Spirit, some portion of a
<hi>volatile Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Spirit of Wine, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Aqua fortis, as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34721:19"/>
strongest is called, make an
effervescence so vehement,
as plainly to boil.</p>
                  <p>Besides the vehemence
hereof, there is another sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
circumstance. For
whereas all other Liquors
which make an Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
together, will do it
in any quantity assigned to
either of them, although
but one drop to a thousand:
on the contrary, these two,
<hi>sc.</hi> rectified Spirit of Wine
and Aqua fortis, require a
certain proportion the one
to the other. For if into
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34721:20"/>
no more than six drops of
Spirit of Wine you put in
but two or three of Aq. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
they stir no more than if
you put in so much Water:
but drop in about seven or
eight drops of Aq. fortis,
and they presently boil up
with very great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the reason of the so
very sudden access of an
<hi>acute Disease,</hi> and of its
<hi>Crisis.</hi> These not begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>gradually with the
Cause;</hi> but then, when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34721:20"/>
the <hi>Cause</hi> is arrived unto
such an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or such a
certain <hi>Proportion,</hi> as is
necessary to bring Nature
to the contest. And these
may serve for Examples
upon <hi>Vegetables.</hi>

Instances of
tryal upon <hi>Vegetables;</hi> I
next proceed to <hi>Minerals,</hi>
which, for some orders
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34721:21"/>
sake, I shall distribute
into five or six sorts, <hi>sc.
Earths, Stones, Ores</hi> and
<hi>Metals, Sulphurs,</hi> and
<hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First for Earths. Oil of
Vitr. upon Fullers Earth,
doth not stir it, or cause
the least Bullition. Nor
upon yellow Oker. Nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Oker which falls
from green Vitriol. The
same Oil of Vitr. and Spir.
of H. Horn poured seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
upon Bolus Armena
of two kinds, and upon one
kind of Terra sigillata, stir
none of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34721:21"/>
Hence <hi>Bolus</hi>'s are the
<hi>Beds,</hi> or as it were, the
<hi>Materia prima,</hi> both of
opacous <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;</hi>
into which the said
<hi>Bolus</hi>'s are transmuted,
by being <hi>concentred</hi> with
divers kinds of <hi>Salts</hi> and
<hi>Sulphurs,</hi> which succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
flow in upon them.</p>
                  <p>Aqua fortis, and Oil of
Vitr. being poured several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon another sealed
Earth, which was vended
by the name of Terra Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;
they both made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
considerable Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34721:22"/>
herewith.</p>
                  <p>Whence it appears,
That there is no small
difference in the nature,
and therefore the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Bolus Armena</hi> and
<hi>Terra Lemnia.</hi> As also,
betwixt the sealed Earths
themselves, one making a
great <hi>Effervescence,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
none at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
those that use them,
are to have regard.</p>
                  <p>Next for Stones. And
first Spir. of Nitre upon
Tripoly, stirreth it not in
the least.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34721:22"/>
                     <hi>Irish Slate, with Spirit
of Harts-horn, maketh a

and it presently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</hi>
So that it seems to
be nothing else but a
<hi>Vitriolick Bole.</hi> As is
also argued from its taste,
which is plainly acid, and
somewhat rough.</p>
                  <p>Whence also it is with
good reason given upon
any inward Bruises. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by coagulating the
Blood, it prohibits its too
copious afflux into the
affected part. Yet being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34721:23"/>
but gently astringent, and
so the Coagulations it
makes, not great; they
are likewise well enough
carried off from the same
part in the Circulation;
by both which means an
Inflammation may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prevented, or the
better over-ruled.</p>

Acid.</p>
                  <p>Osteocolla, with Spirit

                  <p>How it comes to be

that upon its solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

by a <hi>Nitrous acid</hi> in

upon the broken

                  <p>Lapis Tuthiae, with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

Effervescence much alike.
And with Oil of Vitriol
very considerably.</p>
                  <p>But Lapis Calaminaris
with Oil of Vitriol grows
stark; as the powder of
Alabaster doth with water.
With spirit of Nitre it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a little Bullition, and
quickly. But with Aq. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34721:25"/>
a great one; beyond
any of the stones above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named.</p>
                  <p>Hence both <hi>Tutty</hi> and

from their <hi>Alkaly.</hi> Which
is also confirmed, from
the efficacy of some <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies</hi>

                  <p>Hence also <hi>Calamy</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

strong an Effervescence as
any of the rest.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whiting makes as great
an Effervescence as Chalk.</hi>
So that it seems the saline

with the water,
wherein the Chalk, for
the making of Whiting,
is dissolved.</p>
                  <p>Talk will not stir in

                  <p>But that which is called

the Lead-Spar maketh a

                  </p>
                  <p>To these stones may be

whereof Oil of Vitriol be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Oil of Vitriol, maketh an
Effervescence at the same
degree. So doth the Belem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
or Thunder-stone,
both the larger and the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

                  <p>So that none of these

red and white Coral do the

                  <p>Hence they are all of

                  <p>Copper, with Spirit of

Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua

With Spirit of Nitre it

Principle is altogether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,

by the fire.</p>
                  <p>Lastly for Salts. And
first of all, Borax maketh
no Effervescence nor any
Fumes with Oyl of Vitriol
or Spirit of Nitre.</p>
                  <p>Hence, it is of a very
different nature from <hi>Salt
Armoniac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oyl of Vitriol and Nitre
make fumes or steams,
though no Effervescence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34721:35"/>
Green Vitriol, with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Harts-horn, is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved. White Vitriol,
with the same Spirit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a conspicuous huff.
And Roman Vitriol a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
Effervescence.</p>
                  <p>Whence the <hi>former</hi> is
the <hi>least acid,</hi> and the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the most of all.</hi> Which
also confirms what I said
before of the like natures
of the several <hi>Metals</hi> to
which they belong.</p>
                  <p>Salt of Vitriol, though a
fixed Salt, and made by
Calcination, yet maketh no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34721:36"/>
Effervescence with the
strongest acid; but only
with Alkalies; as may be
seen upon their mixture,
but much better heard by
holding the mixture to
ones ear.</p>
                  <p>Hence, there are <hi>fixed
Acids.</hi> Which further
confirms what I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
asserted concerning
the nature of <hi>Gold, scil.</hi>
That the <hi>predominant Salt</hi>
thereof is a <hi>fixed Acid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sal Martis, with Spirit
of Harts-horn, maketh a
considerable huff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34721:36"/>
Hence it is much more
<hi>acid</hi> than <hi>green Vitriol;</hi>
and is therefore a cooler
body.</p>
                  <p>Alum and Sp. of Harts-horn
make a plain Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence.</p>
                  <p>Saccharum Saturni with
Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not at
all. With Spirit of Salt,
huffs a little. With Spirit
of Nitre much more.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>acid</hi> of the
<hi>Vinegar,</hi> and not the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly</hi>
of the <hi>Lead,</hi> is the
predominant Principle.</p>
                  <p>Common Salt stirs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34721:37"/>
with Spirit of Salt,
nor with Spirit of Nitre;
nor with Aq. fortis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
with Oyl of Vitriol it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a great Effervescence
with noise and steams.</p>
                  <p>Hence, even common
Salt, though it be not
reckoned amongst <hi>alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate
Salts,</hi> yet is far
nearer in nature to <hi>that,</hi>
than to an <hi>acid.</hi> Hence
also the <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> is a
<hi>subalkalizate Acid,</hi> and of
a very different nature
from <hi>Oyl of Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</hi>

Salt Armoniac, with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre, stirreth not.
But with Oyl of Vitriol it
maketh a great Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence</hi> spirit <hi>of</hi> Nitre <hi>is
a</hi> subalkalizate spirit.</p>
                  <p>Oyl of Vitriol and spirit
of Nitre, though both acids,
yet make a great smoak;
greater than that which
the spirit maketh of it self.
<hi>Which confirms the last
preceding</hi> Corollary.</p>
                  <p>Oyl of Vitriol and spirit
of Salt, though both acids,

at several terms, from

                  <p>The reason hereof is,
Because the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the greatest part
driven away by the fire;
the remaining <hi>Salt</hi> lies
now more open and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the attaque of the
<hi>Menstruum,</hi> so soon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>From hence it is plain,
That <hi>Egg-shells,</hi> and the

                  <p>To these may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
all kinds of shelly
Insects. I will instance in
three or four.</p>
                  <p>And first Bees, with Oyl
of Vitriol, stir not in the
least. With spirit of Nitre
they make an exceeding
small Bullition, without
any elevation.</p>
                  <p>Cochinele makes some
Bullition with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34721:45"/>
but very small: for
the bubbles are not to be
seen without a Glass. But
with spirit of Nitre the
Bullition is more visible,
and joyned with some ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Cantharides make no
visible Bullition with Oyl
of Vitriol. But with spirit
of Nitre they do, and huff
up rather more than Cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nele.
Yet is this done very
slowly, and comparatively
with many other bodies, is
not much.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is not the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34721:45"/>
                     <hi>quantity,</hi> but the <hi>quality</hi>
of their <hi>volatile Salt,</hi>
which makes them so
strong an <hi>Epispastick.</hi> For
most of those bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and hereafter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
make a greater <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi>
and yet are neither
<hi>Caustick</hi> nor <hi>Epispastick</hi>
in the least.</p>
                  <p>It is hence also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as hath been before
suggested, That there are
divers kinds of <hi>volatile
Salts,</hi> eminently diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
some being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>alkalizate,</hi> others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34721:46"/>
                     <hi>little,</hi> and some scarce
any thing so: such as
those of <hi>Scurvygrass, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemone,
Crowfoot,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the like <hi>Plants;</hi> to
whose <hi>Salts,</hi> this of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi>
seemeth to be
very near of kin.</p>
                  <p>Millepedes make a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
and huff, much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and quicker, than any
of the Insects above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
and that both with
spirit of Nitre, and Oyl of
Virtriol it self. Yet is this
Insect of a very temperate
nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34721:46"/>
Whereby is further
demonstrated, That the
being <hi>simply alkalizate,</hi> is
not enough to make a
body to be <hi>Caustick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, although Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
make a Bullition,
greater than any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects
above-named: yet is
it much less, than that of
Oyster, Snail, or even Egg-shells;
and of divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies above, and
hereafter mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Hence, being given to
the same intent, as any of
those bodies; it is the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34721:47"/>
mildest and gentlest in
its operation of them all.</p>
                  <p>Millepedes likewise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
make a stronger Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescence,
than when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calcined,
as do Oyster-shells,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So that it appears, That
<hi>all Testaceous Salts,</hi> are, at
least in part, <hi>fixed Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I next proceed to Bones.
And first Whale-bone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no Bullition at all
with any acid.</p>
                  <p>A Cartilage, with spirit
of Nitre, makes some very
small bubbles, not to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34721:47"/>
seen without a Glass.</p>
                  <p>The Bone in the Throat
of a Carp, makes a little
and slow Bullition with
spirit of Nitre.</p>
                  <p>The Spina of a Fish
(that which I used was of
a Cod-fish) maketh a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
one degree higher.</p>
                  <p>All sorts of Teeth, as of
Dogs, Boars, the Sea-Horse,
Elephant, make the
like. As also the Bone of an
Oxes heart.</p>
                  <p>So that all these are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gentle in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and fit for <hi>Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34721:48"/>
Sheeps and Calves Bones
both of them make a Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yet a little higher, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
with spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
                  <p>Cocks Bones somewhat
higher than the former.</p>
                  <p>Cranium humanum a
little higher than all the
rest.</p>
                  <p>Bones likewise, being
calcined, make a Bullition
with Acids. And so doth
also calcined Harts-horn.
But in neither of them, is
the Bullition advanced by
Calcination, any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34721:48"/>
to what it is in
shells.</p>
                  <p>Whence it appears,
That the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Horns</hi>
and <hi>Bones,</hi> is much more
<hi>volatile,</hi> than that of <hi>Shells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next for Flesh and the
several Viscera. And first,
dryed and powdered Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
with Oyl of Vitriol,
stirs not at all. But with
spirit of Nitre makes a
small Bullition and huff.</p>
                  <p>Sheeps Heart doth the
like somewhat more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
                  <p>Vipers flesh produceth a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34721:49"/>
froth, but huffs not.</p>
                  <p>Powdered Earth-worms
make a great froth, and
huff a little.</p>
                  <p>Powdered Tripe makes
only a little Bullition.</p>
                  <p>Lamb-stones do the like.</p>
                  <p>Kidney, Spleen, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with some elevation.</p>
                  <p>Lungs, with bubbles
very large; because extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
slowly.</p>
                  <p>Dryed Brain makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a little and slow Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Hence, there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proportion of <hi>Sulphur</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:34721:49"/>
or <hi>Oyl,</hi> and less of <hi>an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly
in all these parts,</hi> than
there is in <hi>Bones, Shells,</hi>
and divers other <hi>parts</hi>
hereafter mentioned. And
in some of them, as in the
<hi>Brain,</hi> that <hi>Salt</hi> which
there is, may rather be
lodged in some <hi>sanguine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
parts mixed with
them, than in their own
proper substance.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to instance
in all sorts of Animal <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first, raw Silk,
with spirit of Nitre, makes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34721:50"/>
a very small Bullition, but
the elevation is considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>The grumous part of the
Blood dryed, with Oyl of
Vitriol, stirs but little. But
with spirit of Nitre it huffs
up considerably.</p>
                  <p>Serum of Blood dryed,
with the same spirit, makes
a plain elevation, with a
little Bullition.</p>
                  <p>Herewith may be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the White of an Egg,
which is nothing but a pure
Crystalline Serum separated
from the common stock.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34721:50"/>
This being dryed, with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre, huffs up rather
more than even the gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
part of the Blood, the
bubbles are much larger,
break oftner, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
sooner made.</p>
                  <p>Whence it seemeth,
that there is a greater
quantity of a <hi>volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly</hi>
in proportion to the
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> requisite to the
<hi>Generation,</hi> than to the
<hi>Nutrition</hi> of an Animal.</p>
                  <p>The Yolk of an Egg is
scarce moved with spirit of
Nitre, producing only a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34721:51"/>
few Bubbles. <hi>The</hi> Salt
<hi>being either little</hi> alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate,
<hi>or else</hi> immersed <hi>in
so great a quantity of</hi> Oyl,
<hi>that the</hi> Menstruum <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the same reason
Sperma Ceti stirs not with
any Acid. Neither doth
Civet.</p>
                  <p>Russian Castor, with Oyl
of Vitriol, stirs not. But
with spirit of Nitre makes
a considerable huff and
froth. Yet it requires time.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it seemeth,
That <hi>Castor</hi> by virtue of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34721:51"/>
its <hi>alkalizate Sulphur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
so good a <hi>Corrector</hi>
of the <hi>acido-alkalizate
Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Opium:</hi> so I
take leave to call it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some reasons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it such.</p>
                  <p>Musk, with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
stirs not. But with
spirit of Nitre it makes a
considerable and quick Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,
with large bubbles,
which often break and rise
again.</p>
                  <p>Whence there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eminent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Musk</hi> and <hi>Civet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:34721:52"/>
Hence also, <hi>Musk</hi> is
Cordial, not only from
its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but its <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
by both directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to preternatural
<hi>Acidities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dryed Gall with spirit
of Nitre for some time is
still: but at length it
makes a considerable Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
and froth.</p>
                  <p>The reason why it is
so long before it begins,
is because the <hi>Salt,</hi> (as
was observed of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Parts)</hi> is <hi>locked</hi> up
in so great a quantity of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34721:52"/>
                     <hi>Oyl.</hi> The abundance
whereof is manifest, not
only from <hi>Destillation,</hi> but
also from hence, In that
the dryed <hi>Powder,</hi> in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by, incorporateth all
together into one body,
as <hi>Mirrh,</hi> and some other
softer and oily <hi>Gums</hi> are
used to do.</p>
                  <p>Extract of Vrine, with
spirit of Nitre, makes a
Bullition with some Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence,
which continues
for a considerable time;
and at last it huffs up with
great bubbles. The Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34721:53"/>
begins presently: the
Salt being copious, and the
Oyl but little.</p>
                  <p>The same Extract of
Vrine makes a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bullition and froth, not
only with spirit of Nitre,
but even with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
is more <hi>alkalizate</hi>
than that in most of the
afore-said <hi>Contents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this and some of
the following <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
it also appears,
That the <hi>Salt</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34721:53"/>
to the generation or
constitution of <hi>Gravel</hi> or
of a <hi>Stone</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys</hi>
or <hi>Bladder;</hi> is of a very
different nature from the
<hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Vrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next for Dungs. And
first, dryed Goats-dung
makes, with spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
a small bullition, but
no elevation. That of Mice
the like. And that of Cows.
So that of all I have tryed,
these three stir the least.</p>
                  <p>Goose-dung, with spirit
of Nitre, makes a very
small bullition and some
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34721:54"/>
elevation. But it requires
time. Oyl of Vitriol stirs it
not.</p>
                  <p>Album Graecum, with
spirit of Nitre, besides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
small bubbles,
rises up with some great
ones, exactly resembling
the huffing up of Yest or
Barm. Also with Oyl of
Vitriol it maketh some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
froth, but slowly.</p>
                  <p>So that it should seem,
that the <hi>Bones</hi> are a little
<hi>opened</hi> by some <hi>acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
in the Dogs sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
(as the body of <hi>Steel</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:34721:54"/>
is in its preparation with
<hi>Sulphur)</hi> whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a good mild <hi>Topick</hi>
in <hi>Quinzies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hens dung, with spirit
of Nitre, makes a very
great bullition and huff:
greater and quicker, than
any of the rest above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>But of all I have tryed,
Pigeons dung, with the
same Spirit, maketh the
greatest and the quickest
Effervescence and huff;
and that not without
steams. Yet neither the same
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34721:55"/>
Dung, nor that of Hens,
is moved in the least with
Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>The cause of so great
an <hi>Effervescence</hi> in these,
more than in the rest, is
that <hi>white part</hi> which is
here mixed in a great
quantity with the <hi>Dung.</hi>
Which <hi>white part,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
not from the
<hi>Stomach,</hi> but is an <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
separated from the
<hi>Blood</hi> (as are <hi>Gall</hi> and the
<hi>Succus Pancreaticus)</hi> by
a peculiar <hi>Organ,</hi> which
evacuates it into the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinum
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34721:55"/>
rectum;</hi> whence,
together with the <hi>Stercus,</hi>
it is excluded.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident,
That in the said <hi>white
part</hi> of <hi>Hen's,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Pigeons dung,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a great quantity of
a <hi>volatile Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proceed to Salts. And
first Salt of Blood and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
both make a more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effervescence with
Acids, than doth Salt of
Wormwood, or Salt of
Fern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34721:56"/>
Hence the former are
more <hi>alkalizate,</hi> than the
latter.</p>
                  <p>Again, though divers
other Animal Salts will
not stir with Spirit of Salt,
or with Oyl of Sulphur or
Vitriol; yet the Salt of
Blood will make an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
with all kinds of
Acids.</p>
                  <p>Whence it is further
argued to be highly <hi>alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate,</hi>
and very proper
for the <hi>correction</hi> of all
sorts of <hi>preternatural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:34721:56"/>
in the body. There
is little doubt, but that
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> will
do the like.</p>
                  <p>The Tartar or Gravel
which precipitates out of
Vrine, with Oyl of Vitriol,
makes no bullition in the
least. Nor with strong spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Salt. But with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre, it makes a
very great one, with Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
and steams.</p>
                  <p>From hence it appears,
That there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be made in the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34721:57"/>
use of <hi>acid Diureticks,
Nephriticks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And that I may not
altogether omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what may be so
much for the good of
mankind, I do here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
That for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the generation of the
<hi>Stone,</hi> either in the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi>
or in the <hi>Bladder,</hi>
there are not better <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines</hi>
in the world, than
some certain <hi>Preparations</hi>
of <hi>Nitre,</hi> duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
Who-ever shall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34721:57"/>
think that any kind of
<hi>acid,</hi> as <hi>Oyl of Sulphur,
Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of
Salt,</hi> or the like, will have
the same effects, will find
themselves much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in their practice.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with Stones.
And first, Spirit of Nitre
dropped upon a Stone of the
Kidneys or Bladder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the very same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as upon the Gravel
in Vrine. That is to say,
it makes it boil and huff
up, until at length it is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34721:58"/>
perfectly dissolved into a
soft Pulp; which neither
Oyl of Sulphur, nor Oyl of
Vitriol, nor Spirit of Salt
will do; nor give the
least touch towards its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
                  <p>This confirms what I
said before of the use of
<hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Nitrous Spirits,</hi>
if duly prepared and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Acids,</hi> against the
<hi>Store.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pearls, with any Acid,
make the like Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34721:58"/>
as do Oyster-shells.</p>
                  <p>Magistery of Pearls, as
usually prepared, stirs not
at all, with any Alkaly or
Acid.</p>
                  <p>So that as to the effect
frequently intended by
it, it is very insignificant;
as of that of <hi>Corals</hi> hath
been said.</p>
                  <p>Crabs Eyes, with any
Acid, make an Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
almost as quick as
that of Oyster-shells.</p>
                  <p>Crabs Eyes likewise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
make a stronger Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescence,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34721:59"/>
than when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calcined.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>these,</hi> as well
as <hi>Shells,</hi> contain a <hi>fixed
Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The stones in Whitings
heads make a strong Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
like that of Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shells.</p>
                  <p>Stone of humane Gall,
stirs not with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.
But with spirit of
Nitre maketh a little bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
just upon mixing, and
after a considerable time, a
little froth. Much less than
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34721:59"/>
what was observed before
of the Gall it self.</p>
                  <p>So that it seemeth to
be generated of the <hi>Gall
coagulated</hi> by some <hi>Acid,</hi>
which hath already <hi>refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
the <hi>Alkaly</hi> wherewith
the <hi>Gall</hi> abounds.</p>
                  <p>This confirms the use
of those <hi>Medicines</hi> in the
<hi>Jaundies,</hi> or any other
bordering <hi>Disease,</hi> which
destroys those <hi>Acidities</hi>
by which the <hi>Gall</hi> is <hi>curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
or <hi>coagulated,</hi> and so
rendred more difficultly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34721:60"/>
separable into the <hi>Guts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bezoar, neither the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,
nor the Eastern, doth
stir at all with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
                  <p>Western Bezoar, with
spirit of Nitre, makes a
very little thin froth, and
that's all; and that it doth
very slowly.</p>
                  <p>But Oriental Bezoar,
with spirit of Nitre, after
some time, maketh a very
great Effervescence, with
froth, elevation, noise, and
steams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as if you poured
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34721:60"/>
Oyl of Vitriol upon Salt of
Tartar) till it be wholly
dissolved by the affused
Spirit, and turned into al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a blood-red.</p>
                  <p>Hence it may seem to
be no mean <hi>Remedy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such <hi>fretting</hi> and
<hi>venenate Acids,</hi> as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in <hi>Feavers,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Distempers,</hi> lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and are
thence frequently tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to the <hi>Heart, Brain,
Nerves,</hi> and other <hi>parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difference like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34721:61"/>
betwixt the <hi>Western,</hi>
and the <hi>Eastern Bezoar,</hi>
is so great, that in any
case of danger, and where
the <hi>Bezoar</hi> is relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is an unpardonable
fault, for the <hi>Apothecary,</hi>
or any <hi>Person,</hi> to <hi>substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
the one for the other:
unless he will take <hi>ten
times</hi> as much, or <hi>ten
times</hi> as little of the one,
as he would have done of
the other: if that will
serve turn.</p>
                  <p>The Stones already
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34721:61"/>
mentioned, are ordinarily
generated in the bodies
of Animals. I have one
instance more of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stones which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
In the City
of <hi>Hereford</hi> lives a Maid,
who often voids these
stones, and in the space
of some years last past,
hath voided several
pounds, of several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and sizes, not only
<hi>per vias urinarias,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by vomit, and by stool.
The first mention made
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34721:62"/>
to me of them, was by
Mr <hi>Digges,</hi> a worthy
Gentleman of that City,
as a thing that was there
much wondred at. And
some of them, upon my
desire, were sent me by
Mr. <hi>Wellington,</hi> a noted
Apothecary in the same
place. <hi>I have tryed what
several acid Menstruums
will work upon them; and
find, That with Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
and especially with
spirit of Nitre the great
ones make a very quick and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34721:62"/>
conspicuous Effervescence.
But the small ones, neither
the white, nor the grey,
make any bullition in the
least:</hi> for in truth, they
are no other but little
Pebble and greet Stones.</p>
                  <p>This being considered,
and the various <hi>colours</hi>
and <hi>mixture</hi> of any one of
the great <hi>Stones,</hi> being
well observed; it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
plain, That although
she be somewhat old (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
thirty years) yet
may she have a kind of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34721:63"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>diseased Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi>
to <hi>Stones, Bones, Wood-ashes,
Tabaco-pipes, Chalk,</hi>
and such like things;
which sometimes swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in little <hi>lumps,</hi>
sometimes grosly, or fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>ground</hi> betwixt her
teeth; they are in her
<hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Bowels,</hi> more
or fewer of them, <hi>cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
together, either with
a <hi>pituitous, bilious,</hi> or
some other more or less
<hi>glutinous substance.</hi> And
that by virtue also of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34721:63"/>
said <hi>Cement,</hi> or any of
the said, or other like <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizate
Bodies,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Stones,</hi> which consist
of those partly, do make
an <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>acid
Liquors.</hi> Thus far of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
upon the <hi>parts</hi> of
<hi>Animals.</hi> I shall close
with some <hi>Corollaries</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the whole.</p>
                  <p>And first, since we
find, that amongst all the
<hi>Menstruums</hi> we have
made use of, <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
or any very <hi>Nitrous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34721:64"/>
Spirit,</hi> is the most <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
dissolver</hi> of all kinds
of <hi>Animal bodies;</hi> the
<hi>best dissolver</hi> of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
both <hi>Vegetable</hi> and
<hi>Mineral,</hi> and the <hi>only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solver</hi>
of some: Hence
it is probable, That the
great <hi>stomachick Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
which either <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves,</hi>
or <hi>opens</hi> almost all
<hi>Bodies</hi> which come into
the <hi>Stomach,</hi> is a kind of
<hi>Nitrous Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi>
being a <hi>subalkalizate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:34721:64"/>
and working more
evidently upon <hi>Animal
bodies,</hi> than other <hi>simpler
Acids</hi> do, which yet are
as <hi>strong;</hi> It hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
That most of the
<hi>Salts</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> are <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid
Alkalies.</hi> How far
this <hi>conclusion</hi> may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instruct us, I shall
have occasion to shew in
another <hi>Discourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, there being so
many, say twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>degrees,</hi> from the <hi>slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
to the most <hi>vehement,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:34721:65"/>
in the <hi>Bullition</hi> of <hi>mixed
Bodies;</hi> it seemeth, That
<hi>Fermentation</hi> it self, as
to the <hi>formal notion</hi> of it,
is nothing else: or that
from the common <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>
of <hi>mixed Bodies</hi>
whereof we have now bin
speaking, it differs not
<hi>in specie,</hi> but only in the
manner of its <hi>causation,</hi>
and in <hi>degree:</hi> the <hi>Aer,</hi>
or some certain <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
lodged therein,
being of no greater
<hi>strength,</hi> than to produce
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34721:65"/>
a <hi>Bullition</hi> or <hi>Luctation</hi>
of that <hi>low</hi> and <hi>soft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
which we call <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have thus endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prove, by various
<hi>Instances,</hi> how instructive
this most easie, plain and
simple <hi>Method</hi> in the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of bodies, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to us: &amp; that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by observing the <hi>Lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which thence arise
betwixt them. How much
more then, if a diligent
remarque be made of all
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34721:66"/>
those various <hi>Colours,
Smells, Tastes, Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and other <hi>Mutations</hi>
thereupon emergent?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:34721:69"/>
                     <hi>Discourse</hi> to

I cannot say, unless

                  <p>Another Reason,

I could not
<pb facs="tcp:34721:69"/>
but publickly return
Your <hi>Lordship</hi> thanks,
for minding the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

a way, as they are
lately resolved upon,
for the management
of a great part of
their business. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
my <hi>Lord,</hi> I do
more then presume,
that I also speak the
sense of the whole

<pb facs="tcp:34721:70"/>
not any one except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>I may with the

my <hi>Lord,</hi> how
happy they account
themselves, in having
a <hi>Person</hi> so fit to
preside their Affairs,
as Your <hi>Lordship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
The largeness of Your
Knowledge, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
of Your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the evenness
<pb facs="tcp:34721:70"/>
of Your Comport;
being some of those
necessary Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
had in His eye,
(as right well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
what He
did) when He fixed
His choice upon Your
<hi>Lordship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
that there are some
men, who have just
so much understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:34721:71"/>
as only to teach
them how to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious:
the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of whom, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like the tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Children, till
they fall a dancing.
But I also know,
that Your <hi>Lordship</hi>
unconcerneth your self
as much, in what I
even now spake; as
<hi>Caesar</hi> did himself,
when his <hi>Souldiers</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:34721:71"/>
began to style him
<hi>King.</hi> For as he
said, <hi>Non Rex, sed
Caesar:</hi> so let Your
<hi>Lordship</hi> be but once
nam'd, and all that
follows, is but a
<hi>Tautology</hi> to what
You are already known
to be. Your being
<hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

the <hi>first</hi> that was
chosen, and <hi>chosen</hi>

by so Wise a <hi>King;</hi>
amounteth to so high
and real a <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
to Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
as maketh ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
ones to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
and leaves
them without any
sound.</p>
                  <p>Whence, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
I have a third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
most naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent;
which is,
that I dare to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:34721:72"/>
my self, as to
what I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
said, to Your
<hi>Lordships</hi> Censure.
You being so able,
and just an Arbiter,
betwixt the same and
all those persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
concern'd; that
You can neither be
deceived, nor corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in any Point,
to the injury of either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:34721:73"/>
And truly, my
<hi>Lord,</hi> were it only
from a principle of
self-interest, yet I could
not desire it should
be otherwise. For
the <hi>World,</hi> if it
lives, will certainly
grow as much wiser
then it is; as it is
now wiser then it
was heretofore. So
that we have as
little reason, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb facs="tcp:34721:73"/>
                     <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as
we can have willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that we our
selves should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by <hi>Posterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet some difference
there is to be made;
<hi>viz.</hi> betwixt those of
all <hi>Ages,</hi> who have
been modestly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and those who
have thought, or
pretended, that they
were Omniscient. Or
<pb facs="tcp:34721:74"/>
if knowing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that they
were ignorant; have
yet not been content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be so; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
with as good
manners, as sense,
they did conjure all
Mankind, not to offer
at the knowing any
more then themselves.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the whole,
my <hi>Lord,</hi> I desire
not You should be
<pb facs="tcp:34721:74"/>
a <hi>Patron,</hi> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then You are
a <hi>Judge.</hi> For if
this small <hi>Essay</hi> hath
deserved the least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
I am sure,
that in being one,
You will be both.
Whereby, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
You will not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<hi>What</hi> it is.</p>

the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> or
say, <hi>How</hi> it is made.</p>

                     <p>FIRST, As to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
not to trouble you
with tedious quotations of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34721:77"/>
what <hi>Aristotle, Galen, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,
Scaliger, Sennertus,
Riverius,</hi> and others say
hereof; we may suppose
the whole summed up in
that <hi>Definition</hi> which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
himself hath given of
it, and which the greater
number of his Followers,
have almost religiously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to; <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

as it is usually expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
is both <hi>Vnintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and <hi>Vnuseful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things are <hi>unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible;</hi>
what they mean by
<hi>Alteration;</hi> and what by
<hi>Vnion.</hi> In this <hi>Alteration,</hi>
they say, That the very
<hi>Forms</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> are
<hi>alter'd.</hi> And therefore lay
it down for an <hi>Axiom, Quòd
in Mixto, Formae Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
tantum sint in potentia.</hi>
But let us see the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34721:78"/>
For if in a <hi>mixed</hi>
body, the <hi>Forms</hi> of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements</hi>
are but <hi>in potentia;</hi>
then the <hi>Elements</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are but <hi>in potentia:</hi>
for we all say, <hi>Forma dat
esse.</hi> And if the <hi>Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elements,</hi> are only <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia;</hi>
then the <hi>Compound;
Body</hi> it self can be only <hi>in
potentia:</hi> yet to say it is no
more, is most absurd.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements</hi>
in a <hi>mixed Body;</hi>
they make it such, as brings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34721:79"/>
them at last to assert, the
<hi>Penetration</hi> of <hi>bodies,</hi> and
that the <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
is nothing else. For
they say, it is made in such
sort, that every particle of
the <hi>mixed body,</hi> partaketh of
the <hi>Nature</hi> of the whole.
Which <hi>Nature,</hi> ariseth from
the contemperated <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the four <hi>Elements.</hi>
Whence they conclude,
That every particle of the
<hi>mixed body,</hi> containeth in it
self all the four <hi>Elements.</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:34721:79"/>
Which is plainly to assert a
<hi>penetration</hi> of <hi>bodies.</hi> For
every <hi>Element</hi> is, at least,
one particle; if therefore
every particle of the mixed
body, containeth four <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements;</hi>
then four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
are but one. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi>
is <hi>Vnintelligible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it follows, That
it is also <hi>Barren</hi> and <hi>Vnuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
For who can make
any use of that which he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34721:80"/>
understandeth not? And
the experience of so many
years, wherein it hath been
ventilated by the disputes
of men, proveth as much:
Scarce any of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi>
daring to venture upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
for fear they
should come to understand
themselves.</p>
                     <p>It is confessed, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gallant things have been
found out by artificial <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
But no thanks to this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34721:80"/>
                        <hi>Definition</hi> of it. For as an
<hi>Ignorant</hi> Person may make
bad <hi>Work,</hi> and a good <hi>Rule</hi>
be never the worse; so an
<hi>Ingenious</hi> Person may make
good <hi>Work,</hi> and a bad <hi>Rule</hi>
be never the better. The
question is not, what have
men done? but what have
they done upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<hi>Quòd Mixtio sit mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibilium
alteratorum unio.</hi>
Had this ever taught them
to do any thing, even so
much as to make the <hi>Ink</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34721:81"/>
wherewith they have wrote
all their <hi>Disputes;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
they would have had
something to shew for it.
But the truth is, their <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of <hi>Mixture,</hi> have been
so far from doing us any
good, that they have done
us much harm: being,
through their seeming sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety,
but real absurdity,
as so many phantastick
Spectrums, serving only to
affright men from coming
near them, or the Subject
whereof they treat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34721:81"/>
I shall therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to open the true <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of <hi>Mixture.</hi> And I shall
build my <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon
the <hi>Common Notions</hi> of <hi>Sense:</hi>
which none can <hi>deny;</hi> and
every one may <hi>conceive</hi> of.
In order to which, I shall
take leave to lay down
some <hi>Propositions,</hi> of the
<hi>Principles</hi> of all <hi>mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>SECT. II.</head>
                     <p>1. AND first, by <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
I mean <hi>Atomes,</hi>
or certain <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi>
or of the <hi>simplest</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi>
For otherwise they would
not be <hi>Principles;</hi> for a
<hi>compounded Principle,</hi> in strict
speaking, is a <hi>contradiction.</hi>
Even as <hi>fives, threes,</hi> or
<hi>twos,</hi> are not the <hi>Principles</hi>
of <hi>Number,</hi> but <hi>Vnites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Whence, secondly,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34721:82"/>
it follows, that they are
also <hi>Indivisible.</hi> Not <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically;</hi>
for the <hi>Atomes</hi> of
every <hi>Principle</hi> have their
<hi>dimensions.</hi> But <hi>Physically;</hi>
and so, what is but <hi>one,</hi>
cannot be made <hi>two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be asked, Whether
a Stick cut with a knife,
be not of one, made two?
I say, that a Stick, is not
<hi>one</hi> body, but <hi>many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of bodies; that is, of
<hi>Atomes;</hi> not any one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is <hi>divided</hi> within it self,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34721:83"/>
but only they are <hi>separated</hi>
each from other, where
the Knife forceth its way.
As in the drawing of a
mans Finger through an
heap of Corn; there is no
<hi>division</hi> made in any one
<hi>Grain,</hi> but only a <hi>separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
all remaining still in
themselves entire. I say
therefore, that what is <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically
one,</hi> is also most firm,
and <hi>indivisible;</hi> that is, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable:</hi>
for <hi>penetration</hi> is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34721:83"/>
but the <hi>separation,</hi> not the
<hi>division</hi> of <hi>Atomes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Hence, thirdly, they
are also <hi>Immutable.</hi> For
that which cannot be <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
cannot be <hi>chang'd.</hi> So
that of the whole World of
<hi>Atomes,</hi> not any one hath
ever suffer'd, or can suffer
the least <hi>mutation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon is grounded
the <hi>Constancy</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi> and
<hi>Effects.</hi> So that, in all <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi>
it is not less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the self same
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34721:84"/>
                        <hi>Principle</hi> is still <hi>propagated</hi>
from the same; than, that
<hi>Man</hi> is from <hi>Man.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Compounded</hi> bodies
are <hi>generated;</hi> but <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
are not, but only <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated;</hi>
that is, in every
<hi>Generation,</hi> they pass, in
themselves unaltered, from
one body, into another.</p>
                     <p>4. If <hi>Principles,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
are all <hi>Immutable;</hi> it
again follows, That they
are of <hi>divers kinds.</hi> For
one and the same <hi>Principle,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34721:84"/>
or <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi> will still
<hi>make</hi> the <hi>same</hi> thing, and
have the <hi>same effect:</hi> so
that all <hi>Generations</hi> would
then be the <hi>same.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since they are <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
they must be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. This <hi>diversity,</hi> for
the same reason, is not
small, but very <hi>numerous.</hi>
For as the <hi>World,</hi> taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
is <hi>Natures Shop;</hi>
so the <hi>Principles</hi> of Things,
are her <hi>Tools,</hi> and her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials.</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34721:85"/>
Wherefore, as it
speaks the <hi>goodness</hi> of a
<hi>Shop;</hi> so the <hi>perfection</hi> of the
<hi>Vniverse,</hi> That it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with many <hi>Tools</hi>
wherewith, and many <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi>
whereupon to <hi>work.</hi>
And consequently, that
<hi>Philosophy</hi> beareth best its
own name; which doth
not strain all to two or three
<hi>Principles,</hi> like two or three
Bells in a Steeple, making
a pittiful <hi>Chime:</hi> but try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to rise up to <hi>Natures</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:34721:85"/>
own <hi>number,</hi> and so to <hi>ring</hi>
all the <hi>changes</hi> in the
world.</p>
                     <p>6. Yet doth not this
vast <hi>Diversity,</hi> take away
the <hi>Regiment</hi> and <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
of <hi>Principles.</hi> There
being a certain lesser <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of them, which either
by their greater <hi>quantity,</hi>
or other ways, have <hi>Rule</hi>
and <hi>Dominion,</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Orders,</hi> over all the
rest. For where-ever the
<hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>Multitude, Order</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:34721:86"/>
is part of its <hi>Perfection.</hi>
For <hi>Order</hi> is <hi>Proportion.</hi>
And how can <hi>Nature</hi> be
imagin'd to hold <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in all things else, and
not here? Wherefore, as
certainly, as <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
are in all the parts
of the <hi>Rational;</hi> so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of the <hi>Material World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it is, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
be very <hi>numerous;</hi>
yet the <hi>Principles</hi> called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical,
Chymical,</hi> or any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34721:86"/>
others, which do any way
fall under the notice of
Sense, are notwithstanding
<hi>reduceable</hi> to a <hi>smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
viz.</hi> according to the
<hi>number</hi> of <hi>Predominant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
in <hi>Nature;</hi> or, at
least, in this part of the
<hi>Vniverse</hi> which is <hi>near and
round about us.</hi> To the
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> whereof,
all other <hi>Principles</hi> do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
Which <hi>Submission,</hi> is
not the <hi>quitting</hi> of their
own <hi>Nature;</hi> but only their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34721:87"/>
appearance under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Face or <hi>Habit</hi> of the
said <hi>Predominant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. As there can be no
<hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> without
<hi>Diversity;</hi> so no <hi>Diversity,</hi>
but what is <hi>originally</hi> made
by these two ways; <hi>sc.</hi> by
<hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> By <hi>these</hi>
they may be exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
and all other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
besides, whereby
they differ, must be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi>
upon <hi>these two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34721:87"/>
8. Nor therefore, can
they be of any other <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
than what are <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
For <hi>Regularity, is a
Similitude continu'd.</hi> Since
therefore all kinds of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
are <hi>divers</hi> only by
their <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> if
the self same <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
were not <hi>common</hi> to a
certain number of <hi>Atomes,</hi>
they could not be said to
be of any <hi>one kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and
consequently, if there were
no <hi>Similitude</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:34721:88"/>
there could be no <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Principles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Hence also, these
two <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Atomes, viz.</hi>
their <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> are
the true, and only <hi>original
Qualities</hi> of <hi>Atomes.</hi> That
is, an <hi>Atome</hi> is <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such,</hi>
because it is of such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Lastly, As these
two <hi>Modes,</hi> taken several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are the <hi>Qualities</hi> of an
<hi>Atome:</hi> so consider'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they are its <hi>Form.</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34721:88"/>
A <hi>substantial Form</hi> of a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
being an unintelligible
thing. I say of a <hi>Body;</hi>
for although the <hi>Rational
Soul</hi> be a <hi>substantial Form,</hi>
yet is it the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi>
and not of a <hi>Body.</hi> For
the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> we
can conceive of no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then as of the <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
of a <hi>Body,</hi> or a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi>
of all the <hi>Modes</hi> of a
<hi>Body.</hi> Which also agrees
with that <hi>Definition</hi> of a
<hi>Form,</hi> which amongst the

                        <hi>Peripatetick Philosophers</hi> is

Quod sit, Ratio ejus Essentiae,

Which <hi>Ratio,</hi> if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to a <hi>Body,</hi> what is
it but the <hi>Modification</hi> of

proposed a Summary of
my <hi>Thoughts</hi> about <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
I shall next proceed

is.</p>

                     <p>AND first of all, from
the <hi>Premisses,</hi> we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at this <hi>Conclusion; sc.</hi>
That the <hi>Formation</hi> and
<hi>Transformation</hi> of all Bodies,
can be nothing else, but
the <hi>Mixture</hi> of Bodies. For
all <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>immutable;</hi>
as we have above proved:
and therefore not <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
formable,</hi> or <hi>transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</hi>
And the <hi>Forms</hi> of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34721:90"/>
                        <hi>Principles,</hi> being but their
<hi>Modes,</hi> are also <hi>immutable.</hi>
So that the whole <hi>Business</hi>
of the <hi>Material World,</hi> is
nothing else, but <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, as <hi>Nature</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
every where only by
<hi>Mixture;</hi> so is this <hi>Mixture</hi>
every where but <hi>one thing,</hi>
and can be but <hi>one.</hi> For
whether it be the <hi>Mixture</hi>
of <hi>great</hi> Bodies, or of <hi>small;</hi>
of <hi>Compounds,</hi> or of <hi>Atomes;</hi>
it is every where <hi>Mixture,</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34721:90"/>
and the <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi>
Wherefore, <hi>Mixture</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <hi>intelligible Affection</hi>
of <hi>all</hi> Bodies, or of <hi>none;</hi>
which latter, no man will
say. As many wayes,
therefore, as we can <hi>see,</hi>
or <hi>conceive</hi> the <hi>Mixture</hi> of
any <hi>gross</hi> Bodies, which we
hold in our hand; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways, we may, of the
<hi>subtilest Mixtures</hi> which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
maketh, or of <hi>Atomes</hi>
themselves; and no other
wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34721:91"/>
Now all the wayes we
can distinguish <hi>Mixture</hi> by,
are in general these <hi>two;</hi>
either in respect of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Mixed,</hi> or else of the
<hi>Modes</hi> of the <hi>Mixture</hi> it
self.</p>
                     <p>In respect of the <hi>Bodies
Mixed, Mixture</hi> is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
also <hi>two</hi> ways; <hi>viz.</hi>
by <hi>Conjugation,</hi> and by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By</hi> Conjugation, <hi>I mean,
a</hi> Certain Mixture of some
such Principles, and not of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34721:91"/>
others. <hi>Which is</hi> three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> As to <hi>Number:</hi>
as when one Body may be
compounded of <hi>two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
another of <hi>three,</hi> a
third of <hi>four,</hi> a fourth of
<hi>five,</hi> and so on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Kind:</hi>
where, though there be a
conjunction of the same
<hi>Number,</hi> yet not of the
same <hi>Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from one another both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34721:92"/>
in <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So many ways the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of Bodies may be
conceived to be <hi>Conjugated;</hi>
and therefore are: for
here, that which <hi>may</hi> be,
<hi>is.</hi> The Consequence is
clear. For <hi>first, Nature</hi>
hath various <hi>Materials</hi>
wherewith to make these
<hi>Mixtures;</hi> as we have
shew'd. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By
these <hi>Mixtures</hi> she <hi>may,</hi> and
without the concurrence
of any imaginary <hi>Forms,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34721:92"/>
must</hi> produce all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the <hi>material world;</hi>
as likewise hath been said.
Wherefore, since all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
<hi>Mixtures may</hi> be
<hi>made,</hi> and that to <hi>some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;</hi>
if they should not be
<hi>so, Nature</hi> would be <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
because we our selves
can think, how she might
put her <hi>Materials</hi> to further
use, then <hi>so</hi> she would
do.</p>
                     <p>To think, therefore,
that all <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:34721:93"/>
or all <hi>Elements</hi> go to make
up every <hi>Compounded Body;</hi>
is a conceit, no more to
be credited, then one that
should tell us, all <hi>kind</hi> of
<hi>Wheels</hi> and other <hi>parts</hi> of a
<hi>Watch,</hi> were put into a
<hi>Clock;</hi> or that there were
no other <hi>Materials</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to build an <hi>House,</hi>
then for a <hi>Tent</hi> or a <hi>Ship.</hi>
For why should <hi>Nature,</hi>
the great <hi>Artificer</hi> by which
all <hi>perfect Works</hi> are made,
be feigned to cram and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34721:93"/>
ram <hi>all things into one,</hi>
which we our selves look
upon as absurd?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Mixture</hi>
of <hi>Principles</hi> is diversifi'd,
as by <hi>Conjugation,</hi> so also
by <hi>Proportion.</hi> That is,
by the divers <hi>Quantities,</hi> of
the several <hi>Principles</hi> or
<hi>Parts mixed</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>As if the <hi>quantity</hi> of
one, were as <hi>five</hi> to <hi>ten;</hi>
of a second, as <hi>five</hi> to <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;</hi>
of a third, as <hi>five</hi>
to <hi>twenty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:34721:94"/>
Or if that of one, be as
<hi>five</hi> to <hi>six;</hi> of a second, as
<hi>six</hi> to <hi>seven;</hi> of a third, as
<hi>seven</hi> to <hi>eight.</hi> By which,
and by other <hi>Proportions,
Mixture</hi> may be varied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> As <hi>Mixture</hi> is
varied with respect to the
<hi>Bodies Mixed;</hi> so likewise
in respect of the <hi>Mixture</hi> it
self, which I call the <hi>Loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Principles,</hi> or the
<hi>Modes</hi> of their <hi>Conjunction.</hi>
Which may be various,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34721:94"/>
as well as their <hi>Conjugation</hi>
and <hi>Proportion.</hi> Yet are
they all reduceable unto
<hi>two</hi> general <hi>Modes:</hi> all
<hi>Bodies,</hi> and therefore all
<hi>Principles,</hi> being <hi>Mixed,</hi>
either by <hi>Mediation,</hi> or by
<hi>Contact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all <hi>Contact,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Compounds,</hi> or of
<hi>Atomes,</hi> can be no other
way, then such as is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to their <hi>Figures.</hi>
Whereof, therefore, we
can conceive but <hi>three</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:34721:95"/>
                        <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>Contact</hi> in a
<hi>Point,</hi> or some <hi>smaller part:</hi>
as when <hi>two Atomes</hi> meet,
which are <hi>globular</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>gibbose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By <hi>Contact</hi> in
a <hi>Plain:</hi> as in the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>sides</hi> of <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi>
or <hi>Quadrangular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,</hi>
or otherwise <hi>flat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By <hi>Contact</hi> in a
<hi>Concave:</hi> as when one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi>
is admitted into the
<hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>hole</hi> of another;
as a Spigot is into a Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34721:95"/>
The <hi>first</hi> may be called,
<hi>Apposition;</hi> the <hi>second, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi>
the <hi>third, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi>
or <hi>Intrusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>two last</hi> wayes,
<hi>Atomes</hi> may be joyned by
<hi>Mediation;</hi> but best of all
the <hi>last.</hi> As when the
<hi>two extreams</hi> of one <hi>Atome</hi>
are received into the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caves</hi>
or the <hi>holes</hi> of two
others.</p>
                     <p>And these are all the
<hi>general</hi> ways, whereby we
can conceive Bodies to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34721:96"/>
                        <hi>Mixed</hi> together; <hi>sc.</hi> by their
various <hi>Conjugation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
and <hi>Location.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the <hi>Composition</hi>
of <hi>Atomes,</hi> in <hi>Bodies;</hi> is
like that of <hi>Letters,</hi> in
<hi>Words.</hi> What a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap
would such a <hi>Word</hi> be,
as wherein all the four and
twenty <hi>Letters</hi> were pack'd
up? One therefore is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of more, another
of fewer; this of some,
and that of others: and
both the <hi>Conjugation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:34721:96"/>
and <hi>Location</hi> of
<hi>Letters</hi> is varied in every
<hi>Word:</hi> whereby, we have
many thousands of <hi>differing
Words,</hi> without any <hi>altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
at all, in the <hi>Letters
themselves;</hi> and might have
ten times as many more.
In like manner, therefore,
or in the self same analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
way, as the <hi>Letters</hi>
of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> are the
<hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Words;</hi> so <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
are the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of
<hi>Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:34721:97"/>
What we have said of
<hi>Principles;</hi> and of <hi>Mixture</hi>
as consequent thereupon;
may be a <hi>foundation</hi> for an
<hi>intelligible</hi> account, of the
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> of most
of the Intrinsick <hi>Properties,</hi>
and <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>Bodies:</hi> as
of <hi>Gravity, Levity, Fixity,
Fluidity, Angularity, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Heat, Cold, Blackness,
Whiteness, Sowerness, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Fragrancy, Fetidness,</hi>
and very many more. I
say an <hi>intelligible</hi> account;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34721:97"/>
                        <hi>sc.</hi> such as is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> and
made out <hi>Mechanically.</hi> But
the exemplification hereof,
being too large a field for
this, or any one <hi>Lecture,</hi>
I shall, before I come to
the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi> only
deduce from the <hi>Premisses,</hi>
these following <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> That there is
no <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>Principles</hi> or
of <hi>Elements,</hi> in the most
<hi>perfect Mixture</hi> of Bodies.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34721:98"/>
It <hi>cannot</hi> be; for <hi>Principles</hi>
are <hi>Immutable,</hi> as we have
said. And if it could be,
yet it <hi>needeth not</hi> to be:
for they are also <hi>many,</hi> and
<hi>compoundable infinite</hi> ways;
as hath been shewed. So
that we have no need to
perplex our selves with any
of those difficulties, that
arise from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Alteration</hi> of <hi>Elements.</hi>
The ground of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
is that, of there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but four <hi>Elements,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34721:98"/>
that all the <hi>Elements</hi> must
needs be in every <hi>Body.</hi>
And so men being puzled,
how from thence to make
out the infinite <hi>variety</hi> of
Bodies, they feigned them
to be alterable, and <hi>alter'd,</hi>
upon every <hi>perfect Mixture.</hi>
Not considering, that if
their four <hi>Elements</hi> be <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi>
as few as they are,
no fewer then <hi>three</hi> of them
may be spared: for <hi>one
Element,</hi> if <hi>alterable,</hi> may
be made <hi>any.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34721:99"/>
2. Hence, <hi>secondly,</hi> may
be solved that great <hi>Dispute,</hi>
Whether such as we call
<hi>Lixivial Salts,</hi> are <hi>made</hi> by
the <hi>fire?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>first,</hi> No <hi>Principle</hi>
is <hi>made</hi> by the <hi>fire:</hi> all
<hi>Principles</hi> being <hi>unalterable;</hi>
and therefore <hi>unmakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
distinguish betwixt
the <hi>Principle,</hi> and the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi>
of a <hi>Principle;</hi> or
its various <hi>Mixture</hi> with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34721:99"/>
other <hi>Principles,</hi> whence it
may receive a various <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, a <hi>Lixivial Salt,
qua Lixivial,</hi> is certainly
<hi>made</hi> by the <hi>fire.</hi> But <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Salt,</hi> it is not: that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
being <hi>extractable</hi> out of
<hi>most</hi> Bodies; and by <hi>divers</hi>
other <hi>ways,</hi> then by the <hi>fire.</hi>
For whether you <hi>Calcine</hi> a
body, or <hi>Ferment</hi> it, (after
the manner shew'd by the
<hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>curious Improver</hi>
of <hi>Chymical</hi> Knowledg, <hi>Dr.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34721:100"/>
Daniel Coxe)</hi> or else <hi>putrifie</hi>
it under ground, or <hi>drown</hi>
it in the Sea; it still yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>some kind</hi> of <hi>Salt.</hi> All
which <hi>Salts</hi> are <hi>made,</hi> not by
<hi>making</hi> the <hi>Saline Principle;</hi>
but only by its being <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Mixed,</hi> upon those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ways of the <hi>Solution</hi> of
Bodies, with other <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi>
from which its <hi>various
Mixture,</hi> it receives the <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Denominations,</hi> of <hi>Marine,
Nitrous, Volatile,</hi> or <hi>Lixivial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Hence, <hi>thirdly,</hi> the most
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34721:100"/>
                        <hi>perfect Mixture</hi> of Bodies,
can go no higher then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact.</hi>
For all <hi>Principles</hi> are
<hi>unalterable;</hi> and all <hi>Matter</hi> is
<hi>impenetrable;</hi> as hath been
said. In the most <hi>visible</hi> and
<hi>laxe Mixture,</hi> there is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact;</hi>
and in the most <hi>subtile</hi>
and <hi>perfect,</hi> as in <hi>Generation</hi>
it self, there is <hi>nothing more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Hence, <hi>fourthly,</hi> we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
understand, how divers
of the same <hi>Principles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
both to <hi>Vegetables</hi>
and many <hi>other</hi> Bodies, are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34721:101"/>
also <hi>actually</hi> existent in the
Body of <hi>Man.</hi> Because even
in <hi>Generation,</hi> or <hi>Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the <hi>Principles</hi> which are
translated from one body to
another, as from a <hi>Vegetable</hi>
to an <hi>Animal,</hi> are not in the
least <hi>alter'd</hi> in themselves;
but only their <hi>Mixture,</hi> that
is, their <hi>Conjugation, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Location,</hi> is <hi>varied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Hence also the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Mixture,</hi> arising
from the difference of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact,</hi>
is intelligible; <hi>sc.</hi> as to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34721:101"/>
those <hi>three degrees, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Vnion, and Concentration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Congregation,</hi> and <hi>Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
Mixture,</hi> is when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Atomes</hi> touch but in a
<hi>Point,</hi> or <hi>smaller part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> In
<hi>which</hi> manner, I have divers
arguments, inducing me to
believe the <hi>Atomes</hi> of all
<hi>Fluid Bodies, qua Fluid,</hi> do
touch; and in <hi>no other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vnion,</hi> is when they touch
in a <hi>Plain.</hi> As in the <hi>Crystals</hi>
and <hi>Shootings</hi> of all <hi>Salts,</hi>
and <hi>other</hi> like Bodies. For if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34721:102"/>
we pursue their divided,
and subdivided parts, with
our eye, as far as we can;
they still <hi>terminate,</hi> on every
side, in <hi>Plains.</hi> Wherefore,
'tis intelligible, That their
very <hi>Atomes</hi> do also <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
and therefore <hi>touch,</hi> in
<hi>Plain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Concentration,</hi> is when two,
or more <hi>Atomes</hi> touch by
<hi>Reception</hi> and <hi>Intrusion</hi> of
one into another: which is
the <hi>closest,</hi> and <hi>firmest Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of all; as in any <hi>fixed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34721:102"/>
unodorable,</hi> or <hi>untastable</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
the <hi>Atomes</hi> of such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
being not able to make
any <hi>Smell</hi> or <hi>Tast,</hi> unless
they were first <hi>dissolved;</hi> that
is to say, <hi>unpin'd</hi> one from
another.</p>
                     <p>6. Hence, <hi>sixthly,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
how in some cases,
there seemeth to be a <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration</hi>
of <hi>Bodies;</hi> and in what
<hi>sense</hi> it may be admitted:
<hi>viz.</hi> if we will mean no more
by <hi>Penetration,</hi> but <hi>Intrusion.</hi>
For the <hi>Intrusion</hi> of one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:34721:103"/>
into the <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>hole</hi>
of another, is a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration;</hi>
whereby they take
up less room in the <hi>mixed</hi>
Body, then they would do
by any other way of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact.</hi>
As a naked knife and
its sheath, take up almost
double room, to what they
do, when the knife is
sheathed.</p>
                     <p>Whence we may assign the
<hi>reason,</hi> Why many <hi>Liquors</hi>
being <hi>mixed;</hi> take up less
room or space, then they did
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34721:103"/>
                        <hi>apart;</hi> as they very <hi>Ingenious</hi>
M. <hi>Hook</hi> maketh it to appear
by <hi>Experiment</hi> that they do.
I say the plain <hi>reason</hi> hereof,
or at least one reason, is the
<hi>Intrusion</hi> of many of their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
one into another.
Which yet is not a <hi>Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Bodies strictly so
called.</p>
                     <p>7. If all that <hi>Nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,</hi>
be but <hi>Mixture;</hi> and all
this <hi>Mixture</hi> be but <hi>Contact:</hi>
'tis then evident, That <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
and <hi>Artificial</hi> Mixture,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34721:104"/>
are the <hi>same.</hi> And all those
<hi>seeming subtilties</hi> whereby
<hi>Philosophers</hi> have gone about
to <hi>distinguish</hi> them; have
been but so many <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows,</hi>
to affright <hi>Men</hi> from
the <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
That <hi>Art</hi> it self may
go far in doing what <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
doth. And who can say,
how far? For we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>Make;</hi> but only to
<hi>Mix</hi> those <hi>Materials,</hi> which
are already <hi>made</hi> to our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34721:104"/>
hands. Even <hi>Nature</hi> her self,
as hath been said, <hi>Maketh</hi>
nothing <hi>new;</hi> but only <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
all things. So far, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as we can govern <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
we may do what <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
doth.</p>
                     <p>Which, that we may still
the better understand; let
us before, and in the next
place, see the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
For since <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Artificial Mixture</hi> are the
<hi>same;</hi> the <hi>immediate Causes</hi> of
both, are and must be the
<hi>same.</hi>

                     <p>NOW all the <hi>Causes</hi>
of <hi>Mixture</hi> we can
conceive of, must, I think, be
reduced to these <hi>six</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
viz Congruity, Weight,

and <hi>Agitation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Congruity,</hi> or aptitude
and <hi>respondence</hi> betwixt the
<hi>Sizes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> to
be <hi>mixed:</hi> whereby bodies
may be truly called the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
Causes</hi> of their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34721:105"/>
own <hi>Mixture.</hi> As when a
<hi>plain</hi> answers to a <hi>plain,</hi> a
<hi>square</hi> to a <hi>square,</hi> a <hi>convex</hi>
to a <hi>concave,</hi> or a <hi>less</hi> to a
<hi>greater</hi> or an <hi>equal,</hi> &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which <hi>Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi>
in the <hi>parts</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they are more or less
easily <hi>mingleable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Weight;</hi> by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
all <hi>Fluid</hi> Bodies, upon

<hi>mingle</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Compression;</hi> which either
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34721:106"/>
by the <hi>Air,</hi> or any other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
added to <hi>Weight,</hi> must, in
some degree, further <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
Because, that <hi>Weight</hi> it

                     </p>
                     <p>For further proof of all
the said <hi>Causes,</hi> I made this
<hi>Experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Let <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds,</hi>
and <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> be put
apart into the <hi>Receiver</hi> of an
<hi>Air-Pump.</hi> And, having <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted</hi>
it of the <hi>Air,</hi> let the
<hi>two</hi> said <hi>Oyls</hi> be then affused
one upon the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34721:106"/>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It is visible, that they
here <hi>mix</hi> and <hi>coagulate</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
that is, their parts
are <hi>wedged</hi> and <hi>intruded</hi> one
into another, without the
<hi>usual compression</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi>
for that is <hi>exhausted:</hi> and
therefore only, by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi>
of their receiving and
intruding parts; and by
their <hi>Weight;</hi> by <hi>which</hi> alone
they are so <hi>compressed,</hi> as to
make that <hi>Intrusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is also evident,
That although they do <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate;</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34721:107"/>
yet not altogether
so much, as when powred
together in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and quantity, in the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Air.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
whether made by the
<hi>Air,</hi> or any thing else, doth
somewhat further the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of Bodies, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the <hi>Compression,</hi> the more.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Solution;</hi> For all bodies
<hi>mix</hi> best, in <hi>Forma fluida.</hi>
And that for two reasons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>parts</hi> of
a body are not then in a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34721:107"/>
                        <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Vnion,</hi> but of <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and therefore, in a more
capable <hi>state,</hi> for their <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Vnion</hi> with the <hi>parts</hi>
of <hi>another</hi> body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because then they
are also in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi>
more or less; and therefore,
in a continual tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mixture;</hi> all <hi>Mixture</hi>
being made by <hi>Motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, all <hi>Generations,</hi>
and most <hi>perfect Mixtures</hi> in
<hi>Nature,</hi> are made by <hi>Fluids;</hi>
whether <hi>Animal, Vegetable,</hi> or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34721:108"/>
                        <hi>Mineral.</hi> Which is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Honourable</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in
his <hi>excellent Treatise</hi> of the
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Gems.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And 'tis well known, That
bodies are ordinarily <hi>petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
or <hi>Stones made,</hi> out of
<hi>Water.</hi> That is, out of <hi>petrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parts</hi> dissolved <hi>per mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
in <hi>Water,</hi> as both their
<hi>Menstruum</hi> and their <hi>Vehicle.</hi>
Wherefore, if we will talk of
<hi>making Gold;</hi> It must not be
by the Philosophers <hi>Stone,</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:34721:108"/>
but by the Philosophers
<hi>Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Digestion.</hi> For which
there is the same reason, as
for <hi>Mixture,</hi> by <hi>Solution.</hi> For</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> All heat doth <hi>attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi>
that is, still further <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
the <hi>parts</hi> of a body; and
so render them more <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleable</hi>
with the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
And therefore</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth also add
more <hi>Motion</hi> to them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their <hi>Mixture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Agitation.</hi> Which I am
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34721:109"/>
induced to believe a great
and effectual means of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
upon divers considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>making</hi> of
<hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi>
and the <hi>mixing</hi> of the
<hi>Chyle</hi> therewith, is very much
promoted by the same
means; <hi>sc.</hi> by the <hi>Agitation</hi>
of the parts of the <hi>Blood</hi> and
<hi>Chyle,</hi> in their continual
<hi>Circulation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> From the <hi>making</hi> of
<hi>Butter</hi> out of <hi>Milk,</hi> by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34721:109"/>
same means; whereby alone
is made a <hi>separation</hi> of the
oleous parts from the whey,
and a <hi>mixture</hi> of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover,</hi> From the great
<hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Digestion;</hi> well
known to all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in <hi>Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Which <hi>Digestion</hi> it self,
is but a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>insensible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation</hi>
of the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested</hi>
bodies.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>also</hi> a known <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
That the readiest way
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34721:110"/>
to dissolve <hi>Sugar</hi> in <hi>Wine</hi> or
other <hi>Liquor;</hi> is to give the
<hi>Vessel</hi> a <hi>hasty turn,</hi> together
with a <hi>smart knock,</hi> against
any <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> body:
whereby all the parts of the
<hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Liquor,</hi> are put
into a vehement <hi>Agitation,</hi>
and so immediately <hi>mixed</hi>
together.</p>
                     <p>And I remember, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(with intent to make
Mr. <hi>Mathews</hi>'s <hi>Pill)</hi> put some
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of
<hi>Tartar</hi> together in a bottle,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34721:110"/>
and sent it up hither out of
the <hi>Country;</hi> I found, that the
continual <hi>Agitation</hi> upon
the <hi>Road,</hi> for three or four
days, had done more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their <hi>Mixture;</hi> then a
far greater time of <hi>Digestion</hi>
alone had done before. And
it is certain, That a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Agitation,</hi> especially if
continu'd, or joyned with
<hi>Digestion;</hi> will accelerate the
<hi>Mixture</hi> of some bodies, ten
times more, then any bare
<hi>Digestion</hi> alone; as may be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34721:111"/>
proved by many <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will instance in this one.
Let some <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine</hi>
and good <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> be
stop'd up together in a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and the bottle held to
the fire, till the <hi>Liquors</hi> be a
little heated, and begin to
bubble. Then having remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, and the Bubbles by
degrees increasing more
and more; the two <hi>Liquors</hi>
will of themselves, at last
fall into so impetuous an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34721:111"/>
                        <hi>Ebullition,</hi> as to make a kind
of <hi>explosion;</hi> sending forth a
<hi>smoak</hi> for the space of almost
<hi>two yards</hi> high. Whereupon,
the <hi>parts</hi> of both the <hi>Liquors,</hi>
being violently <hi>agitated,</hi> they
are, in a <hi>great portion, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi>
into a <hi>thick Balsam</hi> in a
<hi>moment:</hi> and that without
any <hi>intense</hi> heat, as may be
felt by the bottle. And thus
much for the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

with <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the like. For
<hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
are the same; as we have
before proved. If therefore
<hi>Nature</hi> can do it, as we see in
the <hi>Generation</hi> of bodies she
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34721:113"/>
doth; 'tis likewise in the
<hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> to do it.</p>
                        <p>And for the doing of it,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That we tread in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
steps as near as we can;
not only in the <hi>application</hi> of
such a <hi>Cause,</hi> as may be most
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34721:113"/>
proper for such a <hi>Mixture;</hi>
but also in allowing it <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time</hi> for its <hi>effect.</hi> For so
we see <hi>Nature</hi> her self, for her
more <hi>perfect Mixtures,</hi> usually
doth. She maketh not a <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>

but all things <hi>by degrees;</hi> and
for her more <hi>perfect and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate

Because all such <hi>Mixtures</hi> are
made and carri'd on <hi>per mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima;</hi>
and therefore require
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34721:114"/>
a greater time for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of them.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>second Rule</hi> is, Not only
to make a due <hi>Application</hi> of
the <hi>Causes;</hi> but sometimes to
<hi>Accumulate</hi> them. By which
means, we may not only <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
Nature,</hi> but in some
cases go beyond her. For as
by adding a <hi>Graft</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> to
the <hi>Stock,</hi> we may produce
<hi>Fruit sooner,</hi> and sometimes
<hi>better,</hi> then <hi>Nature</hi> by the
<hi>Stock</hi> alone would do: So
here, by <hi>accumulating</hi> the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34721:114"/>
                           <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> that is, by
joyning <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>four,</hi> or <hi>more</hi>
together; or by <hi>applying more</hi>
in some cases, where <hi>Nature</hi>
applyeth <hi>fewer;</hi> we may be
able to make, if not a more
<hi>perfect,</hi> yet a far more <hi>speedy
Mixture,</hi> than <hi>Nature</hi> doth.
As by joyning <hi>Compression,
Heat,</hi> and violent <hi>Agitation,</hi>
and so continuing them all
together, by some means
contrived for the purpose,
for the space of a <hi>week,</hi> or
<hi>moneth,</hi> or <hi>longer,</hi> without
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34721:115"/>
cessation. Which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
produce, not only
<hi>strange,</hi> but <hi>useful effects,</hi> in the
<hi>Solution</hi> of some, and the
<hi>Mixture</hi> of other Bodies.
And may serve to <hi>mix</hi> such
Bodies, as through the <hi>small
number</hi> of their <hi>congruous</hi>
parts, are hardly <hi>mingleable</hi>
any other way. <hi>Agitation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as carrying the <hi>key</hi> to
and fro, till it hit the <hi>lock;</hi>
or within the <hi>lock,</hi> till it hit
the <hi>wards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Choice</hi> of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34721:115"/>
                           <hi>Materials,</hi> if they are not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi>
that is, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>mingleable;</hi> we are then
to turn one <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
into a <hi>Rule;</hi> which is,
To <hi>mix</hi> them by <hi>mediation</hi>
of some <hi>third,</hi> whether more
<hi>simple</hi> or <hi>compounded</hi> body,
which may be congruous
<hi>in part</hi> to them <hi>both:</hi> as <hi>sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious
Salts</hi> are to <hi>Water</hi>
and <hi>Oyl;</hi> and are for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>mingleable</hi> with <hi>either</hi> of
them.</p>
                        <p>Or, By any <hi>two</hi> congruous
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34721:116"/>
Bodies, which are also, <hi>in
part,</hi> congruous to <hi>two others:</hi>
and other like ways. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>parts</hi> of Bodies, though
never so <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> may
yet be all <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>lock'd</hi> up
together. Even as <hi>twenty
keys</hi> may be <hi>united,</hi> only by
<hi>uniting</hi> the <hi>two Rings</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they hang.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of these
things, have put me upon
making several <hi>Experiments,</hi>
for the <hi>Mingling</hi> of <hi>heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi>
Bodies. I shall give two
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34721:116"/>
Examples of tryal; the one
upon <hi>fluid,</hi> the other upon
<hi>consistent,</hi> Bodies.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> I took <hi>Oyl</hi> of
<hi>Anise-seeds,</hi> and powring it
upon another Body; I so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it, that it was thereby
turned into a perfect <hi>milk-white
Balsam,</hi> or <hi>Butter.</hi> By
which means the said <hi>Oyl</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>mingleable</hi> with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Liquor, Oyl, Wine,</hi> or <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
easily,</hi> and <hi>instantaneously
dissolving</hi> therein, in the form
of a <hi>Milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> And <hi>note,</hi> That this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34721:117"/>
is done, without the <hi>least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration</hi>
of the <hi>smell, tast, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>operation</hi> of the said
<hi>Oyl.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By somewhat the like
means, not only <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise-seeds,</hi>
but any other <hi>stillatiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Oyl,</hi> may be transformed
into a perfect <hi>milk white But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and in like manner be
<hi>mingled</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Liquor.</hi> Which is of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
use</hi> in <hi>Medicine;</hi> and what
I find oftentimes very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and advantageous
to be done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:34721:117"/>
Again, Not only <hi>fluid</hi> but
<hi>consistent</hi> bodies, which of
themselvs will <hi>mix</hi> only with
<hi>Oyl;</hi> by due <hi>mixture</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies, may be render'd
<hi>easily</hi> dissoluble in <hi>Water;</hi> as
may <hi>Rosin,</hi> and all <hi>resinous</hi>
and <hi>friable Gums.</hi> As also
<hi>Wax:</hi> and this without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
much of their <hi>Colour,
Tast</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi> Whereof like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
whatsoever others may
do, the <hi>Physician</hi> may make
a manifold <hi>Vse.</hi>

                        <p>BY <hi>Mixture</hi> also, we may
be <hi>taught</hi> to <hi>Imitate</hi> the
<hi>Productions</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> As to
which, from what we have
before said of <hi>Mixture,</hi> we
may conclude; That there is
no <hi>generation</hi> of Bodies <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organical,</hi>
but what is in the
<hi>power</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> to <hi>imitate.</hi>
As of <hi>Animals,</hi> to Imitate
<hi>Blood, Fat, Chyle, Spittle,
Flegm, Bile,</hi> &amp;c. Of <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
to Imitate a <hi>Milk, Mucilage,
Rosin, Gum, or Salt.</hi> Of <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34721:118"/>
to Imitate <hi>Vitriol, Allom,</hi>
and other <hi>Salts;</hi> as also <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
and the like.</p>
                        <p>I do not say, I can do all
this: but if upon good <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses</hi>
we may conclude this
<hi>may</hi> be done; it is one step
to the doing of it. But I will
also give an <hi>Instance</hi> of
somewhat that may be <hi>done</hi>
in every <hi>kind.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> For the <hi>Imitation</hi> of
an <hi>animal body,</hi> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in <hi>Fat.</hi> Which may
be <hi>made</hi> thus; Take <hi>Oyl O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34721:119"/>
and powr it upon high
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi> Then <hi>digest</hi>
them for some days. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
the <hi>Oyl</hi> becomes of the
<hi>colour</hi> of <hi>Marrow;</hi> and at last,
is <hi>congealed,</hi> or hardned into
a <hi>white Fat</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> which
<hi>dissolveth</hi> only by the <hi>fire,</hi> as
that of <hi>Animals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In converting <hi>Oyl</hi> thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Fat,</hi> it is to be <hi>noted,</hi> That
it <hi>hardens</hi> most upon the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation</hi>
of some of the more
<hi>Sulphureous</hi> parts of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of <hi>Nitre.</hi> Which I effected,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34721:119"/>
well enough for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
by unstopping the
glass after some time of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion;</hi>
and so suffering the
<hi>Oyl</hi> to <hi>dissolve</hi> and <hi>thicken</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times by successive
<hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence, The true <hi>Congealing
Principle,</hi> is a <hi>Spirit of Nitre
separated from its Sulphur.</hi> For
the better doing whereof,
the <hi>Air</hi> is a most commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Menstruum</hi> to the said
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whence also, if we could
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34721:120"/>
procure such a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
we might <hi>congele Water</hi> in
the midst of <hi>Summer.</hi> We
might also <hi>refrigerate Rooms</hi>
herewith <hi>artificially.</hi> And
might <hi>Imitate</hi> all <hi>frosty Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</hi>
For the <hi>making</hi> of <hi>Fat,</hi> is
but the <hi>Durable Congelation</hi>
of <hi>Oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> which may be done
without <hi>frost,</hi> as I have
shew'd how.</p>
                        <p>Hence also it appears, That
<hi>Animal Fat</hi> it self, is but the
<hi>Curdling</hi> of the <hi>Oily</hi> parts of
the <hi>Blood;</hi> either by some of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34721:120"/>
its own <hi>Saline</hi> parts; or by
the <hi>Nitrous</hi> parts of the <hi>Air</hi>
mingled therewith.</p>
                        <p>Hence likewise it is, That
some <hi>Animals,</hi> as <hi>Conies,</hi> and
<hi>Fieldfares,</hi> grow <hi>fatter</hi> in <hi>fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
weather: the <hi>oily</hi> parts of
the <hi>blood,</hi> being then more
than ordinarily <hi>coagulated</hi>
with a greater abundance of
<hi>nitrous</hi> parts received from
the <hi>Air</hi> into their <hi>bodies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the same reason it is,
That the <hi>Fat</hi> of <hi>Land-Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>
is <hi>hard;</hi> whereas that of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34721:121"/>
                           <hi>Fish</hi> is <hi>very soft,</hi> and in a
great part runs to <hi>Oyl, sc.</hi>
Because the <hi>Water,</hi> wherein
they live, and which they
have instead of <hi>breath,</hi> hath
but very few <hi>nitrous</hi> parts
in it, in comparison of what
the <hi>Air</hi> hath.</p>
                        <p>2. For the <hi>Imitation</hi> of a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
Body,</hi> I will give three
<hi>Instances;</hi> In <hi>Rosin, Gum,</hi> and a
<hi>Lixivial Salt.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> may
be made thus; Take good <hi>Oyl</hi>
of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and drop it upon
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise-seeds;</hi> and they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34721:121"/>
will forthwith <hi>incorporate</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and by degrees, will
<hi>harden</hi> into a <hi>perfect Rosin;</hi>
with the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>defining
Properties</hi> of a <hi>truly Natural
Resinous Gum.</hi> Being not in
the least <hi>dissoluble</hi> in <hi>Water;</hi>
or at least, not any more,
then any natural <hi>Rosin</hi> or
<hi>Gum:</hi> yet very <hi>easily</hi> by <hi>fire:</hi>
as also highly <hi>inflammable:</hi>
and exceeding <hi>friable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although this <hi>artificial rosin,</hi>
be the result of <hi>two Liquors,</hi>
both which very strongly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34721:122"/>
affect the <hi>Sense:</hi> yet being well
<hi>washed</hi> from the <hi>unincorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
parts,</hi> (which is to be
done with some care) it hath
scarce any <hi>Tast</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Concentration</hi> of these
<hi>two Liquors,</hi> is likewise so <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal;</hi>
that the <hi>Rosin</hi> is not
made by <hi>Precipitation,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a <hi>total Combination</hi> of
the said <hi>Liquors;</hi> and that
with scarce so much, as any
<hi>visible</hi> fumes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> Having taken a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Powder</hi> and a <hi>Saline Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:34721:122"/>
and mixed them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a bottle, and so <hi>dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi>
them for some time; the
<hi>Powder</hi> was at last transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a perfect <hi>Oily Gum;</hi>
which will also <hi>dissolve</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Oyl,</hi> or in <hi>Water;</hi> in the
self same manner, as <hi>Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
Ammoniac,</hi> and the like
will do.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> A <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi>
may be <hi>imitated</hi> thus; Take
<hi>Nitre, Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and high
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> of each a like
quantity. Of these <hi>three</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34721:123"/>
not any <hi>two</hi> being <hi>put
together;</hi> that is to say, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Nitre</hi> with the <hi>Oyl,</hi>
nor the <hi>Oyl</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
nor the <hi>Nitre</hi> with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
will make the <hi>least ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition:</hi>
yet all <hi>three mingled
together,</hi> make a very <hi>conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
one.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi>
being as the <hi>Sulphur;</hi> and so
that, and the <hi>Nitre</hi> together,
standing, as it were, in the
stead of an <hi>Alkalizate,</hi> that
is, a <hi>Sulphurious Salt,</hi> against
the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol.</hi> Divers
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34721:123"/>
other <hi>Experiments</hi> I can
shew of the like nature.</p>
                        <p>3. In the last place, for the
<hi>Imitation</hi> of a <hi>Mineral Body,</hi>
I will instance in <hi>two, sc. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi>
and <hi>Marine Salt;</hi> if I may
have leave to reckon them
amongst <hi>Mineral Bodies.</hi> As
for <hi>Nitre,</hi> by mixing of <hi>four
Liquors</hi> together, and then
setting them to <hi>shoot;</hi> I have
obtained <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>perfect Salt;</hi> which have had
much of a <hi>nitrous tast;</hi> and
would be <hi>melted</hi> with a <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34721:124"/>
heat,</hi> as <hi>Nitre</hi> is; and even
as easily as <hi>Butter</hi> it self: I
mean, not by the addition
of any sort of <hi>Liquor,</hi> or any
other body, to <hi>dissolve</hi> it; but
<hi>only</hi> by the <hi>fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as for a <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> that
I might <hi>Imitate Nature</hi> for
the <hi>making</hi> hereof, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
That the <hi>Salt</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
was nothing else but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi>
and <hi>Vegetable Salt,</hi>
freed from its true <hi>Spirit</hi>
and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and some <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
particles, specifically Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:34721:124"/>
or <hi>Vegetable,</hi> together
with them. For both <hi>Animal</hi>
and <hi>Vegetable</hi> bodies being
continually carried by all
<hi>Rivers</hi> into the Sea; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
likewise by <hi>Shipwrack,</hi>
and divers <hi>other</hi> ways, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed</hi>
therein: they are at
last <hi>corrupted,</hi> that is, their
<hi>Compounding</hi> parts are <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>resolved.</hi> Yet the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
being in the <hi>Water,</hi>
is not made <hi>precipitately,</hi> as
it is in the <hi>Air;</hi> but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and very <hi>gently.</hi>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:34721:125"/>
Whence the <hi>Sulphurious,</hi>
and <hi>other</hi> more <hi>Volatile</hi>
parts, in their <hi>avolation,</hi>
make not so much <hi>hast,</hi> as
to carry the more <hi>fixed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>
parts along with them;
but leaveth them behind in
the <hi>Water,</hi> which <hi>imbibeth</hi>
them, as their proper <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
herein, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
thus; Put as much
of a <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> as you
please, into a wide mouth'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34721:125"/>
bottle, and with fair <hi>Water</hi>
make a strong <hi>Solution</hi> of
it; so as some part thereof
may remain <hi>unresolved</hi> at
the bottom of the bottle.
Let the bottle stand thus
for the space of about half
or three quarters of a year,
all the time unstopped. In
which time, many of the
<hi>Sulphurious</hi> and <hi>other</hi> more
<hi>Volatile</hi> parts gradually fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away; the top of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved
Salt</hi> will be <hi>incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
or as it were <hi>frosted</hi>
                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:34721:126"/>
over, with many small and
hard <hi>Concretions,</hi> which for
their nature, are become a
true <hi>Sea-Salt.</hi> Whereof
there is a double proof;
<hi>First,</hi> In that most of the
said <hi>Concretions</hi> are of a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical,</hi>
or very like <hi>Figure.</hi>
Especially on their <hi>upper</hi>
parts; because having a <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
body</hi> for their <hi>basis,</hi> their

on all sides with a

Secondly,</hi> In that a strong

which is also the <hi>property</hi>
of <hi>Sea-Salt.</hi> And thus much
for the more <hi>general Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Bodies.</hi>

                        <p>FROM the aforesaid
<hi>Premisses,</hi> and by the
aforesaid <hi>Means,</hi> there is no
doubt to be made, but that
also the other <hi>sensible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of Bodies may be <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
as their <hi>Odours</hi> and <hi>Tasts.</hi>
And that not only the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
ones, as <hi>Fragrant,</hi> or
<hi>Astringent:</hi> but also those
which are <hi>specifical</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
to such a <hi>species</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34721:127"/>
Thus, for <hi>example,</hi> by
<hi>mixing</hi> several <hi>Bodies</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in a due <hi>proportion,</hi> I
have <hi>Imitated</hi> the <hi>Smells</hi> of
<hi>divers Vegetables;</hi> as of <hi>Tansy,</hi>
of <hi>Lignum Rhodium,</hi> and
<hi>others.</hi> And I conclude it
feasable, To <hi>Imitate</hi> the <hi>Tast</hi>
or <hi>Smell</hi> of <hi>Musk,</hi> or <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece,</hi>
or <hi>any other</hi> body in

be <hi>Taught,</hi> How to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate</hi>
the <hi>Faculties,</hi> as well
as other <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bodies.
The reason is, because even
<hi>these</hi> have no dependance
upon any <hi>substantial Form;</hi>
as in the first <hi>Part</hi> of my

<hi>premisses</hi> of this <hi>Discourse</hi>
hath been shew'd.</p>

                        <p>FROM whence, <hi>again,</hi>
it is likewise a <hi>Key</hi> to
<hi>Discover</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
For how far soever we
can attain to <hi>Mingle,</hi> or to
<hi>Make</hi> them, we may also
know <hi>what they are.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:34721:129"/>
For Bodies are <hi>mingleable,</hi>
either <hi>of themselves,</hi> or by
some <hi>third.</hi> As to those
which <hi>mingle of themselves,</hi>
we may certainly conclude,
That there is a <hi>congruity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, in some respect
or other. So upon various
tryals I find, that <hi>Essential
Oyls</hi> do more easily <hi>imbibe</hi>
an <hi>Acid,</hi> then an <hi>Alkaly.</hi>
Whence it is evident, That
there is some <hi>congruity</hi> and
<hi>similitude</hi> betwixt <hi>Essential
Oyls,</hi> and an <hi>Acid,</hi> which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34721:129"/>
there is not betwixt the
said <hi>Oyls</hi> and an <hi>Alkaly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to those that mingle
only by some <hi>third;</hi> we may
also certainly conclude,
That though the <hi>two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi>
are <hi>unlike;</hi> yet that
they have both of them a
<hi>similitude</hi> to or <hi>congruity</hi> with
that <hi>third,</hi> by which they
are <hi>united.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moreover,</hi> We may make a
<hi>Judgment</hi> from the <hi>Manner</hi>
or <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Mixture.</hi> Thus
the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> as is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34721:130"/>
said, will <hi>coagulate Oyl-Olive,</hi>
and render it <hi>consistent.</hi>
Whence it might be
thought, That any other
strong <hi>Acid</hi> will do the like;
and that therefore, there is
no great difference in the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the said <hi>Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</hi>
But the contrary
hereunto, is proved by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</hi>
For having <hi>digested</hi>
the same <hi>Oyl,</hi> in the same
<hi>manner,</hi> and for a much
<hi>longer</hi> time, with strong <hi>Oyl</hi>
of <hi>Sulphur;</hi> although it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34721:130"/>
thence acquired some
change of <hi>Colour,</hi> yet not
any <hi>Consistence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> Because the said
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre coagulates
Oyl-Olive;</hi> it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
it should have the
same effect, upon <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise-seeds;</hi>
or, at least, that if
other <hi>Acids</hi> will <hi>coagulate
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise-seeds,</hi> that this
should do it <hi>best.</hi> But <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi>
proveth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For of all I have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is the only
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34721:131"/>
                           <hi>Acid</hi> that doth it <hi>instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously.
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
if very strong, will do
it; but not so <hi>soon,</hi> nor
so <hi>much. Aqua fortis,</hi> and
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> for the
present, <hi>do not</hi> at all
<hi>touch</hi> it. And <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Nitre</hi> it self will not
<hi>coagulate</hi> it, under <hi>eight</hi>
or <hi>ten</hi> hours at least.</p>

Vse</hi> and <hi>Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Bodies. Thus,
for <hi>example,</hi> by the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation</hi>
of <hi>Rosins</hi> and
<hi>Resinous Gums,</hi> we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know what all of

<hi>wherefore</hi> to be <hi>used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> For
what are <hi>Mastick, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34721:132"/>
Olibanum, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin,</hi>
and <hi>other like Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,</hi>
or <hi>Resinous Gums,</hi>
for their <hi>principal</hi> and
<hi>predominant</hi> parts, that
is, <hi>qua Rosins;</hi> but Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
resulting from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
in like manner,
as I have shewed, they
may be made to result,
from <hi>Artificial Mixture?</hi>
That is to say, the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leous,</hi>
and <hi>Acid</hi> parts of
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> being both <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi>
and <hi>mingled</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34721:132"/>
                           <hi>per minima,</hi> in some
one <hi>Vessel</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi>
they thus <hi>incorporate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one <hi>consistent</hi> and <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
body, which we call
<hi>Rosin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now from hence it
is, that the said <hi>Rosins,</hi>
and <hi>Resinous Gums;</hi> as
also <hi>Amber</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi>
for the same reasons;
are of so great and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
<hi>Vse</hi> against most
<hi>thin</hi> and <hi>salt Rheums;
sc.</hi> as they are <hi>Acido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oleous</hi>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:34721:133"/>
Bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For by
their <hi>Acid</hi> parts, which
in all these Bodies are
exceeding <hi>copious,</hi> they
<hi>mortifie</hi> and <hi>refract</hi> those
<hi>salt</hi> ones which feed the
<hi>Rheum.</hi> And by their
<hi>oleous</hi> parts, the same
<hi>salt</hi> ones are also <hi>Imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</hi>
Whence, they are
all, in some degree, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated</hi>
together; that
is, the <hi>Rheum</hi> is <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
which is the desired
<hi>effect.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:34721:133"/>
Whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if the <hi>Cough</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not from a <hi>thin</hi>
and especially a <hi>salt Rheum,</hi>
but from a <hi>Viscous Flegm;</hi>
the use of <hi>many other</hi>
Bodies, which are also
more <hi>oleous,</hi> and abound
not so much with an
<hi>Acid</hi> as <hi>these</hi> do, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>some</hi> of them, is
more proper: such as
<hi>these,</hi> in this case, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sometimes not only
<hi>ineffectual,</hi> but <hi>prejudicial.</hi>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:34721:134"/>
Since the very <hi>Cause</hi> of the
said <hi>Viscousness</hi> of <hi>Phlegm,</hi>
is chiefly some great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity</hi>
in the <hi>Blood,</hi> or in
some other <hi>part;</hi> as may
be proved by divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                        <p>Many more <hi>Instances</hi>

reiterate the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and
