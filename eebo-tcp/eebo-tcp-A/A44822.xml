            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the better coming to our point, 'tis necessary we take a review of the times preceeding <hi>Forty One,</hi> when from the end of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Reign, the people were, as now, full of murmurings, repinings and distrusts against the Government. At last the smother'd Embers burst forth into a Flame; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten years Violence, War and Confusion, and near as many more of Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny, the Common-wealth was so far from being better'd, by any of the many changes and expedients, that the recalling our King from his unjust Exile was found, and unanimously agreed, the only way to prevent its utter Ruin. Our Gracious Sovereign, merciful beyond example, pardons his Rebellious Subjects, the Murderers of his Royal Father, and the Usurpers of his own Crown and Dignity; loads, even among them, with Offices and Honor, such as seem'd penitent, and were capable. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, first to the resettlement of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> like vertue seated in the middle, and equally endanger'd by the two extremes of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi>; and after, to that of the State in peace and quiet, which we enjoy'd to the envy of our Neighbors. This happiness occasion'd a War with <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> to their great Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis equally destructive of my liberty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King or the House of Commons, takes away <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; I am still against arbitrary Government, ruling according to pleasure, not the Laws and known Constitutions of the Land, whether assum'd by King or Commons, if there be any choice, the odds are against the latter. And to speak truth, by what has pass'd since the Plot, any one in his wits, wou'd believe, the King is invaded, not an invader; that his frequent Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Dissolutions have been his legal defensive weapons, us'd as much for his Subjects security, as his own honour; that arbitrary power is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious thing, and therefore aim'd at by our Demagogues and Tribunes of the people; bad and to be decry'd, only while in the Soveraign. 'Tis very convenient to cry Whore first. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>He that appeareth first in his own cause, seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh after and proveth him.</hi> If the people in an Island are alarm'd that an Invasion is design'd, and that only at one Port, and they become so foolish as for the guard of that, to neglect and expose all other, they do but make the easier way for their enemies to land and overcome. Those, who are the Watchmen, the Sentinels of our safety, ought with <hi>Ianus</hi> to have two faces, one behind and the other before, and many eyes like <hi>Argus,</hi> there being otherwise no security against sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. I remember in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that the <hi>Gretians</hi> besieging a strong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, found no means but stratagem to become Masters, which they thus contriv'd: After they had puchas'd within some Pensioners, they kept the besieged awake, and put them into a great distress by continual false a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, and, as design'd, prepar'd to believe nothing more was intended than amusement and distraction. The false Citizens within taking this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, affirm'd they ought for the future to make it death to any Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to give the Alarm. This decreed, notice was given to the enemy, and without the least resistance the besieg'd were taken and undone, when and where they least suspected; whereupon this Proverb was taken up. <hi>Amyclas perdidit silentium.</hi> I wish we may never run the same fate; the application is too easie and natural to be dwelt upon.</p>

He that can believe these things, is prepar'd for any thing, to say a Lobster is a Whale, or a Whale a Lobster; that the Moon is a Green-Cheese, and the Sun a round Plate of red hot Iron; and then, I presume, it may not be decided whether we are Fools or Madmen. Let us not idly and unjustly bely our Consciences, and publish to the Nation and all the World, that nothing can secure us against Popery, but the shaking and alteration of the Monarchy, by the Bill of Exclusion; an Act in it self unjust and impolitick, both for the King and People. No man is to be punish'd <hi>expost-facto,</hi> by the Laws of this and all other Countries.

This piece of injustice must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by an Assotiation or an Army; this Army must be entrusted in the hands of the King or a General, either may make himself Absolute and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary; and therefore if people are now afraid of slavery from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what may then be their apprehensions? And if they are jealous of the King, what General will they find to entrust? Those meanly skill'd in story, know that Commanders of Armies have at pleasure subverted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and Kingdoms: <hi>Agathocles</hi> from being General became Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Syracusa; Pisistratus</hi> of <hi>Athens, Sforza</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> the <hi>Medici</hi> of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the <hi>Caesars</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to go so far off, <hi>Cromwel</hi> of the three Kingdoms. Most of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were dethrown'd by their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52160:9"/>
and therefore this cannot but make the King as unwilling as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to entrust this great Power in any person. And yet without such a trust the Act of Exclusion is not woth a straw; nor with it can we be secur'd against Slavery, whether the Duke conquer or be overcome. The Duke will still find a party, at least if he out-lives the King, in the Three Kingdoms to fight his Quarrel; and if he comes in by Force, he may well use us like <hi>a conquer'd Nation,</hi> break our old, and give us what Laws and Religion he pleases; Whereas if we attempt no such thing, we shall not run the hazard of a <hi>CIVIL WAR,</hi> the King being as likely to out-live, as to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd by, His Brother. If he shou'd chance to succeed peaceably, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be presum'd to offer any alteration in Religion so much against his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and who never forwarded any in his own Family, suffers his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To say he wou'd be Priest-ridden, is ridiculous; why he more than the <hi>French</hi> King, who openly opposes the Popes Usurpation, and assumes to himself the cognizance even of Church-affairs? This is but a pretence to impose upon the ignorant and the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; if there be not Laws enough already, new ones may be made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any such intention. When all Offices and Power are in the hands of Anti-papists, I cannot see where can be our danger.</p>
            <p>But this, if granted, wou'd not be all, the Monarchy is hereby made elective, and the possessor may as well be remov'd, as the successor debarr'd. In order to this, is there not a History of the Succession publih'd, shewing that the Monarchy is rather elective than hereditary? Of which here I will only say, that the Writer is a notorious Plagiary, and steals all out of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Book writ on the same Subject by <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit, under the name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, with design of distracting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and making way for a <hi>Spanish</hi> Conquest and Inquisition; the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Transcriber proves himself of the same Jesuitical principles, and with equal honestly pursues the same ends, Usurpation and Slavery. 'Tis not to be doubted, but that there has been frequent interruptions of the Succession of the Crown; but no title, but that of the Sword, was ever put in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with proximity os bloud, and he that will oppose Fact to Right is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unjust, and argues not upon the principles of Morality, nor the Laws of Nations. Much such another good Christian, is the Writer of <hi>The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the City,</hi> who tells us, if we set up a King with none or a crack'd title, we shall have the better Laws; and instances that <hi>Richard</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> an Usurper, a Murderer, and a Tyrant, made excellent Statues. But he might, had he been just, have found the Laws of that King out done by those of our present Soveraign, whose title none can question.</p>
            <p>And yet it is not unreasonable to suspect a design on foot of subverting the
