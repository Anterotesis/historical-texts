            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The matter are a company of believers; the manner or forme is this, we from amongst our ſelves chooſe a paſtor; the paſtor and we being entred into a mutuall Covenant, the one to be faithfull in teaching and feeding, the other in hearing and obeying according to Chriſts ordinance; by this reciprocall bond, we become one Congregation or body, as the head and members are one, and ſo the paſtor and people together chooſe other Church Officers, as Elders and Deacons.</p>

               <p>You now grow old, and therefore it ſhould not be with you as it is with ſuch as are Novicees in Religion, wherefore take heed of faire ſpeeches and holy pretences, for there is nothing ſo common in the world as that which is like the truth, &amp; yet not the truth the name of the Church and pure ſpouſe, and yet upon examination doth prove Strumpets and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots; for Chriſts Church his Sanctuarie, his true Tabernacle, is that, which he her Lord pitcheth or buildeth &amp; not man: &amp; therfore that we may trie the truth of your Church, pray ſhew me how you prove it by Scripture;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155256:4"/>
and firſt where it is proved, that the people of every particular Church are to call and chooſe their Paſtor.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hym.</speaker>
               <p>In the ſixth chapter of the Acts; it is thus written, wherefore Brethren look ye out from among your ſelves, ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the holy Ghoſt and wiſdom, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe; where it appeares to us, the Apoſtles gave the believers for ever power to chooſe their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Silv.</speaker>
               <p>There is not one word in the Text that proves your concluſion; that the people of every particular Church are to call their Paſtor, but this it proves, that the Apoſtles times were wholly taken up in prayer and preaching, in regard the Diſciples were ſo exceedingly multiplied, that they could not have time touching the matter of receiving and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the neceſſity of the Saints, by reaſon of which there aroſe murmurings of the Graecians againſt the Hebrews, becauſe their widows were neglected in the dayly Adminiſtration. So that there was a neceſſity that Deacons ſhould be appointed for that buſineſſe, who were comended by the people and confirmed by the Apoſtles; and this is the whole ſcope of that Scripture.</p>

               <p>Good Friend <hi>Silvanus</hi> I have another Scripture which I pray conſider you of, and then I hope you will be of my mind, that is <hi>Act. 11. 19 20. 21. 22. 23.</hi> you ſhall ſee there that in the 19. 20. and 21. verſes, there is mention made of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and that the Gentiles had received the Faith: then in the 22. and 23. verſ. <hi>Barnabas</hi> from amongſt theſe believers gathers a Church after he had deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch</hi> by the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and to me the words prove both the matter and forme of our Church who when he came &amp; had ſeen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord; to me it is plaine that with purpoſe of heart to cleave unto the Lord, is the covenant the people enter into with their Paſtor, and Barnabas his rejoycing to ſee their grace from God and his rejoycing in it, his continuing to exhort them, and to this Church much people was added as in the 24. verſe.</p>

               <p>I have often obſerved old friend, that there is none ſo eaſily deceived as thoſe that would willingly be deceived, for if you would not willingly be ignorant the reading of the text would better informe you, for there is not one word in all thoſe verſes you have read, proves what you ſay, the truth is this that the perſecution that aroſe about <hi>Stephen</hi> was the occaſion that many diſciples were ſcattered and diſperſt amongſt the Gentiles, and by the witneſſe they bare to Chriſt, many believed, as many Greeks at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> tydings whereof came to the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who ſent <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> thither, and when he came to them found the report ſo true that it rejoyced his heart, and his doctrine was of that power and authoritie that he furthered the grace begun, and begun it where it it was not, for he was a good man and full of the holy Ghoſt and of Faith, that his exhortations wrought ſo through their hearts that it prevailed with the thought and purpoſes thereof to cleave to the Lord ſo full is the phraſe, as if he had gained the whole heart to the Lord, and beſides he added much people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord ſaith the text, and then departed to <hi>Tarſus</hi> to ſeek <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo there

               <p>By the name of the Church of Chriſt in Scripture we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, Gods faithfull peculiar, choſen and regenerate people, ſuch and ſuch only as are born of the holy Ghoſt; and that I may the better deſcribe and manifeſt the true Church, the whole body, building or houſe, I will firſt declare the making parts and true nature of every particular living ſtone and member, of which, and which only the whole frame or fabrick conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. Now to the making of any part thereof and ſo of every part, 3 things are conſiderable and required; that is to ſay, the ſpirit, water and bloud, whereof the firſt is the worker, the two laſt the work, or matter or make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of every living ſtone of the Church it ſelf. Of theſe three termes the firſt is literall, by which we are to underſtand the finger of God, the ſpirit which proceeds from the Father and the Sonne: the other two are Metaphoricall, by which other things are meant, namely repentance and remiſſion of ſins, as it is written, <hi>Except a man be borne againe from above of water and the holy Ghoſt he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Silv.</speaker>
               <p>That I ſhall willingly do, and give you their definition in their due place. For the firſt, which is repentance, the Lord in the working thereof, unhardens the heart that naturally by ſin is obdurate, hard, flat and quite contrary and diſobedient to God and his will, which graciouſly God of his meete and alone goodneſſe by a kind of heavenly power, ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens and makes it plyable and inclinable to God and his will. And the word of God compares this humble broken bruiſed contrite heart to plowed ground, to ſoft and tender fleſh, and to water, and ſuch like, ſetting forth by all theſe compariſons the true nature and condition thereof.</p>
               <p>That as fleſh differs from a ſtone; barren, fallow, weedy ground from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155256:6"/>
that which is broken up and plough'd; and as the plyableneſſe and ſoftneſſe of water differs from the hardneſſe of a Dyamond, ſo a broader and greater difference is there between this penitent heart and that it was before, for that which was pleaſant &amp; delightfull is now become nothing but grief &amp; ſorrow of heart, that which before was chiefly fought after is now moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. As formerly its joy and gladneſſe was in ſuch ſinfull ways as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him from God, now he unceſſantly ſeeketh, prayeth, deſireth and longeth after every way and meanes whereby he may be brought to God, to be refreſhed with his favour, which by his ſins and tranſgreſſions he hath loſt; and never did any hunted and chaſed ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t pant more after the water brooks, than this ſoul doth thirſt and deſire the favour and grace of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>No undone man, no wounded man, no diſeaſed man, no deadly ſick man, no man in bondage and thraldome ſo miſerable and wretched in a naturall ſence as this penitent man in his own apprehenſion in a ſpirituall and godly ſence.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> the great and powerfull preacher and worker of repentance, that he ſhould prepare the way of the Lord, that is, make a people ready for the Lord to heale and cure, and in working the preparation, he bruiſed the reed, he cauſed the flax to ſmoak, he turned the hearts of the Fathers to the children, the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt, he humbled and brought low the high and lofty, the rough, ridged, and untoward he made gentle and ſmooth, the crooked and perverſe hearted, he bent, bow'd, and made ſtraight, he made the rich poor, the well ſick, the whole broken, in a word, all theſe terms do but ſet out and declare his great and heavenly work of repentance which he wrought in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>According as it was prophecyed of him, that he ſhould go in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> and as the Angell ſaid to <hi>Zacharias</hi> his Father, <hi>And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the children of Iſrael ſhall he turne to the Lord his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, the whole life of this holy Prophet and every houre therof prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched repentance, for he choſe the deſart place in the wilderneſſe to dwell in before the ſtately City <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> And hunger and thirſt before dainty fare, wine or ſtrong drink, and ſack-cloth rather then ſoft rayment, his Garment was hair-cloth and his Girdle a leather skin. Neither boyld nor roſt was his food but what he found unbought or uncared for; his meate was locuſt and wild hony. His life and Doctrine being thus one and the ſame, and both ſo wonderfully powerfull and effectuall, that all <hi>Ieruſalem, Iudea,</hi> and the Region about <hi>Iordan</hi> went out to ſee and heare him, the like Prophet being never heard nor ſeen before.</p>
               <p>And he preached unto them repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, for ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155256:6"/>
powerfull was his miniſtery in working repentance in their hearts, that the holy Ghoſt ſaith of them, they were baptiſed of him in <hi>Iordan</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſins. An apt and plaine figure or reſemblance is the baptiſme of water, of that of repentance, for repentance it is the preparation of the way of the Lord, the ſigne or badge of it is the baptiſme with water, and ſo Saint <hi>Marke</hi> doth plainly preach, <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize in the wilderneſſe, there's the ſignification; and preached the baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, there's the ſubſtance, which heavenly gift repentance he calls the beginning of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, by which he proves cleerly, that the beginning of our new birth or regeneration, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new covenant of life and ſalvation; herein agreeing with all the Prophets, who ſpeaking of the new covenant, ſtill begin with the unhard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart, taking away the ſtony heart and giving an heart of fleſh.</p>

I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Sonne,</hi> Every word declaring the true and reall ſenſibleneſſe of his own guiltyneſſe, confeſſing with deteſtation in the ſtrength of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, like the penitent Publicain ſmiting his wofull breaſt with his guilty hand in a ruefull manner, as a man loſt and undone; in the fourth and laſt

               <p>Thus all the Prophets and Apoſtles, as doth their Lord alſo, deſcribe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the penitent, by the poor, the broken hearted, the loſt, the ſinners, the unrighteous, becauſe theſe only are ſo truly in their own eyes and in the gift or work of God called repentance, or the preparation of God, happy man is he that heareth and obeyeth, for God hath ſworn he ſhall not periſh.</p>

               <p>To make it more plaine, we will firſt cite the Teſtimonyes of the Prophets, our Lords and his Apoſtles, and then I will ſhew you how plainly and clearly the heires of the promiſe have particularly declared her hope and confidence in it. <hi>Job</hi> had the true knowledge and comfort of it which raviſht him, and made him thus to cry out as if he were out of himſelf: <hi>Oh, that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a book, that they were graven with an Iron Pen in a Rock for ever, for I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin wormes deſtroy this body yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee, for my ſelf and my eyes ſhall behold, and not another.</hi> In which he clearly expreſſes that the place of his bleſſedneſſe after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall be in the earth where his Saviour ſhall ſtand, that is, ſhall rule and raigne for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart excells in this Faith and hope, what man is he that feareth the Lord? (ſaith he) him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe, his ſoule ſhall lodge in goodneſſe, and his ſeed ſhall inherit the earth: And againe, <hi>Let all the earth feare the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world ſtand in aw of him, for evill doers ſhall be cut off, but thoſe that waite upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the earth, and though it be but a little while, and the wicked ſhall not be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and his place ſhall not be found, yet the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace, for ſuch as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the earth, and they that be curſed of him ſhall be cut off;</hi> And ſo he ſingeth Pſa. 48. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed in the City of our God, in the mountaine of his holineſſe, beautifull for ſituation, the joy of the whole earth is mount</hi> Sion: And alſo in another place, The Heaven, <hi>even the Heavens are the Lords, but the earth hath he given to the Children of men;</hi> So teſtifieth the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, that created the Heavens, God himſelf that formed the earth and made it, he hath eſtabliſhed it, he created it not in vaine, he formed it to be inhabited, I ſaid not,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>to the ſeed of</hi> Iacob <hi>ſeek you me in vaine, I the Lord ſpeak righteouſneſſe, I declare things that are right,</hi> And the ſame Prophet makes proclamation; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I create new Heavens, and a new earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred nor come into mind, and as the new Heavens and new earth, (which I ſhall make) ſhall remaine before me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remaine;</hi> Which clearly ſhews the intent of the promiſe to the Patriarks, and ſo accordingly they underſtood it, as ſhall be proved hereafter; The Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> both teſtifie to this truth without queſtion, as before I have briefly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that it may be out of queſtion here, what Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of the Teſtimony of the foure and twenty Elders, praiſing and lauding the lamb their Lord, and they ſang a new ſong, ſaying, <hi>that art worthy to take the</hi>

Here is both the glory and ſafety of this happy City deſcribed; this is the City that God prepared for the Patriarchs, the City with foundations before ſhewed, which all the faithfull expected and looked for, whoſe builder and maker is God: And upon one and all the Citizens of this City I will write upon him ſaith the Lord, the name of my God, and the name of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my God, which is new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which commeth downe &amp;c.
