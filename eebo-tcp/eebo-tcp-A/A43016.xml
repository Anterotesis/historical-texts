            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRAEFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is Observable, that the First Solid Foundation of Physick was laid by the Great Architect of that Art <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> in an Isle called <hi>Coos;</hi> and it is no less Remarkable, that the truest Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure was made on it, in this Island, by the Famed College of Physicians of <hi>London;</hi> It was a Member of that Society, Doctor <hi>William Harvey,</hi> of Immortal Memory, that had laid another <hi>Basis,</hi> by Detecting the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> for which this <hi>Britain</hi> may as justly Merit the Title of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> as the other <hi>Cous.</hi> The Rubbish that was cast about it by <hi>Parisanus, Leighnerus,</hi> and others to Obscure it, tended to render it more firm; notwithstanding, this was so smoothly removed by that Incomparable Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
<pb facs="tcp:55228:5"/>
Sir <hi>George Ent,</hi> the now Praesident of the College, in his <hi>Apology,</hi> that all Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities did then adjudge those void of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, that did not readily Embrace that Principle, and that it was Impossible, for any man to Arrive to be a Physician without the knowledg of it.</p>
            <p>For many Ages the World was Ignorant, whence the superfluous Moisture proceeded, which we hourly spit out, until the out-let, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> were discovered by the Learned Doctor <hi>Wharton,</hi> a Fellow of the College; and though it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, nothing could be further declared, touching the structure of the Liver, yet so Elegant a description of its most Intime parts, and dissemination of its Vessels, <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidochus,</hi> and a very exact pursuit of the Limphaeducts was made by the most Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht Doctor <hi>Glisson</hi> (the late Praesident) in his <hi>Anatomia Hepatis,</hi> that in a manner it appeared, as if nothing had been solidly Written of it by any before him.</p>
            <p>That some Distempers had escaped the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Graecian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, was evidenced by the eminently Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor <hi>Bates,</hi> Doctor <hi>Glisson,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Regemorter,</hi> Collegues, in that excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>de Rachitide.</hi> In all my Travels, I had
<pb facs="tcp:55228:5"/>
never the good Fortune to be particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Person equal in Litterature, Experience and Observation with Doctor <hi>Bates;</hi> I must confess, I went ever from him more knowing, than I was before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pharmacopoea</hi> compiled by the whole Body of this Apollinean Society, doth justly Merit the Character of a most Elaborate work, from those, that shall compare the several compositions in it with their Original, where the amendments of Omitting of superfluous, incongrous, or Asymmetrous ingredients, and substituting of necessary and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Correctives, are to every Eye very Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and their Care, that those Medicines be Neatly, and Artificially praepared by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries of <hi>London,</hi> hath proved so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that Travellers are Obliged to Attest, that <hi>Pharmacy</hi> is in no Forreign part so much Improved, as it is here; and therefore why is not the <hi>London Theriaca Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machi</hi> aequal to <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oft times consists only of the two third parts of the Ingredients, and the better half of them Garbles? Or why should the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Alkermes</hi> of <hi>Monpelier</hi> exceed that of <hi>London?</hi> I must confess our Apothecaries set an higher Price upon their Medicines and their Labour too, than the <hi>French,</hi> and not without Reason; for you must agree to me,
<pb facs="tcp:55228:6"/>
that an <hi>English</hi> Apothecary, who puts on three pair of Sleeves a Week; and comes Neatly about your <hi>Posteriora,</hi> doth better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Shilling for giving you a Glyster, than a <hi>French</hi> Apothecary wearing his Half-shirt a Month, Two-pence. That by the way, but still I must say, that Medicines are no where so Neatly, so Honestly, and so Skilfully praepared as here at <hi>London,</hi> and in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular you may easily believe me a Judg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent enough, since when I was a Student in Physick, Lodging purposely at an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries House, I have spent many a half hour at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>estil and Mortar, and did arrive to that Proficiency, that I could praetend to dispence <hi>Methridate,</hi> or make up a <hi>Paracelsus</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster, with any of the Trade.</p>
            <p>It is not so much in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> as <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> claim the Superlative; It is confessed, a <hi>French-Man</hi> shall very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously take off six Legs or Arms, to One of an <hi>English</hi> Surgeon; he shall make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with his Scissors, as far as he can well reach with his sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>robe, let it go as far as it will between the Muscles, or the <hi>Cutis</hi> and the <hi>Membrana Carnosa,</hi> when an <hi>English</hi> Surgeon shall only clap in a Dorsil into the Orifice: He shall force in two of his Fingers into a Wound as far as he can possibly reach, though the Orifice will scarce admit a Probe
<pb facs="tcp:55228:6"/>
without great pain; whereas one of our Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons shall gently stroak the coagulated Blood, or lodged Matter towards the Orifice. This is the Difference, but the Issue is, that of those six Members Amputated, four or five of the Patients shall retire into the other World, whereas on the other side probably five among the six shall be praeserved with their Legs on. Touching those large Incisions, it's observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in making them they oft cut a Vein or Artery asunder, and cause Mortal Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages, or at least oft create incurable Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; whereas the other without putting the Patient to that Extremity of pain, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, shall safely and easily Cure him in a few dayes. Of how dangerous a Consequence the forcing of Fingers into Wounds doth oft prove, is abundantly Evident to all Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Surgeons. It must be granted, that in some Cases Members cannot be praeserved, likewise Incisions may be necessary, where Matter is suspected to lodge remote; or a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sometimes may be gently slid into a Wound, to clear it of coagulated Blood or Matter, that's lodg'd near the Orifice; but to practice Surgery as I have seen it in most parts of <hi>France</hi> (excepting only the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> Hospital at <hi>Paris,</hi> where in my younger Years, for to acquire a competent knowledge in that part of Physick, I had leave to dress
<pb facs="tcp:55228:7"/>
for some Months) is not comparable to the Practice of <hi>English</hi> Surgeons; so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the <hi>French</hi> Practice I have oft ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, that in some Countries, you shall scarce see a Person of Quality, but must have his <hi>French</hi> Surgeon at his Elbow, as if no Body could Cure a Clap but a <hi>French</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; for I cannot imagine what other Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they can have for him, now Duels are grown so much out of Fashion. That I do not Write this out of a Praejudice, but from a real Truth, you may apprehend from my particular Humour, which sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me, to be extremely pleased with <hi>French</hi> Company. I must now return to give you likewise an account of the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, wherein the Fellows of the College have proved so wonderfully Successful, that their Methods of Curing the most stubborn of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, may serve for a fit Pattern to all the World to Practice by, and I cannot deny, but in many Cases it hath proved so to me, which to acknowledg is the sole occasion of my Introducing this Discourse. But possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may appear strange, that of a Society, whose Fame is spread as far as the Art of Physick it self, I should not endeavor to be a Member. In relation to that particular, I am Obliged to give you Satisfaction; it is many Years past, (<hi>viz.</hi> In the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion)
<pb facs="tcp:55228:7"/>
when I first arrived at <hi>London,</hi> to Initiate my Practice in Physick, at which time I ought to have entred into the College, but find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, that the Humour of some was much towards Preaching, Praying, and all the Knacks of <hi>Phanaticism,</hi> others driving a way quite contrary; in fine the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was such, that I concluded I should scarce make up my account among them, and therefore judged it more Expedient, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue my Advantages abroad; but now finding the College Re-establisht, and Revested with their Ancient Lustre, and many to have got in, who when I begun to Practice, were not come from the <hi>Grammar School,</hi> if I should come in I must give Praecedency to those Youngsters, which I imagine I shall never do. My next Affair is to praeacquaint you with the Design of this Treatise; I do assure you, I have Inserted nothing in it, but what I have found to be true, and have used my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Endeavours to Trac all the Steps of this General Disease; I have Imparted to you some Secrets, which when you know, and have Tried, you will have Reason to believe, I had no other Drift in Divulging this <hi>Octavo,</hi> than sincerely to serve the Publick.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> The Design of the Treatise. <hi>2.</hi> The Synonyma's and Derivation of the <hi>Scorvey. 3.</hi> Whether the <hi>Scorvey</hi> was known to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len?</hi> that it's contagious and haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. <hi>4.</hi> That the <hi>Scorvey</hi> is of about <hi>200</hi> years standing.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will not resume, what by others hath so oft been chaw'd upon, and that take for a reason, if I do not tell you a Story out of <hi>Eugalen, Solomon Albertus,</hi> or <hi>Wierus,</hi> a sort of people, that from one another re-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55228:9"/>
a most prodigal number of Scorbutick Symptoms, by the same Rule of Arithmetical Progression, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> made use of in mustering his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of Pulses, an impertinent vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, more imaginary, than percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the subtillest Aranean Tact. By what I here condemn, you may conjecture, I praetend to divulge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular, in such terms, as shall as little tire you in the reading, as me in writing. To commence my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from the Description of my Subject, seemeth most expedient, wherein an exactness ought to be aimed at, exceeding what hitherto hath been heeded, which may oblige such, as when meeting with a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they are not well acquainted with, are compelled to tell the Patient, it is the <hi>Scorvey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. <hi>Scorbutus</hi> and <hi>Scorvey (quasi Scorbey)</hi> are words bastardized from <hi>Scorbeck,</hi> a Westphalian Primitive, denoting a Hoarse Throat, probably a Symptom, that antiently attended that Disease, and in these dayes is now and then observed a Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55228:9"/>
especially among the Danes, where it passed by the name of <hi>Scher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>; who moreover being oft rack'd with tearing pains in their legs, gave them the name of <hi>Schor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bein,</hi> or Tear-leg. By the way, I must here take notice of a vulgar error, in the Orthography of the word <hi>Scurvey,</hi> which ought to be written <hi>Scorvey,</hi> as being derived from the word <hi>Scorbeck.</hi> The Low Dutch discerning; it oft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth its fury on the Guts, by causing insufferable Gripes, chuse to call it <hi>Scheurbuyck</hi> or <hi>Tear-belly</hi>; also <hi>de Blawe Shuit,</hi> from those blew spots, that haunt Scorbutick Legs. From the stink of Breath and foulness of the Gums, the Italians name it <hi>La Marcia di Bocca,</hi> or <hi>Scornobocca,</hi> implying a corruption of the mouth. But if it be proper to derive the denomination of a Disease from its chief Symptoms, the word <hi>Gingipedium (crassa &amp; pingui Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va)</hi> expresseth its nature more amply, declaring it most incommodious (<hi>gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givis &amp; pedibus</hi>) to the gums and legs; and it may be conjectured, this kind of Nomenclature was twisted together out of those two Antick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55228:10"/>
words latinized <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. The use of these words seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be of a far ancienter date, than <hi>Pliny</hi>'s age, since <hi>Strabo</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> in the Six'h Book of his Geography, about the

That each of these have a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in their Causes and Symptoms to the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> needs no debate; for according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Citation, in those great Spleens <hi>The Belly is puffed up, afterward the Spleen doth also swell, and is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rd, and acute pains happen to the Spleen, the colour is also changed and looks black, pale, and like a Pomegranate shell; and an ill smell cometh out of their mouth, and the gums scent ill and separate from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55228:11"/>
the teeth; and on the legs there break out Vlcers, also nocturnal Pustuls; and the parts are extenuated, and their ordure is not evacuated.</hi> The <hi>Ilios Haematites</hi> is also decipher'd with features not unlike the former: <hi>The Disease,</hi> saith <hi>Hippocrates, beginneth about the Autumn, and therein these things happen: There commeth an ill scent out of the mouth from the teeth, and the gums separate from them; and blood floweth out of the nostrills; and sometines ulcers break out on their legs, and other things appear, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour groweth black, and the skin thin.</hi> The curiosity praedominating so much among Authors, touching the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of primaeval and subsequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, might be construed very super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for the result, whether it be so or not, contributeth no more light to the scrutiny of the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> than a Candle to the Sun at Noon-day; though perchance <hi>exercitii gratia,</hi> and for reputation of being versed in Antick Lectures, it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be ventilated. The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the major part of the learned, infers from the near alliance of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55228:11"/>
the <hi>Great Spleens</hi> of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> to be the <hi>Scorvey</hi>; and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the same reason are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the <hi>Black Jaundice,</hi> the <hi>Ileos Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites</hi> and <hi>Black Vitiligo,</hi> are no other. If this inference be received, Hypochondriack Melancholy, Hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Passion, Quartan Ague, and most other Splenetick Maladies, may be reduced as <hi>Species</hi> to the <hi>Gender</hi> of the <hi>Scorvey.</hi> But upon a strict sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey your aestimate will conclude, that the distinction of Diseases doth not depend so much on common acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as properties; or to speak phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically, on Pathognomonics, derived from a Specifick qualification, in their Causes, Parts affected, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms. Thus the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gumenal cause of the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> though its vulgarly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Melancholy, or rather Salt vitiated or degenerated to a praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and in that qualification may be a common parent to this, the <hi>Great Spleens, Black Jaundice,</hi> and the rest; yet the more nice insinuation of others hath detected the Salts of the Blood so specifically receded from their natural Constitution in the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55228:12"/>
and to have indued such pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine qualities, that they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give birth to any other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease than this. Moreover, by most the part affected and harth of the praeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged distempers, are determined u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically the Spleen; in the Scorvey the Stomach (by some the <hi>Pancreas</hi>) the Spleen and Liver; and some do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so accuse the brain, though <hi>per dente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropathiam.</hi> Among the Symptoms the difference is most perspicuous, the exufflation of the Spleen is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes discovered in the Scorvey, though in great Spleens never absent: In the <hi>Ileos Haematites</hi> there is loss of blood by Stool, attended with tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gripes; which in this distemper is not assumed for a Pathognomonic. The Scorvey: is particularly malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, because it is contagious, and so radicated, that for some months, and fraequently years, it doth praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate over the most potent of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; and Infants oft bringing Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Seminaries with them into the world, speak it haereditary; insomuch that on some Families the Scorvey hath been intailed with their Estates.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55228:12"/>
These Praedicates certainly are not convertible with the fore-mentioned Diseases, and therefore ought not so rashly to be pronounced the Scorvey; which moreover is <hi>Endemick,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Epidemick</hi> and <hi>Pandemick.</hi> Thus far no sensible error can be incurred, if upon comprise of the whole, these Diseases are conceded to be Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, in the same terms, as one may aptly explain a Pleurisie, an <hi>Empye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> an Inveterate Cough, and many other Pulmonic Diseases, <hi>Asthmatic,</hi> but not an <hi>Asthma</hi>; unless derived from Saline Scorbutic <hi>Procatarctic</hi> and <hi>Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenal</hi> Causes.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. The <hi>Scorvey,</hi> in respect of its primar appearance, seems to bear no certainty in Chronology, since some describe it a distemper, that for some Ages hath harrassed the crazy inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the world; others will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it a Disease of longer date, than Authors of the last Century record its first budding among the Danes, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Westphalians; which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time of Two hundred years at most. This latter sentiment is easily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55228:13"/>
supported by this Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> No Disease described by any of the Greek, Latine, or Arabian Physicians, doth exactly quadrate in Parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Causes, and Symptoms with this Northern Scorvey; and therefore may be inferred a new up-start Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: especially that sort of Scorvey, which in my <hi>Little Venus</hi> I term <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick.</hi> Probably an objection may be offer'd, that since those Procatar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic and Proegumenal Causes, had their being many Ages past, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently an influence on humane Bodies, they must necessarily (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that trite Axiome, <hi>Posita causa ponitur effectus</hi>) have constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scorvey. To this is replied, History maketh no report of those occasions, that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to produce this Malady. The Graecians, among whom those great Spleens of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> being nearest of kin to the Scorvey, were so popular, lived in a benign air, and were constantly imployed in Warlick Exercises, whereby they were divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Melancholy, or other dull Passions, from Excess of Sleep or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55228:13"/>
Sloath, and other inconveniences: so that those External Causes, that now concur in the production of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, had no praevalence on them; and therefore improbable, our Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per should have been engender'd then, or any time before. But waving other Causes, and considering only, it is an <hi>Endemick</hi> Disease, which hath its chief dependance on the Air, and particular disposition of the Clime, wherein alterations happen by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from Sea or Earth, and Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Irradiations, which being so various and fraequent, it's no wonder, if the Scorvey be a recent producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or if every moneth or year Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of new aspects emerge.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>INto two great branches the <hi>Scorvey</hi> seems to be divaricated, namely a <hi>foul Scorbutick Mouth,</hi> or rather the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey,</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick Legs,</hi> or <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi>; to which very aptly a third may be added, to wit the <hi>Joynt-Scorvey.</hi> The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of Swelled, Laxe, Spungy, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, sore Gums, loose Teeth, that in process of time do inevitably rot or cariate, and a stinking Breath; which as they ascend through various degrees to an extremity, do render the disease very incommodious, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing observed the tumefaction of the Gums in some so luxuriant, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Lips in closing, appearing more like a <hi>Fungus</hi> grown to the Jaw, then Gums; on the contrary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55228:14"/>
the Gums have been intirely corroded away, so as the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or juncture of the Teeth, and Jaw, might have been evidently discerned; and you may receive it for a truth, that the corrosion was continuated with that rapid violence, in the Lips of a certain Scorbutick Dutchman, who for cure was admitted into the Hospital at <hi>Leyden,</hi> that being quite devoured, the Teeth were left bare, and exposed to the Air: wherefore note, that the first degree of a foul or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Mouth is a swelling of the Gums, through a thin serous or ichorous blood, soon after disposed to be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of its bounds, with the least touch of a Finger, insomuch that it's fraequently observed, that Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks biting a peice of bread, the remainder in their hands will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear all bloody about the edges: Hereupon the Gums fissure or cleave, afterwards changing into phagedaenic ulcers, which not seldom are suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by malignant cancerous ulcers, threatning an extream deformity and devoration of all the circumjacent parts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55228:15"/>§ 2. More than once I have given advice for little hard unaequal swellings about the inside of the Lips, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Tongue, of a livid, or not infraequently of an ash colour and dolorous. These by Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are termed Cancers of the Mouth, and indeed are little less than Cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and consequently Scorbutick. Neither would I have you judge it a Paradox, if I assert an Endemic Cancer in whatsoever part, to be an extream degree of a <hi>Scorvey</hi>; as hereafter may be more plainly repraesented. Of the nature of the praemised Cancers in the Mouth, doth participate a <hi>Ranula,</hi> a Tubercle under the Tongue, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, because being an impediment to the free motion of the Tongue, in pronouncing words, that contain the Liquids <hi>L</hi> or <hi>R,</hi> it occasions them to sound frog-like. The Cure hereof is vsually attempted by Astringents and Acids, as Oyl of Vitriol and others, whence seldom or never a succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> being answered to the intention of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, converts his hopes to the sharp Steel, or the Fire. But were it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55228:15"/>
supposed scorbutick, as many other signs accompanying, do certainly evince it to be, might infallibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Cure by a Scorbutic To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. A vagous re-current Tooth-ach, especially in Women, doth often act a part in the <hi>Syndrome</hi> of a <hi>Mouth-Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> which in distinction to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tooth-ach, hath concomitant a very grating pain, with a violent sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation of thin saline Rheum; and as it is that, which for Cure hath been an <hi>Opprobrium Medicorum,</hi> for their frustraneous applications, so the most facile and indubious method of sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this pain by Antiscorbuticks, is an argument, there hath been a Hallu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, in discerning the true cause of it.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. <hi>Grandines,</hi> or little whitish hard swellings, of the bigness of a Radish seed, with a small perforation in the middle, and running about the Tongue, Gums, Palate, and inside of the Cheeks, is a Scorbutick Thrush, and cured onely by Antiscorbuticks.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55228:16"/>
And those that have been curious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers in their practice, can attest, there is a periodical swelling of the <hi>Tonsils</hi> (or Almonds under the Ears) and a relaxation of the <hi>Vvula</hi> and Palat, which must be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Diagnosticks of a <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi>; and such being render'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worse by the use of ordinary astringents, I have cured with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garism of <hi>Betony, Sage</hi> and <hi>Scorvey-grass,</hi> Elder and Rosemary-flowers, and Nettle-seeds, boyl'd in white Wine and Water, with a few drops of spirit of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> instilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the decoction; but not without assistance of internal Medicines.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. The discoloration of the Gums in a Scorbutick Mouth first appears in a deep red, afterwards in a spotted yellow, then duskish and leadish, and at last a cadaverous pale, or a cancer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous black. The Veins about the Gums, under the Tongue, and the inside of the Lips, shew unaequal, swell'd and ill-colour'd. The sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Gums feels sometimes burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or as if prick'd with Needles;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55228:16"/>
other times the pain lies deep about the <hi>Periostium,</hi> or Membrane of the Jaw, not unlike the Tooth-ach.</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. Among the Pathognomonics of a <hi>Mouth-Scorvey,</hi> none is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly concomitant than a Stinking Breath; insomuch that it is beyond all contradiction, where there is a continual stink of Breath, (evident causes, as Ulcers of the Mouth, Throat and Lungs always excepted) there is a confirmed, or at least a growing <hi>Scorvey:</hi> and among all those Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks I ever was concerned with in relation to their cure, I never found that symptom absent; which if by the course of some years it be established in a deep radication, is refractory to all cure; if recent, all hope is repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a strict Scorbutick method. And for this so ungrateful symptom, the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi> comprehends a great lassitude and weakness of the Knees and Ankles, spots and blotches of several figures and colours on the Shins, and particularly just below the Knee, and also near the Ankles, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuls, uneven Tumours and Tubercles of Purpre Variegated Red. Oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Legs, with thick, hard, callous, livid, or sometimes brown red Skin about the Ancle, ulcers on the Shin, and near the Ankle, pains of the Knees, likewise deep pains along the Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, continuing all day, but raging most in the night, are all fraequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of the <hi>Leg-Scorvey.</hi>

            <p n="2">§ 2. The feebleness of the Knees and Ankles coming gradually upon you; without any evident praeceding Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, or any suddain alteration of looks, or habit of body; is an <hi>Item</hi>

            <p n="3">§ 3. Scorbutick ulcers, especially those on the Shins, and near the Ancle, upon a short continuance grow callous about the Lips, within painful, as if prick'd with Needles; their flesh appearing torn, uneven, of an ill aspect, the Lips tumid, the matter undigested

is this Species, or sort of Scorvey only circumscribed with the praenumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Symptoms, but is also applicable to those, whose Articles or Joynts are subject to Crackle upon a sudden Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

The
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55228:20"/>
impure Nutriment the Conception as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth in the Womb, rendreth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more subject to this kind of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, than others of Riper years, and is vulgarly stiled the Joynt-Evil, and some will know it by no other Name than the Kings-evil, which properly denotes only Scrophulous and Strumatick Kernels and Tumors, though beyond all scruple are of the same Production with the former, and consequently highly Scorbutick. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are a <hi>Fistula Lachrymalis,</hi> and other malignant Issues near the Angles of the Eyes, or those <hi>Epiphora's,</hi> or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eyes, different in Causali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Constitution from either of the fore-mentioned.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Another sort of Joynt-Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey is specified in Rheumatisms, which generally declare themselves by pains of the Joynts, or rather in some by Tortures of the extream Articles, as Wrists, Knuckles, Joynts of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Elbows, Shoulders, Hips, Knees, Ancles, Toes, and worst of all, when the impetuous flood of Salin Rheum streams to the Neck, and Back-bone.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55228:20"/>
(<hi>Spina Cervicis &amp; dorsi.</hi>) Pains of this Nature are so Violent, that for Acuteness are not parallel'd by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gout-pains. In like manner this sort of Rheumatism doth oft rudely afflict the sides of the Head, decur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the <hi>Bregma,</hi> to the upper and lower Mandibles, and Roots of the Teeth, shooting like Darts from one part of the Head to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with so quick a Perculsive motion, that Lightning and Blasts seem slow to it.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Practical Observations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us a two-fold Rheumatism, External and Internal. The former is just now praemised: The latter is discovered by Internal, Acute, Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pains, moving Erratically from one Bowel to another, thence possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Guts, and thence again it may be to the Ambient Skin, or to some other Bowel, or the Brest; the quality of these Internal pains, is for suddain and violent Motion, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling External Rheumatisms; and for Acuteness, forceth the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to scriech out, lamenting his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55228:21"/>
pain, now in one place, praesently after in another, and suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in another, to no small Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Visiters; since for a small interval being free from pain, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself very well, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friends with Discourse, on a suddain a shooting pain shall take him, and alter the Scene to a contrary Disposition. Internal Rheumatisms are generally of a taedious continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the pains are far more brisk at one time than another, and sometimes do make a Truce with the Patient for a few Dayes or sometimes Weeks, but in the interim detain him in a neuter Estate, which can be determined neither well nor ill, but weak; and thus I have heard of several, whose Recovery was scarce accomplisht in several Years; but that might partly be imputed to the ill address of the Physician, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skil'd in managing that Disease.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Among divers Joynt-Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, it hath been Remarked, their Bones have been very Frangible, that upon very small occasions, they have had the misfortune of breaking their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55228:21"/>
Legs, Arms, Bones of the Hand, and Fingers; but before this can arrive, another Symptom doth ever praecede, namely, a Cracking and Noise of the Joynts, when they are moved. It argues him much a stranger to Practice and Experience, that never observed an Arthritick or Gouty-Scorvey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a sort of Counter-natural affection, as besets the parts near the Joynts with <hi>Corrosive</hi> Salin Ichors, and through them attaques them with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lacerative and Terebrating pains, and such as commonly in the Night season Duplicate their Fury. In this Disease, as it's Genuine distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from other Gouts, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much conduce to the Solace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patient, and his compleat Recovery; so it would no less add to the Reputation of the Physician, and therefore shall in their places amplifie upon it's Description, Causes, Signs and Cure.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Two Bones being tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that place where they meet is properly termed the Joynt, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned together, or Juncture, or Articulation. Physicians also stile it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55228:22"/>
an Article, but improperly, the word <hi>Articulus</hi> importing a Diminutive of <hi>Artus,</hi> Latiniz'd from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Moreover, Bones that are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arthrotically joyned, are fastened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, besides particular Ligaments, by a common Ligament or Band growing usually from the lower part of the Apophyse of one Bone, and inserted into the upper part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophyse of the other Bone. This common Ligament or Band is in point of substance tough, thick, dense and extensive, and by reason of its close Compacture, and immediate Adhaesion and Circumvesture, doth refuse pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to all Arthritick humours, whence may be Deduced, the Gout is not properly to be termed a Joynt-disease; whereunto this Instance contributes an unquaestionable Evidence, that the Internal parts of the Joynt being Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaginous, and the Ambient parts Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are both Insensible and Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Sensation: So that we must conclude the Universal Sentiment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this particular a vulgar Error, growing from an Inadvertency and blind Ignorance in <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55228:22"/>§. 7. We are therefore to state the Parts nearest adjacent (above or below) to the Joynt, the Seat of the Gout, which by reason of the Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Tendons, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesture of the <hi>Periostium,</hi> are exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely Sensible, and exposed to the greatest Tortures.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. The Joynts that are most commonly haunted by the Gout, are the Hip, where it's called the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or Hip-Gout; the Knees, where it's termed the Knee-Gout, or <hi>Gonagra</hi>; the Feet, which comprehends also the Ancles, and here it's named the <hi>Podagra,</hi> or Foot-Gout; and the Hands, including also the Wrists, thence called <hi>Chiragra,</hi> or Hand-Gout. Besides these, most other Joynts, as Shoulders, Elbow, and Back and Neck-bones, are sometimes also at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued by those furious pains. Why these last recited Junctures are not so much exposed to Gout pains, as the former, is, because being wrapt about with fleshy Tendons, and Muscles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thence a great assistance of heat and warmth, whereby the temperament
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55228:23"/>
of those parts are much comforted, the External cold resisted, and those Saline Acrimonious Ichors soon dissipated.</p>
            <p>The periodical Revolutions of these Arthritick Scorveys, are an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to me, they are subject to a Praedominance of both the <hi>Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>: For from the Seasons produced by the Suns Peragration, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitated Spring and Fall; and the <hi>Lunar Circuits</hi> occasion their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Return in many Bodies as ordinarily, as the monthly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of Women, scarce any Sex or Age under Twelve or Fourteen, being exempted from the fore-mentioned <hi>Arthritick Scorvey</hi>; But it's otherwise in the Gout, which ordinarily rather invades the Crazie Bodies of Super-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated Persons.</p>
            <p>In contra-distinction to an <hi>Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Scorvey,</hi> that's fixt to a part, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Hip, Knee, or Foot, as hath been just now Praeliminated; there is also observed an <hi>Arthritis vaga,</hi> or Fugitive Arthritick Scorvey; but this being not different from an External Rheumatism, whereof hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, shall supersede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explanation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55228:23"/>It will hardly escape the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of many Perusers, that I have beyond the Sentiment of other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, reduced the Praeternatural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections treated of here in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, within the Latitude of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey. Wherefore that I may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Sinister Censure, I will offer those Arguments, that to me were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Motives, which if to others they seem less persuasive, I need only tell them, I may with as much right range them in the Train of the Scorvey, as <hi>Eugalen, Solomon Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Wierus,</hi> and twenty more have given place to half the known Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the Diseased Body of Man, in the List of <hi>Scorbutick Attendants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the Insertion of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Lassitude in the first Article, all Authors that have Treated on the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> have granted that Symptom almost so Universal, as to be a Pathog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomonick inseparable.</p>
            <p>In relation to that of the second Article, most may find difficulty, to Identifie it with the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> since it's not easie to discern one and the same Disease, to be the same in two or more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55228:24"/>
several Patients; much less a Disease that's so Various and Multiform, featu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with several Shapes and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in several Subjects: Wherefore I must be obliged to a Recital of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Marks, and received Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Authors do either Diversify or Identifie Diseases.</p>
            <p>Causes of the same Nature and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, though Univocal, do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes produce the same Effects, and therefore consequently (though two or more Diseases are engendred by the same Efficients, and out of the same Matter) they may be different Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whence may be objected, that those Joynt-Diseases, though issuing from the same Causes the Scorvey is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from, it's no Argument they should be termed the Scorvey. By this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, the Peripatetick Maxim seems to be suspected, <hi>viz. Posita causa, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur effectus; ergo posita causa Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, ponuntur effectus Scorbutici:</hi> And all Diseases that are produced by a Scorbutick cause, must be the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</p>
            <p>You must observe the truth of this Theorem doth depend upon certain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55228:24"/>
Limitations, namely, a cause to be qualified to produce the same Effects, must be Univocal, and <hi>a causa per se</hi>; for otherwise (though granted Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal) its causality may be <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> Depravated, and Occasioned to an Aberrancy by other causes: For instance in the Scorvey, imagine it's Production from a corrupt Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that may Stagnate in the Spleen, which being supposed in two several Bodies; in the one possibly it may constitute Symptoms, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Concomitants of the Scorvey; in the other, because there may be a mixture of Vitiated Choler, or of a <hi>Serum</hi> affected with an ill Quality, or a great Infirmity of some Entrail; the aforesaid supposed Scorbutick cause shall be so Obtused, Altered, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a different Efficiency, that the Diseases so produced, shall be no Scorvey, but some other Counter-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection. This may also very properly be exemplified in Coelestial Causes, among which conceive a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in such a Sign, and such a Degree, by his influence to produce certain Effects, upon any supposed Sublunary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55228:25"/>
body; at its return to the same Sign and Degree, possibly it shall not be a cause of the same Effects, because through the Radiations of other Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamentary lights, it's influence shall be directed and limited to another Effect much different: Whence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rendred the Ground of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Symptoms in the Body of Man obvious, my next affair is to propose a Theorem whereby Diseases are Identified.</p>
            <p>Diseases are computed the same, that are constituted by the same Univocal Causes, not aberring further <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> than that those symptoms that are effected <hi>per se,</hi> may in Number and Specification exceed those, that are produced <hi>per accidens.</hi> Moreover, Diseases by their Intrinsick significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imply Parts primarily affected, whereof they are Diseases; and therefore Diseases cannot be Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unless the parts affected prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be the same; which we must now explain to be the same in the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> and in the <hi>Joynt-Evil,</hi> and <hi>Gout-Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</hi> None vary from this Opinion, that the parts Primarily and Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55228:25"/>
affected in the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> are all the chief parts of the <hi>Inferior Cavity,</hi> that appertain to the <hi>Natural Faculty,</hi> whose office is to Confect the Chyle, Elaborate and Depurate the Blood, which are the Stomack, Spleen and Liver.</p>
            <p>The Chyle in those, that are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Joynt-Evil,</hi> receiving a Malign Tincture and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, from an ill qualified Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, is a praegnant Evidence, the Stomack is a part affected; and the aforesaid Chyle upon its arrival with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Spleen and Liver, induing a quality of a Malignanter efficacy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly proves, both those Entrails aequally parts affected, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the parts radically or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected are the same.</p>
            <p>Neither can I discern any difference in the Causes of both, residing in a corrupt Salt, fixt or volatil. It must then be the difference of symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that creates suspicion of the Diversity between these Joynt-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> which as was intimated before, may be remarked in all Universal Diseases, varying in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55228:26"/>
two or more Bodies, in several symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and yet are deemed the same Disease: A continual acute Feaver (which I call an Universal Distemper, because it's symptoms are Universal, and disturb all the parts of the Body in their several Functions) in one is attended with Vomitings, in the other with a Looseness, in a third with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which nevertheless, are known and determinated Concomitants of a continual acute Feaver in all. In thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Labyrinth, the Position stated in the beginning of this Paragraph, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts me to an Expedient of surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the difficulty, <hi>viz.</hi> The symptom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Identifie Diseases, do immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>per se,</hi> emanate from them, in or near the parts affected: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if the Heart be seized with a Disease, the Pulsation doth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly express it, being a symptom that immediately consecutes the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the part affected, which is the Heart; the like may be observed in all Diseases. These must be such as properly are terms <hi>Pathognomonick,</hi> and by Industry, and fraequent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, may be discerned in most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55228:26"/>
though symptoms that are occasioned <hi>per accidens</hi> are Infinite, and common to many Diseases. Now to our Affair; In the recited <hi>Joynt-Diseases,</hi> and <hi>Gout-Scorvey,</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical symptoms are an ill Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> or a vitiated Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Depuration of the <hi>Chyme</hi>; a propagation of Malign Seminaries, in the Bowels and Blood, that renders Diseases contagious, Haereditary, and most Obstinate; these being likewise symptoms in the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> I judge I have justly Identified them; but that will more amply appear in my subsequent Discourse. Add hereunto, that in Identified Diseases, the Procatartick causes are the same, which in these various kinds of the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a Salin Air and Diet, whence both the Internal, Antecedent and Continent causes afterwards take their Original, which also for a certain space continue the same, until that by a continuated morbifick Action and Calcination, they pass into a contrary Nature, from an <hi>Acid,</hi> to an <hi>Alcali,</hi> as among <hi>Chymical</hi> processes, appears in <hi>Acid Tartar,</hi> which by Calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. BY a Scrutiny into some Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick and Occasional Causes, we may possibly be Conducted into a Path, of discovering the Immediate and Continent causality of the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi>; and therefore converting our Observation on the Effects of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol, Nitre, Vinegar,</hi> &amp;c. We
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55228:28"/>
shall on the aestimate of the use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, mixt with Powders into Dentifrice, or Instilled into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for a Collution of the Mouth, award, they are as offensive as any Internal cause, by Rotting and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Teeth, raising Pain and Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Gums, and moving a thin Sputation.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Mercury</hi> externally by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friction forced into the Pores, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally taken in the form of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Sublimate,</hi> or <hi>Praecipitate,</hi> soon Ravages the Mouth, exactly like, a Scorbutick Cause, since it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces up a Humour from within, that swells, Fissures, Ulcers, Pains the Gums and the Mouth, Looseneth and Rots the Teeth, Salivates, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions a fowl stink of Breath; all which symptoms, if we can demonstrate to take their rise from <hi>Effluviums</hi> issuing from an Acid Salt, mercurial praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have all their dependance on, and which within their most intime and centrical Particles, do contain a most Subtile Vibrating and Volatil Salt, will result into a praemiss, whence no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55228:29"/>
Ingenious Reader, but with me, will conclude a <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by a corrupt Acid Salt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fluid, and a Volatil Salt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into corrosive, inordinate in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and united with a Fuliginous Salt. That you may be convinced of this <hi>Hypothetick</hi> proposition, take Inspection into the various processes of Mercurial Elaborations, where you find <hi>Mercury</hi> fixt (but very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) into <hi>Praecipitates, Sublimates, Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> of divers Shapes and Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Into White, Red and Yellow <hi>Praecipitates,</hi> by <hi>Aqua Fortis, Spir. Nitr. Spir. Sal. Ol. Vitr.</hi> all which, take notice, are vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acid; and thence conceive, that the Volatil Salt, or Fugitive Spirits, latent in <hi>Mercury,</hi> are only to be tied by an acid <hi>Vinculum.</hi> If upon this you design to reduce <hi>Mercury</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Praecipitate,</hi> or <hi>Sublimate,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Praeparation) to its former shape of <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> it's easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by freeing it from that acid <hi>Vinculum,</hi> in mixing it with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Calx Viv. Gypsum, Soap-ashes, Sal Tartari,</hi> &amp;c. and driving it through
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55228:29"/>
a Retort, whereunto it readily yields by means of those Alcalized, or fiery fixt Salts, mortifying the <hi>Acid.</hi> So that by the Rule of Contraries, if an <hi>Alcali</hi> reduces <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, it was detained by an <hi>Acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. The Sequel is farther illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the praeparation of <hi>Sublimate Corrosive,</hi> the <hi>Quick-silver</hi> being first grinded with <hi>Salt Peter, Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Common Salt,</hi> wherein being latent a most potent <hi>Acid</hi> (as appears by their Reverberatory distillations) doth soon invade and penetrate the body of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with its most subtil and fugitive <hi>Minims,</hi> arrests, and in some degree doth fix them, qualifying their Volatil levity with it's ponderous <hi>Acid,</hi> and therein it's discernably as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by affusing a few drops of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Vinegar, or other Acid Spirit, whilst the Salts and <hi>Mercury</hi> are grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. Upon this Mixture, that Salin Lixivious taste of the Salts, before their Coalescence with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> is changed into a pontick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55228:30"/>
Acid taste. And because <hi>Ther eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine</hi> is so praegnant of an Acid spirit (as the Rectified spirit thereof to the Tongue, is a palpable proof) it's therefore the chief refine, that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of subduing <hi>Mercury,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it's Lentour and Glutinous facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth very much contribute.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Hence let us make a nearer approach, to what is a Branch of my Subject, and necessarily conclude, that Spittle (<hi>Saliva</hi>) is endued with a Turgency of Acid Particles, far more potent, than sharp distilled Vinegar, because it's so effectual in Amortizing or Fixing <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> which may likewise be performed by the Acid juice of Limons: But observe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that Spittle is rendred Acid, only towards the latter end of the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stomack, from the Acour of the <hi>Dissolvent Liquour,</hi> and therefore the Morning-fasting-spittle is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the purpose above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Moreover, take this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with you, That the Spittle is imbued at several seasons with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salts; sometimes with Volatil, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55228:30"/>
times with Lixivial salts, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Acid, and sometimes with mixt salts, according to the contents in the Capacity of the Stomack, and about it's tunics; so that all sorts of spittle is not proper for the Amorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Now upon Compute of the whole matter, though your Reason may reap so much satisfaction, as to believe potent <hi>Acids,</hi> the sole subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and capable of arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Fugitive particles; yet we must not be so facil, as to concede all <hi>Acids</hi> pernicious in the same Latitude with <hi>Mercury</hi> coagulated, of acting upon Liquours of the Body, and rendring them Scorbutick aggressors; for the greater number of <hi>Acids,</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with rules of Caution and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, obtaining a virtue of Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Suppressing some kind of Scorbutick symptoms, bear an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Testimony of the contrary.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Spirit of <hi>Salt Marin</hi> (I mean not the <hi>Graecian</hi> Impostor's, but) dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously praepared, according to the rules of the <hi>Spagyrick Art,</hi> hath acquired a good Character to some Physicians,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55228:31"/>
for praescribing it to their Scorbutick Patients: And I were to blame for my silence, should I praetermit the great Effects of <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically purged from its Arseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fumes, not a few Scorbuticks ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Recovery to this <hi>Acid</hi> from very obstinate accidents, that were true issues of that Disease. Neither can the performance of these praecited inciding deoppilative <hi>Acids,</hi> be justly called into doubt, since from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> (used in the Condiment of <hi>Capers, Samphire,</hi> &amp;c.) though of a styptick Energy, advantage hath been received in the Cure of Scorbuticks and Spleneticks: If then these Corroding and Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Acids</hi> merit a reception so just among the <hi>Apollinean</hi> Faculty, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, those that are acquainted with the true Process of the <hi>Acid</hi> spirit of <hi>Tartar,</hi> being so Penetrative, Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, Digestive, <hi>Ecphractick,</hi> and yet of an amicable Acour, can prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a greater secret to Eradicate the Scorvey. By the way, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, It is not against an <hi>Acid Scorvey</hi> they are such excellent Remedies, but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55228:31"/>
against a <hi>Lixivial</hi> one, which in the progress of this Discourse will be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explained to you.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. From this Praecurrent Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, we may be assured in Opinion, that <hi>Acids</hi> by their native Qualification, or Corrosive to some Scorbutick bodies, and therefore it must be through a praeternatural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they are enforced to constitute the Principles of the fore-cited Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. On this occasion, it will not be Dissonant, to Analyse <hi>Mercury</hi> (as it is reduced to a <hi>Praecipitate,</hi> or <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> or other Coagulated body, by acid Salts or Spirits) into its most Intime Syntheticks, whence the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Procreatives of the <hi>Scorvey</hi> will more distinctly Emerge.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. In order to the Unravelling of this so close knitted Mineral, I must first Repraesent to you these by me received <hi>Hermetick</hi> Theorems.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All Alcalies are contrary to Acids, and consequently do extinguish them, or if encountring in a lesser proportion only praefract them.</hi> Affuse the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> Liquor of <hi>Tartar,</hi> to the <hi>Acid</hi> Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in their just propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55228:32"/>
the Production will be a Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> much praefracted in its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calized faculty, and a Salt of <hi>Vitriol</hi> much obtused in its Acidity; but if the Alcaly of <hi>Tartar</hi> be superiour in measure to the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> then it doth reduce the <hi>Vitriol</hi> to a <hi>Capul Mortuum,</hi> and intirely extinguish its Acidity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All Volatil Salts are fixed by Acids.</hi> The Volatil salt of <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi> or Amber, being Irrorated with Spirit of Salt, is soon laid in sleep, and loses its Wings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no Alcali, but in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and centrical Particles, contains a most Acid, Corroding, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forating Salt. Likewise, There is no Acid Salt, or Spirit, but in its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> Particles is lodged <hi>a most Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Alcaly.</hi> Within the centrick of the Acid Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> there is an Igneous and Caustick alt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Volatil Salt is nothing but the fixt Salt of any Body, Volatilized by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Sulphurous Particles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Purgative, or Vomitive, or other active faculty of Bodies, doth Emanate from their Volatil Salts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55228:32"/>
by Irradiation, or Atomical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Application of these to any particular Praeparation, we are to expect, what now we Dive into. To this purpose, let our ordinary <hi>Turbith Mineral,</hi> as it is in the <hi>London Pharmacopoea</hi> Transcribed by our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians out of <hi>Vnzerus,</hi> who Records the Invention of it to <hi>Adam Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denstein,</hi> be our Subject, as best known to my Perusers, both for its Use and Process; though possibly this remarque may escape their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that whereas Directions are given in the <hi>Dispensatory,</hi> for affusing an Anatick proportion of dephlem'd Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> to <hi>Mercury,</hi> purged from its plumbeous Recrements, which Evaporated, leaves a white residence in the bottom of the Bolt-head, to be sweet washt into a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Powder; the praescription of the fore-mentioned <hi>Bodenstein,</hi> requires an addition of Salt of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of half the weight to the Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which renders the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Elaboration less Churlish, and more effectual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55228:33"/>Your view on this discerns the most compact body of <hi>Mercury,</hi> dissolved by the Acid of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> its Fugitive spirits detained, or Volatil salt part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed by its Pontick Liquor, or Acid Salt, and through their mutual Re-action so Elaborated, that in this Conjunct state have assumed neuter Faculties, not to be deprehended in either Singular: For the one is so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Adstrictive, that in Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages both Internal and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it performs, what other Restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents or Emplasticks fail in. The other, <hi>viz. Quick-silver</hi> aims at no other Effects, than its weight or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is capable to produce; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Coalition, they remove most obstinate Diseases by Vomit, Stool, Urine, Sweat, and Salivation.</p>
            <p>From the Inference of the first and second <hi>Spagyrick Theorems,</hi> you must be convinced, it is the Volatil Salt of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and no other Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle, is here Coagulated, because performed by its opposite, a fixing Acid, and thereby somewhat praefracted; for through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of its Vibrating and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55228:33"/>
Faculty, it's experienced not so capable, to Amalgamate the nobler Metals into a <hi>Calx.</hi> From the reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussive particles of the said Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Volatil Salt, the Acid of Vitriol is not only obtused, but rendred a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent corruptive Acid, whereas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally it's known a great Praeserver from putrefaction and dissolution. And if you give credit to the fifth Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, which long Experience hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht firm and indubious among most Practicians; you must assert, not only the Vomitive and Purgative faculties to be issues of the Mercurial Volatil Salt, but also its Salivative quality; which explain'd in manner following, seems to me to be evident enough, how it exerts its power.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. <hi>Turbith Mineral,</hi> or other crude <hi>Mercurial</hi> praeparation, is no sooner swallowed down into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but through its most subtil vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt, doth attaque the Salts, that are floating in the Liquor, the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Stomack is ever furnisht with more or less, (for an absolute driness, would certainly be attended
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55228:34"/>
with a most dangerous Hiccoch, or Convulsion of the Stomack) which in some proportion converting into Particles of its own Nature, doth soon occasion a Turgency in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Stomack, (being an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Contrariety and Combat between the <hi>Mercurial Volatil Salt,</hi> and the <hi>Acid.</hi>) And the Lymph con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Lymphaticks of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, which Turgency continuated to the <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> under the Tongue, and the others that termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate about the Cheeks and Gums, causeth an overflowing of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Lymph or <hi>Serum,</hi> where it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spittle or <hi>Saliva, quasi Sal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ceu Salsus Liquor,</hi> or Salt Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for such it is. Here we must make a Digression to a succinct Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Fabrick, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Stomack, discovering the Nature of it, whence it Sourceth, and through what Creeks and Inoscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations it makes its Irruption, and thence it will prove more facil, by a further pursuit to render the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Salivation Obvious to the meanest Capacity.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55228:34"/>§. 11. Experiment in this Case makes the strongest Plea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will offer you my Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Upon the Dissection of a Dog, fed with salt Meat intermixt with <hi>Sublimate Corrosive,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most thirstily Lapping a great quantity of Water, wherein Pease had been boyled, and immediately strangled. I was chiefly intentive on a strict view and research of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, in whose External Surface or Tunic, being a process of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> the Coeliac Arteries appeared very tumid and full, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery where discernable to the Eye, accompanied with Lymphatick Vessels, that were also no less Turgid, and supported by a number of small Glanduls, which at other times remain hidden, because there is not so great a Confluence of Lymphatick matter, to swell them up. The <hi>Crusta carnosa</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior</hi> Tunic, separable in a Dog from one another, through this superfluous Irrigation were Fungous, and upon a pressure the <hi>Lympha</hi> exstilled at little Pores or Orifices; which probably may be conjectured the extremities
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55228:35"/>
of the Inosculations of the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Vessels. The dispersions of the Branches and Terminations of the foresaid Coeliac Artery, through the middle and inward Tunic, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly distended with Humors, and the Lymphatics every where through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both Tunics, no less visibly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd with moisture, and upon a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent observe of their track, were found to ascend the <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forate the great Glanduls, and thence to the Tonsils, the Ranine, and other Glanduls of the Mouth.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. Before I detected the Expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of these Lymphatick Channels, could not out of any Author supply my self with the Reason, why upon the assuming of any ungrateful Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Purgative or Alterative, after a small interval, the Mouth doth sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a thin pellucid <hi>Serum</hi>; which from the praemised Discourse seems very evident: For upon the Combat between the Dissolvent Liquor (or that which is improperly called the Ferment) and the Volatil Particles of the Medicine, happens a Turgency,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55228:35"/>
which by continuation being likewise Impressed upon the Lymphaticks of the Tunics of the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> and <hi>Oesopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> must necessarily occasion an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing at the Termination of the <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> both of those under the Tongue, and the other on the sides of the Gums.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. By the way, I must make one observe, how unsuccessful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have been, in Imposing the name of <hi>Ferment</hi> upon the <hi>Acid juice</hi> of the Stomack, and describing its Source, or Original. The word <hi>Ferment,</hi> (as you may read more at large, in the first part of my Treatise, <hi>De Febribus, Cap.</hi> V.) is Universally taken to be that, which Clarifies and Exalts any compound Liquor, that's newly made by Decoction, Infusion, Expression, or otherwise, to a greater Perfection, by means of a Simpering (for <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> takes its Derivation <hi>a Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo,</hi> and not <hi>Fervendo</hi>) or a small Ebullition, whereby the Liquor is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliated or Attenuated, and the Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous bodies separated into a Froth and Lees. This Signification
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55228:36"/>
can in no manner be applied to the foresaid <hi>Acid juice,</hi> performing only the Office of Dissolving the Victuals received in the Stomack, and Coae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quating it into a Cream, or <hi>Chyle</hi>; a word Originated from <gap reason="foreign">

am to Illustrate to you, the <hi>Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic juice</hi> is so far remote from being <hi>Acid,</hi> that it's perfectly sweet.

            <p n="19">§. 19.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55228:41"/>
is chiefly floating about the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Ventricle</hi>: But if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Digestive Operation to be performed principally, by virtue of the <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> contained in the Pores of the Lymph, being of a Subliming and Ascending Nature; the Stomack by reason of those greater Nerves of the Sixth pair, and Fibres of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est strength, Circumvesting the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Stomach to be most Robust, and the Heat and Dissolvent steems to be Reflected, Collected, and Augmented there; it must be confessed, that the Digestive Faculty is most Energic about the upper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Ventricle.</hi> The next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in order to be Explain'd, is, when and how the Juice that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, is separated from that, which is not yet perfectly digested, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Transmitted through the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> or Inferior Orifice of the Stomack, into the small Guts. That the whole content of Victuals and Drink is not so long retain'd in the Stomack, until the entire Mass be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Digested, is Experinced by all, that observe their Stomacks after
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55228:41"/>
Meals, to grow gradually Lighter and less distended, and their Appetites like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to return Gradually, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the upper part of the Chyle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first Concocted, and swiming a-top like a Cream, is first praepared, and ready to be Effused thence in this manner: The <hi>Chyle</hi> being thorowly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with a great proportion of <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> is so Rarefied and Tumid, that it now exceeds its bounds, and by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of that Aculeous quality of the aforesaid Salin Particles, stimulates the Oblique Fibres to Expulsion, and still as in the same manner the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is gradually disburdened, so the Fibres gradually Contract and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Tunics into a smaller Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, until the whole be Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the Stomack reduced to a scarce greater Circumscription than a Fist. Several particulars here are of Remarque.</p>
            <p>The first, That the Finer and most Coaequate matter is Extermined first, and that which is somewhat of a gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Pulment next, until at last the coursest and Faeculent part succeeds to be wrought upon, which being Tough,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55228:42"/>
Tenacious and Glutinous, requires an <hi>Acid Dissolvent,</hi> by whose force, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Continuation of the heat, Animal and Vital Spirits, or Vivid <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> fuming out through the Pores of the Nerves and Arteries, the matter is more potently Incided, Comminuted and Dissolved, and the said <hi>Acid Dissolvent,</hi> or <hi>Mock-Ferment,</hi> obtaining a Pontique or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable astringent Acidity, is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, to praecipitate the gross remainder of the <hi>Chyle</hi> into the <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,</hi> and afterwards to fortifie, and Corroborate the distended and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated Fibres of the Stomack by a gentle Astriction.</p>
            <p>The Second, That the <hi>Ventricle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full, the <hi>Pylorus</hi> or lower Orifice is Erected high, to praevent the too sudden Expulsion of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> and therefore no part but what is upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and rendred Turgid, by being throughly Imbued with <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> can be Transmitted; but as the <hi>Chyle</hi> Ebbs lower, so the <hi>Pylorus</hi> seems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to Decline downwards by the Contraction of the Fund of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, to give an easier passage to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55228:42"/>
weighty and drossy remainder of the fore said <hi>Chyle,</hi> to which, should the <hi>Pylorus</hi> continue Mounted, at so great a distance from the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Region of the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or Expulsion would prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difficult.</p>
            <p>The third is, That the last remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Stomack, upon every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Concoction, is nothing but Dross, among some Physicians called the <hi>Scoria,</hi> which being Commixt with the <hi>Acid Mock-Ferment,</hi> is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> where by reason of the Acrimony of the Commixt <hi>Acid,</hi> vellicates the said Gut, at the Terminations of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidochus,</hi> and the <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus,</hi> Irritating the former to Disburden its <hi>Cargo</hi> of Choler, and the latter its Incrassated Glutinous Lymph, of which three only the Excrements of the Guts do consist, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Dross or <hi>Scoria</hi> of the Stomack, they Derive their Matter and Consistency, from the Pancreatic Lymph their Clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Cohaesion, and from the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler their colour, from the quantity whereof it's more or less Yellow,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55228:43"/>
Red, or Luteous, and from the commixture of all their stinck doth Derive.</p>
            <p>The fourth Observe is this, That whilst the Body is seated in a Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful state, the sweet Cream of the <hi>Chyle</hi> not being irritative, passes the <hi>Duodenum</hi> and the other small Guts, without being Perturbated, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, or Corrupted with the foresaid Excrementitious Choler, or Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Lymph, which ever as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are disburdened at last, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from the Alimentary Juices.</p>
            <p>The fifth Discovers an Error of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some of the Learned in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, who strive to maintain, that it is the Red Dregs of the Blood, is Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated through the <hi>Ductus Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> which they name <hi>Gloces Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> not being unlike the Dregs of Red-Wine, which partly they say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of thick Melancholy, that hath perform'd its Task, and partly of the Red of the Blood, that was too long Retain'd, and somewhat Adust. Of this Opinion the Learned Professor <hi>Vander Linden,</hi> of Famous Memory, was the Author, and also did (among
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55228:43"/>
the rest of his Disciples) Instil it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me many Years past, but having only his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> for it, and upon Anatomical search into several Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not finding any Red Dreg or Lee, or any thing else, except the oft fore-mentioned thick Pancreatick Lymph, have justly deserted that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>
            <p>The sixth puts me in mind of the Praeparation, all solid Victuals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

That the Spittle is so praegnant of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Salt,</hi> is clearly Evinced from it's Dissolutive virtue, Softening and Discussing almost any Pustle in less time, than any Medicine whatsoever; and supposing the Spittle to be so Turgid of <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> much more the <hi>Dissolvent</hi> Lymph of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
            <p>The seventh Annotation is, That during three fourth parts of the time
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55228:44"/>
of Concoction, the <hi>Dissolvent Juice</hi> is no wise Acid, but on the contrary partakes of an Igneous Alcalized vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil Nature, abounding with Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative, Dissolutive and Pungitive, or Mordicant Effluviums and Steems, as may be observed by those, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally Belching at the mid-time of Concoction, or before, or somewhat after, are so vehemently Stung, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and Inflamed in their Throat, and along the <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> that it is not in the power of <hi>Brandy,</hi> or other <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Spirits,</hi> to imitate those Effects. But the <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> being together with the <hi>Chyle,</hi> passed out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack into the small Guts, the <hi>Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> Lymph is left <hi>Acid,</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the Digestion of the Gross and Faeculent remainder, which towards the latter part of Digestion, or some six or eight hours after Meals, in some quicker, in others slower, is upon an Eructation or Belching perceived in the Mouth, not only Sour, but <hi>Acid</hi> with an Adstriction, not unlike the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid</hi> Spirit of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">§. 21. To those that are knowing in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55228:44"/>
the Analytick part of the <hi>Spagyrick Art,</hi> it's very Obvious, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Liquors consist of a <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> and an <hi>Acid Tartar,</hi> as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be Demonstrated in Wine, whose <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> being extracted, and dissolved from the Union with the Fixt Particles, through the attraction of the igneous effluviums of the Ambient Air, the <hi>Acid Tartar</hi> doth immediately appear in the taste of the remaining Liquor, which then is called <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or Sour Wine. In the same manner most other Liquors and Decoctions being deserted of their <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> by Attraction of the Sun-beams or Ambient Air, do likewise immediately turn sour. Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle though sweet, when it's egested out of the Mouth, grows <hi>Acid,</hi> as soon as its <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> is Exhaled. Upon so perspicuous an Illustration, I cannot imagine you expect further proof, that the <hi>Dissolvent</hi> Lymph of the Stomach is not at all <hi>Acid,</hi> but contrary, as soon as it's effused into the Stomack, it's Subdulce or Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, and continues so until it's Body is Expanded, Pores opened, and it's

               <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> Extracted to the Circumference, and then it's grown Igneous Colliquative and Mordicant, and at last, the <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> being partly Evaporated, and partly Attracted into the <hi>Vasa Lactea</hi> (like Wine changing into Vinegar) turns ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>Acid,</hi> Inciding and Astrictive. Arguments in greater number, and of no less Evidence, I could here offer to your Consideration, but do praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to avoid the Suspicion of judging my Reader so Obstinate an Opiniater, as not to be perfectly Convinced of the truth of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, by what is already proposed. Neither would I have you conclude, that I have Steer'd beyond my Rhomb, in Expatiating into so Ample a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the first <hi>Concoction</hi> or <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi>; for the true <hi>Theory</hi> of the Office of the Stomack, and its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Operation, is a great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of the Art of <hi>Medicine,</hi> the Ignorance whereof (God mend it) among Physicians, is a great occasion of their too great Correspondence with the Sexton and Grave-maker.

               <p>
                  <hi>1.</hi> That the Material Cause of the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> is an Acid Lymph of the Stomack.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. IN Mercurial Salivations, wherein (as hath been hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) every Particular doth so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly resemble the Scorbute, I find the Material Cause is the Liquor of the Stomack, and the <hi>Lymph</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machick Lymphaeducts, which like a continuated Stream is forced up; but how this Issue of the Mouth is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ought to be further inquired into.</p>
            <p>Although many of these Water Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55228:46"/>
from the Brain, and other parts of the Head, do Communicate with those, that are terminative within the Mouth, yet it must be received for a Truth, that the great Source and Spring is about the Stomack, and the Pancreatick Lymphaticks, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter streaming so Impetuously upwards, are the chief Cause of the Constipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Belly, being otherwise greatly promoted, in its natural Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian Evacuation by the wonted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the <hi>Pancreatick Juice,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing and Lubricating the passage of the Guts. The Anxiety attending a Salivation, is a Symptom oft very Urgent, and depends on a streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned passage of the Blood, through the Ventricles of the Heart; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of the greatest part of its <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> imbiled by the Lymph or <hi>Serum,</hi> which is now too much drained from the Blood, the Pulsifick Faculty for want of the <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> must necessarily Languish, and the Blood being too dry, and Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, must needs pass the Heart with great difficulty. Neither is this the sole Cause, but being accompanied
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55228:47"/>
with a stoppage of the Salivation, as oft happens, the Salivable Matter doth Regurgitate to the Lymphaticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> where it doth Duplicate the Anguor, which in some I have observed so extream, that they owed their narrow Escape to very Opportune Remedies, and most, if not all, that have the ill Fate, to be Banisht the World in a Salivation (which the <hi>Surgeons</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> of this Town are so Unsuccessful in) have been stifled by these Angours.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The Blood floating through its Chanals, naturally is Indued with a sweetness, but in a Salivation, and the Scorbute, turns <hi>Acid</hi>; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, is the great Secret of this Theory. Praemissorily it's requisite, to propose the Nature and Kinds of <hi>Acids,</hi> which are various. The <hi>Acids</hi> of <hi>Vineger, Vitriol, Nitre, Common Salt, Tartar, Antimony, Allom, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> &amp;c. all obtain a Specifick dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as is rendred Obvious by their Properties and Efficiency. The <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Vineger</hi> is particularly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Potent, in Attracting the <hi>Sulphur</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55228:47"/>
of Minerals. The <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is Diametrically opposite to the <hi>Alcali of Tartar. Nitre</hi> by force of it's <hi>Acid,</hi> doth Amortise the Volatil Salt of any Mineral; Abstract it oft from <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the result will be a Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified <hi>Arcanum Corallinum,</hi> a Medicine singularly reputed for a mild Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Dejectory; upon further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Cohobations, the foresaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi> deserts its Cathartique Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is limited to a <hi>Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</hi> The like Effects it produces on the furious Body of <hi>Butyrum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonii.</hi> The <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Salt Marine</hi> is the sole Dissolvent of Gold, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when united with the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and then constitute the true <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> which is in nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from <hi>Vitriol, Nitre,</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> except that the former far exceeds the latter in Purity and Force: For though the common <hi>Aq. Regia</hi> be made out of <hi>Aq. Fort.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobated upon <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> it's most certain, that the said <hi>Aq. Fort.</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> that of <hi>Vitriol</hi> being too ponderous to ascend
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55228:48"/>
through the same degree of Heat; and the <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> from which this is propel'd, contributes nothing, but its <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> which constitutes the Body of the said <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi>; for the Volatil Salts of Urine and Soot, which defer to it a Specifique difference from other Salts, being <hi>Alcalies,</hi> are Amortised, and Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht by the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in their Extinction, must necessarily by Reaction obtuse, and hebetate the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Nitre,</hi> whence it appears this sort of <hi>Aq. Reg.</hi> must yield to the other, in point of Efficacy and Virtue. In the Thirsts of <hi>Hydropicks,</hi> the said <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> through it's penetrative Faculty doth excel all others, in Allaying and Conquering the Exiccative Quality of those fiery Salts, that are daily Meteorised to the upper Orifice, or supream Region of the Stomack, and there occasion those insatiable Droughts. There is a Subject of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in the <hi>Acid Spirit of Tartar,</hi> considering there is nothing so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or Abstruse in the Body of Man, but it will find out and Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55228:48"/>
into; but what is more than this, contrary to the Nature of most <hi>Acids</hi> (whose Operation is universally by Urine) it's a great <hi>Diaphoretique,</hi> and provokes Sweat potently. <hi>Antimony,</hi> if like <hi>Vitriol</hi> it may be called the third part of an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, it's <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit merits the chief place in it; for beyond all Peradventure, he that's unacquainted with this great <hi>Acid,</hi> is by some thought Ignorant, how to Cure a Malignant Feaver <hi>è Fundamento.</hi> The <hi>Acid Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> though usually termed the same with Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> hath that difference, that it contains a sixt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whence it derives a power, to six the most Fugitive of Minerals, which is denied to Spirit of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Put to Illustrate this more plain, that some <hi>Acids</hi> are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and in a manner almost as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to each other, as an <hi>Alcaly</hi> is to them; only make trial upon the <hi>Magistery</hi> of <hi>Coral</hi> or <hi>Pearl,</hi> which is commonly praepared, by their Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in Spirit of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon happens an Ebullition) Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55228:49"/>
of the said Spirit, and Edulcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; upon this <hi>Magistery</hi> affuse some different <hi>Acid,</hi> as Spirit of <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> or any other, there will arrive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ebullition, as smart, if not smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the former, but of a shorter continuance, which Evinces, there is a great Contrariety; as appears further in this particular, that one <hi>Acid</hi> will praecipitate, what's contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dissolution in the other. There is no less Contrariety between <hi>Alcalies,</hi> for <hi>Sulphur</hi> dissolved by a continuated Ebullition in the Capitel or Lixive of <hi>Calx viv.</hi> is praecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Urine. Any of the <hi>Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> Oyls, be it of Cinamon, Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Incrassated, and Coagulated into a thick Balsam, by affusing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> to it, which is an infallible Character of Contrariety between them, and (by the way) is lookt upon as a great Secret, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Balsam may be made without the Mixture of Wax, or Oyl of <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs.</hi> Besides these, it is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, <hi>Acids</hi> are either Natural, or Corrupt. The former bears the part of a Constitutive Principle in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55228:49"/>
Bodies, though being praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by an <hi>Alcaly,</hi> or ballanced to a temperament <hi>ad Justitiam,</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be discovered by sense; but by a Chymical dissolution into their Elements, the <hi>Acid</hi> is ever discovered to Universal view to be one. All Salts, (not being Alcalious) though the <hi>Acid</hi> lies dormant and hidden in them, by the force of Fire through a Retort, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prome their <hi>Acid</hi>; all sorts of Wood do exert the like <hi>Acid,</hi> being forced in the same manner through a Retort; which <hi>Acid</hi> before this <hi>Analysis,</hi> could not be deprehended in them by Taste or Scent. A strict Proof will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, I imagine, that there are some <hi>Acids,</hi> that are corrupt; Apples and Pears when they begin to Rot, smell and taste sour, and so do Flesh-meats, and most Artificial compound Liquids corrupting, as Beer, Syrups, Meathe, Broaths, and most sorts of Decoctions, also natural Compound Liquids, as Milk, Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None of these <hi>Acids,</hi> but by any Naturalist will be termed Corrupt. But what is more, Bodies that are primarily <hi>Acid,</hi> are subject to be Converted into a corrupt <hi>Acid,</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55228:50"/>
as appears in the Juice of Limons, Oranges, Pomgranates, and others, which being exposed to the Rays of the Sun, do decline into a corrupt <hi>Acid,</hi> far remote from their Natural.</p>
            <p>The variety of <hi>Acids</hi> beyond this last inserted distinction, is great: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids</hi> are either Pontique and Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, as some deep red Wines, <hi>Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,</hi> and many Vitriolate Praeparations; Acerbons, as immature Pears, Apples, Plumbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Austere, as some sort of Wines, that taste sour and harsh. There is also an <hi>Acre-Acidum</hi>; a sharp <hi>Acid,</hi> without any Stypticity or Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the <hi>Acid</hi> of Spirit of <hi>Salt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi> In Mucilages is also a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Acid</hi> to be observed, which may be termed <hi>Acidum Mucilaginosum.</hi> Some use may be made of describing <hi>Acids</hi>

            <p>I must here divert my Reader from opinioning me to have deserted my line, in bringing on the board the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and distinctions of <hi>Acids</hi>; which I affirm is no wise forreign to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it is from the praemisse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Symptoms from an <hi>Acid,</hi> will in the process of this Discourse more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Demonstrate; only in conclusion of this Paragraph, I do say, That if it be granted, that Milk doth oft turn sour and curdle in the Breast, it's as probable the Blood in the Vessels doth turn sour and Coagulous, they being in constitutive principles, but little different from one another. I cannot very well avoid animadverting on an Objection, that <hi>Prima fronte</hi> seems to carry some force, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Blood be supposed <hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> then all <hi>Acid</hi> Medicines must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Blood more <hi>Acid,</hi> and the Disease worse, as is implied by that trite Theorem in Physick, <hi>Similia si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milibus conservantur, &amp; contraria contrariis curantur</hi>; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Alcalies</hi> should be furnished with a virtue, to subdue the said <hi>Acid,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their contrary.

            </p>
            <p>The field of <hi>Acids</hi> is large; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which of them this Scorbutick <hi>Acid</hi> doth most imitate, will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to propose next. Upon pervolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Authors, that have treated on this Distemper, I find them so closely adhaering to <hi>Similies</hi> abstracted from Wine and Vineger, that I judge it a matter more facil, to draw a Drunkard out of a Tavern, than them from their course notions upon <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Vinegar.</hi> He that resembled Scorbutick Blood to Wine, that's turn'd <hi>Ropy,</hi> hugs himself in that subtle Invention, and in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple recompence of being applauded by the young <hi>sucking Physicians.</hi> This word <hi>Ropy</hi> is oft intended for stringy, or strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55228:52"/>
there being long streaks separated from the whole fluid Body, and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the thin liquor, as appears in Milk that's turned sour and grown <hi>Roapy</hi>: But such I could never yet observe in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Blood, though I have examined a great number of Porringers. Blood that's tenacious, obductible and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous (which thence may be termed <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous</hi>) I do very fraequently meet with among Scorbuticks, but that's no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then what flows in the Veins of most Cachecticks. The Cause assign'd (by my Author) of the Roapiness of the one and the other, is an over-fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; wherefore, he saith, the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> is oft subsequent to a continual Fever: And why not then to all Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, there being as much an over-fretting in the one as in the other? Whence this is the consequence, that all <hi>Scorveys</hi> are produced by Fevers, or Over-frettings; And what over-fretting of the Blood are Seamen and others subject to, that derive the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of their <hi>Scorvey</hi> from the Salin Air of the Sea? I could never yet understand any. He proceeds, and would perswade you to believe, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55228:53"/>
through this over-fretting, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and Salts are separated from the Mass of the Blood, and being abandon'd to the Urine, render it Red like unto Blood; as if the Urin of all Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were of that tincture. If this praetended Roapiness may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Blood, it must be that, which is contained in the Vessels of the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> whence gross Humors are purged away in great Streaks and Ropes: But that it should be Streaky within the Vessels, because it appears so, when by Carthartick Physick its purged thence, <hi>Non valet ratio.</hi> For a farther Explanation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ropiness, I refer to Chapter 11.</p>
            <p>Others affirm, the Blood in the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> to turn Acid like Vinegar. By the way, you must not apprehend the Blood to decline to the same Degree of Acidity Vinegar is of; for that must necessarily Infer a Total extinction of the Dogmatick Innate and Influent heat; but that it only recedes from its Dulcor and Sweetness, to a Crude Austerity and some small Acidity. It will not be out of purpose, to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how an Acidity is introduced
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55228:53"/>
into Wine, and consequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Vinegar; whence probably may be Extracted the Cause of Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Scorbutic Blood. Peripatetique Philosophy asserts Wine to change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vinegar by Putrefaction and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Putrefaction (being by some accounted only a tendency to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) is Defined by the Stagirite a Corruption of the proper Natural heat in each moist Body, occasioned by a forreign Heat that's without. This applied to the Generation of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, infers that Sourness to proceed from an Extinction of the Natural heat or Spirit of Wine, by an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Heat. I cannot but admire here, that a Liquid Body should issue from a praeceding Liquor by Putrefaction, and that without any <hi>Foetor</hi> or stinck, which is asserted to be an inseparable Accident; and what is more, that a Body should be engendred by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, which of all others is the greatest praeserver from Putrefaction; for such Vinegar is esteemed to be.

Volatil Salt,</hi> and <hi>Lymph,</hi> or in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi> phrase, <hi>Mercurius.</hi> The Fixt Salt is the Acid <hi>Tartar</hi>; the <hi>Volatil</hi> (Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the <hi>Sulphur</hi>) being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a small proportion of Lymph is the Spirit, which as long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues United with the Fixt Salt, doth obtuse the Acidity, and renders the whole Mixture sweet, as the Wine appears to the Palate, but being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it (as hath been hinted before) the Acid Tartar dissolved in the greater proportion of the Lymph, in effect is the Vinegar; so the way to make Vinegar, is to Abstract the Spirits or <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> from the Wine, by suffering it to Exhale, or by Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to the Sun, or Heat of a Fire, which Attract the foresaid <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> or by adding a small Measure of sharp Vinegar to a greater of Wine, which with an united force of the <hi>Fixt Salt,</hi> do soon Extinguish and Expel the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil,</hi> and then the praevailing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is Converted into Vinegar. The Method chiefly in use among the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-makers in <hi>France</hi> is this; They take two Barrels of a long shape, which there they call <hi>Flutes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55228:54"/>
well cleansed, they put into each of them Four, Six, or Eight Quarts (according to the bigness of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel) of the strongest and sharpest Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, being made Boyling hot, and thereupon stop the Bung-hole very close, then they Roul and Move them to and fro for Six Hours together, until the Vinegar is grown cold, after this they run it out again, until there is not a Drop left, and then lodge the Barrels in a warm place, and fix them so, that they may lie fast and not stir; upon this they make two Holes (which they call the Eyes) in each of them with a Piercer, about a foot from the bottom, and pour into those Holes through a Funnel, some Eight or Ten Quarts of the best Vinegar, and a Week after they pour Two Quarts of Decayed Wine to it through the same Holes, to make Vinegar of, a Week after that they put as much more to it, and so every Week they add as much more to it, until the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels are a little more than half full, and then they encrease them every Four dayes, until they are quite fill'd, which they draw off to two Thirds,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55228:55"/>
for to Sell; and afterwards fill up their Flutes again gradually.</p>
            <p>From whence I infer all Wines to be actually Vinegar, and Spirits, that is to be Physical Compounds, containing actually the Principles of Acidity in them, and <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> of an Alcalious Nature; and on the other hand I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That in <hi>Vinegar</hi> the Acidity is Introduced or wrought into it <hi>per se,</hi> by the Efficiency of the Sun or other Extraneous heat, but only <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> by separating the <hi>Volatil</hi> from the <hi>Fixt Salt,</hi> or Reducing it into it's Principles.</p>
            <p>In the Generation of Vinegar there are several alterations observable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ascents and Degrees, tending to that extream Acidity Vinegar is of: In the first place, Wine changes to a Muddy and Turbid Countenance, loosing that Diaphaneity and aequality of Substance and Colour it had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Constitutive Particles have changed their Position and Situation; for in Wine that's declining towards the Eger, the <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had aequally expanded the Fixt Acid Salt, Exhaling or Receding,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55228:55"/>
the said Fixt Salt doth somewhat Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate, and Unites nearer in its Particles, whereby this Obscurity and Turbation is Introduced. In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the Wine hath something chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged its Taste, and Drinks flatter, but no kind of Sourness doth then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for though the Acid Salt seems to get ground upon the <hi>Volatil,</hi> it's not yet arrived to any mark of Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, because the aforesaid Acid is Commixt with a slimy dull Tartar, which Obtuses its Sourness, and is the principle Cause of the Obscurity and Turbidness in the Wine. It is not long after, that a little Sourness may be discovered by the Taste, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidness observed to diminish; for as the Wine gains in Sourness, so it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in Obscurity, the Acid freeing it self from the slimy Tartar, praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates it to the bottom, or by Inciding and Attenuating it, dissolves it into Lymph, whereby it's Clarified and grows Pellucid, and consequently as it grows Soure so it grows Clearer, until it becomes perfect Vinegar, and then it's likewise grown perfectly Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:55228:56"/>Now you may easily imagine, it is not my Scope, only to offer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Theory of Vinegar, or to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, how to Arrive to be a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar-maker,</hi> but by a way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative (for Notions in Physick frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently spring from that Method) to the Blood, to Illustrate its manner of recess from it's Natural towards a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hutick Acidity.

If ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a praevalence, renders the state of health neutral, but if by conquest it hath got an absolute power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the temperature and mixture of the Mass of Blood dissolved, which onely happeneth in those, that die of old age. But supposing, that upon the affection of the <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Acid</hi> lieth exposed to injuries (read <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.) which during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Vinculum</hi> of both, it was defended from; then the foresaid <hi>Acid</hi> degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates

from its natural into a vitiated, putrid, or corrupt <hi>Acid,</hi> which <hi>ipso facto</hi> doth constitute a disease. This praemised, I assert, that a recent, or confirmed <hi>Scorvey</hi> is the adaequate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a putrid <hi>Acid</hi>; The others, namely austere, or pontique, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses onely of melancholy, hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac and mesaraie distempers. Proof hereof may very well be made by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, desumed from the effects, that issue from the causality of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid <hi>Acid.</hi> First we will examine the blood of <hi>Scorbuticks,</hi> which upon view I have fraequently remarqued, to be of a dull countenance, and in no wise nitorous, of colour livid, or sometimes cineritious, or in others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the whites of Eggs, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed with opaque streaks; in point of consistency thick, cohaerent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated and tenacious, being also overflown with a turbid serosity, of gust palpably acid, and here and there a nitrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55228:57"/>
is strong, being demonstrable to one of the surest Senses, <hi>viz.</hi> the Taste, and that desumed from the <hi>Serum</hi>; which by reason of the Salts and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it extracts from the humors, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a most praegnant discovery of the constitution and complexion of the Blood. But we shall insist no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on that sense, but convert our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to experiment; instil a few drops of Spirits consisting of a <hi>Volatil Salt (viz. Spirit of Sal Armoniac, Cornu Cervi,</hi> Soot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) into a small proportion of Blood; their effect will render it fluid, nitorous, serene, of a most pleasing red, and rescue it from a dissolution of the Humors: But on the other hand, <hi>Acid</hi> drops, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Nitre, Salt, &amp;c.</hi> occasion immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a Coagulation of the said Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and a separation of their <hi>serum,</hi> leaving those in a turbid commixture, dull, opaque, cineritious, and of an ill whitish fleam colour. Whence we may rationally praesume, Scorbutick Blood so exactly resembling what is impressed on any other Blood by these <hi>Acids Spirits,</hi> to derive its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated constitution from an <hi>Acid,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:55228:58"/>
which must necessarily be a putrid one, as shall be explained hereafter. In the next place, let's make Inspection into the Characters of Scorbutick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, which for consistency is uncertain, most times muddy, turbid and thick, sometimes thin and opaque; for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour pale and whitish, though in some few of a raw bloody colour, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where raw flesh hath been washt in; for contents various, sometimes a copious sediment of an Ash colour, with a scum swimming on the surface like Tallow, other times a small sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

into <hi>Vrine,</hi> produces the same evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it did upon the <hi>Blood.</hi> That this <hi>Scorbutick Acid</hi> is putrid, appears by its production and inseparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerence of a stink, for which a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimony may be taken from the breath of <hi>Scorbutics,</hi> the steams that evaporate from their Bodies, the ill scent of the <hi>Serum</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Vrine,</hi> which all stink abundantly.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. A Salivation excited by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curials,</hi> and accompanied with its usual attendants, is beyond all peradventure a <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi>; and for that reason <hi>Hartman</hi> and other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55228:59"/>
Chymical Authors, affirm <hi>Mercurial Medicines</hi> pernicious, and altogether improper in <hi>Scorbutique Distempers</hi>; and consecutively to this Assertion, I have fraequently observed, that such as have been obliged to make use of <hi>Mercurial Remedies</hi> against their <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Maladies,</hi> do ordinarily fall into the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> which sometimes proves more stubborn than the Distemper, which the said Mercurials were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against; So that we must set down <hi>Mercury,</hi> to be one among the number of occasional Causes of the <hi>Scorvey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Gross faeculent and obstructive Diet, especially if overcharged with Salt, or rendred hard and compact with Smoke, as dried Neats Tongues, Bacon, Sausiges, Red Herrings, Dried Salmon, Hung Beef, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute matter, but obtain also a peculiar faculty of impressing a <hi>Scorbutic Idea</hi> on it. Of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are Melancholic Meats, as Beef, Pork, Geese, Ducks, Salt Fish, and all other Fish, that are bred in standing Waters, as Eels and others; also Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55228:60"/>
and Marinaded Fish, as Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Herrings, Anchovies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next of the <hi>Non-naturals,</hi> that bears a great part in this morbisique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, is a Salin Air, rendred thick and constipative by Vapors and Damps, Nitrous Evaporations out of the Earth, filled with putrid steams of Sinks, Gutters, Ditches, Muddy and Dirty Streets, and Sulphurous Smokes of Chimneys, stagnating and pent up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween narrow lanes and corners, and seldom serenated or purified by the rayes of a clear shining Sun, nor frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ventilated with Easterly brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; and such is the Clime of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where the Air is experienced close, dull, damp, salin and muddy, over-spread with dense, dark, salin Clouds (attracted out of the Sea) for two third parts, if not three fourths of the year; during which time the wind seldom blows Easterly, or is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored with a smiling Sun.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. These two are accounted the principal external Causes; the former aggressing the Body within, the latter without; but to which of these the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55228:60"/>
sole causality may be imputed, hath been controverted between some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, the one party, whose opinion induceth them to believe the Scorbut to make its first assault on the Blood and Animal Liquor, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the external pores, state the Air the chief and original efficient: The other, apprehending the Stomach and its Ferment, to receive the first efforts, proclaim Diet the principal Agent. In favor of the former sentiment, these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments seem persuasive, 1. The <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> being assented by most an Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Disease, which generally derives its production from the Constitution of the Clime, infers a verdict for the Air: and, 2. This is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by being also aesteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of Contagious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, which are universally commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by Transportation of morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique Miasms, whereof necessarily the Air must be the chief Vehicle, and consequently a more principal cause than the other. 3. Symptoms bearing Characters more obvious to sense, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an evidence very plain; wherefore if the Animal Faculty be the first suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55228:61"/>
as appears by the Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Lassitude, Drowsiness, Noise in the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the said Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of Lassitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Patient, while his Stomach and its Ferment continue in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and exempted from any praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural affection, then it's undeniable, but the Air is the primar Agent. Those who espouse the contrary arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement, assert the faculty of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to be impaired, and next after the Blood to be vitiated, before the appearance of any Lassitude, or other Animal Symptom; moreover, that the word <hi>Endemic,</hi> importing only a common Disease among people (from <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55228:61"/>§. 4. The next circumstance that's worthy of inquiry, is the manner, how a Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iate Diet, or impure Air, doth cause an Acidity in the Humors. We will suppose, That a <hi>Salt Diet</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Salt Meat, and Brackish Drink.</note> is the most common Efficient of the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> which being ingested into the Stomach, doth chiefly act on the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Nervorum,</hi> consisting in a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> (whose office principally is, by contraction of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bres to corrugate the Stomach) and Spirits of the Arteries. It is then this extraneous Marin Salt, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and absorbes the foresaid <hi>Volatil Salts,</hi> with the liquor they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in, in great measures; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon occasioning a great Drought, forceth the Stomach to covet vast quantities of Small Drink; whereby the Stomach is immoderately cooled and relaxt; the foresaid <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> rendred fixt, and <hi>Spirits</hi> drowned and extinguisht; moreover the said <hi>Extraneous Salt</hi> having absorbed and attracted the <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> into its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, they meet with the <hi>Acid,</hi> that's latent in its Bowels (as appears upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55228:62"/>
driving <hi>Salt Marin</hi> through a Retort) which through its contrariety to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies,</hi> amortises the fore-mentioned <hi>Volatils.</hi> The consequence upon this is, that the digestion is not perfected, and the contents not justly dissolved and coaequated, but remain crude and imperfect, whence must happen Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Obstructions, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prove a <hi>Basis</hi> for all other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases to be establisht on.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. It is not to <hi>Salt,</hi> or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom Meats, we must solely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe this Scorbutick Effect, but lay part of the charge on Drinks, that are used among us; in particular the Beer and Ale that's brewed about the City; the Water whereout they are brewed being absolutely brackish, or imbued with a proportion of <hi>Salt,</hi> though not so great as to be discovered by the Pallat. That Water containing a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Salt, is thereby capacitated to make the stronger Drink, is most certain, and for that reason, because the Water being somewhat brackish in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore making the strongest Liquor, it's thence <hi>English
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55228:62"/>
Beer</hi> is reputed the best and strongest in other Countries. Consequently to this Remarque, I find, that Beer or Ale brewed out of <hi>Thames Water,</hi> is more vigorous and spirituous, than what is made of other Water, because the former by having a commerce with the Sea, is more Salin; and thence it is also that <hi>North-down</hi> and <hi>Hull-Ale</hi> exceed <hi>Thames-Ale</hi> in strength, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to the Sea. This may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be confirmed by the practice of some Brewers, who to render their Drink the stronger, do commonly fling some small quantities of Salt into their Brewing; wherein exceeding sometimes a due proportion, doth impress so great a seasoning on their Beer or Ale, that it's manifestly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived brackish by those that drink it. The reason of this sort of process is grounded on the insinuating and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Vertues of <hi>Salt,</hi> attracting the intire life and soul out of the Malt. Neither are Chymists ignorant of these attractive faculties, who when they are to extract a Spirit or Oyl out of Aromatics or Cephalic Herbs, generally dissolve a handful
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55228:63"/>
or two of Salt into the Water, while it's in digestion. <hi>Apothecaeries</hi> do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so experience, that Roses lying a few dayes in Salt, yield a water much more odoriferous, than if Distill'd off sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. These Instances are produced to make proof, that the water of <hi>London</hi> is Salin, and consequently highly Scorbutick. But probably an Objection may be started, that though <hi>Thames</hi> Water from its communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Sea, may be suspected Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Why should other Waters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Drink is also Brewed, be aesteemed so? To this I answer, That the Air of the City being perfused with salt Clouds, attracted out of the Sea, (which is no great distance thence) doth sufficiently imbue it with that Tincture: Moreover, the Earth over which those Waters stream, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to it a Saltness, being brackish, as may appear to any ones Gust, that will adventure to taste it; now that Clay Ground, and other sorts of earth, do exude or sweat out a <hi>Salsugo,</hi> or Saltness, is abundantly manifested in Salt Pits; and undoubtedly the Pit-water which <hi>Caesars</hi> Army made

use of for two Years together, when they were quartered near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> sourced from a salt Pit, though not so much Impraegnated, as to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht by the Palat, or at least the foresaid Water was imbued with some Mercurial Vapours (but the former is more probable) which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gave them a Disease like the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi>; they being subject to a Vacillation and elaps of their teeth, with pains of their Gums. One sort of Water we have not yet taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, which is of standing Pools, as that is reported, whereout that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is Brewed, which goeth by the name of <hi>Shoreditch Ale,</hi> for strength being Superlative to all other. No doubt but Water by stagnating, doth contract a Putrefaction and Saltness, which being thorowly allayed with the Cream of a fat brackish Clay, is naturally praepared to Brew thick fat Ale; whence that Water is vulgarly termed strong bodied, whereas Spring water is accounted thin weak Water, and not capable to Extract the intire strength of the Malt, as the other is; which is true enough spoken. This
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55228:64"/>
Discourse doth also infer sour Beer, or Ale, to be very pernicious, likewise decayed Wines.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Among the next relating to both the praeceding Branches, we must impeach <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> for two grand Scorbutick Abetters. The former by imposing too great a burden on the Stomack, doth so much obtuse the <hi>Volatil Salts,</hi> that the <hi>Acid</hi> thereby gaining a praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and thereupon soon growing putrid, occasioneth Crudities and Obstructions, and so an Inlet to the <hi>Scorvey.</hi> The latter refers to excess of Drinking strong Liquors, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>French Wines,</hi> through which the Stomack suffering fraequent inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, their Spirituous and Volatil particles are attracted Crude, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested into the Vessels, which in a short interval of time, Obnubilate and Drown the <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> of the Nerves and Arteries, as not being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently praepared to be Assimilated to them; and these Efforts being oft repeated, do at last Vitiate, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and Amortize the Spirits.

sort of <hi>Scorvey</hi>; here we intend to propose a <hi>Scorvey</hi> different from that, wherein the <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> being vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and augmented in too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, over-ballanceth the <hi>Natural Acid,</hi> and produceth a Constitution of Salts and Humors, likewise Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, that are absolutely Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, but of a fiercer and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant quality. By the way, I must praevent my Reader from any haesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein it may appear strange to him, that Symptoms that bear the same countenance, should be derived from two contrarily different Causes. As to this, it is an Observation evident enough in other Diseases; for instance the Colick is sometimes occasioned by Bilious Lixivious Humors, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the internal Tunic of the Guts, in which case they usually suffer a Contraction <hi>in longitudine</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it's caused by an Acid flatuous phlegmatic Humor, and here the Guts are affected <hi>in latitudine.</hi> On the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is imposed the name of an <hi>Hot Colic,</hi> and on the latter a <hi>Cold Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>; the same may be also observed in Pleurisies and many other Distempers.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55228:67"/>§. 2. The Constitution of the Blood in this kind of <hi>Scorvey</hi> is far different from what it is in the other; for here the Blood runneth into a thick cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fluor, like Syrup, doth not coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate or concrease; but continueth in the same form, without the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Serum,</hi> that in the other commonly floats on the top. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is likewise in colour and taste; here the Blood appears in a purple, and to the taste its Lixivial and Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious. Touching the Symptoms; the <hi>Acid Scorvey</hi> exercises its fury most on the parts above the Navil, the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calious Scorvey,</hi> chiefly on the parts below, what farther distinction is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, you shall read elsewhere.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Certainly it was a great Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucination in <hi>Sennertus,</hi> but far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in others, that have wrote since on that Subject, to praetend an <hi>Acid</hi> the cause of <hi>Pendulous Blood</hi> (a term the Recentiors have borrowed from the fore-named <hi>Sennertus,</hi> though ill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into English <hi>Roapy,</hi> as hath been animadverted before) which rather
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55228:67"/>
causeth a Coagulation, as appears by Experiment, upon instilling Acid drops into Blood or Milk; and yet this <hi>Acid</hi> is so abominably stretcht by a late Author, who obtaining a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knack of writing a Story smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth endeavor to adaptate it to Symptoms in general of all sorts of <hi>Scorvey</hi>; whence I find, neither he nor those that harbour his Notion do arrive to a success of curing some <hi>Leg-Scorveys,</hi> aequal to that of the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey,</hi> but are oft render'd infinitely worse.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. The cause of this thick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crassated cohaerent Blood, that if pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a Porringer, hangs in short ropes or long drops, like Balsom or liquid Soap, when poured off, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the fixation of the <hi>Volatil,</hi> which united to the Fixt Salt of the Blood, doth alcalize and calcine it, whence assuming the nature of other Calcined Salts (as <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Nitrum fixum</hi>) doth attract and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorb the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, and some moisture out of the Air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that and the whole mass is turned into a <hi>Deliquium,</hi> and so becometh
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55228:68"/>
thick (the <hi>Serum</hi> being absorbed) cohaerent and pendulous; because part of the Blood is naturally gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, which being tied closer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its particles by the absorption of the thinner and serous parts, must needs prove pendulous; of a taste lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, because such all Calcined Salts appear to the Palat; and of a purpre colour, because the Blood is adusted from a florid red into blackness.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. That the Blood of these Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butics, which are here mentioned, is qualified in the manner described, will appear to any, that shall give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the trouble of examining Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Blood, when occasionally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by Phlebotomy; but least such as desire to be satisfied in this point, have not a ready opportunity of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, we will endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of this truth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Take Blood that's found, and possibly extracted for praevention or abating a Plethory, instil into it Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> or of any other <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> it shall praeserve it in its fluor, colour, consistency, mixture
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55228:68"/>
and other qualities, until it be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, and then the said Blood by coagulating into a Mass, will separate from its <hi>Serum</hi>: But if instead of this, you affuse a small quantity of Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fixed Salt, that's runned into a <hi>Deliquium,</hi> it will incrassate the Blood, change it into a deep purpre, render it pendulous and lixivial to the taste. After all, proving the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Symptoms to issue thence as proper immediate effects, will crave an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable conclusion; but that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a further inroad into this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. I must not retire from this Subject, before I give the reason, why I have named this sort of <hi>Scorbutic Blood, Soapy,</hi> or <hi>Saponary</hi>; namely, because like <hi>Soap</hi> consisting of <hi>Tallow</hi> and <hi>Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivial Salt,</hi> the Blood in this kind of <hi>Scorvey,</hi> is also composed of a defla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated incrassated <hi>Sulphur</hi> and a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Salt,</hi> both commixt and united into one Body; but how and through what causes it is rendred so <hi>Soapy,</hi> shall be told you in the next Chapter.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. THe <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is the Original and Conservative of the <hi>Volatil,</hi> for (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one of the Hermetick Theorems formerly recited) a <hi>Subtil Sulphur</hi> penetrating into the pores of the <hi>Fixt Salt,</hi> closely knits it self with its particles, and being of a subliming nature, that is derived from the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55228:69"/>
igneous minims it contains, doth le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate, sublime, and volatilize the said <hi>Salt.</hi> Experiment doth assert this a certain truth; affuse <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> on <hi>Calx Vive</hi> (which beyond all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is praegnant of <hi>Fixt Salt</hi>) after a short digestion, abstract it, and some part of the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> will be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilised and sublimed with the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the foresaid Spirit. Possibly here may be demanded, how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any of the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> is volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Hereunto I answer, 1. By the Taste, the foresaid Spirit proving more igneous, vibrating and pungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Tongue. 2. <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> by reason of its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is inflamable to the last drop; but being united to this <hi>Volatilized Salt,</hi> doth very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly receive a flame, or when infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will scarce continue. One Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment being too scanty, I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you another. <hi>Volatil Salt of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> is fixed by abstracting <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> from it; and being so fixt, affuse on it <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> digest them a while, and then abstract the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> from it, and you shall find the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> volatilized again. Hence I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55228:70"/>
infer, 1. That the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the original matter, but also the sole conservative and nourisher of the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil,</hi> by yielding new sublimable parts. 2. That the Constituent principles of a <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> are a <hi>Sulphur</hi> and a <hi>Fixt Salt.</hi> This being allowed or at least praesupposed, doth detect the manner, How a <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> is fixable, <hi>viz.</hi> by divelling the <hi>Sulphur</hi> from it, or strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it of its force and efficacy; so that those externals that act against the foresaid <hi>Sulphur,</hi> are to be aesteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Procatarctic Causes of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Blood Scorbutic, and of lixiviating its <hi>Fixt Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The same remote Causes, which in one of the praecedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were declared Efficients of a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Acid,</hi> are also impowered to lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate and alcalize the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> though not in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or univocally, but <hi>per accidens,</hi> and aequivocally; so the Sun is virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to produce contrary effects aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally, in engendring Cold and Hot Bodies, moist and dry. A Salin Diet and Salin Air, by vertue of their <hi>Salt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55228:70"/>
Marin,</hi> do absorb and concentrate the Sulphurous minims of the Blood, which being inflamed, and rendred corroding, partly through its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly by its union and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe of the Saline parts, and being withal thereby <hi>Fixt,</hi> are both praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated to the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> whereunto also uniting, do all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Soapy and Lixivial. Secondly, The <hi>Fuliginous Salts,</hi> that are too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously occasioned in Saline Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ebullitions, are a principal cause, but for a more ample satisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to Chap.. How greatly the familiar sipping of Brandy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adust Spirits, do contribute to the inflaming the Sulphurous particles of the Blood and lixiviating of it, is sufficiently obvious; likewise that fuming Tobacco, under the notion of concentrating and fixing the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Volatil particles, doth lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate and fix the Blood, needs no farther proof.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Least I should leave the least scruple, that might induce the Reader, to supect the contents of this Discourse,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55228:71"/>
I apprehend it expedient, to remove this Objection, which is offered by way of Quaery, How can a Salt Diet or Air, or rather Sea Salt, occasion two contrary effects, <hi>viz.</hi> of rendring the Blood Acid, and Lixivial or Alcalious. I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, that these effects are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in a various manner, to wit, an <hi>Acidity</hi> is caused, as was explain'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, by the separation of the <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt</hi> and <hi>Subtil Sulphur,</hi> which is an effect <hi>per accidens</hi>; an <hi>Alcali</hi> is impressed on the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> by an effect the <hi>Marin Salt</hi> produces <hi>per se</hi>; for through its igneous facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and especially when its tumid with the absorbing the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Blood, it alcalizes the <hi>Fixt Salt.</hi> 2. The fore-mentioned <hi>Marin Salt</hi> is not only naturally fiery, but vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented in its igneous quality, by its conjunction with <hi>Lixivious Salt,</hi> or <hi>Excrementitious Choler,</hi> that naturally ought to be separated and evacuated by the <hi>Gall Bladder</hi> and <hi>Cholidochus,</hi> whose passages in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi> are commonly for a time constipated, the Excrements of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55228:71"/>
the Guts through their paleness and <hi>livor</hi> signifying as much; but withal observe, that the <hi>Cystis Bilis</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Cholidochus</hi> continue obserated only for a certain space; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the foresaid passages are forced open, by the abundance of gross lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Choler, which then impresses a deep red Tincture on the Excrements of the Guts. Furthermore observe, That commonly the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> praecedes a <hi>Leg-Scorvey,</hi> and seldom do both invade the Body at the same time, but one upon the neck of the other; so that if the <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> continue any considerable space, the <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi> must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Observe likewise, That some continual and intermittent Fevors, especially Quartans, do sometimes exchange into <hi>Alcalious,</hi> but no <hi>Acid Scorveys,</hi> as by their internal Causes and Symptoms, which the deep red Tincture and vehement stink both in Urine and Ordure, likewise a very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Sweat and Spittle, do attest lixivial, is evidently declared; and that which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55228:72"/>
doth positively evict the cause of these kinds of Scorbuts to be <hi>Alcalious</hi> and <hi>Saponary,</hi> is their Cure, which is chiefly to be performed by <hi>Acids,</hi> as <hi>Spirit of Salt, Antimony, &amp;c.</hi> and by <hi>Subtil Sulphurs,</hi> and <hi>Volatil Salts</hi>; but in no manner by <hi>Fixt Alcalies,</hi> upon which an irreparable detriment hath oft en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. Lastly, To prove the undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth of these Observations, the vulgar management of Sea-men (who are out upon long Voyages) in their <hi>Scorveys,</hi> which so inevitably they are incident into, using nothing but <hi>Acids,</hi> as <hi>Spirit of Salt, Juices of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges</hi> and <hi>Limons,</hi> wherewith they are abundantly stored, tells us, it's an <hi>Alcalious Saponary Scorvey</hi> they are subject to, against which an <hi>Acid</hi> is the diametrically contrary Remedy.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55228:73"/>
and Salin and Sulphurous.</hi> The whole Theory of the <hi>Scorvey</hi> is by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor fore-mentioned briefly summed up in those few lines, which to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, is the chief affair of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. First, He tells us, <hi>It's probable</hi>; But why is it probable? Because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it seemed so in some inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable little Analogies and Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: I may as well affirm, that it is probable, his Horse is a Mare, because viewing him at a distance, he seems like one. Certainly, he that by too much stretching of the Cloth, endeavors to make all sorts of Habits and Shapes out of it, must necessarily make a very incongruous Suit. This our Author hath practised in most of his Tracts, abstracting Notions from Wine to illustrate his Theory of Diseases; as first in relation to Fevors; Because Wine is apt to be fretted, it's probable the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lood is also subject to a fret; whence a necessary conclusion is drawn, <hi>That the Blood so fretting is either a Fevor,</hi> or <hi>rather the cause</hi> of a Fevor; but <hi>A probabili ad necessar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

being a derivative from a Vegetable, that naturally is disposed to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said alteration; the other from a <hi>Vive Animal,</hi> that when declining into a Fevor, is praeternaturally affected. Moreover this fretting quality that Wines are incident into, is only of one kind; but the frets or fevors of the Blood are various and very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as Quotidians, Tertians, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, In relation to Convulsions, Because the Blood is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed to fret in all the Vessels of the Body, it's probable, that in the fretting of the Nervous System, it doth impel heterogeneous <hi>Copula</hi>'s and Explosive Particles into the <hi>Liquor Nervosus,</hi> and irritate the Nervous Systeme to an explosive motion, through which a <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A pretty kind of Rhetorick, exchanging the old significant terms, into those that are obscure and aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; however these <hi>Probables</hi> might very well be admitted, especially being gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with those pretty affected Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; provided the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance were omewhat more paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55228:74"/>
and conform to Experiment; from which that they are infinitely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I shall particularly instance in the comparison of <hi>Rancid</hi> and <hi>Roapy,</hi> or rather <hi>Scorbutic Wine</hi> (for such he would have it to be) with <hi>Scorbutic Acid</hi> and <hi>Scorbutic Lixivial,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponary Blood.</hi> That Wines by over-fretting become rancid, is agreed on by all Wine-Coopers, which in their usual phrase, they do not term <hi>rancid,</hi> but say, <hi>It tastes of the fret,</hi> that is, Fuliginous, Empyreumatic, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant, but not Acid; neither when they are over-fretted as much as they can be, do they immediately taste o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than what is set down. Their Cure is performed, as he sets forth, by being drawn off the Lees; which in a plainer way is to be understood thus; if it be observed, that Wines are inclined to fraequent frettings, or over-frettings, as all Wines are in the Summer season, especially if lying in a warm Cellar, to praevent the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they endeavor to cool the place, where they lie, by stopping up all the Lights, and oft dashing cold water over the Floor. The later, <hi>viz.</hi> Their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55228:75"/>
aptness to over-fret, is remedied by pouring a proportion of new Milk to the Wine, or Ison-glass dissolved, or other materials that are impowered to appease, allay and sweeten the heat and fury of the Sulphurous Spirits; but when Wines are absolutely over-fretted, then indeed to draw them off the Lee, is the next remedy. The cause of an over-fret or rancidness, he asserts to be an imbodying or cogula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sulphureous particles with the Salin, so as the former exceed the latter in proportion. This <hi>Aetiology</hi> may easily conduct the Reader into mistakes, supposing the Constitutive Principles of Wine, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> to be distinctly contained therein, whereas it must be conceived, they are so intimately cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together in their minimal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that there is not the least drop, but contains the foresaid principles in its least individual physical particle, so that you are not to imagine, that in Wine, that is thus declining, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> swims in one part, the <hi>Spirits</hi> in another, and the <hi>Salt</hi> in another, but that the Subtiler <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55228:75"/>
               <hi>Mercury,</hi> being united into one, do abscede from the grosser, into whose room and cavernicles external hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal principles succeeding out of the ambient air, occasion such various alterations, as render the Wine ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, roapy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corpus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les, if they are sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as in the Summer season they generally are, then they alterate the Wine into <hi>rancid</hi>; if more gross and salin, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at other seasons they are, it becomes <hi>roapy.</hi> But Wines being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to these alterations in all Climes, and Humane Bodies onely in some particular sorts of Air, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (together with a vitious diet) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diseases thereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; this alone is an Argument sufficient to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Alterations of the Blood and Wine not to be comparative, and consequently the <hi>Simile</hi> to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant. Secondly, Suppose the <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> allowed in Fevors, that as Wines fretting are indued with an intense heat, through the exaltation of their <hi>Sulphur,</hi> so the Blood fretting is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a dyscratic or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat, which for the praesent shall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55228:76"/>
also be allowed the name of a Fevor; then consequently the Blood must be deemed Scorbutic, because rancid; for Wines during their fretting are ever rancid, and taste of the fret; and so all compounded Liquors, as Beer, Ale, Metheglin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst they are working, are rancid.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The absurdities that follow the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> are, 1. That there is no moving living Creature, but is troubled with the <hi>Scorvey</hi> in one part or other; for whilst the Chyle is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in the Stomach, or the Blood fretting in the Vessels, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of Fermentators happens at all times, they become rancid. 2. In <hi>France</hi> I find Fevors more fraequent, than in any other Countrey, which in the sense of my Author are all attended with fretting, and very probably some with over-fretting; yet I could never observe any there afflicted with the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> and if they are, I am certain they have no proper name for it in French. 3. That all Heats, Spots, Blotches, and Pustles, that burst out into the Face

That the fore-mentioned Scorbutic Eruptions, are onely safely cured by Remedies, that demulce and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enifie the incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ferment (as its stiled <hi>fol.</hi> 340. <hi>l.</hi> 18. which is expressing an <hi>ignotum per ignotius</hi>) such are <hi>Starch, Gum Arabic, Gum Dragant, &amp;c.</hi> These I am assured, never yet removed Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Eruptions, I cannot tell what they might operate at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Market Towns about it, where <hi>Scorveys</hi> are not so numerous, as to abstract observations from them, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach the world a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Scorbutic <hi>Dyscrasies,</hi> and <hi>Copula</hi>'s. But this I dare declare for a truth, that real Scorbutic pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre, and yellow, some red Blotches, and Pustles, I have removed, and known others to do the like, onely with Antiscorbutic Volatils; which manner of Cure doth in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55228:77"/>
no wise square with the Notion of <hi>Rancid</hi> blood. However it must be assented, that many Eruptions, such as are recited in <hi>pag.</hi> 234. have been extermined by Contemperative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and Bleedings; but then they were not of the genuin Scorbutic is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. <hi>In summa, admisso absurdo uno conceduntur mille.</hi> Wines that have been disturbed by an Overfret, do seldom long continue only <hi>Rancid,</hi> but after a short interval, are incident into a <hi>Putrid Acid,</hi> far different from <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, may more exactly square with Scorbutic Blood; but it is not from Emplastic Lenients these Wines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the least Rectification, for through them they are rather rendred far worse. For the removing this sort of dyscrasy, <hi>Coopers</hi> experience the scenting the Cask with <hi>Brimstone,</hi> to be very effectual in manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; They dip a Linnen-rag into mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Brimstone,</hi> which being grown cold and coagulated on the Cloth, is kindled into a flame, and hung through the Bung-hole into the Cask,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55228:77"/>
until the flame be burnt out, and upon that the Bung-hole is stopt up close again; for the same purpose Lime, burnt Allom, and other Materials, that are praegnant of an <hi>Alcalious Salt,</hi> are commonly used. 5. Upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Authors <hi>Rancid Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> the Blood of Scorbutics of that degree, ought to appear smoaky, Soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Empyreumatic, not easily Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable; on the contrary, it's observed <hi>Acid,</hi> Coagulable, Ill coloured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will conclude this Branch with a Caution, That all Innovators ought rather to Demonstrate their Notions <hi>a Posteriori,</hi> that is, they ought to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and Illustrate the Cause, by the Effects and Symptoms, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Notions of Causes, and by their Virtuality, or by what they probably seem capable to act, to assign their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">§. 3. The other Branch falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our consideration, is the <hi>Roapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Wines, wherein the <hi>Coopers</hi> generally observe a Gradation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; for first they begin to Pall,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55228:78"/>
and grow Flat, next they fall into Clots and Lumps of Gelly, and then they say, the Wine drinks tender; at last, their Clots running into one, causeth the Wine to become <hi>Roapy.</hi> This the worthy Author affirms, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the association of a lesser proportion of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> or <hi>Tartar.</hi> It's an Universal Remarque, that <hi>Sulphur</hi> and an <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> without some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Intermedium,</hi> that is amicable to both, are insociable; for affuse a <hi>menstruum</hi> purely <hi>Acid</hi> (as Rain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acuated with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol, Salt Nitre, &amp;c.</hi>) to <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and digest it <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> no Tincture shall be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but upon the least digestion with a Lixive, or any Unctuous Liquor, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> yields its whole body, and entirely unites. 2.

That <hi>Roapy</hi> Wines are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by fixt <hi>Alcalies</hi>; which on the contrary, I know some that arrive to their Mark, by dissolving <hi>Roch-allom</hi> into them, that by all is agreed to be an <hi>Acid,</hi> and consequently doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this <hi>Roapy Hypothesis.</hi> 3. The blood of those Scorbuticks, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

expressed any Sign or Character of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing molested with an <hi>Acid</hi> Scorbut, undergo a smart Ebullition of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in the Vessels, depending upon an accension of the Spirits, and defla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the Bituminous Particles of the Blood, whereunto some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, Rheumatism, Lassitude, Pain in the Head or Bowels, or some other Symptoms, are attending, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it dubious, whether this sort of Fever be Essential or Symptomatick; however Antifebril Remedies, as Bleeding, Purging, Contemperatives, and Sudorificks are praescribed, the success whereof in the space of three or four dayes, commonly amounts to the abatement of the Fevor and other Symptoms, though not to a perfect Restitution of Health, the Patient for some short time possessing only the condition of a neutral State; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon manifest Scorbutic Symptoms begin to take up their quarters with him, as Lassitude, Sloath in Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:55228:81"/>§. 2. The content of the praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Paragraph I do affirm to be the Morbisique transaction in some, though in others I likewise observe, that the praeceding Ebullition, or Tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood is not so vigorous, as to cause them to think more, than that they are only a little out of order, and so the Juices of the Vessels detume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, leave them in a kind of neutral state; which manner of Ebullition and Intumescence oft returning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing and decreasing, doth at last result to the same Effect, as if it had been as smart, as what is above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. These are certain and true Observations, any Physician may make on Bodies, before the <hi>Scorvey</hi> declares. A third Observation I shall subjoyn, after the Explication of the two former. By these praevious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions the Blood is grown extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Turbid and Disturbed in its parts, mixture, consistency, ntour, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and other qualities, like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a River, that grown Muddy and Thick upon a Storm, raising those Impurities, that lied on the bottom.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55228:81"/>
Now the faeculencies and <hi>Acid</hi> tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humours, that by stagnating in the Vessels of the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> and other remote parts, being raised, and commixt with the Mass of Blood, choak up and extinguish the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Volatil Salts,</hi> damping withall the flaming of the Bituminous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, upon which the Ebullition ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The cause of these Ebullitions is the saltnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, induced into the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by a <hi>Salin Air</hi> and <hi>Diet,</hi> which obtaining a power of condensing, and congregating the <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Volatil Salts,</hi> and sulphurous or bituminous particles of the Blood, cause an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of the foresaid <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> whereunto by constipating of the Pores the gross <hi>Salin Air</hi> doth also very much contribute. In this conflagration the <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> are in a great part dissipated and consumed, the other part stifled, choakt, or extinguisht by the rising of the <hi>Acid</hi> salin dregs, whereby the whole Mass is not only turned <hi>Acid</hi> (how the dissipation of the <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> occasion an <hi>Acidity,</hi> you have read before) but grows putrid
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55228:82"/>
               <hi>Acid</hi> by the commixture of fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous acrimonious Salts, that through the foresaid Ebullition and conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are occasioned, and through the constipation of the Pores repelled into the Blood. The cause of the latter Observation may easily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, from what is here set down touching the former.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. A third remarque taken from Scorbutics is, that many gradually and insensibly without any such prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Ebullitions, as are above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, undergo an alteration in their Temperament and Faculties; first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a sloath in their Limbs, nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous spitting in the Morning, an ill brass taste in their Mouth, crudities and imbecillity of Digestion; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards do succeed Spots, Laxity, and Discoloration of Gums, stink of Breath, and so the rest in order. The Cause of this sort of Morbifique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress is the blood, gradually declining to a putrid <hi>Acid,</hi> in the same manner as hath been explained in one of the fore-going Chapters.</p>
            <p>Though the first of these three Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55228:82"/>
seem to have some resemblance to the nature of <hi>Rancid</hi> Blood, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by Fretting or Fermentation, and the manner of Cure appointed in the oft cited Treatise <hi>de Scorbuto,</hi> to be performed by Demulcers of the Blood, as Phlebotomy, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratives; upon a more deliberate consideration, you will conclude their difference almost contrary to each other; for, 1. All Ebullitions, especially that expressed in the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the foresaid first Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not Fermentations. 2. The worthy <hi>Oxonian</hi> Author infers all <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid</hi> Blood Scorbutic, though it be still on the Fret, which is greatly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, the <hi>Scorvey</hi> being a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic or long taedious Disease; this a praevious distemper, that is soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or at least altered into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Intemperament, <hi>viz.</hi> From an Acrimonious hot, to an <hi>Acid</hi> cold Disease. 3. The foresaid Notion is highly dangerous, and oft proves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, in deriving thence a Method of Cure; for forming Indications, that this being a hot sulphurous Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, lenient and cooling Remedies are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55228:83"/>
indicated, which if long continued after the Fermentation is quieted, and an <hi>Acid</hi> disposition introduced, do render the Disease incurable.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. It is only in some, that this Ebullition is a praecursor to the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> whereas the Notion of <hi>Rancid</hi> Blood doth infer all <hi>Scorveys,</hi> that are not depending on pendulous blood, effects of an immoderate Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>

But this is not all; for the Blood in this Case is not only <hi>Alcalious,</hi> but <hi>Sapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> as now will be made apparent to you. There being a large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of impure <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or gross Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous Particles, mixt with the Humours in this degree of <hi>Scorvey,</hi> the <hi>Alcalious</hi> fiery Salts do easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,

Colliquate, and Unite them to their own Particles, which absorbing the <hi>Serum</hi> in a great measure, must needs render the Blood thick, cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and a little obductible.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. That the Bituminous parts of the Blood are so apt to be united to the <hi>Fixt Salt,</hi> is evident from the ready commixture of Tallow, Train Oyl, or other unctuous bodies with Pot-ashes in the Composition of Soap, from the resemblance whereunto (as formerly hath been intimated) I have termed the fore-mentioned constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blood <hi>Soapy,</hi> or <hi>Saponary.</hi> The same Promptness of Unition seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Chymical Praeparations do likewise confirm, as in particular; the Ebullition of <hi>Sulphur</hi> with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of <hi>Salt of Tartar, Fixt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> or a Lixive of <hi>Calx vive,</hi> in the process of <hi>Lac Sulphuris</hi>; also in the Praeparation of <hi>Hartman's Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> where the <hi>Antimony</hi> being fused by the violence of a ventous Fornace, and instilled into the deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> its Sulphurous parts are immediately Imbodied with the

            <p n="1">§. 1. IN course I ought next to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt these praeceding Causes to their Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> Scorbutic Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, in which I judge I shall not find that difficulty, or be Obliged to strain the former, to square them with the latter, since I arrived to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them by the Observation of their Effects. I shall commence with the Explication of the Cause of Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde, and Sloath of Limbs, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the first budding in a Scorbutic Body. A Lassitude, Debility, and Sloath of Limbs, are Affections of the nerves, which originating from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Brain &amp; Back, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derive their Causes thence, unless we should conceive them naturally to draw in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> both ends; but there being usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concomitant other Symptoms of an affected Brain, as Drowsiness, Obtuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the Internal senses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55228:85"/>
amply confirm, what is asserted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Blood according to the first Observation mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. being affected with a tumultuation, the Spirits and <hi>Volatil Salts</hi> are inflamed, and rendred Acrimonious, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal constituents of the Animal Juices, must necessarily prick the Nerves, through which they pass, and incommode the Nervous parts, to which they are transmitted. As for the Imbecillity and Sloath of Limbs, also the obtusion of the Animal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they depend on the intemperature of the Animal Spirits, not being potent enough to perform their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with alacrity, to which their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed just Temperament is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requisite. By the way you are not to apprehend here, that the said Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde is occasioned through a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hapning upon the appulse of the <hi>Nervous Liquor</hi> (rendred <hi>praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Acid</hi>) to the Articles, and there meeting with <hi>Lixivial Blood</hi>; for the constitution and temperament of the <hi>Nervous juices</hi> are not so extreamly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the <hi>Blood,</hi> as to be contrary to it, which in this sort of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55228:86"/>
Fermentation or Ebullition is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary it should: I can conceive no more difference between them, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which former cannot be indued with any other qualities, than what it derives from the latter. And here it is, that trite Maxime is verified, <hi>Vitium prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> coctionis non corrigitur in secunda, nec secundae in tertia.</hi> So that, if the constitution of the Blood in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries be <hi>Acid</hi> and not <hi>Lixivial,</hi> the Animal juices must likewise be <hi>Acid</hi> and not <hi>Lixivial,</hi> as being engendred by a further digestion out of the said Arterial blood. Hence I argue, that Arthritic pains in the <hi>Scorvey</hi> do not proceed from a Fermentation between an <hi>Acid</hi> Nervous Liquor, and <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial</hi> blood about the Joynts; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as you shall be further satisfied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the <hi>Lixivial Salts,</hi> that are cast forth to the circumference in an <hi>Acid Scorbut,</hi> do not partake of an Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or at least not so intense, as to excruciate the Limbs with those insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable pains. But after all, the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation desumed in this case from the Nervous Liquor, assigns an Alcalious
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55228:86"/>
Medicine, and that which is collected from the Lixivial Blood, indicates an Acid; an absurdity not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Physick, that one and the same Disease should require two Medicines <hi>per se</hi> contrary to one another.</p>
            <p>Neither can I assent to that opinion <hi>Tr. de Sc. p.</hi> 250. <hi>l.</hi> 25. which asserts the cause of a Spontaneous lassitude and weakness of the knees and legs, to be an infarction of the pores of the Musculs with Excrementitious humors, through which the Animal Spirits are obstructed in their passage; for it is not observed, that there is any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Tension in the flesh of the said Musculs, but commonly hangs lank and laxe; on the contrary, where there is a real Tension and Tumefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Musculs of the Legs, which some gross Bodies are subject unto, we do not find any other, then a small compression of the Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, notwithstanding which, the Animal Spirits have their free influxe and refluxe, and the Limbs their sense and motion; wherefore if there be no obstruction or constipation in this case, much less in the other, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55228:87"/>
it must be the Animal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Loco-motive Spirits, being praeternaturally affected, that are the occasion of these last fore-mentioned Symptoms.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The <hi>Dyspnoea</hi> or difficulty of Breathing, that so oft is implicated with the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> depends on the stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of gross Acid Blood in the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Arteriosa</hi> or <hi>Arteria Pulmonalis, Arteria Venosa</hi> or <hi>Vena Pulmonalis,</hi> and in the Pores of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Lungs; for every <hi>Systole</hi> propel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the streams of Blood into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Artery faster, than it is received through the Pores of the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> into the <hi>Lung Vein,</hi> the Lungs must necessarily be stuffed, swelled up, and consequently much oppressed by the weight of this stagnating Blood. But that I may praevent you from lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into the same error my Author is fallen into, it's convenient I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you here with the meaning of <hi>Dyspnoea</hi> or difficulty of Breathing; <hi>Respiratio Anhelosa,</hi> or short and thick breathing, or in the common phrase, <hi>Short windiness, Asthma,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:55228:87"/>
or improperly <hi>Phtysick</hi> and <hi>Orthopnaea,</hi> or the worst and extream degree of <hi>Phtysick</hi> and their difference; for <hi>qui bene distinguit, bene docet.</hi> In a <hi>Dyspnoea</hi> the breathing is somewhat long and slow, with the sense of an oppression or weight, as if something kept the Lungs down. A <hi>Respiratio Anhelosa</hi> is a quick and thick Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as you may perceive in your self, after any smart Exercise, as Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or Carrying a Weight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Asthma</hi> is a thick and short breathing, accompanied with a whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing noise, and commonly also with a Cough. An <hi>Orthopnaea</hi> is a long and slow expiration, and a quick catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) inspiration, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such a stifling, that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is forced to sit upright, thrusting his Mouth up and gaping for Air.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Respiratio Anhelosa</hi> is also frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among Scorbuticks, and is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by a Putrid Acid Blood, that is (as I have told you before) Fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous and Acrimonious, by means of those sharp sooty steams it irritates, and prompts the Lungs to a quick breathing, to prevent stifling, and to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55228:88"/>
attract a clearer Air instead of those sooty Evaporations, which in some I have observed so copious, that their Tongue was covered with a black scum, not unlike what is fraequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken notice of in continual ardent Fevors.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. As the Pulse in respect of quickness and aequality of motion, doth proportionably correspond with the Respiration in a healthful, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in a morbifique state; so it doth in the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> where in this degree it's quick, fraequent, and unaequal in motion, which is occasioned by the same cause, <hi>viz.</hi> by Acid Fuliginous Blood, stimulating the Vital Faculty of a quick motion, and imposing a necessity on the Ventricles of the Heart to an expeditious explosion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonious <hi>Cruor.</hi> The inaequality of Pulsation depends on the unaequal mixture of the Blood with those Fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous steams (or <hi>Heterogeneous Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's</hi>) that do so unaequally vellicate the sides of the Ventricle.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. A ruddy and thick Urin is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55228:88"/>
most commonly an attendant of a <hi>Praeliminary Scorvey,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and specified in the two foremost Observations of <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the production whereof is a dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those deflagrated Salts and Sulphurs in the <hi>Serum,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is praecipitated by the Putrid <hi>Acid,</hi> that's ever a sequel to the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butique Ebullition, and so abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kidneys and Ureters; but as the said Ebullition doth onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally happen now and then, so the fore-mentioned ruddy Urin doth onely appear on those occasions. For the greater part the Urin is turbid, and copiously saturated with a thick sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is apt to furr to the sides and bottom of the Chamber-pot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else, but an excretion of crude indigested Tartar, or Acid Salt, from the Mass of Blood; if at some seasons the Urin appears thin and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qeous, that may happen either thorow the potent coagulative quality of the acidity in the Blood, not separating the superfluous and excrementitious Tartar; or through some obstruction of the passages, leading to or from the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55228:89"/>
Kidneys, suffering the thin only to pass, and retaining the thick. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over observe, that in those thick drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Urins, upon some standing the gross sediment is apt to sinck to the bottom, leaving the middle clear and transparent, and a cream swimming on the top, which is nothing but the mucilaginous part of the Tartar, through its lightness recovering the surface of the Urin.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Spots and Blotches of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral colours do ordinarily survene a <hi>Scorvey,</hi> and are caused by a conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the sulphurous parts of the Blood, that are deflagrated, and <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salts</hi> amortized through the <hi>Acid,</hi> in the pores of the ambient Skin or <hi>Cutis,</hi> where they are deposed or deserted by the <hi>Acid Blood,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing it self from them, and through its penetrative faculty insinuating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veins, returns by the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive motion into the Body; whereas the others being so much obtused, are rendred incapable of reverting into the Vessels. These Spots and Blotches are not dolorous, because the acrimony
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55228:89"/>
of the deposed Salts is obtused; their colour if red, they derive from the Sulphurous or Bituminous parts of the Blood, mixt with the Volatil or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortized Salt; if yellow, from an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of part of the <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed and obtused by the reaction of the said <hi>Volatil Alcali,</hi> which now mentioned obtused <hi>Acid,</hi> if left com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt in a greater proportion with the <hi>Alcali,</hi> and with a lesser proportion of the Bituminous Particles, render those Blotches of a livid tincture.</p>
            <p>The production of Scorbutic Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Botches differ from Spots and Blotches in this only, that the Salts in these latter are diluted, or dissolved in some part of the <hi>Serum,</hi> which in the former are more condensed and coagulated. Some of these are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, others are painful; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hapening, because the acrimony of the foresaid Salts is not totally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tused by reaction.</p>

First, I offer thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether the <hi>Scorvey</hi> be a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest or Occult Disease, that is as <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> doth term it, <hi>a Morbus totius sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae?</hi> Some that Argue from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, probably may offer the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>Platerus, Sennertus, Steeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,</hi> and others. The first of these asserts the <hi>Scorvey</hi> to be an Occult Malignant, and absolutely Venomous disease. The second gives us a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55228:93"/>
(which as I said before, the <hi>Scorvey</hi> is not capable of, as having no essential difference) in these terms. <hi>The Scorvey is an Evil and Occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or disposition, impressed on the whole Body, but chiefly on the Bowels, that are destined for Nutrition, arising from a gross Melancholy Humour, that's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorous or Serous, and corrupted in a peculiar manner,</hi> or, saith he, <hi>It is a certain Evil Nutrition, or Ill Habit of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. The last expresses it, to be a Moist distemper of the Spleen, occasioned through the putrefaction of the thick Humour, which the Spleen delights in. The formost Opinion may easily be Refelled, since the Symptoms of the <hi>Scorvey</hi> may be plainly deduced from Causes, that are obvious and manifest. 2. All Venoms do immediately assassinate the Heart, dissolve the <hi>Vinculum vitae,</hi> and have this Qualification appropriated to them, that they are only to be Expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their Antidotes; but common Observation tells us, that the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> moves gradually, is more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily seated in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> or <hi>Stomach,</hi> than the <hi>Heart,</hi> and is Cured by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55228:94"/>
that Operate by a Manifest, and not Occult quality, namely such as are of a subtil igneous and colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quative faculty, as <hi>Scorvey-grass, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercresses,</hi> &amp;c. The second Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on savours much of the first, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it <hi>a morbus totius substantiae,</hi> which that it is not, appears from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Answer. <hi>Steeghius</hi> will have it a Moist disease, and asserts Melancholly a Drying humour, the continent cause; which however <hi>per accidens</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Moist distemper; but waving that, it is most certain, that in many Scorbutics the <hi>Spleen</hi> is not affected, and therefore cannot be described to be a Moist distemper of the <hi>Spleen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. The next Quaery is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the <hi>Scorvey</hi> a <hi>Similar,</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similar</hi> Disease? Some that do allow the <hi>Scorvey</hi> a Disease of very ancient date, adjudge it a <hi>Dissimilar</hi> disease, and in particular a Disease of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>viz.</hi> A great Spleen. <hi>Pet. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restus</hi> asserts it a Compounded disease, and not Simple. The fittest answer to this in short is, That primarily it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55228:94"/>
a <hi>Similar,</hi> and secundarily a <hi>Dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Disease.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. The third Quaestion is, Which is the part Principally and Originally affected in the <hi>Scorvey? Horstius</hi> states the Spleen the part affected, others the Stomach only, and many the Stomach, Spleen, and Liver. If in some it be observable (as it is) they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with luxuriant glowing Gums, and vacillation of their Teeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concomitance of other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, in all probability it's the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is the only part affected, there appearing no Sign or Symptom of any other entrail, that's affected. On the other hand, if no other Symptoms E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge, besides blewish Scorbutic Pustles or Blotches, it may rationally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, no other part is affected but the Spleen. It has been also observed by <hi>Forestus,</hi> and <hi>Reusnerus,</hi> that the Spleen and other Entrails have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much affected in some deceased Scorbutics, but the Liver chiefly, wherein was observed a great discolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and dissolved unity of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Whence we may deduce,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55228:95"/>
that a <hi>Scorvey</hi> that's contracted by a <hi>Salin Diaet,</hi> the Stomach is originally and primarily affected, in that which is occasioned through a <hi>Salin Air</hi> the Spleen, but after some continuance they become all parts aequally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

This being praemised, I intend those Ebullitions comprehended in the Observations that are Delineated in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. for a <hi>Praeliminary Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> because they praecede, and are generally <hi>Praeliminary</hi> to a <hi>Scorvey.</hi> A <hi>Liminary Scorvey</hi> is that, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quietation and subsidence of a <hi>Praeliminary</hi> Ebullition buds forth.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. A <hi>Praeliminary Scorvey</hi> is not onely discovered by praeceding Scorbutic Procatarctics, but also by the Pulse and Urin, the former beating not so unaequal, as in continual putrid Fevors; neither is the heat so pungent, but glowing only,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55228:98"/>
that is obtuse and fuliginous: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is commonly of a higher colour, than in an ordinary continual Fevor it can arrive to in so short a space of time, and very abounding in a gross ruddy sediment. Moreover the ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Blood is of no long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, but in a few dayes is apt to fall and subside, unless provoked by the error of the Physician or Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. A <hi>Liminary Scorvey</hi> some do decipher by these four <hi>Pathognomonic</hi> Signs, 1. A livid and dead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Face. 2. An itching deep redness of the Gums. 3. An Oppression of the Brest and Respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, also of the Sides about the Bastard Rib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 4. A Painful Feebleness of the Knees. These we grant to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Signs in an evident commencing <hi>Scorvey,</hi> but not <hi>Pathognomonic,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not alwayes attend eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scorbutique; for I have met with some, that without those Symptoms before-mentioned, have been disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with livid Scorbutique Spots, likewise some whose Mouth and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55228:99"/>
parts were affected, without the least sense of feebleness in their Knees, or Oppression of Respiration; Lastly, Those that are molested with a <hi>Latent Scorvey,</hi> are exempted from several of the praenumerated Signs.</p>
            <p>To these common Diagnosticks must be added a fifth, A great heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all the Body, and lumpishness or dulness of the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senses. 6. The Appetite in some is obtused, in others it's so much sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they are apt to covet more than they can digest. 7. A <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the digestion of the Stomach some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what impaired of its wonted vigor; as appears by a small heaviness and drowsiness after Meat, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Belchings and Winds murmuring downwards. 8. The Urin is less transparent, and grown a little turbid and drabby. 9. All these may be confirmed, by considering the <hi>Procatarctic</hi> Causes, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they have lived in a Scorbutic Air, or fed upon Salt Diaet, or by reason of Imprisonment, or other volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Confinement, have neglected all manner of Exercise, or whether they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55228:99"/>
have been under some occasional Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or whether some usual eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, as the <hi>Menstrua,</hi> Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage at the Nose, or Haemorrhoids, Issues in the Arm, Neck, or Leg, or in any other part, be not suppressed. Or whether they are not Splenetic or Hypochondriac; or have lately been troubled with a Quartan Ague: Or whether their Parents were not subjected to the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> whence it might be aesteemed Haereditary; or lastly, whether they do not daily converse with Scorbutiques, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it might become Contagious. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider also the <hi>Juvantia,</hi> and <hi>Nocentia,</hi> what things help them, and what hurt them.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. The signs of a <hi>Recent,</hi> or <hi>Augmented Scorvey,</hi> are, 1. A spongy swelling of the Gums, which upon the least pressure, or biting a piece of Bread, are apt to exudate Blood. 2. A great stink of the Mouth. 3. Loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Teeth. 4. Spots like Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, and Freckles dispersed over the whole Field of the Body, but thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est about the Mouth, Temples, Arms,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55228:100"/>
Breast, and Knees; some are Red, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Yellow, Grayish, Duskish, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre, or Blackish, easily disappearing in one place, and emerging again in another. 5. A deeper transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Complexion into an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, the looks seeming Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish, Greenish, deep Red, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or Swartish. 6. The Oppression of the Lungs, Breast and Sides is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably increased, insomuch that when they stir or rise up, they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to faint and gasp for Breath, which continueth so long, until they sit, or lay themselves down again. 7. Puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing up of the Stomach particularly after Victuals, and Tension of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 8. The weakness of their Knees and Ancles, is likewise much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which renders them far more Impotent in going, or moving. 9. It's observed, that in many the whole train of Symptoms is apt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or increased every fourth day, in some every third day, that is every other day (for Physicians do reckon inclusive) in others at certain seasons every day. 10. In this degree they are usually Costive. And 11. troubled
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55228:100"/>
with Pain and Stiches all over. 12. Suppression of the <hi>Menstrua</hi> in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in stead whereof, they are molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a sort of painful Whites.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. In an <hi>Inveterate Scorvey,</hi> these Praecited Symptoms and Signs, as they have taken deeper Root, so have also assumed a greater Intension and stubbornness; for in this degree the Patient is deprived of all power of Moving or Stirring; the Sinews, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and Muscles, are apt to be stiff and contracted. He is molested with Vagrant, Ambulative, Distending, Creeping, Vellicating, or Lancina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pains of several parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; bruising Ossifragous (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) pains in the midway of a Limb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Joynts, torturing most in the Night; Red, Yellow, Purpre, or Blackish splotches, especially about the Knees, which sometimes being concomitated with a Tumor, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thence downwards as far as the Foot, and meeting altogether in one tumefied Splotch render the Leg to ones view, as it were all over Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous; a fraequent recurring Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55228:101"/>
passion, Hiccoch, choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coughs, and copious Salivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, violent Palpitations of the Heart, deep Swoundings strenuous Vomitings, tearing Iliack pains, which a famous Author names a <hi>Dysenteria Incruenta,</hi> but how properly, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge. The Pulse variable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequal in motion and strength, most times low and thick, and sometimes vermicular, though at other times strong and violent, that is Thumping. The Urin is inconstant, oft turbid and whitish, sometimes thick and reddish, seldom thin and pale; deep Red, or purpre Tumor and Pustles, scattering over the Surface, Redness of Face, Tumors and Impostumes of all kinds, according to the Temperament of the Grieved. The foresaid Splotches oft do peel off in Scales of several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and figures, or exchange into <hi>Erysipelas's,</hi> these and likewise Botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es do pass into Ulcers, some of which are superficial, profound, simple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, callous, dry, sanious, puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In some few the Veins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tongue, and about the inside of the lower Lips are varicious; some
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55228:101"/>
also they are debilitated by great Sweats, which they are exposed to. In an <hi>Inveterate Scorvey,</hi> they are oft Loose and subject to fall into violent Fluxes of the Belly, or <hi>Diarrhaea's,</hi> and <hi>Lienteries,</hi> which if continuing, pass into a <hi>Terminatory Distemper.</hi> The tormenting pain in the Back, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lumbago,</hi> and resembling the pain that's occasioned by the Stone of the Kidneys, is very brisk in this degree, as also spurious Pleuritick pains.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. The Signatures and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a <hi>Terminative Scorvey</hi> (which is the extream degree, whereinto the forgoing passeth either <hi>per</hi>

            <p n="6">§. 6. The Signs of an <hi>Hepatic Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> are, 1. Deep, Red, or Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish prurient sanguinolent Gums. 2. Red, Yellowish, or Cineritious Spots and Splotches about several parts of the Body, especially about the Breast, Neck, and Face, also Pustles and Bumps of the like tincture in the same places, that prove somewhat Incommodious by a Pruriginous itching quality, also Erysipela's, Shingles, and Ring-worms; some of those Spots and Splotches of

The Mouth, Leg, and Joint-<hi>Scorvey,</hi> needs no further Illustration for discovery, than what I have set down in their particular Chapters.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. A <hi>Latent Scorvey</hi> requires Experience and Industry in the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who must take his Dimensions of Conjecture, 1.

From such Symptoms, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so Directly or Relatively be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any particular Disease besides this, as a Recurrent Lassitude, and sloath of Moving, dulness of the Senses, difficulty of Breath, pesanture of Body, inflation of the Stomach, heaviness and dulness after Meat, winds about the Guts, Coughs and Catar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, Observe that where two such Non-naturals, as a <hi>Salin Air</hi> and <hi>Diaet,</hi> have so absolute an Influence on Bodies, scarce any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease can seize on a man, which doth not partake of a <hi>Scorbutic Tincture,</hi> neither can it be well Cured, without

A <hi>Dutch Scorvey</hi> in Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is very different from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>; they using generally a Diaet more Excrementitious than ours (as gross thick Beer, Roots, Cabbage, Salats, Milk, Roak-Flesh, Pickle-Herring, and other Fish) are more Exposed to all the supposed <hi>Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monics</hi> and <hi>Syndrome</hi> of a <hi>Mouth</hi> and <hi>Leg-Scorvey,</hi> than we, who feed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on Meats of more Nutriture and less Excrementitious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not so much Exposed to that general Catalogue of <hi>Scorbutic Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> but most commonly to those that are Latent, (and Recited in the praeceding Paragraphs) and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more evident, as Spots, Blotches, Pustles, Cutambulous Pains, Griping of the Guts, Vomiting and Gnawing Pains of the Stomach, Hypochondriac Winds and Vapours, Catarrhs, Coughs, also to those of the <hi>Joint-Scorvey.</hi>

               </gap>utiny and observation in practice I had detected their true Fountain and Original, which I now propose to you. That the Heart is the chief seat, and part primarily and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55228:108"/>
principally affected of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Diseases, appears 1. By the Pulsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arteries, which before any <hi>Convulsion, Palsie,</hi> or <hi>Apoplexy</hi> doth seize on the Patient, doth very much vary from its Natural, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Fortitude, Order, Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Aequality of Motion, and many other specifications; which certainly express the heart primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally affected; confer further with the 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. By the Respiration, whose variation from its ordinary Function in several respects, praeceding those recited affections, also signifie the same to be the part principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. 3. From the consideration of the Office and Function of the Heart, which, besides the Vivification and Irradiation of the whole, is, to be the sole and <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of Motion of the Animal Spirits; for through the Pulsation of the Arteries about the Brain, and more especially about the <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> it causes Efforts, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus,</hi> and impulsive motions on the Animal Spirits; so that it is from those Impulses these receive their energy and vigor, and therefore consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55228:109"/>
the Heart being affected, those <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses</hi> must also be depravated or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht. 4. If at any time those Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are abated or removed, it is by means of Cordials, which here for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and the scope they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for (though improperly) may be termed Cephalic-Cordials, <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico-Cardiaca,</hi> as <hi>Spirit of Castor, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Rosemary, Pyony,</hi> &amp;c. These undoubtedly are nothing more than Cordials, and rectifying the Blood, comforting the Vital Balsam and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Heart, and reducing them to Ordination, aequality of Motion and Vigour. From ordinary Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als they differ in this only, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a more durable and compact <hi>Sulphur</hi> and Spirits, they continue their Operation longer, in comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart, and oppugning the <hi>Salts</hi> of the Blood, by reason of the Compactness and Crassitude of their substance, whereas those that are vulgarly termed Cordials, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to comfort the Spirits by assimilation, consist of a lighter, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and exhalable substance; as <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, Treacle-water, Aqua
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55228:109"/>
Mirabilis,</hi> &amp;c. 5. Observing, that in some Cases the foresaid Symptoms receive a considerable abatement and benefit from Phlebotomy, it is easily Demonstrable, that this is performed, by detracting some part of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that oppressed the Heart, and its Pulsifique and Impulsive motions. 6. <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de caus. puls. c.</hi> 12. seems to intimate what is here asserted, in these words: <hi>Pulsus convulsivus est, in quo ad utrumque terminum arteria tenditur, quem convuls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o sequi solet.</hi> So that a convulsive Pulse (which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Heart to be affected prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) doth praecede a Convulsion, which following must be deemed a Symptom of the former. Touching the manner and difference of those three Symptoms, I conceive, that a <hi>Convulsion</hi> is occasioned by Irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a <hi>Palsie</hi> by Relaxation and Obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> by Dissolution. But to Illustrate it further; When the Arterial Blood consisting of an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious pungitive Salt, and appelling to the lower part of the Brain (which is the most sensible, and near the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Nervorum</hi>) is agitated smartly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55228:110"/>
by the vibration of the Arteries or hard and violent pulsations (for in all Convulsions <hi>Pulsus sunt duri &amp; tensi</hi>) those subtiler particles of the Blood are adacted violently into the Pores of the tender parts of the Brain, which being thereby extremely discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, do violently impel the said pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Particles into the Nerves (or in some cases only make a smart Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of their <hi>Idea</hi> on the Animal Spirits contained in the Nerves) and being protruded to the Tendons of the Muscles, through their sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating quality incite them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and distend themselves, to be freed or discharged of those aculeous Particles. Moreover, take notice, that the vulgar Explicatory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, wherein the Nerves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be primarily and chiefly convelled, which being continuated to the Muscles, do likewise occasion their being convelled is greatly Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; for only the Tendons are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Convulsions, they being the chief instrument of the <hi>Motus Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> and only subject to a <hi>Motus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravatus,</hi> and <hi>Violentus,</hi> whereas
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55228:110"/>
the Nerves are not appointed to move or to be moved, but to convey the Spirits. Secondly, When a Nerve is punctured, or cut asunder (as hath oft happened by the Indexterity of Surgeons in Phlebotomy wounding the Nerve in the Arm in stead of the Vein) it's only apt to be surprized with a very great pain, but never known to be convelled. Wherefore I would not have my Reader judge the Dictates of the Ancients to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, since besides what is fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it's manifest in many of their Positions, which hitherto by this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Age are received for Truths: I shall only give you this Instance for Proof; The Causes of a <hi>Cephalalgia,</hi> or Head-Ache, is by them asserted to be Acrimonious, or distending Humors and Winds, corroding or distending the Membranes or <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain. Nothing is more false than this, or savours more of Ignorance in Anatomy; for neither of the <hi>Menin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> are in the least sensible, as may be observed by the Probe, wherewith touching the <hi>Dura meninx,</hi> though roughly, (when lying bare upon the use of the Trepan) is not in the least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55228:111"/>
by the Patient. Secondly, Whence should the sense be derived, there being not any Nerve, or so much as a Nervous Fibre transmitted to it from the Brain. In <hi>Summa,</hi> in the Brain, Stomach, and Liver, though they are daily Dissected and Examined by Physicians in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired Patients, many particulars are passed by, that have not been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered until very lately, which is to be attributed to their Negligence and Unskilfulness; for indeed now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, if a Physician hath but once or twice dissected a Sheeps-head, or a Calves-pluck, he thinks himself suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified to Challenge the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of an expert Anatomist; thus we see, that an expert Anatomist of this kind, observing that one of the jaw Muscles of a Sheeps-head had two Bellies (whence its also called <hi>Diga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricus</hi>) immediately concluded all Muscles to be <hi>Biventres</hi>; an able Head-piece for an Anatomist.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Palsie</hi> is an imperfect <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> or a <hi>Levis Apoplexia,</hi> and differ only <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du, secundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> and therefore do easily pass into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55228:111"/>
according to the Tenor of the <hi>Doct. of Hipp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Galen 3. de loc. affect. 10. <hi>further tells you, That where all the Nerves have at once lost their sense and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that affection is called an</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, <hi>but that which only happens to the right or left side is a</hi> Palsie.</p>
            <p>The causes in general are twofold, 1. A Material. And, 2. A Formal Cause. The former is a gross <hi>Sapona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Blood,</hi> which through its thickness is rendred incapable of being so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized by the Brain, as to distil into the Nerves, and that part that is Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into the Nerves, being too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse and gross, to receive the Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive motions and <hi>Impetus,</hi> prove una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to actuate or distend the Nerves and Fibres, and therefore move the Members very weakly, or not at all, whence I term it a Relaxation in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the said distention. The Formal Cause is the pulsifique faculty of the Heart, which is rendred soft, slow, and dull, and therefore Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exercise it's Impulsive motions. Moreover observe, that though the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55228:112"/>
Blood is Salin-Alcalious, it is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonious, because it is obtused by a mixture of gross Unctuous and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that obtuses its Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for otherwise were it Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and purely Lixivial, it would prove Vellicating and Dolorous, and consequently Convulsive. The <hi>Aetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> of the other Terminatives may be easily deduced from the interspersed Discourses.</p>

Moreover two things are observable, 1. That this Scorbutic Evil praesently after its first Origination, was more

fierce, and Malignant, than the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Twenty or Thirty years; for the said <hi>Fabritius</hi> in the account he gives of it, tells us, this Distemper tended immediately to Ulcers; which if not timely remedied, became Gangraenous, and Mortal. The Second is, That there was an Interval of some years, before it spreaded into Countries, that were less Northern; for <hi>Balduinus Ronsaeus,</hi> who to me appears the first, that wrote on the <hi>Scorvey, è Professo,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>de Magn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Physicians being extremely surprized at it, who had not yet determined any thing concerning it, being an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that was yet new and unknown, and so was its Name, Essence, and much more the manner of Curing it.</p>
            <p>Scorbutic Authors tell us, that <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi> was pester'd with it next after <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> in the year 1500. the next <hi>Frizeland,</hi> then <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> in 1556. where it was occasioned by eating of Rye, that was brought from <hi>Prussia,</hi> there being at that time a great scarcity of Wheat; afterwards <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi>; in a manner, as if this Distemper had by Contagion crept from Country to Country.

            <p>A <hi>Praeliminary Scorvey,</hi> if not well Distinguisht, and rightly Cured, may either be Transitory into a dangerous Malignant continual Fever, or a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Scorvey,</hi> either of which may be praevented by a very facil Cure.</p>

            <p n="9">§. 9. A <hi>Latent Scorvey</hi> is easily or difficultly Cured, according to the length of time since it hath invaded the Body, and according to the quality of the Symptoms, and parts affected. In general, a <hi>Latent</hi> Distemper doth more easily admit of Cure in the beginning, than a manifest one; but in the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or State is far more difficult than the other, because there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Scorbutic matter towards the Circumference, as in the other, and consequently the Spirits must be more oppressed.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:55228:116"/>§. 8. An <hi>English Scorvey</hi> is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally milder, and less refractory than a <hi>Dutch Scorvey.</hi>

            <p n="11">§. 11. A <hi>Mild Scorvey</hi> may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue or be protracted to ten, twenty, or thirty years; a <hi>Malignant</hi> one doth sometimes terminate Life in two, six, or twelve Months, in some sooner, in others later; some arrive to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods gradually, that is by a gradual decay of Spirits, and contabescency of Body; others die suddenly, and possibly when they least think of it.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Spots</hi> and <hi>Blotches,</hi> the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they come to a black colour, the worse they are, and if they burst out into Ulcers, signifie a greater Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and difficulty of Cure. It is observable, that in some before they Die, those <hi>Blotches</hi> do disappear by reverting into the Body, but soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death appear again.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>Vlcers</hi> of the Legs are not easily chekt, but on the contrary if irritated, like Cancers indue a fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer Nature, which fraequently inclines
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55228:117"/>
to a Gangraene, and Mortification.</p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. <hi>Spots</hi> and <hi>Blotches</hi> of an Ash colour, especially if Corroding and Itching, in some are never Cured. Cutaneous Tumours if apt to retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and burst out again, praesage a <hi>Palsie.</hi> A <hi>Palsie</hi> though Cured, leaveth a contraction of some of the Tendons, or a subjection to Convulsions behind it.</p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. In a <hi>Mouth-Scorvey,</hi> if the Palat and Throat turn Livid, that is Leadish, or Blackish, prognosticates Death to be at the door.</p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. A weak <hi>Pulse,</hi> and debility of Body in this Distemper are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes dangerous, because that former may be occasioned by vapours and steems, and the latter by putrid <hi>Acid Blood.</hi> Neither are Convulsive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that survene Scorbutique Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, of an aequal danger with those, that accompany other Distempers; for these soon cease, and their cause being Acrimonious steems, are in a short time dissipated.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:55228:117"/>§. 17. A <hi>Scorvey</hi> succeding a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague,</hi> or a continual Malignant Fevor, proves for the greater part ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Malignant, Obstinate, and in some Incurable.</p>
            <p n="18">§. 18. Children and Boys are most incident to the Kings-Evil, and Joint-Evil, young Men to the vagrant Gout, and old Men to the fixt nodous Gout. Boys and Girls are not so much expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the <hi>Scorvey</hi> as Men or Women; because the Constitution of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not so Salin, as the latter, and therefore when at any time they are surprized with it, are easier Curable. Old Men if Scorbutique, carry their Distemper commonly along with them to their Grave. A <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> is more familiar among the younger sort, and a <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi> among those that are past thirty.</p>
            <p n="19">§. 19. A Body that hath been once Cured of the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> if attacked the second, or third time, shall find the Cure to advance much more slowly than before.</p>
            <p>Few Distempers of this kind are remedied without an exact Diaet,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55228:118"/>
though never so slight, and if they be any thing <hi>Inveterate,</hi> or <hi>Terminatory,</hi> the best Medicines without a Diaet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail nothing.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. <hi>Terminative Scorveys,</hi> though Curable, require a long continuated strict course of Medicines; some are absolutely Incurable.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. Make choice of a thin serene perflated In-Land Air, and therefore shun the Sea-coasts, Bogs, Waterish, Stincking, and Close places.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Let your Diaet be chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fresh Meats, that are Nutritive, of easie digesture, and not very Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious; so that you must avoid all Victuals that are stale, stincking, salt, gross, obstructive, Excrementitious, and of hard digestion. Within the Verge of this Rule are meats, that have been kept too long, until they had acquired a <hi>French Haugou</hi>; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Pork, Brawn, and all sorts of Hog-meat, as Black-puddens, Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siges, Beef, Ducks, Geese, Tripe, Flower-Puddens; most sorts of fried Victuals, as Pancakes, Stakes, Eggs fried, Collops of Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Most sorts of Fish, Salats, all Souced, and Pickled Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which are all Scorbutique. Let your Drink be clear, well fermented, fresh, sweet, and temperate; not stale, or sour, ill

tasted, thick and muddy, heating, or cooling. Thus much for the quality; for quantity you must be moderate, in respect both of Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let your times of Meals be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, seven in the morning, twelve at Noon, and seven at Night in the Summer, and in the Winter one Hour later. Your Breakfast and Supper ought to be light, and moderate, but your Dinner somewhat more solid and plentiful. Particularly avoid Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, new raw Cider, Brandy, and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Sleep moderately, use Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, but not violently, keep your Body in order; that is between Loose and Bound; shift your Linnen once or twice a Week, to praevent the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of your Pores by the Condensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sweat, and sooty steems, that stick to your Shirt.

            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. In respect of their too much increased quantity, they seem to direct the Physician to Diminution or Substraction, which is accomplisht by <hi>Pharmaceutical</hi> and <hi>Chirurgical</hi> means. The latter are, 1. <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> for disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening and depleting some part of the whole, which in Hepatic and Stomachic <hi>Scorveys</hi> is to be performed in the right Arm; in a Splenetic in the Left, and in a Pleuritic <hi>Scorvey</hi> in the Arm of the same side. After a competent Interval, for derivation from, and easing of the part affected, a particular substraction of Blood out of the <hi>Hemorrhoide veins</hi> by the application of Leeches is of great use in an Hepatic or Splenetic <hi>Scorvey.</hi> In Women, especially if there be either a Total or partial sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression

of the <hi>Menstrua,</hi> the <hi>Saphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ought to be opened. The measure of what quantity of Blood is requisite to be subducted, is to be taken from the degree of Plethory, Age, Sex, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common Circumstances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fontanels or Issues, than which no means, whether <hi>Chirurgical,</hi> or <hi>Pharmaceutical,</hi> seem more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and necessary, both for a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative, and Curative. Touching the Place, where an Issue is most proper to be made; in a Splenetic <hi>Scorvey</hi> is in the inside of the Leg above the Knee, an Inch or two higher than the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering place; but here the <hi>Surgeon</hi> is to be very cautious, that in making the Incision, he doth not wound some of the Vessels, that pass just under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, which is fraequently done if made too deep, and sometimes not without danger. In an Hepatic <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> the Right Leg is most proper, in a Stomachic either, it matters not. The <hi>Mouth-Scorvey</hi> indicate; an Issue in the Left Arm, or in some cases in the Neck, or Right Arm, or in some very few on the Head, on the place of meeting of the <hi>Sagittal</hi> and <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:55228:122"/>
Suturs. In the <hi>Leg-Scorvey</hi> an Issue above the Knee is more rational. In the <hi>Joint-Scorvey</hi> more Fontanels than one are necessary, to be made in the Arm or Leg, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Neck also, according to the circumstances of the Disease.</p>
            <p>Children that are Born of Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Parents, receive a great benefit from Issues, that are made in the Neck or Arm; but for praevention, that the Scorbutic stain wherewith some Child bearing Women are contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, shall be communicated to the Child in the Womb, nothing is of aequal force to an Issue in the Arm. The too much increased quantity of Scorbutic Humours indicating Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceutical evacuations, is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisht, or abated by Laxatives or Eccoprotics, and Purgatives or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics. The former are usually prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before Bleeding (where requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and Purgatives.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>ALoes</hi> is the chief Laxative, and indeed the <hi>Basis</hi> of most Purgative Pills; but in regard that it's offensive to the Stomach and Liver, and that by reason of its bitter Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Lixivial parts, it's of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so Colliquative, and Irritating, that it's apt to force the Blood out of its Vessels, and particularly to excite a <hi>Tenesmus,</hi> and Haemorrhoidal pains, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily requires such Correction and Praeparation, as may render it not only

            <p n="4">§. 4. It is among the Records of Experience, that <hi>Aloetic Pills</hi> are a most safe and effectual Praeservative from the <hi>Scorvey,</hi> being at convenient times used once or twice a Week or oftner; they are likewise a great Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, that may be praemised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55228:124"/>
a Curative Method of a <hi>Recent,</hi> and <hi>Inveterate Scorvey.</hi> They offer no violence to Nature, which the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>Mountebancks</hi> Universal, or Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Pills, Elixirs, and praetended purgative Cordials do in so rude a measure, that many have and daily do purchase them with the loss of their Lives. Were I obliged to set down the Names of all those bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Elixir-purchasers, or Pill-Chapmen, that in one Year only are untimely posted away to their Graves by those Deleterious Medicines, it is not twice the Bulk of this Treatise would contain a space large enough for a Register.</p>
            <p>How gently those <hi>Aloetic Pills</hi> cleanse the Stomach, the Guts, and Mesaraics of their Drossy Mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and Tartarous Dregs, and that without the least perturbation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, alteration of Body, change of Countenance, impair of Strength, or any ill attendance, may be admired.

            <p>The second is in relation to their proper Use and Exhibition, where you are to take notice, that they are only appropriated to an <hi>Acid Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> being otherwise very praejudicial in a <hi>Lixivial,</hi> and <hi>Saponary Scorvey,</hi> also to all hot and dry Temperaments, lean and thin habits of Body, and such as are subject to <hi>Haemorrhages</hi> of the Nose or <hi>Haemorrhoides,</hi> or excessive <hi>Menstrua.</hi>

Thus much for the Simples, the Composits are these following; but before I proceed upon them, let me recommend one Rule of Caution to you, That the less Compounded Medicines are, the more certain are their Effects, and less subject to disturb the Spirits: For a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that consists of manifold Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, though perchance it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the same Operation, will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a greater Perturbation, and with so much uncertainty, that you shall not know, to which of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the success is to be chiefly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Moreover, though for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Dubiousness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper a Polypharmacal praescription may be allowed, yet in Scorbutique Maladies, where the Blood upon the least irritation is so apt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitated, and moved into a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ebullition or <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">§. 4. Secondly, Be mindful of this Remarque, that Scorbutics, because they are so much exposed to an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and Depauperation of Vital

and Animal Spirits, as appears by their low inaequal Pulses, the imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Joynts, and oppressed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, cannot bear much Purging, especially by violent Cathartics, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there that Concoction (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="14">§. 14. The Virtue of those Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Mineral Waters is derived, from a permixture of some crude Elements of <hi>Iron,</hi> imperfectly Coagulated or Compounded into Particles, with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sourcing near and washing through the <hi>Matrices</hi> of the said Crude imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ferruginous Elements; or to be more plain, the said Mineral Waters do consist of a dissolution of Vitriolat Salt, volatilized by the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Iron.</hi> From the <hi>Vitriol</hi> it is, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

On the contrary, as soon as it hath suffered the loss of all its Volatil Salt, which is in very few dayes, it doth assume a binding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive quality, and that in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

a manner, that some have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it; for the Water remaining in their Bodies, and not being carried off, had suffocated the Vital flames of the Heart and Arteries.</p>
            <p>Those that have made Observation on the number of such, that have been hurried out of the World both at the season of their drinking the Waters of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or soon after they had left them off, may very well conclude, either, that the said Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not proper for their Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or that as too frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, their Bodies were insufficiently praepared; for it is far from a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable praeparative, to Exhibit only a Dose of Stomach Pills, or a little <hi>Pulv.

A while since, a Patient made her complaint to me of sharp running pains, flying up and down her Limbs, a pricking in her Gums, glowing of the Calves of her Legs, and sometimes of the Shins, a gnawing pain about her Ancles, especially upon much stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, heats and pustles in her Face.

            <p>It is this sort of <hi>Scorvey</hi> and its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions (which hitherto hath not been observed by any) that occasions so many ambulative Patients, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from one Physician to another, among whom some are so ingenious to confess, they do not know what name to give the Distemper, or what to make of it.</p>

in an <hi>Elixir Antiscorbuticum,</hi> the Basis whereof is <hi>Antimony</hi> stripped of its venenous <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and rendred cooling, Diuretic, and a very high Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difier of the Blood. Neither have I ever observed a Medicine in most Scorbutic Cases, to exceed the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faculties of my <hi>Nitrum Tartarisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the praeparation whereof is, as followeth; but for your praevious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, you are to take notice, that in praeparing <hi>Antimonium Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum,</hi> I am used to add a triple proportion of <hi>Salt Peter,</hi> pulverised and sifted, to crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> likewise poudered and sifted; this being mixt together, I put by little Ladlefuls into a Pipkin made Red hot in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberating Fornace, covering the Pipkin upon every Injection of the said mixture; and having Injected all, I cover the Fornace with a great Tile, and let it Calcine, until the Coals be burned out. The Mass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet warm I pouder, and put it into a large Bason, on which suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Mass to be a Pound in weight, I pour about a quart of warm Water, and stir it very well about, afterwards
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55228:142"/>
let it stand four or five hours, that the Powder may settle on the bottom, decant the Water into an Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting body, affusing to it half a pint of distill'd Vinegar, evaporate it to a Pellicle, and set it in a Cellar or other cool place, and there let it continue three or four days to Crystalize; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Crystals, and evaporate the remaining Liquor again to a Pellicle, afterwards set it on Crystalizing, and so proceed, until all is passed into Crystals.

            <p n="1">§. 1. I Must necessarily praemise one Observation touching the structure of the Stomach, before I can render the Indications plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Its contexture doth consist in four Membranes. The first I call the <hi>Tunica Mucosa,</hi> or the slimy Coat, being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Nature for a defence of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Tunic from those Acrimonious
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55228:143"/>
moistures, the Stomach upon every digestion doth abound with. This Tunic if at any time it be abraded, occasions great Pains, Vellications, continual Singultitions, and enormous Vomitings. The second from those various Sulcations and Wrincklings may aptly be termed the <hi>Tunica Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosa.</hi> This Tunic is very Nervous, and consequently indued with a most exquisite sensibility, derived from the Ramifications of the External branch of the sixth pair, and from the <hi>Plexus sexti paris mesentericus</hi>; the use of it is, to corrugate the Stomach, and to amplex the ingested Victuals firmly and strictly. Both the forementioned Tunics late Authors have improperly named the <hi>Crusta Carnosa.</hi> The third I call the <hi>Tunica Fungosa,</hi> consisting of a laxe spongy flesh, serving to give an ample space and passage for a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Arterial Blood, from whose praesence and praeterflux in its Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Stomach doth receive a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient heat to dissolve, concoct, and elaborate its contents into a Chyle. Another great use is, that it is subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient in the nature of a <hi>Concoctory,</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:55228:144"/>
where the crude Blood circulating is to be Digested or Concocted into a sweeter and aequal Mass; so that you must make this Annotation, that it is here the gross, and phlegmatic crude Blood doth so frequently stagnate; whence that pesanture and load at the Stomach, which the Sick do so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make complaint of in most Distempers, is occasioned, and not from crude viscous Humours in the capacity of the Stomach, which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, with the Ignorant vulgar, term a Cake of fleam; for were this a truth, a detergent <hi>Aloetic Laxative</hi> would at once scour the Stomach, and disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it of those weighty Humours, or at least a Galiard Vomit cannot be supposed to fail in that Indication; but on the contrary we find, that in many Cases scarce a score of proper Purgers, or half that number of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metics will accomplish the design; however this is not to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so strictly, but that some crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may float, or through their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity adhaere to the sides of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and may be as conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thence by a detergent Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55228:144"/>
It is in this Tunic, where many Distempers take their root, which generally proves of so difficult an era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; but be not so facil, as to erre with the gross of Physicians, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that it is those thick mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous humours, penetrating through the <hi>Tunica Mucosa</hi> and <hi>Nervosa,</hi> do lodge in the <hi>Tunica fungosa,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Cause of those durable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santures of the Stomach; for the said Humours are nothing near proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in subtility to pass through the thick and compact bodies of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Membranes. The fourth Tunic is the common Tunic, derived from the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. This sufficeth to inform you, that in a commencing <hi>Stomachic Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> nothing is more properly Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that an <hi>Aloetic Eccoprotic</hi> praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as hath been proposed before, and repeated once, or twice, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrice a Week, and in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val dayes a Detergent and Antiscorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic decoction.

            <p n="1">§. 1. THe Malignity that so oft is Concomitant and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient to continual Fevors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly almost Reigning in and about <hi>London,</hi> seems chiefly to derive its Original from the ill temperature of the Air, which as hath been declared, is Salin and Scorbutic. That this is the principal Procatarctic, is evident from these two Reasons: 1. Because Persons differing from one another in the use of all the other <hi>Non-naturals,</hi> are subject to be surprised by the same Malignant Fevor, which consequently must then solely be derived from the Air, that only of all the <hi>Non-naturals</hi> being the same, and common to all. 2. Because many of those, that have the misfortune to fall Sick of a <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55228:153"/>
Fevor,</hi> have been most temperate and regular in their Diaet, Motion, and Resting, Sleeping and Waking, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions and Retention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and Passions of the Mind; so that it must be the Air only, that lies imputable of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Effect; add hereto, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Bodies when incident into Fevors in some other Climates, are not afflicted with those Malignant Symptoms. The causality through which a Salin Air produceth such Malignant febril Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is by disposing the Body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender great measures of gross Fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and very Acrimonious steems, which by reason of the constipation of the External pores, and of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obstructions are repelled, and incorporated into the whole current of the Blood, kindle and inflame its Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> parts, whose flames are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendred Malignant and venomous to the Spirits, which then prove the immediate Cause of those Malignant Symptoms. 3. By this means the Blood soon becomes Lixivially Salin, Saponary, and runs into a gross deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Oyl, as plainly appears, when occasionally tapt out by Phlebotomy.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55228:153"/>
Now the great difficulty of reducing this unctuous saponary Blood to its former qualification, and freeing it from that gross Salin and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crimonious <hi>Fuligo,</hi> is the Cause, that renders <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevors</hi> so indomitable, and extremely pernicious. Upon this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi> which your strict Scrutiny and Observation in Practice will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly confirm, how Deleterious the ordinary Method of Curing the said Fevors, and how contrary those hot Cordials exhibited by spoonfuls prove, is easily discovered; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of moving Nature to sweat by an Incisive, Attenuating, and Volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing quality, and by Amortizing the Lixivial Salts, they render the said Salts more Lixivial and absorbing, and consequently dispose the Body not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but against Sweating. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Times or Seasons observed for exhibiting of Medicines, that are accordingly to be varied in quantity quality and other circumstances; a certain directory of all which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be attain'd by Indications, desu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from that impertinently impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Notion of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> which
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55228:154"/>
hath been the occasion of posting hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to the jaws of <hi>Orcus.</hi> What measures ought to be taken in point of Management and Cure of this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I have already proposed in my <hi>Tractatus Theoret. &amp; Pract. de Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>; But in short, the necessary prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses not being omitted, I do repose a great confidence in an <hi>Antifebril Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir,</hi> consisting of Ingredients of a mixt nature; and in <hi>Spir. cornu cervi</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in a peculiar manner.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> being in some kind not unlike the foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, I will only give my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with Directions relating to the Cure, and then take leave. I cannot give Credit to the received Opinion, importing, that the Small is caused by some impurities, the <hi>Foetus</hi> contracted in the Womb, which afterwards Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth cast forth into those viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pustles: this among the rest is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>Deliramentum Antiquitatis</hi>; for considering that in <hi>Guinee,</hi> most parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and almost through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whole <hi>Asia,</hi> the Natives, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Strangers are never surprized
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55228:154"/>
with the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> though their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities contracted in the Womb (if any after many years interval) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supposed less than ours, we must conclude, that it is rather an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic Disease,</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Northen</hi> Climes, or rather a seasoning or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Nature of Man, arriving out of the <hi>Microcosm</hi> of his Mother into the <hi>Macrocosm,</hi> impressed by the rudeness and difference of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Air of <hi>Northern</hi> Climes from his primogenial Temperament, which needs no other Confirmation, than the Instance of those <hi>Guineans, Indians,</hi> and others, who soon upon their arrival into those Climes are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued by the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> which I can term nothing but a Seasoning, in like manner, as <hi>Northern</hi> Bodies are season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Diseases of the Climate that transport themselves to <hi>Virginia, Barbados,</hi> or other parts of the <hi>West,</hi> or <hi>East-Indies.</hi> That some undergo this seasoning of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> soon after they are crept out of the shell, others when they are grown up to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years; and some not at all, being praevented by some Mortal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55228:155"/>
is occasioned, through the strength of Nature, some Bodies are indued with above others (that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the fore-mentioned seasoning soon after their Birth) whereby they are rendred capable to resist the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative impressions of the Air.</p>
            <p>Since then it is so obvious, that the Air is the principal External efficient, you must necessarily apprehend, that where the Air is Salin and Scorbutic, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> proves much more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and fraequently mortal, and that, by reason the Blood becomes Lixivial, Saponary, and Absorbing, which to dispose to a <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> or Breathing, by those hot inflaming Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials is in some as impossible, as to force Water out of a Flint; but on the contrary, the Salts of the Humors being rendred more Lixivial and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorbing by them, they do not only through that absorbitive and droughty Faculty exhaust and dry up the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, but concentrate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or draw in from the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence those vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>til fuliginous Salts, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the External Salts engendred in the Air, which otherwise Nature is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55228:155"/>
striving to cast forth; and hence it is, that Old Women and Nurses by giving only large measures of plain moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening posset Ale, very small Ale boyld, or thin Fig-drink, prove infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more successful, than many if not most of Physicians: But now I must tell you also, that some of the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practicers of the College of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> taking their measures from the event the management of Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doth procure, and the ill Exit that attends the advice of other Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, there are no principles, either those of Dogmatic putrefaction, or that of Fermentation, which to me do so evidently expound the causality and reason of all those Symptoms and Changes, that so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

happen in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and <hi>Measels,</hi> than the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; and what concerns the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Indications they are such, that in Success and happy Event, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent exceed all others.</p>
