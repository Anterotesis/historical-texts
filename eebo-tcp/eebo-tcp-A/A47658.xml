            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:53908:3"/>
Sciences daily improve, yet Vice and Folly get footing in the World: that men will hardly be corrected, unless they are entertain'd at the same time, and therefore has often Brib'd their Spleen to rid them of their Immoralities and Indecencies, that so being pleas'd to see those of others severely lash'd, they might be perswaded to go a little farther, and find themselves under Correction.</p>
                  <p>He is an Author, so very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that several who are familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, can't easily understand him, and perhaps want leisure or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to study him; and indeed nothing but his extraordinary merit cou'd have induc'd the Translators to undertake him: they thought our <hi>English</hi> World had better take up with an indifferent Translation of such an Author, than want one; and

                  <p>I Borrow'd the subject matter of this Book from the Publick, and I now restore it what it lent me. Indeed having finish'd the whold Work, with the utmost regard to truth, that I was capable of, 'tis but just I should make it this restitution. The world may view here the Picture I have drawn of it from Nature, and if I have hit on any defects, which it agrees with me to be such, it may at leisure correct them. This is what a man ought chiefly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to himself in writing, tho he can't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be sure of success. However, as long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as men distaste Vice so little as they do, we should never give over reproaching them They would perhaps be worse were it not: for censure and reproof, which makes wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preaching of absolute necessity. The Orator and Writer can't stifle the Joy they feel when they are applauded, but they ought to blush in themselves if they aim at nothing more than praise, by their discourses or writings. Besides, that the most certain and least equivocal approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the change of Manners in their Readers or Hearers, we should neither write nor speak but for Instruction; yet we may lawfully rejoyce, if we at the same time please those to whom we address, and

by this means make the truths we should advance, the more insinuating and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiv'd, when any thoughts or reflections slide into a Book which have neither fire, nor turn, or vivacity agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the rest, tho they seem at first to be set there for variety, to divert our minds, and render them more attentive on what is to follow, but otherwise are not proper, sensible, or accommodated to the capacity of the people, whom we must by no means neglect, both the Reader and Author ought to condemn 'em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> This is one rule which I desire every one to remember. There's another which my particular Interest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to request, may not be forgot, that is, always to have my Title in view, and to think as often as this Book is read, that I describe <hi>the Characters, or Manners of the Age</hi>; for though I frequently take 'em from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and men of my own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this so necessary a precaution, the consequences of which 'tis easie enough for any body to penetrate, I must protest against all chagrin complaint, all malicious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53908:9"/>
prejudice and scandal. Men must know how to read and hold their Tongues, or say nothing more or less than they have really read, but this caution will not sometimes be sufficient, unless the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are willing themselves to judge favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Without these conditions, which an exact and scrupulous Author is in the right to require of some people, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Recompence of his Labour, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether he ought to continue writing, if he prefers his private satisfaction to the publick good, and a zeal for promoting Truth. I confess about the year 1690 I was divided between an impatience, to give my Book another Figure, and a better form by new Characters; and a fear lest some people should say, will the Characters never be finisht? shall we never see any thing else from this Author? On one side several men of good sense told me the matter is solid, useful, pleasant, inexhaustible, live a long while, and treat on't without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as long as you live? What can you do better? The follies of Mankind will every year furnish you with a Volume. While o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with a great deal of reason made me apprehend the capriciousness of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the levity of the people, (with whom however I have good cause to be content). These were always suggesting to me, that for these 30 years past, few have read with any other intent than for the sake of reading<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> I in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure took both their Advices, as opposite as they seem to be, and observ'd a medium which disagrees with neither. I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have added any new Remarks to those which already had doubled the bulk of the first Edition of my Book, but that the publick might not be oblig'd to read over what was done before, to come at what has been added since, and that they may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately find out what they would only read, I have taken care to distinguish the 2d aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation by a greater mark, and the first by a less, as well to shew the progress of my Characters, as to guide the Reader in the choice, he might be willing to make. And lest they should be afraid I shall never have done with these additions, I add to all my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, the sincere promise to venture on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of this kind. If any one accuses me with breaking my word, by adding in the sixth Edition a few remarks, I confess inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously I had not the power to suppress 'em.

I know well enough I have offended against the customs of Maxims, which are deliver'd in short and concise terms, like the manner of Oracles.

It is our backwardness to be thought tender, or to shew any emotion at a false subject, where we fancy we are made Cullies? Without naming some grave men, or persons of sound judgments, who think there is as much weakness shewn in Laughing excessively, as in Weeping? What is it that we look for at a Tragedy, Is it to Laugh? Does not truth reign there as lively by its Images, as in a Comedy? And does not the Soul imagine things true in either kind before it suffers itself to be mov'd? Or is it so easie to be pleas'd, that verisimility is not necessary towards it? If not, we must suppose 'tis the natural effect of a good Tragedy, to make us Weep freely in sight of the whole Audience, without any other trouble than drying our Eyes, and wiping our Faces. It being no

In some of his best pieces there are unpardonable faults against the Manners, the Action is embarrast with the declamatory stile, there are such negligences in the Verse and Expression, that we can hardly comprehend how so great a man cou'd be guilty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is above all to be admir'd for his great variety, and the little agreement we find in his designs, amongst the great number of Poems, he compos'd. In <hi>Racine</hi>'s Plays there are more likeness, they lead more to the same thing: But he is even and every where supported, as well in the design and conduct of his pieces, which are just, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, full of good sense, and natural; as for the Versification, which is rich in Rhimes, elegant, numerous, harmonious, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.

Is it not in Eclogues, a fine Wit and a natural simplicity; in familiar Letters and Conversation a great delicacy; or rather is not Wit and Delicacy the Sublime of those Works where they make the Perfection? What is this Sublime, and in what does it consist?</p>
                     <p>Synonyma's are several Dictions or Phrases that signifie the same thing. An Antithesis is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53908:22"/>
the opposition of two Truths, which give light to each other. A Metaphor, or comparison, borrows from a Strange thing, the natural and sensible Image of a True one. An Hyperbole expresses things above Truth, to reclaim the mind, that it may the better understand it. The Sublime paints nothing but the Truth, only in a noble subject it paints it all entire in its causes and effects: 'Tis the Expression or Image most worthy the dignity of the Truth it treats of. Little Wits cannot find the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Expression, and use Synonyma's. Young Men are dazled with the Lustre of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, and generally make use of 'em. True Wits, who would be exact in their images, are for Metaphors and Comparisons.

                     <p>* Every one who would write purely, should put himself in the place of his Readers, examine his own work as a thing that is new to him, which he never read before, where he is not at all concern'd, and the Author must submit to the Critick. He should not suppose another Man will understand his Writings, because he understands 'em him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but forasmuch as they are in themselves really intelligible.</p>
                     <p>An Author should not only endeavour to make himself understood; he must strive to inform us of such things as deserve it. He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53908:22"/>
ought, 'tis true, to have pure Language and a chast Expression; but they ought also to express lively, noble, and solid thoughts, full of good Sense and sound Reason. He prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Chastity and Clearness of Stile, who wastes it on some frivolous, puerile, dull and common subject; having neither Spirit, Fire, nor Novelty. Where the Reader may perhaps easily find out the meaning of the Author; but he is much more certain to be tir'd with his productions.</p>
                     <p>If we aim to be profound in certain Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: if we affect a polite Turn, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too much Delicacy, 'tis meerly for the good opinion we have of our Readers.</p>
                     <p>* We have this disadvantage in reading Books written by Men of Party and Cabal: We seldom meet with the Truth in 'em; Actions are there disguis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He who has the greatest patience must read abundance of hard, injurious reflexions on the gravest men, with whom the Writer has some personal quarrel about a point of Doctrine, or matter of Controversie. These Books are particular in this, that they deserve not the prodigious Sale they find at their first appearance, nor the profound Oblivion that attends 'em after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: When the fury and division of these Authors cease, they are forgotten, like an Almanack out of date.</p>

                     <p>* There are some Artists and skilful men, whose Genius is as vast as the Art or Science they profess: They restore with Interest, by their Contrivance and Invention, what they borrow from its Principals: They frequently break through the rules of Art to ennoble it, and thwart the common roads, if they don't conduct 'em to what is great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. They go alone; they leave their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a long way behind, whilst they are by themselves mounting high, and penetrating far into the secrets of their profession: Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd by their success, and encourag'd by the advantages they draw from their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Whilst men of ordinary, soft and moderate parts, as they can never reach 'em, so they never admire 'em; they can't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and much less imitate 'em. They live peaceably within the compass of their own sphere, aiming at a certain point, which makes the bounds of their insight and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

nothing beyond it: They are at best but the first of a second Class, and excellent in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity.</p>
                     <p>* I may venture to call certain Wits Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or Subaltern, they seem as if they were born only to collect, register and raise Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines out of the productions of other Genius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They ne're think, but tell you what other men have thought: And as the good choice of thoughts proceeds from Invention, having none of their own, they are seldom just in their Collections, but choose rather to make 'em large than excellent. They know nothing of what they learn, and learn what the rest of the World are unwilling to know, a vain and useless Science, neither agreeable or profitable in commerce or conversation: Like false Money, it has no currency, for we are at once surpriz'd with these Coxcombs reading, and tir'd with their company and writings: However, the Great ones and the Vulgar mistake 'em for men of Learning; but Wise men know very well what they are, and rank 'em with the Pedants.</p>

He ought on the contrary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, as he would Destruction, any desire to imitate those who write by humour, who speak from their hearts, which inspires 'em with figures and terms, and draw, if I may say it, from their very Entrails, what they express on their paper.

And this I'm inclin'd to think from the strange

Success of some People whom Fortune only has thrown into Posts, and from whom, till then, no great Matters were expected.</p>
                     <p>How many great Men and extraordinary Genius's are dead without ever being talkt of? And how many are there living that neither are now, nor ever will be talkt of?</p>

                     <p>* 'Tis seldom that one Man of himself, finds out the Merit of another.</p>
                     <p>Men are so employ'd about themselves, that they have not the Leisure to distinguish and penetrate into others; which is the Cause that a great Merit join'd to a great Modesty, may be a long time before it is discover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* There is not in the World so toilsome a Trade, as that of pursuing Fame: Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes before you have gone thro with the rough part of your Labour.</p>
                     <p>* What's to be done with this <hi>Egisippus</hi> who sollicits for an Employment? Shall he have a Post in the Exchequer or in the Army? 'Tis indeed perfectly indifferent, which of 'em he has; nor can any thing but Interest decide it. For he's ev'n as good an Accomptant, as he is a Soldier. Oh! but his Friends say, he's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any thing, that is, He has a Talent for no one thing more than another, and that is in other terms, he's capable of nothing.</p>
                     <p>Thus 'tis with most Men. They bestow their Youth entirely upon themselves. They debauch themselves with Idleness and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and then falsly think when they are Old or Poor, the Commonwealth is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'em; never regarding that important Maxim, which says, That Men ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the first Years of Life to become so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd, that the Commonwealth may have occasion for their Knowledge or Industry. That they ought to resemble those Materials in a Building, which are of absolute Necessity, and which being set there to advantage, give a grace to the whole Fabrick.</p>

This wou'd banish, from Courts Intrigues, Cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ill Offices, Flattery, Corruption and Deceit. This wou'd, of a tempestuous Court, full of Plots and Contrivances, make it to resemble one of the ordinary Representations of the Theatre, where the wise are never but Spectators: This wou'd restore Dignity to the several conditions of Men, and Serenity to their Looks, enlarge their Liberty, and revive in 'em together with the natural Talents, the
<pb facs="tcp:53908:27"/>
habit of Labour and Exercise. This wou'd excite 'em to Emulation, to a Desire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to a Love of Vertue; and instead of vile, unquiet, or lazy Courtiers, burthensome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Commonwealth, wou'd teach 'em Prudence in the Conduct of their Families, or in the Management of their Estates, or make 'em upright Judges, or good Officers, or great Commanders, or Orators, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers; and all the Inconvenience of this to any of 'em wou'd be perhaps to leave their Heirs not so vast an Estate as an excellent Example.</p>
                     <p>* There is occasion for a great deal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution as well as Greatness of Soul to refuse Posts and Employments, and to rest content with retirement and doing nothing.</p>
                     <p>There are few who have Merit enough to play this part well, or know how to pass their leisure hours, without that which the vulgar call business. The Idleness of a Wise Man suffers by that Name. His Meditation, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, Reading, and Repose, deserve rather to be call'd Employment.</p>
                     <p>* A Man of Merit and in Place is never out of humour thro Vanity. The Post that he is in, renders him not so uneasy, as a greater which he thinks he deserves, and which he has not, makes him humble. He may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear sometimes disturb'd, but never haughty or disdainful, who judges of all People by himself.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis a great deal of trouble for a Man of Merit to make his Court assiduously; but not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53908:27"/>
for the reason which some may presently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. He has more Modesty than to think, that he does the least Pleasure to a Prince, to stand constantly in his passage, to post him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self just before him, and make himself taken notice of. He is more apt to fear that he's importunate, and all the Reasons drawn from Custom, and Duty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are hardly sufficient to perswade him to make his appearance. While on the contrary, another who has a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himself, and one, whom the vulgar cry up for a Brisk man, takes a Pride to shew himself, and makes his Court with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confidence, because it cannot enter into his head, that the Great, of whom he is seen every day, shou'd think otherwise of him, than he does of himself.</p>
                     <p>* The Pleasure, which a Man of Honour takes in being conscious to himself of having perform'd his Duty, is a reward which he pays himself for all his pains, and makes him the less to regret the applause, esteem and acknowledgments, which he is sometimes depriv'd of.</p>
                     <p>* If I durst make a Comparison between two conditions of Life vastly different, I wou'd say, that a Man of Courage applys himself to the Execution of his Duty, almost in the same manner, as a Tyler goes about his Work: Neither the one nor the other seeks to expose his Life, so neither of 'em is diverted by Danger. Death is an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that happens in both their Callings, yet is never an Obstacle. The first is not

more vain for having appear'd in the Trenches, mounted a Breach, or forc'd a Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; than the other is, for having climb'd to some desperate height, or to the top of some Steeple.

These Men neither have Ancestors, nor Posterity: Themselves alone compose their whole Race.</p>

                     <p>* The Man that is single and free in the World, if he has any Wit, may raise himself above his Fortune, make a Figure, and keep the best Company: Which is not so easily done, if he's confin'd to a Wife. Marriage seems a Hindrance to all Advancement.</p>
                     <p>* Next to Personal Merit, it must be own'd, that Eminent Dignities and Titles give the greatest Distinction and Lustre to Men, and one that has not all the Learning of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> may hope to be made a Bishop.

He has an Agate for the Handle of his Sword, and on his Finger he wears so large and bright a Diamond, that it dazzles your Eyes to look on't. He wants none of all those curious Toys, which are worn more out of Ostentation than Service; and is as Extravagant in his Dress, as a young fellow that has marry'd a rich Widow.

                     <p>*'TIs seldom that the Merit of a Woman is universally agreed on by both Sexes, because their Interests are extreamly different. The Women are Displeas'd with those very same Beauties in one another, which render them agreeable to the Men. A thousand Charms, which inflame us with the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tender Love, move in them quite contrary passions, Aversion and Malice.</p>
                     <p>* The Greatness of some Women is all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial: It consists in the Motions of their Eyes, the Toss of their Head, a Stately Mien, and a Superficial Wit, that passes on those who understand no better. There is in others an easie, natural Greatness, nothing beholden to Motions, Looks or Gesture, but springs from the Heart, and is the happy consequence of their noble Extraction: Their Merit is not Noisy or Ostentatious, but Solid, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53908:34"/>
shine to all who have but Eyes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern 'em.</p>
                     <p>* I cou'd wish to be a Woman, that is, a Fair and Beautiful Woman, from Thirteen to Two and Twenty; but after that Age, to be a Man again.</p>
                     <p>* Nature has been very kind to some young Ladies, but they are not sensible of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: They Spoil by Affectation, those Gifts which they enjoy by the distinguishing favour of Heaven. The Tone of their Voice, their Mien is not their own: They study, they consult their Glasses, how to Dress themselves as much out of Nature as they can; and 'tis not without a great deal of Trouble, that they are able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves less Agreeable.</p>
                     <p>* If 'tis the Ambition of Women only to appear Handsome in their own Eyes, they are in the right without doubt, to take what course they please to Beautify themselves, and in the choice of their Dress and Ornaments, to follow their own caprice and fancy. But if 'tis the Men whom they wou'd charm, if 'tis for them they Wash and Paint; I have told their votes in that case, and I do assure them from all the Men, or from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part, that, the White and Red they use, make 'em look hideous and frightful; that they hate as much to see Women with Paint on their Faces, as with false Teeth in their Mouths, or Balls to plump out their Cheeks, that they solemnly protest against all Art; which indeed does but make 'em ugly, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53908:35"/>
is the last and infallible means that Heav'n takes to reclaim Men from their Love.</p>
                     <p>If Women were form'd by Nature what they make themselves by Art; if they were to lose in a Minute all the freshness of their their Complexion, and were to have their Faces as thick with Red and Paint, as they lay 'em on, they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* A Coquet is one that is never to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded out of her Inclination, for appearing always agreeable, nor out of the good Opinion she has of her own Beauty. Time and Years she regards as things that wrinkle and decay other Women, but forgets that Age is writ in the Face, and that the same Dress which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her when she was young, does but make her look the older now. Affectation attends her ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n sickness and pain. She dies in a High-head and colour'd Ribbonds.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Coquet laughs at her pretending to Youth, and her wearing those Dresses which do not agree with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Forty. <hi>Lyce</hi> is no less 'tis true; but Years with her have not twelve Months, nor do they add to her Age, that is, she thinks so, and when she looks in the Glass and lays on the Paint on her own Face, and sticks on the Patches, she confesses there is an Age, when 'tis not decent to affect to appear youthful, and that <hi>Clarice</hi> indeed with her Paint and Patches is very ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>* Women when they expect their Lovers, make great preparation in their Dress; but if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53908:35"/>
they are surpriz'd by them in it, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vanish and are seen no more. In the presence of indifferent Persons, what disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they're sensible of, they rectify with ease, and before them make no scruple to adjust themselves, or else disappear for a moment and return drest.</p>
                     <p>* A fine Face is the finest of all Sights, and the sweetest Musick is the Sound of her Voice whom we love.</p>
                     <p>* That a Woman is agreeable depends on Fancy, but Beauty is something more real and independant on inclination and opinion.</p>
                     <p>* There are Women of such perfect Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and such transcendant Merit, that tho 'tis impossible for us not to love 'em, yet we dare not encourage our passion to hope for any greater favour, than that of seeing 'em and conversing with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>em.</p>
                     <p>* A Beautiful Woman that has the qualities of a Man of Honour, is of all the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World the most delicious. In her alone is to be found all the Merit of both Sexes.</p>
                     <p>* Every little, kind accidental thing, that comes from the Fair, is strangely moving and perswasive to the Persons in whose favour 'tis intended. 'Tis not so with the Men; their Caresses, their Words, their Actions, are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and soft and transported, yet are not half so perswading.</p>
                     <p>* Caprice from Women is inseparable, and is the Counter-poison of their Beauty. It prevents the damage which their Beauty
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53908:36"/>
wou'd otherwise do the Men, and cures 'em when no other Remedy will take effect.</p>
                     <p>* Women are engag'd to Men by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they grant 'em. Men are disingag'd by the same Favours.</p>
                     <p>* When a Woman no longer loves a Man, she forgets him so much, as not to remember the favours he has receiv'd from her.</p>
                     <p>* A Woman that has but one Gallant thinks she is no Coquet: She that has more thinks her self but a Coquet.</p>
                     <p>* A Woman may avoid the Reputation of being a Coquet, by a firm engagement to one particular Person, who yet passes for a Fool for having made a bad choice.</p>
                     <p>* An old Gallant is of so little considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he must give way to a new Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a Husband is of so short duration, that a new Gallant justles him out of place.</p>
                     <p>* An old Gallant either fears or despises a new Rival, according to the Character of the Person he serves.</p>
                     <p>An old Gallant often wants nothing, but the name, to be a very Husband. He is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to that circumstance, or else he wou'd have been discarded a thousand times.</p>
                     <p>* Few Intreigues are secret; a great many Women are not better known by their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands names, than by the names of their Gallants.</p>
                     <p>* A Woman of Gallantry is Ambitious of being belov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d; tis enough for a Coquet, that she's thought lovely and desirable. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of one is to make an engagement, of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53908:36"/>
the other to make a Coquest. The first passes successively from one Engagement to another, the second has a great many Amusements on her hands at once. Passion and Pleasure are predominant in one, Vanity and Levity in the other. The gallantry of this proceeds from a weakness in the Heart, or perhaps a vice in Complexion; that the other is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet proceeds from an irregularity of the Mind. The Gallant Lady is fear'd, the Coquet hated. From these two Characters might be form'd a third, which wou'd be the worst in the World.</p>
                     <p>* A weak Woman is one that being guilty of a Fault, reproaches herself more than she's reproacht: Her Heart is in a perpetual War with her Reason. She wou'd fain be cur'd of her folly, but is hardly ever cur'd; at least 'tis very long first.</p>
                     <p>* An Inconstant Woman, is one, that is no longer in Love, a False Woman is one, that is already in Love with another Person. She's Fickle, that neither knows whom she loves, nor whether she loves or no; and she's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different who does not love at all.</p>
                     <p>* Treachery in Women is an Art of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing ev'ry Word and Action, of Managing Oaths and Promises in the best manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; the last of which it costs 'em no more to break, than it did at first to make 'em.</p>
                     <p>* A Faithless Woman, if known for such by the Person concern'd, is but Faithless still: She is Treacherous who when she is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in, proves False.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53908:37"/>This Good we get from the Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Women, that it cures us of our Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy.</p>
                     <p>* Some Women in their Course of Life have a double Engagement to maintain, which to break, or to dissemble is equally difficult; In one there's nothing wanting but the Ceremony of the Church, and in the other nothing but the Heart.</p>
                     <p>* To judge of that Lady by her Beauty, her Youth, her Severity, and her Pride, you wou'd swear none but a Hero cou'd one day succeed with her. At last, she has made her Choice; and what is it? A little Monster, that has not one Grain of Sense.</p>
                     <p>* Women that are past their Prime, seem Naturally to be the Refuge of Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows who have no great Estates. 'Tis their Character at least, if 'tis not their Disposition, tho for my part, I can't tell whose Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is most to be lamented; That of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man advanc'd in Years who stands in need of a Spark; or that of a Spark who stands in need of an Old Woman.</p>

                     <p>* 'Tis strange to see Passions in some VVomen, stronger and more violent than that of their love to Men: I mean Ambition and Play. Such VVomen make the Men chaste, and have nothing of their own Sex but the Cloaths they wear.</p>

                     <p>* Most VVomen have no Principles. They are led by their Passions, and those whom they love form their Manners.</p>
                     <p>* Women exceed the generality of Men in love, but in friendship we have infinitely the advantage.</p>
                     <p>The Men are the occasion, that Women do not love one another.</p>
                     <p>* Mocking is of ill consequence. <hi>Lyce</hi> who is something in years, to make a young Woman appear ridiculous, makes her self so deform'd that she is frightful. To imitate her, she uses such Grimaces, and puts her self in such distorted Figures, that now she's grown so horribly ugly, that the Person whom she mocks, cannot have a better Foil.</p>
                     <p>* In the City, they will have it, that there are Idiots, both Men and Women, who have some Wit: At Court they will have it, that there are abundance of People who really have Wit, yet want a great deal more. These last Criticks will hardly allow a Beautiful Woman to have as much Wit as the rest of her Sex.</p>
                     <p>* A Man is sooner to be trusted with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons secret, than his own. A Woman on the contrary, keeps her own Secret, tho she keeps no bodies else.</p>
                     <p>* Let Love seem never so violently and so entirely to possess the Heart of a young Woman, there's room enough still left for Ambition and Interest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53908:43"/>* There is a time when the richest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to Marry. They seldom let slip an opportunity at first, but it costs 'em a long Repentance. The Reputation of a Fortune, decays as well as Beauty.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, every thing is favourable to the young of that Sex, even the Mens opinion, who are fond of giving 'em all the advantages possible to render 'em still more Desirable.</p>
                     <p>* To how many Women has a great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty been of no service at all, but to make em hope for a great Fortune?</p>
                     <p>* Lovers, who have been ill us'd, have their revenge at last. They commonly see their Mistresses, tho Beautiful, throw away themselves on ugly, old, or undeserving Husbands.</p>
                     <p>* Most Women judge of the Merit and good Mein of a Person, by what impression they make on them, and very rarely allow him either, if they are not sensibly toucht themselves.</p>
                     <p>* He that is in doubt to know what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration his Age has made in him, needs only to consult the Eyes of the Fair One he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to, and the tone of her Voice as she talks with him, and he will learn there what he fears to know! But oh how hard a Lesson!</p>
                     <p>* The Woman that has her Eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly fixt on one particular Person, or whose Eyes you may observe constantly to avoid him; tho they are two different
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53908:44"/>
Motions, they make us conclude but one and the same thing of her.</p>
                     <p>* The Women are not at so little trouble to express what they never feel, as the Men are to Express the real Sentiments of their Heart.</p>
                     <p>* Sometimes it happens that a Woman conceals from a Man the Passion she has for him, while he only feigns the Passion he professes for her.</p>
                     <p>* Is a man suspected of indifference? He returns presently, wou'd any one offer to perswade a Person that he loves her, whom he has no Concernment for? But what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer can he make to this Question? Is it not easier to deceive the Woman who loves you, than her that does not?</p>
                     <p>* A Man by feigning an Inclination may deceive a Woman, but then he must have no real Engagement elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>* A Man for the present rails and curses at a Woman whom he no longer cares for, and quickly forgets the loss of her. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not so outragious for being left, but the Regret lasts a long time.</p>
                     <p>* Idleness is never cur'd in Women but by Vanity or Love. Tho on the contrary in Women of a brisk and sprightly Temper, 'tis the Presage of Love.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis cartain that a Woman who writes with warmth is agitated, tho 'tis not so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that she's truly sensible. A Passion that is sincere and tender, is more likely to be pensive and silent, and for a Woman who is no

                     <p>* <hi>Glycera</hi> does not love her own Sex; she hates their Conversation and their Visits; she orders her self to be deny'd to 'em, often to her very Friends, who are not many: She's reserv'd to 'em, allows of nothing but bare Friendship from 'em, is uneasy with 'em, answers 'em in Monosyllables, and seems to seek all occasions to get rid of 'em. She affects to be alone, and retir'd at her own House. Her Gate is more strictly Guarded, and her Chamber more inaccessible than a Minister of States. Yet there is One that is expected, admitted at all Hours, <hi>Corinna,</hi> who is embrac'd a thousand times, Carest and Whisper'd with, tho they're alone in the Closet, there's such attention given to all she says, that both Ears are hardly suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to hear her discourse.

She is Charming in this Dress, and wants nothing but a little Colour. 'Tis observable tho, that she wears about her a very curious Jewel, which she takes special care to conceal from her Husbands Eyes. Him she Caresses, is fond of, and every day invents some new, pretty Name for him, has no other Bed, but that of her dear Husbands, and wou'd not lye from him for the world. The morning she spends at her <hi>Toilette,</hi> and in writing some necessary Billets. A Servant enters and speaks to her in private: 'Tis <hi>Parmeno,</hi> her Favorite whom she supports in spight of his Masters aversion, and his fellow-servants envy. He deserves it indeed; for who takes a hint sooner, or does a message better? who has a greater Gift of secrecy in those things which are not to be spoken of? who understands how to open a Door with less noise? who is a better Guide up a back pair of Stairs, or who has a more cleaver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance down again the same way?</p>
                     <p>* I cannot understand how a Husband who gives himself up to his own ill humour, and temper, who conceals none of his ill qualities, but on the contrary exposes them all; is covetous, slovenly, surly, rude, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectful and sullen; I cannot conceive, I say, how such a Man can hope to Defend the heart of a young Woman from her Gallants

                     <p>* A Husband seldom has a Rival whom he does not make himself; and whom he does not, as it were, make a Present of to his Wife. He is always praising him before her for his handsomeness, for his fine Teeth. He receives his visits, and encourages his assidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and next to what comes off his own ground, nothing relishes better with him, than the Fowl and Fruit his friend sends him. He makes a Treat, and bids his Guests fall to on such a thing: 'Tis <hi>Leander</hi>'s, says he, and does not cost me any thing but thanks.</p>
                     <p>* There are those Wives, who bury their Husbands before their time: That is, a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with one of those Ladies is not so much as mention'd in the world, 'tis doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a man is alive or no. In the Family he is a Cypher, of no use, except it be to show an example of perfect Submission, Fear and Silence. He has nothing to do with Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Settlement: If 'twere not that he does not lye in, one wou'd almost take him for the Wife, and her for the Husband. They may be a quarter of a year in the house together, without any danger of meeting one another. They live as if they were only Neighbours. He pays the Butcher and Cook, but 'tis my Lady that gives the Treat. They have nothing in common, neither Bed nor Table. They have not so much as the same name: They live after

the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> manner. She has her name, and he his, and 'tis a long time, and not before one is well acquainted with the Language of the Town, that one comes to know at last, that Mr <hi>B.</hi> and Madam <hi>L.</hi> have been Man and Wife this twenty years.</p>
                     <p>* There are some Wives, who if they brought no other Plagues with 'em, are vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enongh to their Husbands upon the account of their great Birth, and Alliances and Fortune; upon the account of their Beauty and Merit, and of that, which some People call <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>* There are few Wives so perfect, who do not give their Husbands cause once a day to repent of their Marriage, or at least to envy a Man that is unmarry'd.</p>
                     <p>* Silent, stupid Grief is out of Fashion. Women now adays are very talkative in their Sorrow. They are so toucht with their Husbands Death, that they do not forget to tell you, and repeat to you every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it.</p>
                     <p>* Is it impossible for a Man to discover the art of making his Wife to love him?</p>
                     <p>* The Woman that is Insensible, is one that has not yet seen the person whom she ought to Love.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Smyrna</hi> there liv'd a young Lady of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Beauty call'd <hi>Emira</hi>; who yet was not more famous for her Beauty, than for the severity of her Manners; and above all, for a strange Indifference that she had for all Men, whom, as she said, she beheld

without any danger, and without any other concernment, than what she felt for her Friends, or her Brothers. She cou'd not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the thousandth part of all the follies, which, she was told, Love had been the cause of; and those which she saw herself, she cou'd not comprehend. Friendship was the only thing she had any notion of, and that she made the first experiment of, in a young and beautiful person of her own Sex: She found in her friendship, something so very soft and pleasing, that her only Study was how to continue it; never imagining that any other Inclination cou'd arise, which shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Her discourse was only of <hi>Euphrosina,</hi> which was the name of that faithful friend, and the discourse of all <hi>Smyrna,</hi> was only of <hi>Euphrosina</hi> and her. Their Friendship became a Proverb. <hi>Emira</hi> had two Brothers, both so young and so handsome, that all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that City were in love with 'em, and whom she lov'd herself, as became a Sister. One of the Priests of <hi>Iupiter</hi> had access to her Fathers house, and being ravisht with her Beauty, ventur'd to declare his Passion to her, but came off only with Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. An old man, who relying on his great Birth and Estate, had the same assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, met with the same success. She Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs on this; she was surrounded by her Brothers, a Priest, and an Old Man, and cou'd boast herself Insensible; but these were

Of three Lovers, whom her Charms had gain'd her, one after another, and all whose Passions she was not afraid to see and to slight, the first in an Amorous Transport stabb'd himself at her feet, the second in Despair of ever succeeding, wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The man that was to revenge all these, had not yet appear'd. The old Spark, who was so unfortunate in his Amours, was cur'd at length, by reflecting on his Age, and on the character of the person, to whom he had made his Addresses. However, he was desirous to visit her sometimes, and had her Permission. One day, he carry'd along with him his Son, a Youth of a most agreeable Aspect, and of a noble Mein: She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him with some Interest more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but observing him very silent, as he was, in the presence of his Father, she made a judgment of his Wit from thence not much to his advantage. She cou'd have wisht he had had more. He saw her afterwards alone, and then he talkt to her sufficiently, and wittily too; but when he regarded her less, and talkt to her less about her self and her Beauty, than she expected, she was surpriz'd, and had, as it were, some indignation, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53908:47"/>
a Man who was so well made, and had so much Wit, shou'd be so little Gallant. Her Friend had exprest a Desire to see him, and was in company when she entertain'd him; that was the reason. 'Twas for <hi>Euphrosina</hi> alone that he had Eyes, and her Beauty alone which he commended. This made <hi>Emira,</hi> from being Indifferent, to become Jealous; and then she perceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, that <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of what he said; and that he not only was capable of Gallantry, but of Tenderness. From that time she is more reserv'd to her friend, yet desirous to see 'em together once more. The second Interview more than sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd her in all her fears, her doubt was turn'd into certainty. She now flyes from <hi>Euphrosina,</hi> no longer knows that Merit which charm'd her before, she loses all relish of her conversation, she loves her no longer; and this alteration made her sensible that 'twas Love, which in her heart, had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the place of friendship. <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> and <hi>Euphrosina</hi> see one another every day. They love mutually; they agree to marry: They are marry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d. The news is spread about the Town, and People publish it the more for the rarity of it, that two persons who Love so well, shou'd be blest in Enjoyment. <hi>Emira</hi> hears of it, and is all enrag'd, she feels then to what height her Passion was grown. She seeks out <hi>Euphrosina</hi> again, only for the pleasure of one sight of <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> but that young Husband has not yet quitted the Lover: in a new Wife he finds all the Charms of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53908:48"/>
Mistriss, which makes him that he cannot look on <hi>Emira,</hi> but as on the friend of her that's dear to him. This compleats the poor Lady's misfortune. She can take no rest, refuses all sustenance, her Body grows weak, and her Mind disturb'd. She mistakes her Brother for <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> and speaks to him as to a Lover. She recollects her self, and blushes for her Distraction, yet relapses into greater, which she does not blush for. She knows not what she does. Then is she apprehensive of Men, when 'tis too late. 'Tis her Folly now. She has her Intervals of Reason; but 'tis of Reason that she most complains. In this condition she lyes so sad and miserable, that the Youth of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who before had seen her so proud and insensible, now think Heaven has punisht her but too severely.</p>

                     <p>* There may be a Friendship between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of different Sexes, which may subsist without Enjoyment; yet a Woman will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look upon a Man as a Man, and so will a Man still look upon a Woman as a Woman. This Engagement is neither Love, nor pure Friendship. 'Tis something of another kind.</p>
                     <p>* Love seizes on us suddenly, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us time to consider, and our Disposition, or our Weakness favours the Surprize. One Look, one Glance from the Fair fixes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins us. Friendship on the contrary is a long time in forming, and that by degrees, by a long Acquaintance and Familiarity. How much Wit, good Nature, Affection? how many good Offices and Civilities are there among Friends to do that in many years, which sometimes a fair Face, or a fair Hand does in a minute?</p>
                     <p>* Friendship the older it grows, is the stronger; Love is the weaker for its Age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53908:49"/>* Love, as long as it does last, subsists of itself; and sometimes subsists by those very means, which shou'd seem rather to extinguish it; Severity, Cruelty, Absence, Jealousy. Friendship, on the contrary, stands in need of all helps, Care, Confidence, and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance. If 'tis not supply'd with these it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</p>
                     <p>*'Tis not so hard to meet with Love in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, as with perfect Friendship.</p>
                     <p>* Love and Friendship exclude one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>* He that has had Experience of a great and violent Love neglects Friendship; and he that has consum'd all his Passion upon Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is nothing advanc'd towards Love.</p>
                     <p>* Love alone begets Love. We commence but languishing Lovers, when we have but just quitted the dearest and most affectionate Friendship.</p>
                     <p>* Nothing more resembles the strongest Friendship, than those Engagements which we make for the Interest and Security of our Love.</p>
                     <p>* We never Love heartily but once, and that's the first time we love. The Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that succeed are more at our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p>* Sudden Love is longest to be cur'd.</p>
                     <p>* Love, that grows slowly and leisurely, is too like Friendship ever to be a violent Passion.</p>
                     <p>* He who loves to that degree, that he wishes he were able to love a thousand times
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53908:49"/>
more than he does, yields in Love to None, but to Him, who loves more than he wishes for.</p>
                     <p>* If I shou'd grant, that 'tis possible for those who are transported with a great and violent Passion, to love one another better than themselves. Who shou'd I most oblige? They that love, or they that are belov'd?</p>
                     <p>* Men are sometimes inclinable enough to be in Love, but can't succeed in their Desire. They seek all Occasions of being conquer'd, but escape still, for which reason 'tis, if I may be allow'd the Expression, that they are bound to continue free.</p>
                     <p>* The couple who love too violently at first, contribute each of 'em, to their loving one another less in a short time, and at length to their hating one another. Who has the greatest share in this Rupture, the Man or the Woman, is not easily to be decided. The Women accuse the Men of being wild and roving; and the Men say, they are false and inconstant.</p>
                     <p>* As nice as we are in Love, we pardon more Faults in Love, than in Friendship.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis a Revenge sweet to a Man that loves passionately, by all his Conduct and Carriage to an ungrateful Mistris, to make her appear extreamly ungrateful.</p>
                     <p>'Tis but an unpleasant thing to Love, when we have not a Fortune great enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those we love, as happy as they themselves can desire.</p>

                     <p>* When we are very grateful, 'tis a sign that we have a great Inclination and Affection for the person that has oblig'd us.</p>
                     <p>* To be but in the company of those we love, satisfies us: it does not signify whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we speak to 'em or not, whether we think on them or on indifferent things. To be near 'em is all.</p>
                     <p>* Hatred is not so remote from Friendship as Antipathy.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis more common to see People pass from Antipathy to Love, than from that to Friendship.</p>
                     <p>* We make a Confidence of our secret in Friendship, but in Love it escapes from us.</p>
                     <p>'Tis possible to have some People's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and yet not to have their Hearts. But he who has the Heart has no need of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, every thing is open to him.</p>
                     <p>In Friendship we only see those Faults which may be prejudicial to our Friends. In those we love we see no Faults, but those by which we suffer our selves.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the first Disgust in Love only, as well as the first Fault in Friendship, which we are able to make a good use of.</p>
                     <p>* If a Suspicion that is unjust, fantastical and groundless, has been call'd Jealousy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that Jealousy, which is a sentiment

                     <p>'Tis not always a great passion that is the cause of Jealousy, our natural temper has some share in it, yet 'tis a Paradox for a violent Love to be without Delicacy.</p>

                     <p>Those Women, who while they are not at the pains of dissembling with us, are not sparing to give us all occasions of Jealousy, don't indeed deserve our Jealousy, if we had the power to regulate our selves, more by their Sentiments and Conduct, than by our own Affections.</p>
                     <p>* The coldnesses and disorders which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Friendship, have their causes. In Love there's hardly any other reason for our ceasing to love, but that we are too well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis no more in our power to love always, than 'tis not to love sometimes.</p>
                     <p>* Love receives its Deaths Wound from Disgust, and is bury'd by Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>* We are sensible of the Beginning and Decline of Love, by the Impatience we have to be alone.</p>
                     <p>* To cease from loving, is a sensible proof, that Man is limited, and that the Heart has its bounds.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a Weakness to love. 'Tis sometimes another Weakness to attempt the cure of it.</p>

                     <p>* When an ugly Woman is belov'd, it must certainly be very deperately; for either it must proceed from a strange weakness in her Lover, or from some more secret and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible charms, than those of her Beauty.</p>
                     <p>* Visits amongst Lovers are made for a good while out of custom and ceremony, to profess they love, by words, when 't has been a long time that their Actions and Manners have declar'd the contrary.</p>
                     <p>* Wou'd you endeavour to forget any one, 'tis the certain course to think on nothing else. Love has this in common with Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that 'tis exasperated by the Reflections, which are us'd to free us from it. If 'twere Practicable there's nothing necessary to weaken our Passion, but never to think on't.</p>
                     <p>* We wou'd have it in our power, that those whom we love might receive all their good, or else all their ill fortune from our Hands.</p>

                     <p>He's fit to receive, who is toucht with as delicate a pleasure in accepting, as his friend is sensible of in giving.</p>
                     <p>* To give is to act. We are not to be passive in the case, to have our benefits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from us, by the importunity or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of our Petitioners.</p>
                     <p>* If at any time we have been liberal to those we love, whatever happens afterwards, we ought by no means to reflect on our benefits.</p>
                     <p>* It has been said in <hi>Latin,</hi> that is costs less to hate than to love, or if you will, that friendship is more chargeable than hatred. 'Tis true, we are excus'd from liberality to our Enemies, but is a man at no cost to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himself? Or if 'tis so sweet and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to do ill to those we hate, is it less pleasing or less natural to do good to those we love? Wou'd it not be difficult and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to us not to do so?</p>
                     <p>* There is a pleasure to meet the Eyes of a person that we have lately oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* Liberality consists not so much in giving a great deal, as in giving prudently.</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53908:52"/>* If 'tis true, that in our pity and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion we have a regard to our selves, as we are apprehensive of being some time or other in the same circumstances with the miserable, how comes it about then, that in their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we so seldom relieve 'em?</p>
                     <p>* Tis better to expose our selves to Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, than to be wanting to the miserable.</p>
                     <p>* Experience confirms it every Day. That our indulgence to our selves, and hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to others, are but one and the same vice.</p>
                     <p>The churlish, moyling, laborious man, that shews no mercy to himself, is not to be made indulgent to others, but by an excess of reason.</p>
                     <p>* Tho the charge of maintaining an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent person, may be very burthensom to us; yet we cannot heartily relish the new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which put him out of our prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In the same manner the pleasure which we take in the exaltation of our friend, is something abated, by a little sort of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we have, to see him mounted above us, or in an equal condition with us. Thus we agree but ill with our selves. We wou'd have others dependant on us, but to cost us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We wou'd have our friends prosperous in the World, yet when their good fortune comes, perhaps we're the last to rejoyce at it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis nothing for people to make invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their House and Table, to make liberal offers of their fortune and services. To be as good as their word is all.</p>

                     <p>* When we have done all that's possible to gain some sort of people, and we find it in vain, there's one Reserve still left, which is, ev'n to let 'em alone for the future.</p>
                     <p>* To live with our Enemies in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if they shou'd one day be our Friends, and to live with our Friends as if they shou'd some time or other become our Enemies, is at once against the nature of Hatred, and the rules of Friendship. It may be a good Maxim in Politicks, but 'tis a very bad one in Morality.</p>
                     <p>* We ought not to make those our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who being better known, we may be glad to have in the number of our Friends. We ought to make choice of persons of such Honour for our Friends, as if they shou'd ever cease to be so, will not abuse our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, nor give us cause to fear 'em for Enemies.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis extremely pleasant to frequent our Friends, when we do it from Inclination and Esteem, but 'tis painful and troublesome to cultivate Friendship out of Interest. 'Tis solliciting.</p>

'Tis natural to desire it very much, but to take little pains to procure it: To think, in short, we deserve it without seeking for it.</p>
                     <p>* He that knows how to wait for what he desires, takes the course not to be excessively griev'd, if he chances to go without it. He, on the contrary, who desires a thing too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, thinks the success, when it comes, cannot recompence him for all the pains he has been at about it.</p>

                     <p>* It goes to the Heart of a haughty and proud Man, to forgive one that has taken him in a fault, and whom he knows has reason on his side. His Pride is never satisfy'd, till he has regain'd the Advantage he has lost, and made the other acknowledge himself in the wrong.</p>
                     <p>Just in the same manner, as we grow more and more endearing to the persons that oblige us, so do we more and more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate those whom we have extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>

To seat himself next him, and in a posture of too great freedom, to pluck him by the Sleeve, to tread upon his Heals: in fine, to affect to be thus familiar, and to take these sorts of liberties with him, are signs of a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb rather than a Favourite.</p>

                     <p>'TIS a silly Character to have none at all.</p>
                     <p>*'Tis a Fool's part to be troublesome. A Wise man knows when he is agreeable or vexatious, and will not tarry long enough to make any one weary of him.</p>
                     <p>* Buffoons are a sort of Insects which breed in all Countries; we can scarce step for fear of treading on 'em. A pleasant man is rarely to be met with; and a person tho he is born so, must have a great deal of Delicacy to maintain the character a long time: But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he that makes one laugh is not sure to be esteem'd.</p>
                     <p>* There are abundance of obscene, a great many more railing and satyrical Wits, but very few delicate. A Man must have manners and politeness to trifle with a good grace, and a copious fancy to play handsomely on little things, to create matter of raillery, and make something out of nothing.</p>
                     <p>* If we were to listen with attention to every thing that is said in common Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53908:56"/>
we should be asham'd to speak or to hear. We shou'd perhaps condemn our selves to a perpetual silence, which is more injurious to Commerce than unprofitable discourses: we must therefore accommodate our selves to every Mans capacity; we must suffer as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Evils, false News, rambling Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Government, or the Interest of Princes: we must hear with patience the fine notions some men are continually repeating; and permit <hi>Aronce</hi> to speak Proverbs, and <hi>Melinda</hi> to talk of herself, her Vapours, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and Want of Rest.</p>
                     <p>* In the company we keep, we shall often meet with persons who offend us with their ridiculous Jargon, the Novelty and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their Terms and their quaint Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which come from no bodys mouth but their own, and were not design'd by the first Inventors to signifie what they use 'em for. They observe neither reason nor cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, but speak according to their foolish Whimsies, are always fond of Pleasantry, and affect to distinguish themselves by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cant, which becomes at length their Natural Idiom: They speak in a counterfeit tone, and accompany their words with odd gestures and grimaces. However, they are well contended with themselves, and their Wit, which they imagine very diverting. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we can't say they are entirely destitute; but we pity 'em for what little Wit they have, and believe if they had none at all, they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53908:57"/>* Prithee <hi>Acis,</hi> for the satisfaction of your friends, endeavour to speak as they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand you, for my part I do but guess at your meaning: If you would tell 'em 'tis cold, that it rains and snows; say 'tis cold, it rains, and it snows. If you see 'em in good health, and would congratulate 'em upon it, tell 'em they look well: Oh! but say you, that is so plain, and so conspicuous, any one might have said as much. 'Tis true, and what does that signify? besides, what harm is there, Sir, in being intelligible, or speaking like your Neighbours. There is one thing <hi>Acis,</hi> which you and some Gentlemen of your Complexion want very much; I know I shall surprize you, but there's certainly one thing wanting in you, which is Wit: tho this is not all, there is something too abounding in you, and that is the good opinion you have of your self, above other Men. This is the Fountain of all your pompous fustian, your big words, and your perplext phrases. The next time I find you do so, I shall pluck you by your Sleeve, and tell you in your Ear: Don't fancy you have Wit; 'tis a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake: your part is inconsistent with it; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you can, learn some plain unaffected Language, such as those speak who you fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have no Wit, and then, perhaps, we may think you have some your self.</p>
                     <p>* Who that keeps much company can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself to avoid meeting certain vain Blockheads, who are light, familiar and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. These are the Speaking Men in all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53908:57"/>
Conversation, and they compel every one else to hear them. They are heard in the Antichamber. They enter without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: They continue their Tales with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration for such as come in, or go out, or for the rank or quality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who make up the Company. They silence him that dares to begin a piece of News, that they may tell it after thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had it of <hi>Zamet, Raccelay,</hi> or <hi>Conchini,</hi> whom they name fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly without their Title, tho they never knew 'em, or spoke to 'em in their Lives: They get themselves up sometimes to the best Man in the Company, to gratify him with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, which no body else knows. They whisper it, and for a world will suffer none but him to partake on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are some things they must not tell, and some persons whom they cannot name: Their words are engag'd to the contrary, 'tis a mystery, a secret of the last importance. Shou'd you ask it, you wou'd demand an impossibility; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you imagine, they are equally ignorant of both persons and actions.</p>
                     <p>* As we ought not to be backward in speaking, or to abstract our minds from the subject of the conversation we are in, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

attention to the least trifles, that are said in company, to improve 'em, to banter 'em, to discover in 'em a mystery which the rest could not perceive, to make 'em subtle and politick, only that we may have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to shew our own policy and subtilty.</p>
                     <p>* Some Men think th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they tell a piece of News, 'tis meerly for the honour of telling it, and to shew they can come off handsomly. It grows a Romance under their management: they make their men think after their own manner; put their own trivial expressions in their mouths, and they are all like themselves very talkative. They fall at last into Parentheses, which may pass for Epicodes, but that they have no relation to the story; and by this means the Speakers and their Hearers forget what they were about. What a terrible confusion must then attend 'em, shou'd not some body come in luckily to break up the Company, and put an end to the Narration.</p>

for what he says, than the tone he speaks with. He is never out of an extream hurry, but to stutter out some of his own follies and vanities. He has so little consideration for the time, the persons, or decency, that each has his share of his Entertainment, tho he gives no attention to what he says. In short, he never sits down be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Table spread he is the first in his place, and always at the upper end. The Ladies at his right and left, he eats, he drinks, talks, and interrupts; he has no respect for the Master or his Guests; but abuses the toleration they give him. Whoever makes the Feast, he has all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Table: and 'tis more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to give him his way, than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute it with him. Eating and drinking add nothing to his Character. If he plays he wins, and banters the unfortunate, till they are offended. The langhable Men are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on his side, and there is no sort of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which escapes 'em. I must confess I am surfeited with his company, and despair of being able to endure <hi>Theodectus</hi> above a minute, or those who suffer him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Troilus</hi> is very useful to such as have too much Riches: He eases them of the trouble of their superfluities; and saves 'em the labour of hoarding up Money, making Contracts, locking Coffers, carrying the Keys, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Domestick Thief. He assists them in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53908:59"/>
their pleasures, and in time becomes service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to 'em in their passions. He is the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the house, he triumphs in his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he sets every one his task, he hears and decides. He says to this Slave he shall be punish'd, and he is whipt; to another he shall be freed, and he is set at liberty. His Creatures are very demure in his presence, they dare not Laugh for fear of offending him, and then they are dismist: And it goes well with the Master of the House if he leaves him his Wife and Children. If he is at the Table, and says such a dish is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the Master and his Guests govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by his Palat, are of his opinion, and fall to heartily. If he says on the contrary of other Meats they are Insipid, whoever were eating it spit it out, and dare not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it without <hi>Troilus</hi> approbation. Every Eye is on him, observing his looks and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, before he pronounces sentence on the Wine or Victuals before him. He seldom stirs out of the Family where he is Director; there he eats, drinks, sleeps and digests, quarrels with the Grooms and Valets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with the Work-men, and sends back the Creditors. He swells and domineers in the Great Hall, receives there the Homages of those Servants who are more subtle than their fellows, and by his mediation alone come at their Master. If a person enters whose mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune 'tis to have a complexion disagreeable to his humour, he frowns, turns away his Head; if he comes up to him he sits still; if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53908:59"/>
he sits down, he removes himself farther off; if he talks, he is mute; if he continues to talk, <hi>Troilus</hi> gets up into his Chamber: if he follows, he makes to the Stair-case, leaps down Stairs, or gets out at a Window, rather than associate with a Man whose face or voice he dislikes. He is himself happy in both, and they serve to insinuate, and win upon such as he has occasion of. Every thing at last is below him, and he scorns to preserve his favour, by the little ways he acquir'd it. He sometimes sallies out of his Meditation and Silence to contradict, and to shew his Wit condescends to be a Critick. Instead of expecting he shou'd hearken to you in his turn, or be complaisant, and commend your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You are not always sure he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your approbation, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* There is a certain Spark who never fails to be at all Cavalcades, publick Feasts and Sights; he is careful to make himself known and where-ever he stands seldom gives himself the trouble to inquire if the company have heard of him, but presently acquaints them with his Name, his Seat, his Country, his Estate, his Offices, his own and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Family, his Relations, and the Arms of his House: They must understand that he is Noble, that he has a Castle, fine Furniture, Retinue and a Coach.</p>
                     <p>Some Men speak before they think, others study heavily on every thing they say; we must stay for these till they are deliver'd of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53908:60"/>
their Notions, and assist at the Travail of their minds:<note place="margin">A sort of people who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They call themselves <hi>Puriets,</hi> and will not venture the least word where it has not all the fine effect imaginable; yet nothing comes from them easy or happy: they talk properly perhaps, but they are very tiresome.</p>
                     <p>* The Wit of conversation consists more in finding it in others than shewing a great deal your self. He who goes out of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany pleas'd with his own facetiousness and ingenuity, will the sooner come into it again. Most men had rather please than admire you, and seek less to be instructed and diverted, than approv'd and applauded; and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the most delicate sort of pleasure to please another.</p>
                     <p>* Too much fancy is not necessary in our conversation or writings; it begets vain and puerile Ideas which tend neither to make us wiser or better. Our thoughts shou'd be produc'd by good sense and right reason, and ought always to be the effect of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis a sad thing when Men have neither Wit enough to speak well, nor Sense enough to hold their tongues: this is the foundation of all impertinence.</p>
                     <p>* To speak modestly on a good or bad sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to give the true reason for its being so requires good sense, and a happy expression. 'Tis a much more ready way to pronounce
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53908:60"/>
in the decisive tone, that this thing is execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or that wonderful.</p>
                     <p>* There is nothing more displeasing to God or Man, than confirming the least things that are said in common conversation by horrid Oaths and Imprecations. An honest Man, who says Yes or No, deserves sooner to be believed; his reputation swears for him, gets him credit, and draws him all manner of confidence.</p>
                     <p>* He who says boldly he is a Man of Truth and Honour, that he wrongs no Man, but wishes the Ills he has done others may fall upon himself, and swears that it may be believed; does not know even how to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit an Honest Man.</p>
                     <p>An honest Man with all his sincerity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder some People saying of him, what a dishonest Man cou'd say of himself.</p>
                     <p>* <hi>Cleon</hi> talks uncivilly or unjustly, I am sure 'tis one or the other; but he says he can't help it, he was born so, and speaks as he thinks.</p>
                     <p>* Some men talk well, easily, justly, and to the purpose: those offend in the last kind, who speak of the Banqnets they are to be at, before such as are reduc'd to spare their Bread; of sound Limbs, before the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, the person who talks at this rate, has fifty thousand Livres a year Rent, and thinks he has not half what he deserves; he taxes you, prizes you, settles your Expence; and if he judges you worthy of a better fortune, or even what he himself aspires to, he can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Property of this Vice, founded on Riches, Posts, Credit and useless Sciences, without personal Merit or solid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

obliges one equally to despise those who are below us in Fortune, and to over-value those whose Circumstances exceed our own.</p>
                     <p>* There are some filthy Souls fed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiness and Ordure, who are inflam'd by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Gain, as great Souls are fir'd by Glory and Vertue. They taste no pleasure in any thing but getting and never losing; are covetous and nice even to the last penny, busied wholly about their Debtors, restless in making Abatements, or in railing against the Money, lost and immerg'd in Writings, Parchments, Titles and Covenants. These People are neither Relations, Friends, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Christians, or perhaps Men, but they have Silver and Gold in abundance.</p>
                     <p>* Let us first except those noble and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Souls, if there are any of this kind in being, who are helpful to such as are in want, who make use only of their Ingenuity to grow rich, whom no Cares, Disproportions, or Malice can separate from those they once chose for their Friends: And let us after this pronounce a Truth, sad and doleful to be imagin'd. There's not a Man in the World whom Love, Inclination, and a long Society, have engaged to us; who has offered us a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Services, and sometimes given us a part of 'em that has not yet in himself by the ties of his Interest a Disposition to break with us, and become our Enemy.</p>

                     <p>* Marriage, which ought to be the fountain of all good things, is often by the Disposition of Mens Fortunes, a heavy Load that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses 'em with its weight.

                     <p>* The Character of one who would be an Heir, is to be found amongst the Complaisant; we are never better flatter'd, better obey'd, more follow'd, more courted, more attended, and more carest, than by the Persons who hope to get by our Deaths, and wish they may happen quickly.</p>
                     <p>* All Men by different Posts, Titles and Successions, look on themselves as one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Heirs: And for this reason are ever breeding a Secret desire for each others Deaths. He is the happiest Man in each

Condition who has more to leave to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor by his Death, than he can expect by the Decease of another.</p>

'Tis like Discord in Musick, like Colours ill sorted, like Oaths that offend the Ear, or Sounds and Noises, which Jar, and are ungrateful. In a word, 'tis overturning all Order and Decency. If any one tells me 'tis the practice of all the West, I answer, 'tis perhaps one of those things which render us Barbarous to the other part of the World: What the Eastern People, who come this way, remark of us in their Journals; and I question not but they are as much disgusted with this excess of Familiarity, as we are shock'd with their <hi>Zombaye</hi>

                     <p>* A Room of State, or a Chamber of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in capital Cases, shews nothing so serious and grave as a Table of Gamesters playing for high Stakes: A melancholly Severity reigns in their Looks, implacable towards one another, and irreconcilable Enemies, while the Meeting lasts. They consider neither Friendship, Alliances, Birth nor Distinctions: Chance alone, that blind and wild Divinity, presides over the Circle, and desides Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly there on all Occasions. They all adore her by a profound Silence and an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53908:79"/>
they can never observe elsewhere: all the passions seem suspended a while to give place to one of them; the Courtier is at this time neither sweet, flattering, complaisant, nor even devout.</p>
                     <p>* We can't perceive in those persons who have risen by Play and Gain the least trace of their former condition by their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they lose sight of their Equals, and asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with persons of the first quality: 'Tis t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Rooks have continually their Emissaries abroad to learn who comes laden from the Country with the price of an Estate lately sold; who has got a Suit at Law which has brought him in a great Sum; who has been successful at play; what Heir has leapt into a large Inheritance; what Officer will venture his whole Cash on the turn of a Card. 'Tis true 'tis a filthy rascally Trade, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that deals with them are sure to be cheated; but 'tis a Trade, well known, very antient, and a long while practic'd by the Men we call Gamesters.

                     <p>* We see frequently in certain Families what we call the Caprice of Fortune: for a hundred years they are never talkt on, as if they were not in being, till Heaven at once opens it self in their favour, and showres down on 'em from all quarters Honours, Dignities, and Stations, and they swim in prosperity.</p>

They have 'em in common with Persons of the first Quality; we see 'em in their Windows, in their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, on the Gates of their Castle, on the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of their Seat of Justice, where many a Man is condemned to be hang'd, who only deserv'd Banishment. You see 'em on their Moveables and Immoveables; they are sown up and down on their Coaches, and their Liveries are as remarkable as their Arms. But to be plain, with the <hi>Sannions,</hi> they should have had a little Patience to have tarry'd till the next Age, for in this their Folly appears too palpable, and in a few years those who knew their Grand-father must follow him to the Grave: They are old, they can't live long, and who then would be able to say, There he kept his Stall, and sold his Goods very dear.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sannions</hi> and the <hi>Crispins</hi> had rather be thought extravagant than covetous: They tell you a long Story of a Feast or Collation they made at one time; the Money they lost at Play at another, and are very angry at any one who they suppose have not had the same ill Success. They speak in their mysterious Jargon of the Ladies of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; they have ever a thousand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53908:85"/>
things to tell each other, and are always making new Discoveries, passing amongst themselves for Men of very much Intrigue. One of 'em coming late from the Country, goes to Bed, gets up in the Morning, puts on his riding Accoutrements, adorns himself with Ribbons, ties back his Hair, takes his Fuzee, and passes for a Sports-man. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns at night wet and weary, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Game, tries again on the Morrow, and in this manner passes every day in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Thrushes</hi> and <hi>Partridges.</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53908:85"/>
the Dogs at the Death of the Game. But the Clock strikes, and he has no more time to talk of his Hounds, or the Fallow Deer: He must then to his Seat, where with the rest, he is to administer Justice.</p>

We scarce know in the Isle that <hi>Andreus</hi> makes a figure, and scatters his Patrimony in the <hi>Marais.</hi> If it were at least known in the City and Suburbs, perhaps amongst so great a number of Citizens, who are seldom in the right, there might one of them be mistaken in his Extravagance, and tell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that he is <hi>Magnificent,</hi> or give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Banquets he made for <hi>Xantus</hi> and <hi>Ariston,</hi> or the feasts he gave <hi>Elemira</hi>; but he ruins himself obscurely, and hastens to Poverty for the sake of two or three Persons, who have not the least esteem for him; and though he rides at present in a Coach, in six
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53908:86"/>
months you'll see he will not have Means enough left to go handsomly afoot.</p>
                     <p>* <hi>Narcissus</hi> rises in the Morning to lye down at Night, is six hours in his Dressing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, and as regular as the Ladies in going every day to Morning and Evening-Prayer. He is good company, and serves to make a third man at Ombre. He sits four hours together at <hi>Aricia</hi>'s, and loses five or six Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoles anight. He reads exactly the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gazzette, <hi>Barbin</hi>'s Novels, and the <hi>Mercure Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</hi> He has read <hi>Bergerac, Du Marets Lescla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and some Collections of Poetry; he walks with the Ladies in the Park or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. He is religiously punctual in his Visits: He will do the same to morrow, which he has done to day, and did yesterday. Thus he lives, and in this manner he will die.</p>
                     <p>* There is a Man, say you, I have seen somewhere, and though I have forget where, I remember very well his Face. There are a great many others who do so too; and if possible, I'll in this assist your Memory. Was it on the Drawbridge, or on the Bastion, in the Park, or in a Box at the Play-house? Was it at a Sermon, at a Ball, or at <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouillets,</hi> or can you tell where you mist him? Where is he not to be met with? At a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Execution, or Fireworks, he appears in a Balcony; if there is a magnificent Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, you see him on a Scaffold; if the King receives an Ambassador, he sees the Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, assists at the Audience, ranges himself with the Masters of the Ceremonies, and his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53908:86"/>
presence is as essential at administring the Oaths to the <hi>Swiss</hi> Allies, as that of the Lord-Chancellor or Plenipotentiaries. 'Tis his Picture that in the Almanacks represents the People, and their Assemblies. He is at every Hunting Match; at every Review you see him on Horseback amongst the Officers; he has a great Passion for War, Troops and Militia. He has been as far as the Fort of <hi>Bernardi,</hi> to make a Campaign. <hi>Chanley</hi> understands Marches, <hi>Iacquier,</hi> Provisions, <hi>Du Meitz</hi> the Artillery. He is the Spectator of their Professions, he has seen 'em all, and is grown old with seeing. He does nothing that a Man ought to do; he knows nothing that a Man ought to know. But he boasts he has seen every thing that was to be seen, and now he shall die in Peace: Who then will like him inform us that the Park-Gates are shut, that the Meads are marshy, and one can no longer walk there? Who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim when there is a Consort, where a good Lecture, or a great Fair? Who will tell us <hi>Beaumevielle</hi> is dead, that <hi>Rochois</hi> has a Cold, and cannot sing this eight days? Who will distinguish so well an Alderman by his Arms and Liveries? Who will acquaint us that <hi>Scapin</hi> bears the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi>; or who, in short, will be more edifying? Who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with greater Vanity and Affectation the Names and Titles of some new dignify'd Citizen, or be better furnish'd with Ballads and Madrigals? Who will then lend the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the Gentleman's Journals, and the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53908:87"/>
Miscellanies? Who will sing at their Tables a whole Dialogue of an Opera, or the Deeds of <hi>Roland</hi> in one of their Apartments? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, since there is in the City as well as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, a great many dull, lazy, ignorant, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Blockheads, why should we so readily agree with them in every thing?</p>
                     <p>* <hi>Theramenes</hi> was rich, and had Merit; he was afterwards an Heir, and had then more Riches, and a great deal more Merit. The Women of the City courted him for a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and their Daughters for a Husband. He here oppos'd himself to the Cap of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and there disputed with the Knights and Gentlemen, who would force 'em from his Interests. A gay, a lively and witty young Man could not be more passionately lov'd, nor better receiv'd. His Chariot waited at their Doors, he entred with them into the Park; every thing was free for him, to the entire Defeat of a thousand Rivals. How many hopeful Matches has he ruin'd? And how could he satisfy so many People who were obliged to make him account for his Actions? He was not only the Terror of the Husbands, but the Dread of all such as desir'd to be so, and who expected from Marriage to make up their broken Fortunes. A Man so happy, and so full of Money, ought to be banish'd from a well-govern'd City; and the fair Sex should be forbidden, on pain of Folly and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, to treat him better than if he were a Person who had nothing but Merit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him.</p>

The Pewter and Brass in those days shone on their Shelves and Cupboards, the Copper and Iron in their Chimnies, whilst the Silver and Gold lay safe in their Coffers. Women were then serv'd by Women, they had such to do their Offices even in their Kitchens. The fine Names of Governor and Governante were unknown to our Forefathers; they knew to whom the Children of great Princes were confided, but they divided the service of their Domesticks with their Children, and were content to be themselves their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Tutors. Every thing they did agreed with their circumstances, their Expences were proportion'd to their Receipt, their Liveries, their Equipages, their Houshold Goods, their Tables, their City and Country Houses, were all measur'd by their Revenues and their Condition. They had however those outward distinctions amongst themselves that 'twas easy to distinguish the Wife of an Attorny from that of a Judge, and a Plebeian or Valet from a Gentleman. They were less studious to spend or enlarge their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony than to keep it, they left it entire to their Heirs, and past from a moderate Life to a peaceable Death: there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint then, <hi>'Tis a hard Age.

                     <p>'TIS in one sense the most honourable Reproach we can lay on any Man, to say, he knows not the Court, for there is scarce a Vertue which we do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by giving him that Character.</p>
                     <p>* A Man who frequents the Court, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his Gestures, his Looks and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he is profound and inpenetrable. He dissembles when he does ill Offices, smiles on his Enemies, puts a constraint on his Natural Disposition, disguises his Passions, acts against his Inclinations, speaks against his Opinion: And after all, this great Refinedness is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the Vice we call Falshood, which is sometimes as unprofitable even for a Courtier, as Openness, Sincerity and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>* The Court is like certain Colours which change their kind, and seem of different sorts, according to the Lights they are expos'd in.</p>
                     <p>* The Man who leaves the Court for a minute, renounces it for ever: The Courtier who saw him in the Morning, must see him

                     <p>* A Man must be content to seem little at Court; and let him be never so vain, tis impossible to prevent it, but his comfort is, the evil is common to all, and the great ones themselves are but little when they appear there.</p>
                     <p>* The Court appears afar off to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as an admirable thing; but if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it, its Beauties diminish, like a fair Prospect which we view at too little a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53908:93"/>
and they never go to bed without acquitting themselves of an Employ so serious, and so beneficial to the Commonwealth. They are in short, acquainted with the rise of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Accidents, and know every thing at Court which one ought to be ignorant of, having all the necessary Qualifications for a mean Advancement; they are very brisk and quick-sighted about any thing they think for their advantage, but in the main a little too bold, light, and inconsiderate.</p>
                     <p>* A Courtier who has not a name good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his Quality, must hide himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a better; but if 'tis one which he dares own, he must then insinuate that his name is the most illustrious, and his House the most ancient of all others; he ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hans,</hi> the <hi>Chatillions,</hi> or the <hi>Montmerencies</hi>; and if possible from the Princes of the Blood: He should talk of nothing but Cardinals, Dukes and First Ministers: He must usher his Grandfathers by Father and Mothers side, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Discourses, and place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When any one happens to tell him, <hi>Hyacynthus</hi> has a great Portion left, he demands if he is a Gentleman: If Persons laugh at his unseasonable Questions, he lets 'em laugh on: If they tell him a Story, he permits 'em to continue; but at the same time, acquaints them he goes after the Royal Family, and by dint of words will always be believ'd.</p>

                        </gap>Tis a great Folly to carry the least Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenage to Court, to be in a place where one is sure to be contemn'd for not being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
                     <p>* At Court we go to bed, and rise up on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our Interest: 'Tis that which employs us Morning and Evening, Night and Day: 'tis that which makes us think or speak, keeps us silent, or puts us on action: 'Tis for this end we speak to some, and neglect others; that we mount or descend: By this rule we measure all our Cares, Complacency, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, Indifference or Contempt. Whatever progress any Persons make by Vertue towards Wisdom and Moderation: The first ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temptation carries 'em away with the most covetous, who are the most ambitious, and the most violent in their desires. Can they stand still when every one is on the march, and putting themselves forward? Can they forbear following such as run before them? All Men believe they are accountable to themselves for their Advancement, and making their Fortunes; and he who has not rais'd it at Court, is enrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53908:94"/>
of perhaps, but will he leave it without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an advantage by his abode there, or will he still abide without favour or reward? A Question so crabbed and hard to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that an infinite number of Courtiers have grown old between saying yes or no, and have at last dy'd in suspence.</p>
                     <p>* There is nothing at Court so contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and unworthy, as a Man who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to our Welfare; I wonder how such a Person dares appear there.</p>
                     <p>* He who sees a Man far behind him, who was one of his own standing and condition, who made his first appearance at Court at the same time with himself, believes there is some substantial Reasons for his getting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that he ought to think better of himself than of this other Person who stopt by the way, forgetting what he thought of those that went beyond him before his Advancement.</p>
                     <p>* If he who is in favour makes advantage of it before 'tis too late: If he takes hold of the Good Wind that blows fair for him to make his way: If he gapes after all Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Posts, Abbeys, and does but demand and receive: If he is stor'd with Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Grants and Survivances, you will then complain that every thing tempts him, that all is his own, his Friends or Creatures, and that by the number of the various Favours bestow'd on him, he has made a great many Mens Fortunes. In the mean time, what shall he do to please you? Were I to judge less by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53908:94"/>
your Talk, and more by the Course you would take in the same place, 'tis to do exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he has done already.</p>
                     <p>We blame those who have made use of the Opportunities put in their hands to raise their Fortunes, whilst we despair by the Meanness of our own to be ever in the same Circumstances, and to be expos'd to such a reproach. But if we are like to succeed, we begin to think they have done less Injury than we imagin'd, and are more wary in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>* We must never exaggerate things, nor lay Crimes to the charge of the Court, which are not there. We can attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse against true Merit, than to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being rewarded. We shall not always despise it when we can better discern it: Though 'tis indeed at Court where 'tis most neglected, and where they do nothing, or very little, for those whom they very much esteem.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis rare if amongst all the Instruments a Man uses in the Structure of his Fortune at Court, some of 'em don't miscarry. One of my Friends, who promis'd to speak for me, says not a word; another speaks very faintly, a third mistakes my Interest and his own Intentions, and does me more harm than good. One wants the Will, another the Wisdom and Cunning; neither of them would take pleasure enough in seeing me happy to contribute with all their Might to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making me so. Every one remembers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53908:95"/>
what his Establishment cost him, and the helps that clear'd the way to his Settlement. And we should be always for justifying the Services we receive from some Men, by those which on the like occasions we render to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if 'twas not our chief and only care af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Fortunes are made to think of our selves.</p>
                     <p>* Courtiers never employ their Wit, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress or Policy to serve their Friends, when they desire it; but only to find out Evasions and Pretences, that 'tis not in their power, and by that think themselves acquitted on their side from all the Duties of Friendship and Gratitude.</p>
                     <p>People at Court are unwilling to make use of others who offer to assist them; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every body by themselves, expect no one will pretend to any Services from them, and that they are by this means excus'd for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Assistance. A soft and polite way of denying their Credit, Offices and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to such as may need them.</p>
                     <p>* How many Men almost stifle you with their Caresses, in private pretend to love and esteem you, and yet are perplex'd when they meet you in publick. At the <hi>Levee</hi> or Mass, they turn away their Eyes from you, and do all they can to avoid you. There is but a small number of Courtiers whose Greatness of Soul, or Confidence in themselves, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them to do Justice to a Man of Merit, who is alone, and destitute of Employments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:53908:95"/>* I see a Man surrounded and follow'd, but he is in Office; another whom every one courts, but he is in Favour: One is embrac'd and carest even by Persons of the First rank, but he is rich; another is gaz'd and pointed at, but he is learned and eloquent: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one whom no body misses saluting, but he is a Knave. I would be a Man who would be always good, who would be nothing more, and who is at all times willing to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Actions.</p>

                        </gap>'d to a new Post, we break in upon him like an Inundation with our Praises. The Court and Chappel are full of them: The Stair-case, the Hall, the Gallery, and the Withdrawing Room, resound with his Elogies. He gets presently out of sight, and mounts so high we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep him in view. There are not two different Voices in forming his Character; Envy and Jealousy speak now like Flattery: Every one is carry'd away by the torrent which forces 'em to say sometimes what they think, and sometimes what they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and often to commend a Man of whom they have no knowledge. If he has a little Wit, Merit or Valour, he is in an instant a Genius of the first Size, a Hero, a Demi-God; he is so much flatter'd in the Pictures that are made for him, that were he to be set by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, he would appear deform'd. 'Tis impossible for him to countenance those things which Baseness and Compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53908:96"/>
own Reputation: But let him stagger never so little in the post to which he was advanc'd, the World easily change their Opinion, and he entirely loses his credit. The Machines which lifted him so high by Applause and Encomiums, were built so as to throw him down into extreamest contempt: And there are none then who disdain him more, are sharper in their Censures, and say worse things of him than those who were most furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Praises when his Fortune smil'd on him.</p>

                     <p>* We see a great many Men fall from a high Fortune, by the same Defects which rais'd them.</p>
                     <p>* At Court they speak well of a Man for two reasons: The first that he may know they have commended him, and the second that he may do them the same favour.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis as dangerous at Court to make any Advances, as 'tis troublesome to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>If a Man does not know the Face or Name of a Person, 'tis a good subject for a great many Men to laugh at, or despise him. They ask you if such a one is not <hi>Rousseau, Fabry,</hi> or <hi>La Couture,</hi> and would not for a world be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to distinguish them.</p>
                     <p>* A certain Person told me so many ill things of another, and I saw so few in him, that I began to suspect his Merit would never do any one an Injury.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53908:96"/>* You are an honest Man, and do not make it your business neither to please nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the Favourites; only are loyal to your Master, and true to your Duty; yet let me tell you after all, you are a lost Man.</p>
                     <p>* None are impudent by choice, but by Constitution; 'tis a Vice to be so, but 'tis natural. He who is not born so, is modest; and 'tis not easy to go from this Extremity to the other, though 'twould be for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to learn this Lesson, Be impudent and succeed; A bad Imitation will not profit him, he will by this means be quickly baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled; A Man ought to have at least at Court a real and native Impudence to be successful.</p>
                     <p>* We seek, we are busy, we intrigue, we torment our selves, we demand, are refus'd, we demand again, and obtain. But is there any one will tell me he got any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking at a time when he thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, or was thinking of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else?

                     <p>* A Man sets up for an eminent Station, prepares his Machines, takes the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and to be well serv'd, some pull a littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Which is the greater shame to be refus'd a Post that we deserve, or to be put into one we do not deserve?</p>

                     <p>A Person presents himself as fit for a place in the City, he stands for one in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or petitions for a Consulship, he would have little reason to labour the first years of his Life to render himself capable of a great Employ, if he were to demand it without Mystery and Cabal, but openly and with Confidence to serve his Country, his Prince, and the Common-wealth.</p>

There are some people who are besotted to the favour of great men, they think on't all day, and study on't all night; are always running up and down stairs in a Ministers apartment, going in or coming out of an Antichamber: Whatever they pretend, they have nothing to say to him; they speak once or twice, and are content that they have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: If you press or croud 'em, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at your pride, arrogance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; speak to 'em, they shall make you no answer; they know you not, their eyes are dazled, and their minds alienated: It belongs to their Relations to take care of them, and lock them up, lest their folly in time shou'd grow to madness, and the world be no longer able to endure them. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> has a soft way with him, he passionately loves to be in favour, but his passion is more private, he pays it his vows secret, there he cultivates it, and keeps it a Mystery: He is ever on the watch to discover what Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

The Grandees go every day at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hour to a Temple they call a Church, at the upper end of the Temple there stands an Altar consecrated to their God, where the Preacher celebrates the Mysteries which they call holy, sacred and dreadful. The Great men make a vast circle at the foot of the Altar, standing with their backs turn'd to the Preacher and the Holy Mysteries, and their faces erected towards their King, who is seen on his Knees upon a Throne, to whom they seem to apply all their hearts and all their devotion.

                     <p>* If you are born vicious, Oh <hi>Theagenes,</hi> I pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you; if you are become so out of a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for some whose Interest it is that you should be debaucht, who have sworn pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to corrupt you, and boast already of their success; excuse me if I dispise you: If you are wise, temperate, modest, civil, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, grateful, industrious, and besides of a Rank that ought to give examples rather than take 'em, and make rules for others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than receive them; agree with those sort of Fellows to act out of complaisance their disorders, vices, and follies, when the respect they owe you, shall oblige them to imitate your Vertues.

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53908:107"/>The Great have in one thing a prodigious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over others. I don't envy 'em their good Chear, Riches, Dogs, Horses, Equipages, Fools and Flatterers; but I envy them the happiness of having in their service men of as good Souls and Sense, and sometimes better than their own.</p>
                     <p>* The Great delight in opening Walks in a Forest, supporting Trees by long Walls, gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cielings, in Water-works and Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries; but to get a quiet Mind and a glad Soul, to prevent extream cares, or remedy them, their Curiosity never reaches so far.</p>
                     <p>* One asks, if in comparing the different conditions of men together, their sufferings and advantages, we can't observe an equal mixture, and a like sortment of good and evil, which settles them on an equality, or at least makes one as desirable as the other; the rich and powerful man who wants nothing may make the question, but a poor man must answer it.</p>
                     <p>There is however a Charm in each diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent condition, of which nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery can deprive it; the Great please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in excess, the Little in moderation. These delight in lording and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, those find a pleasure, and even a vanity, in serving and obeying: The Great are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, saluted and respected; the Little surround, salute and cringe, yet both are content.</p>

that 'tis modesty in them to be as sparing of 'em as they are.</p>

                     <p>* The Great scorn the men of Wit, who have nothing but Wit to recommend 'em, and the men of Wit despise the Great, who have nothing but their Grandeur: And the honest man pitties 'em both, if they are not Vertuous, as well as Great and Witty.</p>
                     <p>* When on the one side, I see some brisk, busie, intreaguing, bold, dangerous, and scandalous persons, at the Table, and often in the familiarity of the Great; and on the other hand, I consider with what difficulty a man of Merit approaches 'em, I don't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believe the wicked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Empire, and with his Life deprive him of the ascendant over mens minds. Is it in him a zeal for his Neighbour, custom, or an excessive opinion of himself. By his insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he gets admittance every where, no Pallace escapes him. He never stops in the middle of a Chamber, he goes on to the Window or Closet, and we must wait to be seen, or have audience, till he has finished his tedious discourses He makes himself a confident to all Families; he concerns himself in their misfortunes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; he offers himself to 'em on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; they make a Feast, and he will be admitted. The care of a thousand Souls, which he must be accountable for, as much as for his own, is not enough to employ his time, and satisfie his ambition of directing.

'Tis however a gross error in 'em to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish such false prejudices; the best thoughts, the best discourses, the best writings, and perhaps the nicest conduct, do not always come from them.

disposition is hid under an Air of politeness; if the people have no Wit, the Great have no Souls. These have a good bottom and no outside, those have nothing but outside and a simple superficies. Were I to chuse who I would be for, without further weighing the matter, it should be the people.</p>
                     <p>* As profound as the Great at Court are, and whatever art they have to appear what they are not, and not to appear what they are, they cant't hide their malice and extream inclination to laugh at anothers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and to render that ridiculous which is not really so. These fine Talents are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in them at first sight, admirable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt to puzzle a bubble, and make a fool of one who was no better before: But yet more proper, to take away from them the pleasure they might receive by a man of Wit, who knows how to turn and wind himself a thousand agreeable and pleasant ways, if the dangerous Character of a Courtier does not engage him to be too reserv'd. They oppose him with their Gravity, which he is forc'd to dissemble, and does it so well, that the Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyers, as ill disposed as they are, can find no pretence to laugh at him.</p>
                     <p>* A lazy life, abundance, and the calm of a great prosperity, are the reasons why Princes of all others take delight in laughing at a Dwarf, a Monkey, a Natural, or a wretched Tale; Men less happy, never laugh but to the purpose.</p>

                     <p>To value ones self by another, or by the favour of the Great, is a delicate phrase in the Original, and without doubt signifies proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to value ones self, in saying of the Great all the good they have done us, or never thought to do us.</p>

On the contrary, those whose Birth distinguishes 'em from the people, and exposes 'em to the Eyes of men; to their censure and praise exert themselves as much by the force of their natural temper, as by true valor; and this disposition of Heart and Mind, which they derive from their Fore-fathers, is the bravery so familiar to the Nobility, and perhaps No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it self.</p>

Let us be centent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little, and if possible with less: Let us learn to bear the losses that may befall us. The receipt is infallible, and I resolve to try it. By this means I avoid running against a <hi>Swiss,</hi> or justling a Commissioner; to be pusht back from a Gate by an innumerable number of Clients that wait on a Courtier, of whom a Ministers house disgorges itself several times a day. To languish in a Hall of audience: To demand of him, trembling and stammering, a just thing: To wipe off his Gravity and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conism: Then I envy nor hate 'em no more: They beg nothing of me, nor I of them, we are equal, unless perhaps they are never at peace, and I am.</p>

The same envies and antipathies reign at Court and in the City: You find every where bad Fathers-in-law, Mothers-in-law, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives; divorces, ruptures, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understandings; every where different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, heats and partialities, false reports and scandals. With good eyes one may easily see <hi>St. Dennis street</hi> at <hi>Versailles,</hi> and <hi>Fontainbleau:</hi> Here they hate with more fierceness and haughtiness, and perhaps more like quality; they destroy one another more politely and cunningly: their heats are more eloquent; they speak injuriously with more elegance, and in better terms: They don't injure the purity of the language, they only offend men or their reputations; all the outside of Vice is here specious: But at the bottom 'tis the same as in the most abject conditions. You meet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53908:117"/>
here all their baseness, weakness and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness. These men, so great by their Birth, Favour or Dignity, these strong and cunning head-pieces; these women so witty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, are themselves the People, yet they all despise them.</p>
                     <p>Whoever talks of the People, says several things in one; 'tis a vast expression, and we may be surpriz'd to see what it contains, and how far it extends. There is the People, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Great: This is the Populace and the Multitude. There is also the People, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Wise, Able and Vertuous, which includes as well the Great as the Little.</p>
                     <p>* The Great govern themselves by fancy; lazy Souls, on whom the first impression takes; a thing happens, they talk on't too much, soon after a little, and then no more; actions, conduct, execution event, all are forgot. You must not expect from them correction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, prevention, gratitude or reward.</p>

                     <p>* The less we talk of the powerful, the better; what we say good of them, is often flattery: 'Tis dangerous to speak ill of 'em while they live, and villanous when they are dead.</p>

and inconveniences, which would be inevitable, and without remedy. Some there are, tho injurious to particular persons, which become the good of the Publick, though the Publick is nothing else but a body of those very particulars. So there are personal ills, which turn to the good and advantage of the family. Also those which afflict, ruin and dishonour Families, tend to the conservation and advantage of the State or Government. Some others there are which subvert Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and found new ones upon their ruins; and we can't but observe that vast Empires have been utterly extirpated and destroy'd, to change and renew the face of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>

                     <p>A Publick Minister, or Plenipotentiary, is a <hi>Camelion,</hi> a <hi>Protheus</hi>; sometimes like a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gamester, he dissembles his very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and temper, as well to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53908:121"/>
and penetration of others, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any secret escaping thro' passion and weakness; he's always ready to put on that shape his designs or occasions require, and very artificially appears what 'tis his Interest to be thought. So when he pretends his Master is very formidable, or very low, he's resolute and inflexible, to prevent any large Demands; or easie and complacent, to give others occasion to make them, that he may be sure of the same liberty. At another time he's profound and subtil, he dissembles a truth in the speaking, because 'tis advantageous to tell it, and not to be believ'd; or else he's free and open, the better to disguise what he conceals, and gain a belief, that he has made his last Overtures. At the same time, he's violent and very verbose, to excite others to talk, or hinder their speaking what he desires not to hear, or acquainting him with what he would be ignorant of. He talks of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, which soften or destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and leave them confounded betwixt Confidence and Distrust, that he may make amends for a lost opportunity, by dextrously gaining another; or he's cool and silent, to engage others to talk: he hears patiently a tedious while, to obtain the same favour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; his Discourse is lofty and weighty, his Promises and Menaces carry a great stroak with them, and are sure to shock his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists. Sometimes he speaks first, the better to discover the Oppositions and Contradictions, Intrigues and Cabals of the Ministers, upon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53908:122"/>
the propositions he has advanc'd, and to take his Measures from their Answers. At another Meeting he stays till the last, that he may be sure not to lose his labour; he can then be more exact, having nicely observ'd every thing that may be serviceable to his Master or his Allies. He knows what to ask, and what he can obtain. He knows how to be clear and expressive, or obscure and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous; he can use equivocal words and turns, which he can render more or less forcible, as his interest or occasions require. He asks lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle because he won't grant much, or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests are large that he may be sure of a little. He desires small things, which he pretends to be of no value, that they may not hinder him of greater. He avoids the gaining of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant point at first, if it's like to hinder him of several, which tho' in themselves of less value, yet united surmount the other. His Demands are extravagant, with design to be denied, that he may be furnish'd with a just excuse for refusing those he knows will be made. He very assiduously aggravates the enormity of these, and warmly urges the reasons why he cannot hearken to them, and as earnestly endeavours to enervate those which they pretend for their denial. He's equally concern'd to aggrandize those trifles he offers, as to slight openly the little they're willing to grant. He feigns extraordinary proffers, which beget a distrust, and oblige them to reject what indeed accepted would be useless; this serves to colour his exorbitant
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53908:122"/>
demands, and throw the blame of the refusal on them: He grants more than they can ask, to get yet more of them. He's very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and presses very hard for trivial things, and rather than fail, will suffer himself to be perswaded out of them, that he may quash all hopes and expectations of better from him. If he's perswaded to part with any thing, 'tis on condition that he may share the advantage of it. He directly, or indirectly, espouses the Interest of an Ally as he finds it profitable, or tends to advance his pretensions. He talks of nothing but Peace and Alliances, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good and Tranquility; in all which, he means only his Masters interest. Sometimes he reconciles disagreeing Parties, at other times he separates those he found united; he terrifies the strong and potent, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the weak: He cements several feeble Interests against a more powerful one, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Balance equal; he joins with the former, that they may desire his Alliance and Protection, which he sells them at a dear rate. He knows how to interest the Ministers in his Affairs, and by a dextrous management<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this he discovers their most secret Intentions, their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53908:123"/>
most profound Designs, and last Efforts; which he turns to his own advantage. If he's injur'd in any considerable Article he is very loud, but if he finds 'tis not so, he's yet louder, and throws the injur'd on their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Defence. All his measures are order'd, his steps are pointed out, and his least advances prescrib'd by the Court; yet he appears as complacent and free, in the most difficult contests, as if all his compliances were <hi>Extempore,</hi> and purely owing to his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending temper. He adventures to promise the Assembly, That their Proposals shall not be rejected, but approv'd of. By his Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he spreads false rumours concerning those things which he alone is entrusted with; he closely reserves some particular Instructions, these he never discloses, but at such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to neglect the use of them would be very pernicious. All his Intrigues tend to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and substantial ends, for which he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifices Punctilio's, and imaginary points of Honour. He has a great deal of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is arm'd with Resolution and Patience; he fatigues and discourages others, but is himself unwearied.

not this Minute what he was the last, and will not be the next what he is now; he is his own Successor, ask not of what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion he is, but what are his Complexions; nor of what Humour, but how many sorts of Humours has he. Don't deceive your self, is it <hi>Eutichrates</hi> whom you meet? How cold is he to Day? Yesterday he would have sought you, caress'd you and made his Friends jealous of you. Does he remember you?

                        <hi>Menalcas</hi> goes down Stairs, opens the Door to go out, shuts it, and perceives that his Night-Cap is still on, and examining himself a little better, finds but one half of his face Shav'd, his Sword on the Right-side, his Stockings hanging over his Heels, and his Shirt out of his Breeches. If he walks into the Street, he feels something strikes him on his face, or stomach; he can't suppose what 'tis, till waking, and opening his Eyes, he sees himself by a Cart-wheel, or under a Joiners Pent-house with the Coffins about his Ears. Sometimes you may see him run against a Blind Man, push him backwards, and aftewards fall over him. Sometimes he happens to come up Forehead to Forehead with a Prince, and obstruct his passage; with much ado he recollects himself, and has but just time to squeeze himself into a Wall, to make room for him. He seeks, quarrels, and brawls, puts himself into a heat, calls to his Servants, and tells them, one after another, every thing is lost, or out of the way, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53908:131"/>
demands his Gloves, which he has in his hands; like the Woman who ask'd for her Mask, when she had it on her Face. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters an Apartment, passes under a Sconce, where his Periwig hitches, and is left hanging. The Courtiers look on him and laugh: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naclas</hi> looks also, laughs louder than any of them, and turns his Eyes round the Company to see the Man, who shews his Ears, and has lost his Wig. If he goes into the City, after having gone pretty far, he believes himself out of his way, stands still, and asks of such as pass by, where he is. They tell him, the Street he lives in; he enters his own House, runs out in haste, fancying himself deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He comes out of the Hall, and finding a Coach at the Stair-foot, takes it to be his own, puts himself into it: The Coach-man whips, and thinks he is driving his Master home. <hi>Menalcas</hi> jumps out, crosses the Court-Yard, mounts the Stair-Case, runs into the Anti-Chamber, Chamber, and Closet; all is familiar to him, nothing new, he sits down and reposes himself as at his own House. The Master comes in, he rises up to receive him, treats him very civilly, pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He talks, reflects, talks again: The Master of the House is tir'd and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and <hi>Menalcas</hi> as much as he. He will not say what he thinks, but supposes the other to be some very impertinent lazy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who will at last retire; this he hopes,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53908:131"/>
and is patient. The Night comes, when with some difficulty he is undeceiv'd. At another time he pays a Visit to a Lady, and perswading himself that she is visiting him, he sits down in her Elbow-Chair, and thinks not of going. He perceives afterwards the Lady makes long Visits, expects every moment when she will rise, and leave him at liberty, but she tarries yet longer, he grows hungry: Night comes on, and he intreats her to Sup with him; she laughs, and so loud, that at last it wakes him. He Marries in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forgets it at Night and lies abroad. Some time after his Wife dies in his Arms, he assists at her Funeral; and the next day, when his Servants come to acquaint him that Dinner is on the Table, he demands if his Wife is ready, and they have given her notice on't. This is he who enters a Church, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Blind Man who is set at the Door for a Pillar, and his Dish for a Font, he plunges in his Hand and crosses his Forehead. When he hears of a sudden the Pillar speak, and offer him his Petitions, he turns towards the Quire, he fancies he sees a Desk and a Cushion, he throws himself rudely on him; the Machine bend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a Prayer Book; he is hardly got out of the Church but a Foot-man runs after him, pulls him by the Sleeve, and asks him, laughing, If he has not got my Lords Slipper? <hi>Menalcas</hi> shews him his, and tells him, This is all the Slippers I have about me. The Foot-man, however, searches him, and gets the Bishops Slipper whom he just left, whom he found sick by his Fire-side, and from whom taking leave, he snatch'd it instead of a Glove, which was fallen to the Ground. Thus <hi>Menalcas</hi> goes home with a Slipper less than he came out; he plays at <hi>Tric-Trac,</hi> and calls for Drink, 'tis brought him, he is to play, and holds the Box in one Hand, and the Glass in the other, and being a very great Oaf, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Dice and almost the Box, throws the Water on the Tables, and drowns the Man he play'd with.

He writes a long Letter, sands the Paper, and then throws it into the Ink-horn. He writes a second, makes up both, and mistakes the Superscription; one of them is sent to a Duke and Peer; and when he opens it, he reads, <hi>Mr.</hi> Oliver, <hi>Pray don't fail to send me my Quarters Rent, that was due at</hi> Lady-day, <hi>as soon as possible.</hi> His Tenant opens the other, and finds in it, <hi>My Lord, I receive, with a blind submission, the Orders which your Grace was pleased.</hi> He writes another at Night, and after he has

Coming down Stairs from the <hi>Louvre,</hi> he meets another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up; says <hi>Menalcas,</hi> You are the Man I look'd for, takes him by the Hand, hauls him along with him, they cross several Courts, enter the Halls, go out and come in; he looks more narrowly on the Man he drew after him, he wonders who it should be, has nothing to say to him, lets him go, and turns another way. He often asks you a Question, and is almost out of sight before you can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him. He finds you at another time in his way. He is ravish'd to meet you, he just came from your House, where he would have discours'd you about a certain Affair. He contemplates your Fingers; <hi>You have,</hi> says he, <hi>a fine Stone, had it you of</hi> Balcis? He leaves you, and continues his March; and this is the important Affair he was so earnest to discourse you about. If he is in company, he begins a Story, which he forgets to end; he laughs in himself, he discovers what he was thinking of, and gives answers to his thoughts. He sings through his Teeth, whistles, rouls up and down in his Chair, makes his moan, is hush'd and believes he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he is at a Feast, he scrapes insensibly all the Bread on his own Plate; his Neighbours, indeed, want it, as well as Knives and Forks, which he a long while plays with. There are large Spoons invented to serve them the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously; he takes one of them up, plunges

it into the Dish, fills it, puts it to his Mouth, and is extreamly surpriz'd to see the Porrage on his Cloaths and Linnen, which he thought had been in his Belly. He forgets to drink at Dinner; or if he remembers it, and thinks there's too much Wine fill'd for him, he flings half on't in the Man's face who sits next him, drinks the rest with a great deal of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and can't comprehend why the People laugh, who saw him throw away the Wine he was not willing to drink; he keeps his Bed a day or two, for some light Sickness, he is visited, the Men and Women make a Circle round his Bed; he opens the Quilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and drivles in his Sheets. He is carried to the <hi>Chartreux</hi>; he is shewn a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster painted by an excellent Hand. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, who explain the Figures, talk of St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> the Adventure of the Canon, make a long Tale on't, and shew the Story in the Picture. <hi>Menalcas,</hi> who was all the time out of the Cloyster, returns and asks the good Father, if 'tis the Canon or St. <hi>Bruno</hi> who is Damn'd. By chance he finds himself with a young Widow, he talks to her of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Husband, and asks how he died. The Woman, in whom this discourse renew'd her late sorrows, weeps, sighs, and acquaints him with all the particulars of her Husbands distemper, from the Night before the Fever took him, till his last Agonies: <hi>Madam,</hi> says <hi>Menalcas,</hi> who had heard her relation very attentively, <hi>Have you never another</hi>? He bids Dinner be got presently ready, rises before

the Fruit is serv'd up, takes his leave of the Company, and you are sure to see him that day in all the noted places of the City, that excepted, where he had made an appointment about the Affair which made him in such haste, and would not suffer him to tarry till his Horses were put to his Coach, but oblig'd him to trudge out a-foot: You may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hear him Scold, Chide, and be in a passion with his Domesticks for being out of the way. Where are they, says he? What can they be doing? What is become of 'em? When I want them, I can never find them; I'll this Minute give them Warning. While he is speaking they come in; he asks them, in a fury, Whence they came? They answer, From the place he sent them to, and give him a faithful account of their Errand. You are very often mistaken in him and take him for what he is not: For Stupid, because he hears little, and speaks less: For a Fool, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he talks alone, and is subject to a Set of Grimaces, and careless Motions with his Head: For Proud and Uncivil, because when you salute him he takes no notice of you, passes by and neglects it: For an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate Man, because he talks of Statutes in a Family that has a Bankrupt belonging to it; of Executions and Scaffolds before a Person whose Father was Beheaded; of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages before rich Farmers who would pass for Gentleman. He even brings a Bastard into his Family, and pretends to let him live like his Valet; but tho' he would have his

Wife and Children know nothing of the Matter, he can't forbear calling him his Son ten times a day. He resolves to marry his Son to a Tradesman's Daughter, and from time to time boasts of his House and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and tells him the <hi>Menaloas</hi>'s never us'd to Match below themselves. In short, he seems as if he were not present, nor heard what the Company discours'd of, when he is himself the subject of their Conversation. He thinks and talks of a sudden, but what he talks is seldom the thing he thinks on; by which means, there is little coherence in any thing he says. He says <hi>Yes,</hi> commonly instead of <hi>No;</hi> and when he says <hi>No,</hi> you must suppose he would say <hi>Yes</hi>; when he answers you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his Eyes are fix'd on yours, but it does not follow that he sees you, he minds neither you, nor any one else, nor any thing in the World. All that you can draw from him, even when he is most sociable, are some such words as these: <hi>Yes, indeed, 'tis true, good, all's well, sincerely, I believe so, certainly: Ah! O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> And some other Monosyllables, which are never spoken in the right place. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is among those whom he appears to be with; he calls his Footman very seriously, <hi>Sir,</hi> and his Friend <hi>Robin.</hi> He says <hi>your Reverence</hi> to a Prince of the Blood, and <hi>your Highness</hi> to a Jesuit; he hears Mass. The Priest sneezes, and he cries out, <hi>God bless you.</hi> He is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a Judge, grave by his Character, and venerable by his Age and Dignity; he asks him if such a thing is so, and <hi>Menalcas</hi>

We don't expect the Malicious to be tender and complaisant, but they never want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and tenderness when they serve to ensnare the Simple, and set a price on their Artifices.</p>

                     <p>* Life is a kind of Sleep, old men sleep longest: They never begin to wake, but when they are to dye. If then they run over the whole course of their lives year by year, they find frequently neither Vertues nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable actions enough to distinguish them one from another.

                     <p>* There is a time, which precedes Reason, when we live like other Animals by instinct, of which we can't trace the least footsteps. There's a second time, when Reason disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers itself when 'tis form'd, and might act, if it were not obscur'd, and almost extinguisht by the vices of Constitution, and a Chain of Passions, which succeed one another, and lead to the third and last age. Reason then is in its force, and might bring forth, but 'tis soon lessen'd and weaken'd by years, sickness and sorrow; render'd useless by the disorder of the Machine, which is now declining; yet these years, imperfect as they are, make the Life of a Man.</p>

In this they are men long before they are one and twenty.</p>
                     <p>* Children think not of what's past, nor what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all much the same, and it must be with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nice observation, that you can perceive a difference. It augments with Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with it the Passions and Vices increase, which make men so unlike one another, and so contrary to themselves.</p>
                     <p>* Children have in their childhood what old men lose, Imagination and Memory, which are very useful to them in their little sports and amusements; by these helps they repeat what they have heard, and mimick what they see done. By these they work af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others, or invent themselves a thousand little things to divert them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They know at this Age how to be arbiters of their fortune, and masters of their own happiness.</p>
                     <p>* There are no exterior vices, or bodily defects, which are not perceiv'd by Children. They strike 'em at first sight, and they know how to express 'em in agreeable words. Men could not be more happy in their terms; but when they become men, they are loaded in their turn with the same imperfections, and are themselves mock'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53908:140"/>* 'Tis the only care of Children to find out their Masters weakness, and the weakness of those to whom they must be subject; when they have found it, they get above 'em, and usurp an Ascendant over them, which they never part with; for what depriv'd them of their Superiority, will keep them from reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it.</p>
                     <p>* Idleness, Negligence, and Laziness, Vices so natural to Children, are not to be seen in 'em while they are at play: They are then lively, heedful, exact, lovers of rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, never pardon one another the least faults: Begin again several times if but one thing is wanting.

                     <p>* To Children, Gardens, Houses, Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Men and Beasts appear great. To Men, the things of the world, and I dare say, for the same reason, because they are little.</p>
                     <p>* Children begin among themselves with a popular state, where every one is master, and what is very natural, can't agree so long before they go on to a Monarchy. One of 'em distinguishes himself from the rest, either by a greater vivacity, strength, or a more exact knowledge of their little sports and laws; some differ from him, and then they form an absolute Government, which is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only by pleasure.</p>

small things. Consider they are Children, and without much experience. If in bad phrases, 'tis less their fault than their Parents and Masters.</p>
                     <p>* It balks the minds of Children to punish them for Crimes they have not really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or to be severe with them for light offences. They know exactly, and better than any one, what they deserve, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what they fear, they know when they are chastis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* No Man lives long enough to profit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by his faults, he is committing 'em du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole course of his life, and as much as he can do at last, is to dye corrected.</p>
                     <p>Nothing pleases a man more than to know he has avoided a foolish action.</p>
                     <p>* Men are loath to confess their faults: They hide them, or change their quality; 'tis this gives the Director an advantage over the Confessor.</p>
                     <p>* Blockheads faults are sometimes so odd, and so difficult to foresee, that wise men are at a loss to know how they could commit 'em, and fools only can be profited by them.</p>
                     <p>* A spirit of party and faction sets the Great men and the Mob on an equal foot.</p>
                     <p>* Vanity and Decency make us do the same things in the same manner, which we should do by inclination and duty: A man dy'd at <hi>Paris</hi> of a Fever, which he got by waking with his Wife, whom he hated.</p>

Thus men pass for Vertuous, that they may draw some other advantages from it, besides Vertue itself, I would say Esteem and Praise. This should no longer be thought Vertue, but a love for Praise and Esteem, and Vanity: Men are very vain Creatures, and of all things hate to be thought so.</p>
                     <p>* A vain man finds his account in speaking good or evil of himself, a modest man never talks of himself. We can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>False Modesty is the most cunning sort of Vanity: By this a man never appears what he is; on the contrary, raises a reputation by the Vertue, quite opposite to the Vice, which forms his Character: This is a Lye; false Glory is the Rock of Vanity; it tempts men to acquire esteem by things which they indeed possess, but are frivolous, and not fit for a man to value himself on; this is an Error.</p>
                     <p>* Men speak of themselves in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that if they grant they are sometimes guilty of a few little faults, or have some small defects; these very faults and defects imply fine Talents and great Qualifications. Thus they complain of a bad memory, well

Talk of their negligence in phrases which denote their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest, and their being void of ambition. They are not asham'd of being Slovens, which shews only that they are heedless a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout little things, and seems to suppose in them an application for things solid and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential. A Souldier affects to say, 'twas too much rashness and curiosity ingag'd him in the Trenches, or at such a dangerous post, without being on duty, or commanded there. And adds, that the General chid him for't. Thus a good hand, and a solid genius, born with all the prudence which other men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in vain to acquire; who has streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd the temper of his mind by great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; whom the number, weight, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, difficulty, and importance of affairs employ without incumbering; who by his large insight and penetration makes himself maste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

things he does, from the pleasant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things he might read, and needs only to turn over his own life and actions; a man thus form'd may say safely, without doing himself any prejudice, that he knows nothing of Books, and never reads.</p>
                     <p>* Men would sometimes hide their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or lessen the opinion we have of 'em, by confessing them freely. A Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head laughs and says, I am a very ignorant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. A man above threescore says, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* There is either no such thing as Modesty, or 'tis confounded with something in it self quite different. If we take it for an interior sentiment, which makes a man seem mean in his own eyes, this is a supernatural Vertue, and we call it Humility. Man naturally thinks proudly and haughtily of himself, and thinks thus of no body but himself. Modesty only tends to qualifie this disposition; 'tis an exteriour Vertue, which governs our eyes, conduct, words, tone, and obliges a man to act with others to outward appearance, as if is was not true, that he counted them for nothing.</p>
                     <p>* The world is full of people, who making by custom and outward appearance, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of themselves with others, always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in favour of their own merit, and act accordingly.</p>
                     <p>* You say, men must be modest. All per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons well born say the same in return; then
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53908:142"/>
do you take care that such as give way by their modesty, may not be too much tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd over, and that when they bend, they be not broken to pieces.</p>
                     <p>Thus some say, people should be modest in their Dress. Men of merit desire nothing more: But the world are for Ornament: We give it them. They are covetous of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, and we shew it. Some value o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their fine Linnen; or rich silks, and we cannot always refuse esteem, even on these terms. There are some places where a full or a thin Sword-knot will get or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man admittance.</p>
                     <p>* Vanity, and the great value we have for our selves, make us imagin, that others carry it very proudly towards us, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times true, and often false. A modest man has not this kind of delicacy.</p>
                     <p>* As we ought to deny our selves the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thinking, others regard us with so much curiosity and esteem, that they are always talking of our Merit, and in our commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So we should have so much confidence in our selves, that we should not fancy when any whisper, 'tis to speak ill of us, and that they never laugh, but to mock us.</p>
                     <p>* Whence come it that <hi>Aleippus</hi> salutes me to day, smiles, and throws himself almost out of the Coach, to take notice of me. I am not rich, and am a fool, according to the Rules, he should not have seen me. Oh now I have hit on't, 'twas that I might see him in the same seat with a person of the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:53908:143"/>* Men are so full of themselves that every thing they do partakes on't. They love to be seen, to be shewn, to be saluted, even by such as don't know 'em; if they forget them, they are presently haughty. They would have people conjure to find out who they are.</p>
                     <p>* We never seek happiness in our selves, but in the opinion of men, whom we know to be flatterers, unsincere, unjust, envious, suspicious and prepossest: Unaccountable folly!</p>
                     <p>* One would think men could not laugh, but at what is really ridiculous, there are some people who laugh as well at what is not so, as at what is. If you are a fool, and inconsiderate, and something imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent escapes you, they laugh at you. If you are wise, and say nothing but reasonable things in a proper accent, they however laugh at you.</p>
                     <p>* Those who ravish our Wealth from us, by violence and injustice, or rob us of our honour by calumnies, shew that they hate us, but 'tis not at all an argument, that they have lost all manner of esteem for us; by which means we are not render'd incapable of forgiving them, and being one time or other friends with 'em. Mocking on the contrary, is, of all injuries, the least pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.

                     <p>* Men reckon the virtues of the heart worth nothing, and idolize their Wit and bodily endowments. He who says coldly of himself, and she thinks without hurting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, that he is good, constant, faithful sincere, just, and grateful, durst not say he is brisk, has fine Teeth, and a soft hand, he's not so vain, that would be too much for him.

                     <p>* Whatever likeness appears between Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy and Emulation, there is as vast a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as between Vice and Virtue: Jealousy and Emulation operate on the same object, anothers Wealth or Merit with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the last is a Sentiment, voluntary, bold, sincere, which renders the Soul fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and profits by great examples, so far as

A barren pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which leaves a man in the same state it found him, fills him with high Idaeas of himself and his reputation, and renders him cold and sullen on another man's Actions or Works, which makes him astonished to see any Qualifications in the world better than his own, or other men enjoy Talents that offend him. A shameful Vice which grows by its excess to vanity and presumption, and does not so much perswade him who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, that he has more Sense and Merit than others, as that he alone has Sense and Merit.</p>
                     <p>Emulation and Jealousy are always found in persons of the same Art, the same Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and Conditions. The vilest Artificers, are most subject to Jealousy. Those who profess the liberal Arts, or the <hi>Belles Lettres</hi>

They are devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, particularly to the Great, on whom they depend, and in their favour repose all their hopes. They don't serve, but they amuse them. Men of Merit and Capacity are useful to the Great; these are necessary, they are always ready with their Jests, which

are as meritorious in them, as the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Actions are in others.

We may prophetically commend her for the wisdom she will one day certainly have, and the merit she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for her riper years.

Thus an honest man is respected independant from all those outward Actions, by which he would end eavour to make his person more grave, and his vertue more specious, and reserv'd; since too great a modesty, a singularity in Habit, or the State with which some walk, add nothing to sincerity, nor does it raise Merit, but hurts, and often makes it look less pure and more suspected.</p>

The man of honour is one that robs not on the Road, commits no murders, and in fine, a person whose Vices does not make him scandalous. We know very well that an honest man is a man of honour; but 'tis pleasant to think that every man of honour is not an honest man.

Again, what shall I say of Play, who can define it to me? is there no occasion of forecast, cunning, or skill, to play at Ombre or Chess; or if there is, how comes it that we see men of weak parts excellent, and others of great ingenuity that can't attain to an indifferency, whom a piece of Card in their hands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes and puts out of Countenance.</p>

                     <p>* There is a Philosophy which raises us above Ambition and Fortune, that equals us to (what shall I say?) places us above the Rich, the Great and the Powerful; that prompts us to contemn preferments and those that procure them: that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts us from the fatigu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These wise men ought to be commended for their good fortune, as well as wise conduct, and chance ought to be recompenc'd as vertue in them.</p>

                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:53908:174"/>* Some, who are neither Souldiers nor Courtiers, make Campaigns, and follow the Court; they don't form a Siege, but they assist in it; they soon satisfy their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity in the seat of War, how inquisitive so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, concerning the Trenches, the effects of Bombs and Cannon, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses, the Order and Successes of an Attack, as it occurs; they observe the opposition continues, the Rains fall, the fatigues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, they wade thro blood, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both the Enemy and the Elements; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Lines are forc't, and they're en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed between a Town and an Army: what extremities are these? Their courage fails, they murmuring cry out, Will the raising this Siege be of so fatal consequence? Does the safety of the State depend upon one Cittadel? The Heavens themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against us, and shan't we submit to them, and defer the Enterprize till another Season? Then they lose all their resolution, and if they durst would rail at the obstinacy of the General, who withstands all obstacles, and is animated even by the difficulties of the Enterprize; he exposes and fatigues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self night and day to accomplish his design. But as soon as the Enemy capitulate, these dispirited wretches cry up the importance of the Conquest, by anticipating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and exaggerating the necessity he lay under of doing it, and the danger and shame which would have attended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting; they endeavour to prove that the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53908:174"/>
Army that covered them from the Enemy was invincible; they return with the Court, as they pass thro the Towns and Villages, are proud to be gazed at by the Inhabitants from their Windows; and they triumph on the Road, as if they were the men that took the place, imagining themselves very brave. When come home, they deafen you with Flanks, Curtains, Ravelins, Bastions, Half-moons, and Covert-ways: They give you an account of those places where curiosity led them, the unavoidable hazards they were in, and the danger they ran of being kill'd, or taken by the Enemy; they are only silent concerning their fears.</p>
                     <p>It's the least inconvenience in the World to be short in a Sermon or Oration; it leaves the Orator all that he has of Wit, good Sense, Fancy, good Manners and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and robs him of nothing; but it is very surprising that men should affect a sort of Shame and Ridicule, by exposing themselves in tedious and often unprofitable Discourse; and so run a risque of their Reputation.</p>
                     <p>* Those that make the worst use of their time are the first that complain of its short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; such as waste it in Dressing, Eating, Sleeping and Impertinent talk,, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving what to do, and generally doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; they want it for their business or pleasure; on the contrary, those that make the best use of it have some to spare.</p>
                     <p>There is no States-man so thronged with business, but trifles away two hours every
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53908:175"/>
day, which amounts to a great deal in a long Life; and if the evil is much greater in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stations, what an infinite waste is there made of this precious thing, which you complain you want.</p>
                     <p>* There are a sort of Gods Creatures which are call'd Men, who have a Soul which is a Spirit; whose whole Life is imploy'd in, and whose most vigorous attention is taken up in sawing of Marble; this is very foolish and trivial. But there are others more astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for they are intirely useless, and spend their days in doing nothing: this is yet less than sawing Marble.</p>
                     <p>* The major part of Mankind so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that they have a Soul, and launch out into such Actions and Exercises, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the wrong, if we believe we speak advantageously of any Man when we say he thinks; this is become a common Elogy, and yet it raises a Man only above a Dog or an Horse.</p>
                     <p>* How do you divert your self? how do you spend your time? Is the Question asked both by Fools and Men of Sense: if I answer, 'tis to open my Eyes, and to see, to prepare my Ears to hear, to enjoy Health, Ease and Liberty; 'tis to say nothing, the solid, the great, and the only good is slighted, makes no impression. The Answer should be, Do you Game, do you Dance?</p>
                     <p>Is it good for Man to have a liberty (if it were possible) so large and extensive,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53908:175"/>
that it would only prompt him to desire one thing else, that is, to have less liberty.</p>
                     <p>Liberty is not Idleness, it is a free use of time to choose our Labour and our Exercise; in one word, to be free is not to do nothing, but to be the sole Arbiter of what we do, and what we leave undone? In this Sense what good so great as Liberty.</p>

                     <p>* A young Prince of an August Race, the love and hope of his People, given by Heaven to prolong the felicity of the Earth, greater than his Progenitors, the Son of an Hero, who was his Pattern, hath now told the Universe by his divine qualities, and anticipated Vertues, that the Sons of Hero's are nearer being so than other men. <note n="*" place="margin">Contrary to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial <hi>Latin</hi> Maxim.</note>

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53908:176"/>
many things are there unknown to us in Arts and Sciences, in Nature, nay, I durst say in History too? What vast discoveries would then be made, what different Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions would then happen in the States and Empires of the whole World? How great would our Ignorance appear, and how slender our Experience, that is not of above six or seven thousand years standing?</p>
                     <p>* There is no way too tedious for him that Travels gently and without hurry: and there are no advantages too remote from those that prepare themselves with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>

You are not Vicious, <hi>Thrasyllus,</hi> are you? for my part I know it not, but you inform me so your self; that which I know is, that you are not Young.</p>
                     <p>And, you that are personally offended at what I said of some great people, don't cry out of a wound intended for another: Are you Haughty, Malicious, a Buffoon, a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,

                     <p>* Many a man will disown his Father, that is known to keep such a Farm, or such an Ale-house, and will brag of his Grand-father, who is dead, and might, for ought one knows, be a better man. He has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a large income, some great place, and a Lord for his Son-in-law, and had he but a title too, would be as good a man as the best Peer in the Land.</p>

                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:53908:190"/>* A Gentleman was formerly said to have a grant from the King for his Title:<note place="margin">The Title of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is held by Patent in <hi>France,</hi> as that of Pew in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> This was thought a very proper expression, but now 'tis old and obsolete. Rehabilitation is the term which has supply'd its place in all our Courts of Judicature, such a one who has laid up an Estate is rehabilited in his Gentility. This intimates that he was originally a Gentleman, that it is most fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he should still be so, that however his father may have abdicated his title by driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plough, digging the Earth, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pedlars Pack, or wearing a Livery, he is now restor'd to the right of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors. And that what is now to be done is only to continue him the possession of the same Coat of Arms they always had, tho it is perhaps one of his own invention, and quite different from that he had before on his Pewter. In a word, it implies that a Grant of this title is unfit for him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only for one who never was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and whom the meanness of his birth still makes desirous of getting money.</p>
                     <p>* As one man, by often affirming he has seen some miraculous sight, perswades him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he really has. As another, by hiding his age from others, comes to believe at last, he is as young as he would be thought.

heard of. This man, I say, has the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of fancying himself at length to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from some considerable Family.</p>
                     <p>* What man is there that's never so meanly born, who having got an Estate can want a Coat of Arms, and to this Coat a Crest, Supporters and Motto. What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the distinction of Casks and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, the name and use of 'em are abolisht; 'tis no longer in dispute whither they shou'd be born in front or side ways, close or open, or about the number of bars: 'Tis to Coronets that they aspire, that they lay claim to. There are some Citizens that have a little modesty still left, and use not the Ducal Coronet, being content with an Earls; and some go not far in quest of it, but take it from their Signs to clap it on their Coach.</p>
                     <p>* A Citizen is a despicable Creature: but as for one who is born in the corner of a thatch'd House, or perhaps in the ruins of an old Tower, which stands in the middle of a Bog, and which he qualifies with the name of Castle, let him but stile himself a Gentleman, and he is one.</p>

                        <note place="margin">This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to a particular person, perhaps to the <hi>M— de T</hi>—</note>* A Gentleman strives to be respected as a Nobleman, and lives so high that none can tell but he is one. A Nobleman can be satisfied with no less than the title of Prince, changing his Coat of Arms, and producing a new Genealogy as doubtful as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; he sets so many Engines to work, arrogates to himself so many great Titles,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53908:191"/>
has so many disputes about ranks and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, that at last he really becomes a little Prince.</p>
                     <p>* Some men are so fond of titles that they give themselves three rather than fail; one they use in the City, another in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a third elsewhere. Others are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one name, adding <hi>du</hi> or <hi>de</hi> to it, to make it sound genteel, as soon as their circumstances are any thing tolerable; others again, by suppressing one syllable of their name, transfer themselves from one of the meanest Families into one of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the Kingdom. Many will suppress their whole names, which had nothing shameful in them, to adopt others that sound greater, and by which they get nothing but the being compar'd to a disadvantage with the great men from whom we borrow them. And as many who are born within the Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> will feign themselves to be <hi>Flemish</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> as if a mean extraction could not be drawn from any Country, will lengthen their names and give them another termination to make them sound outlaudish, fancying that a name is much better for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far fetch'd.</p>
                     <p>* The want of Money has taken off the inconsistence of gentility with a mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and saves many a dispute about the quartering of Scutcheons.</p>
                     <p>* How many would be gainers by a Law that should make gentility to be drawn from the Mother's side, and how many more
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53908:192"/>
would be losers by it. There are few Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but what are as near related to the greatest Princes as the meanest Peasant.</p>
                     <p>* I here declare it openly, and desire all men to take notice of it, that none may wonder hereafter. If ever any great man thinks me worthy of his care, if ever I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to make my fortune, there is one <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey de la Bruyere,</hi> whom all the Chronicles of <hi>France</hi> place among the men of the highest rank, that follow'd <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon</hi> in his conquest of the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> And this <hi>Godfrey</hi> shall then be the man from whom I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended in a direct line.</p>
                     <p>* If Gentility be a virtue, that man loses his title that is not virtuous. If it is not a virtue it is hardly worth his care.</p>
                     <p>* There are things, which consider'd in their principle and in their first institution are wonderful and incomprehensible: Who could imagine, for example, that this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, who makes his dress his whole study, who wants nothing of the effeminacy or of the vanity that is observ'd in either Sex, and in the highest quality; who has as good a talent to insinuate himself in the Ladies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as the greatest Beau, or the richest Banker: Nay, who outdoes them both.

                     <p>* There is no fine thing but what loses of its grace by being misplac'd; no perfection without an agreeableness; no agreeableness but what is grounded on reason. A Jig in a Church, or the affected tone of a Player in a Pulpit would but offend our ears. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not adorn'd with prophane Images. A Crucifix, for example, and the Judgment of <hi>Paris</hi> were never seen in the same Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. The Equipage and the Retinue of a man of the Sword, is unbecoming of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                     <p>* We hear of no Vows nor Pilgrimages made to any Saint, in order to attain to a higher degree of benignity, gratitude, or equity, to cure us of our malignity, vanity, spleen, and uneasiness of temper.</p>
                     <p>* What can be more extravagant, than for Christians to have their constant meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, design'd on purpose for the applauding a company of excommunicated persons,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53908:193"/>
whom they at once reward and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate for the pleasure they receive from them. Methinks all Theatres should be shut up, or a less severe sentence pass'd against Players.</p>
                     <p>* Parish Duties amount to more for a Christning than for a Confession, and are larger for a Marriage than for a Christning. One would think there was a Tax laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sacraments, by this which seems to be rated as a sort of Merchandize; yet when all is done, nothing like it can reasonably be inferr'd from this custom. They that receive those Duties pretend as little to sell the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as those that pay them think to buy 'em. Such an appearance of evil, might indeed as well be laid aside, to avoid offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weak, and being censur'd by the wicked.</p>
                     <p>* A brisk jolly Priest, who is as healthy as he can wish himself, is Rector of such a Parish, and sits in his lac'd Surplis amongst the Judges and Magistrates, in the best place in the Church, where he ends the digestion of a plentiful Dinner, while a Monk or a Fryer l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The novelty and unexpectedness of such a censure startles you; you wonder at the impertinence of it, and are ready to ask me, whether I would deprive this Priest and his whole Parish from hearing the Word of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53908:193"/>
God, and receiving the bread of Life. No, by no means, I would have him preach that Word, and deal that Bread to them himself, at all times, and at all places, in publick and in private, in the Churches, in the Markets, and on the House tops. And I would have none to pretend to so great and so laborious an office, but with an intent and a capacity of deserving the large offerings and the great retributions that are belonging to it. I am forc'd, 'tis true, to excuse him for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so. 'Tis a custom which he finds establish'd, and he will leave after him to his Successors. But it is this odd, ill-grounded and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable custom which I blame, and which I can approve as little as that of his being paid four times for the same Funeral, once for himself, a second time for his dues, a third for his presence, and a fourth for his assistance.</p>
                     <p>* <hi>Titus</hi> has serv'd the Church for these twenty years in a small Living, and is not yet worthy of a better Benefice that fall's vacant: Neither his parts, the solidity of his Doctrine, his exemplary life, nor the desire of the Parishioners, are sufficient to bring him in. Another man starts up, as it were from under ground, and is preferr'd before him. <hi>Titus</hi> has no reason to complain, Custom would have it so.</p>
                     <p>* Who says the Chanter should pretend to make me rise to Mattins? Am not I Master of the Quire? My Predecessors never went there; sure I am no worse a man

than he was? Should I suffer my Dignity to be undervalu'd while I am in possession of it, or should I leave it to my Successor such as I found it?

A man was formerly to take his wife for better for worse, the same House, the same Table, and the same Bed were in common to 'em both: he was to be a husband all his life time.

                     <p>* <hi>Oranta</hi> has been at Law for these ten years, about determining in what Court her Cause is to be heard. Her pretensions are just, of the highest consequence, and on them depends all her fortune. About five years hence she is like to know who her Judges are to be, and at what Bar she is to plead during the remaining part of her life.</p>
                     <p>* That custom is receiv'd with applause, which has introduced itself in our Courts of Judicature, of interrupting the Council at the Bar in the middle of his discourse, of hindering his being eloquent or witty, of making him return to the matter of fact, and confining him to the bare proofs on which his Client grounds his right, and by which the justness of his cause may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. And so severe a practice, which exposes an Orator to the regret of having left out the finest part of his discourse,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53908:197"/>
which banishes eloquence from its natural place, and which is ready to fill our Courts with mutes. This practice, I say, is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that is the dispatch of business: I could wish this reason was less forgot elsewhere, that it were as much regarded in all Offices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each respective Court, as it is in the Court itself. That our Lawyers were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to aim at a conclusion in their writing as they are in their speaking.</p>
                     <p>* The Duty of a Judge consists in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Justice, and his Trade in delaying it. Some Judges understand their duty, and follow their Trade.</p>
                     <p>* Whoever becomes a sollicitor to his Judge shews him no respect at all: He que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions his understanding or his honesty, he endeavours to give him a prejudice against his Adversary, or else he desires of him a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right injustice.</p>
                     <p>* The temper of some Judges is such, that interest, authority, intimacy, or relation, render a just Cause obnoxious to 'em; their affectation of appearing not to be corrupted causing them to be unjust.</p>
                     <p>* The love of women is of a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in a Magistrate, tho he has but a few private intrigues, than in one that is a profest Whore-master. The first is so close, that it is impossible to discover thro whose means one may make an interest with him. The other has a thousand weak sides, on
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53908:197"/>
which he may be assaulted, and is wrought upon by every woman he converses with.</p>
                     <p>* The administration of Justice is very near as much respected in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as the dispensation of holy Mysteries. And the character of a Magistrate is in a manner as sacred, as that of a Priest. A man of the Gown can hardly dance at a publick Ball, be seen at a Play, or forget plainness and modesty in his Apparel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing contempt upon himself. And one would wonder that a Law should be necessary to regulate his carriage and his garb, and to force him at once to be grave and respected.</p>

                     <p>* Should I read, that in former ages one of those Magistrates, who are appointed for the apprehending and extirpation of Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pockets and Thieves, had been long acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all those Rascals: That he knew their names and faces, had an account of their walks, and of every particular act of theirs; could tell how many pockets had been picked, and what had been stolen out of each; could penetrate so far into the depth of their mysteries, and had so great a share in their abominable actions, that to prevent the noise that some great man was ready to make about a Jewel that was taken from him in a croud, when coming out of a publick meeting, he knew how to restore it to him; and that this Magistrate had been
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53908:199"/>
try'd and condemn'd for this villainous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; I should place such a relation in the same rank with those we find in History, which time has made incredible. How then should I believe that it may now most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be inferr'd from fresh and notorious circumstances, that there is still such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious connivance; and that it is look'd upon as a customary thing, and hardly taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>* How many men oppose strength to weakness; cannot be mov'd by compassion, stand buff against all the sollicitations of the poor, have no regard for the common sort of people, shew themselves rigid and severe in things of no moment, will not accept of the least gratification, nor be perswaded by their dearest friends and their nearest relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are byass'd only by women.</p>
                     <p>* 'Tis not altogether impossible for a man in great favour to lose a cause.</p>
                     <p>* A dying man, who speaks in his last Will may expect to be heard like an Oracle. His words will certainly create many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. Men will put their own constructions upon them, such constructions I mean, as will suit their interest and their inclinations best.</p>
                     <p>* There are some men of whom one may truly say, that Death fixes not so much their Wills, as it puts a period to their unsteadiness, and their inconstancy. An angry fit while they live, moves 'em to prepare a Will. Their passion wears off, and 'tis either torn
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53908:199"/>
or burnt. Their Closet is no less stock'd with Wills, than it is with Almanacks, and every year at least produces a new one. The second is disanull'd by a third, which is made as insignificant by another more exact. And the validity of this also is destroyed by a fifth. Yet the last must stand, if opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, power or malignity is wanting in the person whose interest it is to suppress it. For what can more clearly shew the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the most inconstant man, than a last Deed of his under his own hand, which has been made so late, that at least he has not had time to will the contrary?</p>
                     <p>* Were there no Wills to regulate the rights Heirs and Successors, I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men would need any Tribunal, to adjust their differences and disputes, the function of a Judge would almost be reduc'd to that dismal part of it, the sending of Thieves and Murderers to the Gallows. Who are those, that are continualy solliciting our Magistrates, that make such a stir before their doors and in their Halls? Heirs at Law? No! Their rights are fix'd of course. They are none but Legatees who are jarring about the meaning of a word or a clause in a last Will; or disinherited persons who find fault with a Testament that has been made leisurely, after mature deliberation, by a grave, a wise, and conscientious man, and not without the help of good Counsel: With a Deed in which a cunning Lawyer has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd all his skill to make it firm and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable,

By one clause he makes him his Successor in a good office; by another he bestows on him all his Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the City; by a third a fine seat in the Country; and by a fourth he makes him master of a house richly furnish'd, and seated in the best part of the Town, with all its appurtenances. His grief increases, tears run down his Cheeks: How is it possible he should refrain? He is now one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stys chief Officers; he has his City and his Country-house, his furniture is answerable: He is to keep his Coach and a noble Table. <hi>Was there ever an honester, a better humour'd man than the deceased.</hi> But hold! Here is a sort of a Schedule belonging to this Will, which must be read. This Schedule gives <hi>Moevius</hi> all these things, and sends <hi>Titius</hi> back to his Garret. He has now neither honours nor money, and must be contented to walk on foot as before. <hi>Titius</hi> wipes off his tears, 'tis <hi>Moevius</hi>'s business to weep.</p>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53908:200"/>
drowning as well as burning, private assaults as well as open violence, and whatever may contribute to the destruction of men? Did the Law, which restrains Husbands and Wives from giving any thing one to another, relate only to direct and immediate ways of giving? Has it made no provision against those that are indirect? Was it design'd for the introduction of Trustees? Does it so much as tolerate such an evasion, even when the dearest of Wives out-lives her Husband? But does a man bequeath his Estate to a trusty friend as an acknowledgement of his friendship, or is it not rather as a mark of his reliance upon him, and of the confidence he has, that he will make a good use of what he is entrusted with? Will a man intrust his Estate to one whom he has the least ground to suspect will not restore it to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is really intended for? Does he need a contract or an oath from him? Must he so much as instruct him in what he is to do? And does not every man feel within his breast what he may expect from another in such a case? And if on the contrary the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this Estate is fallen to this trusty friend, why does he lose his reputation by keeping it? What grounds does he give for a Satyr or Lampoon? Would you compar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53908:201"/>
and of a man's keeping for his own use what is lawfully his? How great is the perplexity, how intolerable the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that such a trust draws along with it? If a man, out of reverence to the Laws of his Country, appropriates to himself such a deposite, he can no longer be thought an honest man. If out of respect for a deceas'd friend he acts according to his intentions, and restores such a deposite to his Widow, he must make use of deceitful practices, and trangress the Law. The Law then must dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer strangely from the opinions of men. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be, and 'tis not fit for me to tax either with an error.</p>

Do we read in any Book that <hi>Miltiades, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> or <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> were ever nice or costly in their Diet. I would have no man to commend a General for the goodness, the neatness, or the magnificence of his Table, till he had so exhausted himself on the subject of a victory, on the taking of a Town, or some other great Action, that he had nothing left to mention in his praise. Nay, I could be glad to see a General desirous to avoid such a commendation.</p>
                     <p>* <hi>Hermippus</hi> makes himself a slave to what he calls his little conveniencies. All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practices, all establish'd customs, all fashions, nay decency itself, must fall a sacrifice to them. He will find some in every thing: A less makes room for a greater, and not one is neglected of which the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is practicable. He makes them his whole study, and there is not a day but what produces some new contrivance of this kind. He leaves it for others to have set Dinners and Suppers; as for his part, the very name of 'em is loathsome to him; he eats when he is hungry, and of such meats only that suits best with his Appetite. He stands by at the making of his Bed; what hand is so skilful or so happy as to make him sleep according to his mind? He seldom goes abroad. He loves to keep his Chamber, where he is neither idle nor busie, where, (in the garb of a man that has took Physick) he does nothing, and yet is continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.

Others, like slaves, must wait the leisure of a Smith or a Joyner, according to their occasions. As for him, he keeps a File by him, if any thing is to be smooth'd; a Saw if it must be cut, and Pincers if it must be pluckt out. Imagin if you can, any Tools that he has not, or that he has, and which are not better and more convenient, according to his fancy, than even those that Workmen use. He hath some that are new and unknown; that have no name, that are the contrivances of his own brain, and which he has almost forgot the use of. There is no man to be compar'd to him for the quick performance of a useless labour. He was forc'd to walk ten steps, to go from his Bed to his Wardrobe; he has now so contriv'd his Chamber, as to reduce these ten to nine: What abundance of steps here are sav'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole course of his life? With others it is usual to turn the Key, to thrust backward or to pull forward, and the Door opens; what a fatigue is this! Here is one unnecessary motion which he knows how to spare; by what means? 'Tis a mystery which he keeps to himself: He indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands extremely well the use of Springs, and is a great master of Mechanick, such Mechanicks at least, as the world can be without. <hi>Hermippus</hi> brings light to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another way than than through the Window; he has already met with the secret of going up and down the house otherwise than by the stairs; and he is now studying how to go in and out with more convenieney than thro the Door.</p>

To admit 'em all, or to deny 'em all, seems equally inconvenient; and I dare say, that in this, as well as in all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things, that go beyond the common rules, there is a medium to be found between too easie a perswasion, and too stubborn an unbelief.</p>
                     <p>* Infancy can never be over-burthen'd with too many languages; and methinks that the utmost care should be taken to teach 'em to children: There is no condition of a mans life in which these are not useful to him, and lead him equally to the depths of learning, or the easier and more agreeable parts of knowledge. If this kind of study, which is so painful and so laborious, is put off till men are somewhat older, and they come to that age which is stil'd by the name of youth, either they cannot make it the object of their choice, or if they do, they find it impossible to persevere in it; 'tis to consume that time in the quest of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which is set apart for the use that ought to be made of 'em: This is to confine

to the knowledge of words, an age that wants already to go further, and seek for things; and it is at the best to have lost the finest and the most valuable years of ones life. So great and so necessary a foundation can never rightly be laid, unless it be when the soul naturally receives every thing, and is capable of deep impressions, when the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is fresh, quick, and steady; when the mind and the heart are void of passions, cares and desires; and when those that have a right to dispose of us, design us for long and painful labours.

Thus let this method of studying quite convince you that mens laziness is the thing that hath encourag'd Pedantism to encrease the bulk of Libraries, rather than the worth of 'em, to sink the Text under the weight of Comment; and that it has in this done itself wrong, and acted contrary to its own interest, inasmuch as it hath encreas'd that reading, those enquiries, and that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which it endeavour'd to avoid.</p>

Does this proceed from use or from reason? Is it for healths sake that men wear their Cloaths up to their Chin, that they put on a Ruff or a Band, when they have heretofore for so many ages

gone with their Breast open? Is it decency that obliges 'em to do this, especially in a time where they have found a way to appear naked with all their Cloaths upon 'em? And on the other side, women that shew their Breasts and their Shoulders, are they of a less tender complexion than men, or less subject to decency? What kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty is this, which engages these to hide their Legs and their Feet, and at the same time gives 'em leave to let their Arms go naked up to the Elbow?

                     <p>* Quotations from profane Authors, cold similies, lifeless exaggerations, Antitheses and Hyperboles, are out of doors. Elaborate descriptions are in a fair way of following 'em, and of making room for the plain expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Gospel, joyn'd to the other means that effect Conversion.</p>
                     <p>* The man for whom I have so impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wisht, but whom I durst not hope for in our age, is at last arriv'd. The Courtiers, whose good taste and knowledge in decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies cou'd best distinguish him, have applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to the Skies; and what is a thing

almost incredible, have left the King's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to mix themselves with the croud, and hear the Word of God preach'd by this truly Apostolick man. The City was not of the same opinion with the Court. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Church he preach'd there, not one of the Parishioners was to be found; the very Clerk and Sexton deserted. However, their own and the neighbouring Ministers stuck to him and supply'd their vacant places. This is no more than what I ought to have foreseen, who knew before the invincible power of custom, or else indeed I might have been apt to say, that such a man had no more to do but to shew himself and to be follow'd, to speak and to be heard. 'Tis about these thirty years that your Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Declaimers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been the only Preachers in request, and such especially, like Painters, who can at pleasure draw in great or little. 'Tis not long since the Points and Witticisms that were us'd in Sermons, were so smart and so ingenious, that they might have serv'd for Epigrams. Now, I confess, they are something soften'd, but I fancy that they can't pass still in any thing but Madrigals.

In fine, to recollect what has been said, to abridge this division, and so form a Scheme of — What still, cry you, new matter, new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for a discourse of an hour longer. 'Tis in vain, the more these Gentlemen strive to digest and clear it to me, the less I shall understand it. I believe you indeed very easily, for 'tis the most natural effect of such a mass and confusion of Idea's, which come all to one and the same thing, but with which they unmercifully burthen the memories of their hearers. To see 'em tho affect and persist in this custom, one would almost think that the Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was ty'd up to such enormous divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.

                     <p>* The man must have some Wit who can charm the people in a florid discourse, who makes Morality to divert 'em, and can please 'em with figures, beautiful passages and descriptions. But after all, he has not so much Wit as he shou'd have.

                     <p>* The Heroick Virtue of great men may be reproach'd with this, that it has cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Eloquence, or at least enervated the style of most Preachers, who instead of joyning with the people in their praises to Heaven for its extraordinary gifts on those persons, have associated themselves with

                     <p>* The men of the Gown and of the Sword are alike in this particular. They run a greater risque, but then they make their fortune sooner than those of another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>

                     <p>* The Orator preaches to gain a Bishoprick. The Apostle to gain Souls. The latter deserves what the other generally goes away with.</p>

                     <p>On the contrary, there are some holy men, whose Character seems to prevent their perswasion. They appear, and all the people who attend to hear 'em are mov'd, and are, as it were, already perswaded by their presence. Their Discourse afterwards does the rest.</p>

Masters of the Eloquence of the Pulpit, have had the fate of other great Models; one of 'em has made a great many ill censurers, the other a great many ill imitators.</p>
                     <p>* The eloquence of the Pulpit, with respect to what is meerly humane, and what depends on the genius of the Orator, is conceal'd, and its difficulty known but to very few. How much art must there be, to please at the same time that you perswade! You are oblig'd to walk in none but beaten paths, to say what has been said, and what is foreseen that you wou'd say. The subjects are great, but they are worn and stale. The principles are certain, but every one of the Auditory perceives the inference at the first glance. Others of the subjects are sublime, but who can treat of the sublime? There are mysteries to be explain'd, but they are better explain'd by the plainest instruction, than the most rhetorical Harangue. The Morals too of the Pulpit, though they comprehend mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as vast and as diversify'd as the manners of men, yet all turn upon the same hinge, return all to the same Image, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely more confin'd than Satire. After the common invective against Honours, Riches, and Pleasures, there remains no more for the Orator to do, but to close up his discourse, and to dismiss the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If sometimes there are tears shed, or any one by a serious attention is mov'd, tis not attributed to the genius or character of the Preacher, but to the subject that preaches
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53908:211"/>
itself, or to self-interest, that gives the chief concernment. 'Tis not own'd that it was so much the force of eloquence, as the stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy resoluteness of the Missionary, that shook us, and gave us these emotions. In short, the Divine is not furnish't as the Lawyer, with matters of fact always new, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent events and unheard of adventures. His business is not to start doubtful questions, to improve probable conjectures. All noble subjects that elevate the Genius, tho they give him force and compass, yet they rather put a constraint on his Eloquence, than fix and direct it. He must, on the contrary, draw his discourse from a Spring common to all. If he deserts his common places, he ceases to be popular. He is either too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, or he declaims: He no longer preaches the Gospel: A noble simplicity is all that he has occasion for, but 'twill cost him dear to attain it. 'Tis a Talent rare, and above the reach of ordinary men. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Fancy, Learning, and Memory, are so far from helping, that they often hinder the attaining it.</p>
                     <p>The profession of a Lawyer is laborious, toylsome, and requires in the Person that undertakes it, a rich fund and stock of his own. He is not like the Preacher provided with a number of Harangues compos'd at leisure, got by heart, and repeated with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without contradiction, and which being alter'd a little here and there, do him service and credit more than once. His
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53908:211"/>
Pleadings are grave, spoke before those Judges, who may command him silence, and against adversaries who are sure to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him. This obliges him to be sharp and ready at repartee. In one and the same day he pleads in several Courts and about different matters. His house neither affords him shelter nor rest. 'Tis open to all that come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex him, with their difficult and doubtful cases. He is not put to Bed, rubb'd down, nor is supported with Cordials. His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not a Rendezvous of people of all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Sexes, to congratulate him upon the beauty and politeness of his Language. All the repose he has after a large discourse, is immediately to set to work upon Writings still longer. His trouble continues, he only varies his fatigues, I may venture to say, he is in his way what the first Apostoli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>After this distinction of the Eloquence of the Bar, the profession of a Lawyer, and the eloquence of the Pulpit, and the office of a Preacher, 'twill be granted, that 'tis easier to preach, than to plead, but more difficult to preach well, than to plead well.</p>
                     <p>* What a vast advantage has a discourse that's spoken over one that's written! Men are bubbl'd by tone and action; if there be but never so little pre-engagement in favour of the person that speaks, they admire him, and set themselves to comprehend him; they commend his performance before he has begun, the Sermon time they sleep, and only
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53908:212"/>
wake to applaud him. There are none who so warmly engage in behalf of an Author. His works are Read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are not publick meetings to cry him up; no party zealous to prefer him to all his Rivals, and to advance him to the Prelacy. His Book, how excellent soever it may be, is read, but with an intention to find it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Every leaf is folded down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vast. 'Tis not like sounds, lost in the Air and forgotten, what is printed remains so. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis expected a month or two before it comes out, with an impatience to damn it. The greatest pleasure that some find in it, is to Criticize on it. 'Tis a Vexation to 'em to meet with passages in every Page, which ought to please, nay, often they are afraid of being, diverted and quit a Book only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis good. Every body do's not pretend to be a Preacher. The Phrases, Figures, Memory and Gown of a Divine, are things all people are not fond of appropriating to themselves; whereas every one imagines that he thinks well, and that he can express himself still better than he thinks, which makes him less favourable, to one that thinks and writes as well as himself. In a word, the Parson is advanc'd to a Bishoprick, sooner than the most judicious Writer is to a small Priory. New Favours still are heap'd on him, while the more deserving Author is content to take up with his refuse.</p>

                     <p>HAve they who value themselves so much upon the title of Wits, have they, I say, wit enough to perceive that they are only call'd so by Irony? What greater want of wisdom can there be, than to be doubtful of the principle of ones own being, life, sence, knowledge, and of what will be the end of them? What can more lessen any man than his questioning whither his Soul is not material, like a Stone or a Worm, or subject to corruption, like the vilest Creatures? And is it not a much more real and a nobler sort of wit that raises our minds to the Idea of a being superiour to all others, by whom and for whom all things were made, who is perfect and pure, who never had a beginning, nor will never have an end, of whom our Soul is the image: nay, of whom, if I may so speak, it makes a part, being Spiritual and Immortal?</p>
                     <p>* A tractable and a foolish Mind are both susceptible of impressions; but good impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53908:214"/>
are the lot of the one, and ill ones of the other: That is, the first suffers himself to be persuaded, and then sticks to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, the other is conceited and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that the tractable mind admits of true Religion, the foolish of a false one, or of none at all. Now the modish Wit either has no Religion at all, or has one of his own invention.

                     <p>* By a worldly, earthly or brutish man, I mean one whose heart and mind is wholly fix'd on this small part of the Universe he is plac'd in, the Earth. One who sets a value upon nothing, nor loves any thing beyond it. Whose narrow soul is as much confin'd as that spot of ground he calls his Estate. The extent of which is easily measur'd, the acres are all number'd, and the utmost bounds are limited. 'Tis no wonder that such one, who leans as it were on an Atome, should stumble at the first step in his search after Truth. That with so short a sight he should not reach beyond the Heavens and the Stars, to behold God himself. That not being able to perceive the excellence of what is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or the dignity of the Soul, he should feel as little how difficult it is to satisfie its appetites: How much the whole world is insufficient for it: How indispencably this makes it want an all perfect being, which is God: And how absolutely it needs a Religion to find out that God, and to be assur'd of his reality. And any one, on the contrary, may
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53908:214"/>
soon be perswaded that incredulity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency is but natural to such a man: That he will make use of God and Religion as a piece of Policy only; that is, as far as it may give a fair outside; or keep in some order the things relating to his worldly concerns, which alone, in his opinion, deserve to have any thoughts bestow'd on them.</p>
                     <p>* Some men, by travelling give the last stroke to the corrupting of their Judgment and their Manners, and extinguish wholly that spark of Religion they had left: Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily with new ways of Worship, new Manners, new Rites and Ceremonies, they imitate those who wander about the shops before they have resolv'd what kind of stuff to buy. Variety of choice disables them from choosing. Each piece hath something which pleases their fancy; yet unable to fix upon any, they always come out without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chacing.</p>
                     <p>* The practice of Religion and Devotion is deferr`d by some till lewdness and impiety are profess'd by all. It being then like the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, they will avoid following the crowd. They are delighted with singularity in so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and so important a subject. They would only follow the mode in things of no moment, and which have no consequence; nay, they have, for ought I know, already plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

may be such, that one would scorn to believe like the learned, much more the ignorant.</p>
                     <p>* A man in health questions whether there is a God, as he does whether Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a sin. If he's sick and given over, his Miss is laid aside, and the dread of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker leaves no room for his doubts.</p>
                     <p>* Your modish Wits or Libertines should examin themselves thoroughly before they set up for such, that at least, and indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own principles, they might dye as they have liv'd. Or if they find their stock of wit is like to fail at the approaches of death, that they might be contented to live as they must dye.</p>
                     <p>* A Jest in a dying man is very unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. If apply'd to certain subjects it is dreadful. To bequeath to others matter of laughter, at the expence of one's own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness, is extreamly dismal.</p>
                     <p>Let prejudice make you fancy what you please of a future state, dying is still a most serious work, which becomes constancy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than jest or raillery.</p>
                     <p>* There have been in all ages many of those learned and ingenious persons, who, embracing like Slaves the loose principles of some great men, have groan'd under their yoak, against the dictates of their own minds and consciences all their life time: who never liv'd but for other men, the humouring of whom, one would think they had look'd upon to be the chief end of their Creation. Who have been ashamed to be seen by them
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53908:215"/>
to work out their own Salvation, and to appear outwardly such as they were perhaps within their hearts. Who have run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into their own ruin, out of weakness and complaisance. Shall we then imagine that this world can bestow so much greatness and power on any mortal man, as he shou'd deserve, that his will, his humour, or his fancy shou'd be the rule of our belief and of our lives? Nay, that we shou'd be such Courtiers, at our very deaths, as to make such an exit, not as we think is like to be safest for our own Souls, but as we hope will be most pleasing to him?</p>
                     <p>* One would expect from those who act contrary to all the world besides, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict such principles as are receiv'd by all, that they knew more than other men, that their reasons were plain, and their arguments convincing.</p>

I took up with this principle too readily from my childhood, and my sticking close to it afterwards, hath been too natural, for me ever to have the least jealousie of any falshood in it. Ay, but there are some men who make a shift to forsake this principle. I question whether there are or no. But if there be, it argues that there are Monsters.</p>

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53908:220"/>
never thinks his Life too long, and would perhaps consent to live for ever. What he sees of Death makes a deeper impression on his mind than what he knows of it. The fear of pain and sickness, the horror of the Grave make him lose the desire of knowing another World. And the strongest motives of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can but just bring him to receive his doom with submission.</p>
                     <p>* Had God left it to our choice to dye, or to live for ever: And did we consider how dismal it is for a man to see no end of his Poverty, Subjection, Sickness or Sorrow; or at best, to enjoy Riches, Greatness, Health, and Pleasure, with an absolute necessity of exchanging them shortly for their contraries, by the continual vicis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having ty'd us to the former, saves us the labour of choosing. And the necessity of dying is made easy by Religion.</p>
                     <p>* If my Religion be false, it is a snare at least which you must own to be laid with such temptations that I could not avoid rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it, and being intangl'd by it.

Set open the Books of History, run it over through all its parts; take it from the beginning of the world, and even from before that, if you can; was there ever any thing like this? Could all the power of God himself have laid a fitter plot to seduce me? How then shall I escape? Whether shall I run?

Denying the Being of a God would indeed suit my inclinations much better, than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my self to be deluded, though by so plausible and so specious a pretence. But I have examin'd thoroughly, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd all I could, and still want the power of being an Atheist. This then must be my doom, and I am forc'd again to stick to my Religion.</p>
                     <p>* The grounds on which Religion is founded, are either true or false. If false, the Religious man, and the strictest observer of all the precepts of Self-denial ventures no more than just the loss of threescore years, which I'll allow to be foolishly bestow'd. But if true, the vicious man is of all men most miserable: And I tremble at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts of what unutterable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible torments I see him daily heaping upon himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* Those who dare presume to deny the Being of a God, hardly deserve that one should strive to demonstrate it to them, or at least that one should argue with them with more seriousness than I have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. They are for the generality so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that it makes them unqualify'd for the understanding of the clearest principles, and of the truest and most natural inferences.

                     <p>Forty years ago I was not, neither was it in my power ever to be, any more than now that I am, it is in my power to cease from being.

                     <p>I exist: But this existence of mine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, you'll say, from the power only of an universal nature, which has been such as we see it now, from all Eternity. But this nature is either only spiritual, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tis God; or only material, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not create that part of my
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53908:221"/>
Being which is spiritual, my Soul; or else it is a compound of Spirit and Matter, and then that part of it, which you say is a Spirit, is that which I call God.</p>
                     <p>Again: Perhaps you'll add, that what I call my Soul, is nothing but a part of Matter which subsists through the power of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Nature, which also is material, which always was and ever will be such as we see it now: and which is not God. But at least you must grant, that what I call my Soul, let it be what it will, is something which thinks: That if it is made up of Matter, it is such a Matter as thinks, for you can never beat it into me, that at the time I am thus arguing, there is not something within me that thinks. Now this something, since you will have it to owe its being and its preservation to an universal Nature, which always was and every will be as to the first cause of both, it necessarily follows, that this universal Nature either thinks, or is nobler and more perfect than that which thinks. And if nature thus describ'd is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then it must be an universal Matter that thinks, or which is nobler and more perfect than that which does think.</p>
                     <p>I proceed further, and I say, that such an universal Matter, if it be not a Chimerical but a real being, may be perceiv'd by some of our sences; and that if it cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in it self, it may be known at least through the various order of its different parts which forms all Bodies, and makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53908:222"/>
betwixt them. Matter, then, is it self all these different Bodies; now since, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the supposition, Matter is a being which thinks, or is better than that which thinks, it follows, that it is such in some of these bodies, at least, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Stones, in Minerals, in the Earth, in the Sea, in my self, who am but a Body, as well as in all its other parts. I am then beholden for this something, which thinks within me, and which I call my Soul, to all these gross, earthy and bodily parts, which being laid together make up this Universal Matter, or this visible World. Which is absur'd.</p>
                     <p>If, on the contrary, this Universal Nature, let it be what it will, is not all those Bodies, it follows that it is not Matter, and cannot be perceiv'd by any of our sences. And if, notwithstanding this, it has the faculty of thinking, or is more perfect than that which has the faculty of thinking, I still conclude that it is a Spirit, or something better and more perfect than a Spirit. Now if that which thinks within me, and which I call my Soul, not finding its Principle in it self, and much less in Matter, as has been just now demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, is forced to acknowledge this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Nature to be the first Cause, and the only Spring, from whence it derives its being; I'll not dispute about words. But this original Spring, of all its spiritual beings, which is it self a Spirit, or which is better than a Spirit, is that which I call God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="431" facs="tcp:53908:222"/>In a word I think, therefore there is a God. For that which thinks within me is not a gift, which I can pretend to have bestow'd on my self, since it was no more in my power to be the Author of it at first, than it is now, to be the preserver of it for one minute. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it not from a Being which is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to me and which is not material, since it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Matter to be superior to that which thinks. From whence it follows, that I must have receiv'd it from a being which is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to me, and which is not material. And that superior Being is God.</p>
                     <p>* From the inconsistence of an universal Nature, which has the faculty of thinking, with any thing that's material, must necessarily be inferr'd, that any particular being, which has the faculty of thinking is also and equally inconsistent with any thing that is material. For though the Idea of an universal being, which hath the faculty of thinking, includes infinitely more Power, Independance, and Capacity, than that of a particular being, which hath the faculty of thinking, yet it does not imply a greater inconsistance with Matter, it being impossible for this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to be greatest in either, because it is, as it were, infinite in both. And it is as impossible, that what thinks within me, should be Matter, as it is inconceivable that God should be Matter. As God therefore is a Spirit, so my Soul also is a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>* I cannot positively know whether a Dog is Master of memory, love, fear, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or thought, of the faculty of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:53908:223"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When therefore I am told that those actions in a Dog, which seem'd to be the effect of either passion or sentiment, proceed naturally and without choice from the disposition of the material parts of its Body, which like Clock-work, put it under an absolute necessity of moving thus, I may perhaps acquiesce in this Doctrine: but as for me, I think, and I certainly know that I think. Now if one considers this or that disposition of material parts, which altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up what body you please, that is, an extent which wants no dimensions, which has its length, breadth, and depth, which may be divided in all these respects; pray what proportion is there betwixt such an extent and that which thinks?</p>
                     <p>* If all things are Matter, and if thinking in me, as well as in all other men, is an effect only of the disposition of the parts of Matter, what brought into the world a notion abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely foreign from the Idea of any thing that is material? Can Matter produce so pure, so simple, so immaterial an Idea, as that we have of a Spirit? Can Matter be the principal of that which denies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes itself from its own Being? How is it in man that which thinks; that is, that which is a conviction to man that he is not material?</p>
                     <p>* There are Beings which last not long, because they are made up of things which differ much in their nature, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to each other. There are others
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53908:223"/>
more lasting, because they are more simple, but they perish at last, being made up of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, into which they may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. That which thinks within me must needs last very long, since it is a very pure being, free from all mixture and compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is no occasion why it shou'd pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, for what can corrupt or divide a simple being, which has no parts?</p>
                     <p>* The Soul sees colours through the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the Eye, and hears sounds thro the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the Ear, but it may cease either from seeing or hearing, when those sences on those objects are remov'd, and yet not cease from being, because the Soul is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which sees or hears, it is only that which thinks. Now how can it cease from being such? Not through the want of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, since it has been prov'd that it is not material. Nor through the want of objects, as long as there is a God and eternal Truths, so fit for its contemplation: It is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</p>

A little lower a Rivulet, whose stream run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning amongst the Willows and Poplars, was once hardly taken notice of, is now become a famous Canal, and its Banks supported with Free-stone.

You'll rather commend the order, the disposition of them, the judgment and skill of the ingenious Contriver. My thoughts will be the same with yours, and I'll suppose this must be the dwelling of one of those men who, from the very minute, they get into place, think on nothing but on the laying the Foundation of some great and sumptuous Palace.

                     <p>You are plac'd, <hi>Lucilius,</hi> on some part of this Atome; you must needs be very little, since you hold there is so little room.

And the truth is, that what makes it so great in appearance, is its proximity only: Its distance from us being no more than thirty times the Diameter of the Earth, or three hundred thousand miles Nay, and its course is nothing, in comparison of the prodigious long race of the Sun, thro the spacious Firmament. For it is certain it runs not above sixteen hundred and twenty thousand miles a day, which is not above sixty seven thousand five hundred miles an hour, or one thousand one hundred and five and twenty miles a minute. And yet to compleat this Course, it must run five thousand six hundred times faster than a Race-Horse, that goes twelve miles an hour. It must be eighty times swifter than the sound, than the noise, for example, of a Cannon, or of the Thunder, which flies eight hundred and one and thirty miles an hour.</p>
                     <p>But if you'll oppose the Moon to the Sun, with respect to its greatness, its distance, or its course, you shall find there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to be made betwixt 'em. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

only that the Diameter of the Earth is nine thousand miles: That of the Sun's is a hundred times as large, which is nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand miles. Now if this be the breadth of it every way, judge you what its superficies, what its solidity must be. Do you apprehend the vastness of this extent, and that a million of such Globes as the Earth being laid together, would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Sun in bigness. How great will you cry must then the distance of it be, if one may judge of it by its smallness in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. 'Tis true, it is prodigious great; it is demonstrated that the Sun's distance from the Earth, can be no less than ten thousand times the Diameter of the Earth. Or, which is all one, than ninety millions of miles: Nay, and it may be four times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps six times, perhaps ten times as much, for ought we know. There is no method found out for the computing of it.</p>
                     <p>Now, for the help of your apprehension, let us suppose a Mill-stone falling from the Sun upon the Earth, let it come down with all the swiftness imaginable, and even swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the heaviest body's falling from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so high; let us also suppose that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves always the same swiftness, without acquiring a greater, or losing from that it already has; that it advances forty yards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very second, which is half the heighth of the highe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53908:225"/>
be two thousand six hundred and forty yards, which is a mile and an half, its fall will be three miles in two minutes, ninety miles in an hour, and two thousand one hundred and sixty miles in a day. Now it must fall ninety millions of miles before it comes down to the Earth, so that it can't be less than forty one thousand six hundred and sixty six days, which is above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty years in performing this journey. Let not all this fright you, <hi>Lucili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> I'll tell you more. The distance of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> from the Earth, is at least ten times as much as the Sun's, so that it is no less than nine hundred thousand millions of miles, and that this Stone would be above eleven hundred and forty years in falling down from <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Now by this elevation of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s, raise your imagination so high, if you can, as to conceive the immensity of its daily course. The Circle which <hi>Saturn</hi> describes, has above eighteen hundred millions of miles Diameter, and consequently above five thousand four hundred millions of miles circumference: So that a Race-Horse, which I'll suppose to run thirty miles an hour, must be twenty thousand five hundred and forty eight years in taking this round.</p>
                     <p>I have not said all, <hi>Lucilius,</hi> that can be said on the miracle of this visible world: Or, to speak more like your self, on the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Chance, which alone you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be the first cause of all things. It is

still more wonderful in its operations than you imagin. Learn what Chance is: Or, rather be instructed in the knowledge of all the power of your God. Do you know that this distance of the Sun from the Earth, which is ninety millions of miles, and that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which is nine hundred millions of miles, are so inconsiderable, if oppos'd to that of the other Stars, that no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can express the true measure of the latter. For indeed, what proportion is there betwixt any thing that can be measur'd, let its extent be what it will, and that which it is impossible to measure? The heighth of a Star cannot be known, it is, if I may so speak, immensurable. All Angles, Sinuses, and Paralaxes become useless, if one goes about to compute it. And should one man observe a fixed Star from <hi>Paris,</hi> and another from <hi>Iapan,</hi> the two lines that should reach f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But tho Stars have this in common with <hi>Saturn</hi> and the Sun, and I should express something more. If then two Astronomers should stand, the one on the Earth, and the other in the Sun, and from thence should observe one Star at the same time, the two visual rays of these two Astronomers should not in appearance form an Angle. But that you may conceive the same thing another way,

should a man be plac'd on one of the Stars; this Sun, this Earth, and the ninety millions of miles that are betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Tis for this reason that the distance there is betwixt any two Stars, tho they appear never so near one another, is not to be measur'd.

There is a Star seems to be plac'd on one of those which make the Tail of the <hi>Great Bear;</hi> your sight can hardly perceive that part of the Heavens which divides 'em, they make together as it were but one double Star: Yet if the most skilful Astronomers cannot with all their Art find out their distance from each other, how far asunder must two Stars be which appear remote from one another? And how much farther yet the two Polar Stars? How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious the length of that line, which reaches from one to the other? How immense the Circle which this line is the Diameter of? How unfathomable the solidity of the Globe, which this Circle is but a Section of? Shall we still wonder that these Stars, though so exceeding great, seem no larger to us than so many Sparks?

                     <p>Behold then the Earth on which we tread, it hangs loose like a grain of Sand in the air. A multitude of fiery Globes, the vastness of whose bulk confounds my imagination, and whose heighth exceeds the reach of my conceptions, all perpetually rowling round this grain of Sand, has been for above these six thousand years, and are still daily, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the wide, the immense spaces of the Heavens. Or if you desire an other, and yet as wonderful a system; the Earth itself is turning round the Sun, which is the center of the Universe, with a swiftness that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes my imagination. Methinks I see the motion of all these Globes, the orderly march of these prodigious bodies; they never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, never hit, never touch one another, should but the least of them happen to start aside, and to run against the Earth, what must become of the Earth?

the tracts which are laid before them. And this, at least, with respect to us, is done with so little noise, that the vulgar knows not that there are such Bodies. What a strange and wonderful effect of chance! Could intelligence itself have done any thing beyond this? One only thing I cannot understand, <hi>Lucilius.</hi> These vast bodies are so exact and so constant in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> courses, in their revolutions, and their relations to each other, that a little Animal, being confin'd in a corner of that wide space, which is call'd the world, having made their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on them, has contriv'd an exact and an infallible method of foretelling in what degree of their respective Courses every one of these Stars will be two thousand; four thousand, nay, twenty thousand years hence. Here lyes my scruple, <hi>Lucilius</hi>: If it be by chance that they observe such constant rules; what is order, and what are rules?</p>
                     <p>Nay, I'll ask you what is chance? is it a Body, is it a Spirit, is it a Being which you distinguish from all other Beings, which has a particular existence, or which resides in any place? Or rather, is it not a mode or a fashion of Being? When a Bowl runs against a Stone, we are apt to say it is a chance: but is it any thing more than the accidental hitting of these bodies one against the other? If by this chance, or this hitting the Bowl, it changes its strait course into an oblique one, if its direct motion becomes more contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if ceasing from rowling on its Axis, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

winds and whirls like a top, shall I from thence infer, that motion in general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in this Bowl from the same chance? Shall I not rather suspect that the Bowl owe it to itself, or to the impulse of the arm that threw it? Or because the circular motions of the wheels of a Clock are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, the one by the other in their degrees of swiftness, shall I be less curious in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what may be the cause of all these motions? Whether it lyes in the wheels themselves, or is derived from the moving faculty of a weight that gives 'em the swing? But neither these Wheels nor this Bowl could produce this motion in themselves. And it does not lye in their own nature, if they can be depriv'd of it without changing this nature. It is therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> likely that they are mov'd some other way, and through a foreign power: And as for the Coelestial Bodies, if they should be depriv'd of their motion, should therefore their nature be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd? Should they cease from being bodies? I can't believe they should: Yet they move; and since they move not of themselves, nor by their own nature, one would examine, <hi>Lucilius,</hi> whether there is not some principle without 'em that causes this motion. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you find it, I call it God.</p>
                     <p>Shou'd we suppose these great bodies to be without motion indeed, I could not ask who moves 'em. But I should still be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to inquire who made them, as I may examine who made these Wheels or this

If so, then it existed a minute before it did exist. It was and it was not at the same time. And if it be the Author of its own being, and of its manner of being, why made it itself a Body rather than a Spirit?</p>
                     <p>Or else had this Atome no beginning? Is it Eternal? Is it Infinite? Will you make a God of this Atome?</p>

                     <p>One may observe in a drop of Water, that a little Pepper which has been steep'd in it, has excited the thirst of an infinite number of small Animals, whose figure may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with the help of a Magnifying-glass, and who are moving to and fro, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible swiftness, like so many Monsters in the wide Ocean. Each of these small Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53908:229"/>
is a thousand times less than a Mite, and yet is a body that lives, which receives nourishment, which grows, which must not only have Muscles, but such Vessels also as are equivalent to Veins, Nerves, and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and a Brain to make a distribution of its Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>A bit of any thing that is mouldy, tho it be no bigger than a grain of Sand, appears thro a Microscope like a heap of many Plants, of which some are plainly seen to bear Flowers, and other Fruits, some have buds only, and others are wither'd. How extreamly small must be the Roots and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers through which these little plants receive their nourishment. And if one considers that these plants bear their own Seed as well as Oaks or Pines, or that these small Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are multiply'd by generation, as well as Elephants and Whales, whether will not such observations lead one? Who could work all these things, which are so fine, so exceeding small, that no eye can perceive 'em, and that they, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would not one think it was the same Being who made, and who moves with so much ease, the Heavens and the Stars, those vast Bodies which are so wonderful in their bigness, their elevation, the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the prodigious extent of their Courses?</p>
                     <p>* Man enjoys the Sun, the Stars, the Heavens and their influences, as much as he
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:53908:229"/>
does the Air he breathes, and the Earth on which he treads and by which he is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is Matter of Fact, and if, besides the fact, I were to prove the probability of the thing, and that it is fitting he should do so, I might easily make it out, since the Heavens and all that is contain'd in them are not to be compar'd, in nobleness and dignity, with one of the meanest men on Earth. And since there can be no other porportion betwixt them, than what there is betwixt Matter, which is destitute of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, and is only an extent according to three dimensions; and a spiritual, a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or an intelligent Being. And if any one says that all these things might have serv'd for the preservation of Man, I answer, that less could not have serv'd for the Glory of God, and for the magnifying of his power, his goodness, and his magnificence, since let his works be never so great and wonderful, they might still have been infinitely greater.</p>
                     <p>The whole universe, if it be made for man, is, in a literal sense, the least thing that God has done for man, the proof of which may be drawn from Religion. Man is therefore neither presumptuous nor vain, when, submitting to the evidence of Truth, he owns the advantages he has receiv'd, and might be tax'd with blindness and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, did he refuse to yield himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd thro the multitude of proofs which Religion lays before him; to shew him the

Ay, but the Moon is inhabited, at least we don't know but it may. What, and to how little purpose is it you talk of the Moon, <hi>Lucilius.</hi> If you own there is a God, nothing indeed is impossible. But do you design to ask whether it is on us alone that God has bestow'd such great blessings? Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let the Nations who inhabit the Celestial Globes, whatever those Nations are, be mindful of their own concerns. They have their cares, and we have ours.

we'll consider, whether those men are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians or no, and whether God has made 'em to share his favours with us.</p>
                     <p>* Many millions of years, nay, many thousand millions of years; in a word, as many as can be comprehended within the limits of time, are but an instant, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the duration of God, who is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The spaces of the whole universe are but a point of an Atome, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with his Immensity. If it be so, as I affirm it is; for what proportion can there be between what is finite and what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; I ask what is a man's life, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a grain of Sand, which is call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are prosperous while they live: Yes, some of them are, I own. Virtue is opprest, and Vice remains unpunish'd: It happens so sometimes, 'tis true. This is then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: No, not at all. You should have prov'd, to draw this conclusion, the wicked absolutely happy, the virtuous absolutely depriv'd of happiness, and vice absolutely and always remaining unpunish'd. That short time in which the good are opprest, and the wicked are prosperous, should, at least, have a duration. What we call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and good fortune, should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a false appearance, or a vain shadow which vanishes away. This Atome, the Earth, in which Virtue and Vice so seldom meet with their deserts, should be
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:53908:231"/>
the only stage on which they are to receive their pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I can't infer more clearly, from my thinking that I am a Spirit, than I conclude from what I do or do not, according as I please, that I am free. Now freedom is the power of choosing, or of taking a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary determination towards good or evil, so that the doing of good or evil is what is call'd Virtue or Vice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> For Vice to remain absolutely unpunish'd would be an injustice, 'tis true. For Vice to remain unpunish'd on Earth is a mystery only; yet, let us, with the Atheist, suppose that an injustice too. All injustice is a negation or a privation of justice, therefore all injustice supposes a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: All justice is a conformity to a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign reason. I'll ask you then, whether it has not ever been just that Vice should be punish'd: Yes certainly, and the denying of it would be as ridiculous, as if one should pretend to say, that a Triangle has not three Angles. Now all conformity to reason is a truth: This conformity, as I said just now, always was. It may then be included in the number of what we call eternal truths: but this truth either is, not and cannot be, or else it is the object of a knowledge. This knowledge therefore is eternal, and this eternal knowledge is God.</p>
                     <p>The most secret crimes are discover'd so easily, notwithstanding all the care that has been taken to prevent their being brought to light: And such discoveries seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:53908:231"/>
so naturally, even from the darkest plots that the Authors of those crimes could invent to hide their guilt, that one would think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God could have produc'd those unexpected events. The number of these discoveries is so great, that those who are pleas'd to attribute them to chance, must own at least, that from all ages the effects of chance have been most wonderful.</p>
                     <p>* If you suppose that every man on Earth, without exception, is rich, and wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I'll infer from thence, that there is never a man on Earth but what is poor, and wants every thing. There are but two sorts of riches, which comprehend all the rest, Money and Land. If all were rich, who would be a Husbandman to cultivate the Earth; or who would dig and rip up its Bowels to find out Gold or Silver. Those who live remote from any place where Gold and Silver lies, could not dig for Gold and Silver: And those who inhabit barren Lands, which produce nothing but Minerals, should hardly reap any Fruits. Ay, but Trade, it is to be suppos'd, would supply both the one and the other. But should all men abound in riches, so that none were under a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of living by his labour, who would be troubl'd with transporting from one place to another, your Gold, your Silver, or any thing that were bought or barter'd? Who would fit out your Ships? Who would take care of conducting of them to their respective ports? Who wou'd travel in Caravannes?
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:53908:232"/>
Even necessaries and the most useful things would then be wanted by every one. To banish necessity from the Earth, were to bid an adieu to all Arts and Sciences, all Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Handicrafts; besides, such an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongst men, as to their riches and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, would occasion the like, as to their ranks in the World; would banish all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and would reduce men to have no Servants but themselves, to receive no help nor succour from each other, would make Laws frivolous and useless, would draw after it an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If on the other hand, you suppose all men to be poor and indigent, in vain the Sun enlightens our Horizon; in vain it warms the Earth and renders it fruitful; in vain the Heavens pour out their influences on it; in vain the Rivers water it with their streams; in vain the Fields abound with Fruits; in vain the Sea, the Rocks, and the Mountains are ransack'd and rifl'd of their Treasures. But if you grant that, of all the men who are scatter'd throughout the world, some are rich and others poor, necessity then must reconcile, unite, and bind them together. Some must serve and obey, some must labour and cultivate the Earth, some must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and invent, some improve and bring their inventions to perfection; others must rule, protect, assist, communicate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.

                     <hi>Life deceives us, it promises us great pleasure in the possession of Honour, but Life and Misery begin together, which end in Death; there is often no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unprofitable than the love of reputation.

And St.
<pb facs="tcp:53908:239"/>
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> concerning the matter before cited assures us, that <hi>Theophrastus</hi> at one hundred and seven years old, taken ill of that distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of which he died, lamented that he was obliged to quit Life, at a time when he just began to be wise.</p>
                  <p>He used to say, we ought not to love Friends to try them, but to try them to love them: That Friends ought to be common amongst brethren, as all things are common amongst Friends. That you ought as soon to trust to a Horse without a Bridle as to a Man that speaks without Judgment. The greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that a man can be at, is that of his time. He said once to a person that sate silent at Table during the entertainment, If you are a Man of sense you are to blame to say nothing, but if otherwise, you do very well. These were some of his Maxims.</p>
                  <p>But if we speak of his works, they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and we cannot find that any of the Antients wrote more than <hi>Theophrastus: Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones Laertius</hi> reckoned up more than two hundred different Tracts, and the suctjects of which they treated: the greatest part of which are lost by the injuries of time, and the other remaining parts he reduces to twenty Tracts which are collected out of the Volumes of his works: there are Nine Books of the History of Plants, Six Books of their causes, he wrote of Winds, of Fire, of Stones, of Honey, of the signs of fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the signs of Tempests, of the signs of

Rain, of Smells, of Sweat, of the Vertigo, of Weariness, of the Relaxations of the Nerves, of Swooning, of Fish that live out of the Water, of Animals that change their colour, of Animals that are suddenly born, of Animals subject to envy, the Characters of Manners: these are what remain of his Writings, amongst which this last only which I translate is not inferiour in beauty to any of those which are preserved, but may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But if any one should coldly receive this moral Treatise, on the account of those things they may observe there, which are only applicable to the times in which they were wrote, and are not suitable to their Manners; what can they do more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous and obliging to themselves, than to get loose from that prepossession in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their own Customs and Manners, which they not only take up on trust without any deliberation, but peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all others contemptible, which are not conformable to them, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themselves of that pleasure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, which the reading of the Ancients would afford them.</p>

Servants; their food was wholesome and natural, the Fruits of the Earth, and the Milk of their Beasts; their Raiment plain and uniform, made of their Wool and Fleeces; their pleasures innocent; a great Crop; the marriage of their Children; a good understanding with their Neighbours; peace in their Family. Nothing can be more opposite to our Manners than all these things, but the distance of time makes us relish them, as the distance of place occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions us to receive all that the different relations, or Books of Travels inform us of remote places and strange Countrys. They tell us of one Religion, one Policy, one way of feeding, habiting, building and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War; there was no part of manners that they were ignorant of, those that approach nearest ours affect us, those that are more distant fill us with admiration, but all amuse us, less surprized at the barbarity of Manners and Customes of People so remote, which instruct and at the same time please us by their Novelty, it suffices us that those concerning whom we have the account, are <hi>Siamites, Chinese, Negroes</hi> or <hi>Abyssines.</hi>

But if we read in this Treatise the Characters of certain manners which we can't excuse, and appear ridiculous to us, we ought to remember, that <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> had the same thought of them, that he lookt upon them as vices, which he had drawn so to the Life, that the Picture would serve to shame and correct the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On the contrary, remembering that amongst the great number of Tracts of this Philosopher related, by <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> there is one under the Title of Proverbs, that is to say independant pieces, as reflections or remarks; the first and greatest Book of Morality that ever was made, bears the same name in Sacred Writ; I found my self excited, by so great models, to follow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my abilities the same method, to write of manners, and I am not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from the undertaking, by two works of Morality which are in every ones hands; and either for want of attention or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I shall not follow either of these two ways in the work, which is joined to the Translation of these Characters, it is quite different from the other two, which I spoke of, less sublime than the first, and less delicate than the second, its sole design is to render man reasonable, by plain and common ways, and examining indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently without any great regard to method, and according as the several Chapters there are directed by the Ages, Sexes and conditions, by the Vices, the foibles and ridicules which are there attackt.</p>
                  <p>I have mostly applied my self to the Vices of the mind, the secrets of the heart, and to all the interiour part of Man, which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> has not done, and I may say th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of their disorder; on the quite contrary, these new Characters imploy'd about the thoughts, sentiments and inclinations of Men, discover the principle of their Villany and Follies, making us easily foresee all that they are capable to say or do; and abate our wonder at a thousand Vicious and Frivolous actions, of which their Life is full.</p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledged, that in the Titles of these two works, the difficulty is found near equal, for those who are not pleased with the latter may make themselves amends with the former. But with relation to the Title of the Characters of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> the same Liberty cannot be allowed, because we are not Masters of another mans goods, but must follow the Spirit of the Author, and to render him according to the nearest sense of the <hi>Greek</hi> words, and at the same time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most exact conformity to their Chapters, which will be found very difficult; because very often the signification of a <hi>Greek</hi> Term translated word for word, is quite another thing in our Language; for example, Irony which with us is a raillery in conversatron or Rhetorical Trope; with <hi>Theophrastus</hi> it signifies somewhat between cheating and dissembling, which altogether is neither the one nor the other, but that very particular Vice which is described in his first Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And in other places, the <hi>Greek</hi> have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two or three terms very different to express those things that are so, which we
<pb facs="tcp:53908:244"/>
cannot render but only by one single word; this poverty of our Language doth much embarrass us.</p>

                  <p>The definitions that are at the beginning of each Chapter are very difficult, they are short and concise in <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> according to the force of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and the Style of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who furnished him with the first Ideas; I was obliged to enlarge them in the Translation to make them intelligible: there are also in this Tract some unfinisht Phrases, which make but imperfect sense, but it is easy to supply the true one. You'll find in the various readings some things very abrupt, which may admit of diverse explications; and to avoid wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering amongst these Ambiguities, I have followed the best interpreters</p>
                  <p>To conclude, as this work is nothing but a plain instruction, concerning the Manners of Men, by which 'tis rather designed to make them Wise than Learned, I think my
