            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis Tractate which I now preſent unto thee, is the fruit of my ſpare hours, it having been my recreation, for ſome time, to read the beſt Authors which I could meet with; and for the help of my memory, I have collected the choiceſt Obſervations, and the moſt infallible Prognoſticks which did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and reduced them under ſeveral Heads, diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral Chapters; which I have found very uſeful, profitable, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto me; and preſuming they may be ſo to others alſo, I have now publiſhed them to the World, that ſo they which neither have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to buy, nor leiſure to read many Volumnes, may find in this little Epitome the choiceſt, and chiefeſt things that are contained in them, touching all thoſe Diſeaſes and Symptoms which affect the Head. I have alſo inſerted many Obſervations of my own, which were never before in Print. Indeed when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb facs="tcp:103254:5"/>
the paucity of Obſervations, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially how immethodically (for the moſt part) thoſe extant are digeſted; I thought it might be worth my pains to run through the whole body of Practical Phyſick in this Method, which affords not only the Definitions, and Prognoſticks of Diſeaſes, with ſelect Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon them, but alſo their Cauſes, and Diagnoſtick ſigns, as will clearly appear to the Obſerving Reader. Yet when I had finiſhed this Tractate of the Diſeaſes of the Head, I thought it not convenient to proceed any further, but rather to put a ſtop to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpoſe, until I ſaw how this would be reſented. There can be no better means, I am ſure, to preſerve, further, and aſsiſt, the practiſing of Phyſick, then is the careful and painful penning of it, eſpecially of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For as Practice is the beſt and chiefeſt part of Phyſick; ſo is Obſervation the ſureſt, and moſt demonſtrating part of Practice: Hence it cometh to paſs, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Obſervations, that ſo many Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we meet with in the Works of moſt
<pb facs="tcp:103254:5"/>
learned Practitioners, fall often ſhort in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Cures they promiſe, and we took them up for; but Obſervations are the Touch-ſtone for the trying of what ever is not good, and what current in Phyſick. I preſume that it will be ſuperfluous for me to tell thee, what great benefit thou mayeſt reap by acquainting thy ſelf with this Tractate; for as <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> picturing <hi>Helen,</hi> drew the Liueaments from five of the faireſt Virgins of <hi>Croton:</hi> So this Book (excluding what is mine) is borrowed from the richeſt treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the beſt Phyſitians: And verily, I judge him of too mean capacity for this Art or Science, that cannot by the light of theſe things proceed into further Particulars, when need requireth.</p>
            <p>This I profeſs, that my care in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, continuing, and ending this Work, hath been for the benefit of my Country, that I might help young Students in Phyſick (as I am one my ſelf) to the attaining of ſome perfection, not eſteeming my pains, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
<pb facs="tcp:103254:6"/>
my credit: For I am not ignorant, that a large brood of pregnant Wits, fraught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with jeers, (and good ones, as they term them) will ſnarl, though themſelves either cannot, or (be it ſpoken in the beſt ſence) will not ſpare time from their pleaſures or profits to advantage others. Theſe proud wits and curious heads are ſo extreamly in love with their own ſhadows, and do ſo highly admire their own conceits, that they deſpiſe all the underſtanding and learning of other men. They will whip <hi>Homer,</hi> as did <hi>Zoilus;</hi> ſift great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as did <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> and laſh <hi>Seneca,</hi> that ſuper-intendent of Wit, Learning, and Judgment, as did <hi>Caligula, Agellius, Fabius,</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> himſelf, his chief Propugner; they have ſucked <hi>Lami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's</hi> breaſts in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who when ſhe ſate ſpinning at home laid her eyes by her in a Baſin, but put them into her head when ſhe went abroad: They are as kinde as the Cuckow, which devoureth the Bird that brought her up, and with the male Spider (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) they eat the prey, but
<pb facs="tcp:103254:6"/>
take no pains. Unwiſe were I, being empty and barren, if I thought to eſcape that which <hi>Homer,</hi> that ſweet and ſugred <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> might in no wiſe avoid. Simple were I to ſeek to evade that which the wiſeſt, and Learnedeſt, <hi>Socrates, Architas,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> could not ſhun. <hi>Zeno</hi> the poor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher could reſiſt the violence of the great King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> could withſtand the force of <hi>Philip,</hi> and yet neither of them could avoid the ſnares of thoſe that defamed their Labour, and envied their diligence in Writing, and making of Books. Indeed it is the common doom of all Writers: <hi>Scaliger</hi> makes <hi>Galen fimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Hippocratis;</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> will have them both meer Idiots, Infants in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Philoſophie: Yea, <hi>Cardan</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them alſo, for tediouſneſs obſcurity, and confuſion. If ſuch, and ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men that I could name, have ſuffered ſo much, what ſhall I expect? How ſhall I that am <hi>vix umbra tantae doctrinae,</hi> hope to pleaſe?

hateful and vile a matter is this, and a plain demonſtration of Envie, when one man of Science ſhall be asked by a ſtranger, what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he hath of another man of Science that he knoweth; he ſhall anſwer, he is a good Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſt, or he underſtandeth well the practick part of Phyſick, I know nothing elſe of him. They that are perfect in nothing themſelves have ever in readineſs ſuch diſdainful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to hide their own Ignorance: as though a man being excellent in any one thing, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be ignorant in all other. Certainly the remembrance of ſuch diſdainful Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (when I had already finiſhed this thing) made me in doubt to put forth this Work; but that my Friends, with whom I conferred my doings, earneſtly perſwaded me not to regard the rage of Envie, ſo long as Truth would bear out it ſelf, while Time conſumed both Slander and alſo Envie, the Author of all reproach; And that I ſhould in no caſe ceaſe to do that ſhould profit many, for the evil of a few; ſome perhaps will ſay (to diminiſh that little honour which I might get by this my Work)
<pb facs="tcp:103254:8"/>
that the Ancients have written the greateſt part thereof: But they ſhall learn from the mouth of this great Oracle, That there is no leſs wit and underſtanding required to be able to judge of Sciences formerly written, then to be the firſt Authors of them. Indeed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, whoſe ſtudious endeavours conſpired the ſubduing of theſe and other Diſeaſes, have left behinde them moſt honourable Teſtimonies of their Labors; yea, and Modern men alſo have been ſtirred up to do the like; but ſome of them with ſo much tediouſneſs and prolixity, that you may ſooner finde your Patient dead, than a remedy in their Writings, which (if my judgment be any thing) are more learned then uſeful. Beſides, though there were many Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of old in Phyſick and Philoſophy, yet I ſay, with <hi>Didacus Stella,</hi> A Dwarf ſtanding on the ſhoulders of a Giant may ſee further then the Giant himſelf; and it is no greater prejudice for me, to endite after others, then for <hi>Aelianus Montaltus,</hi> that famous Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to write <hi>De Morbis Capitis,</hi> after <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Pratenſis, Heurnius, Hildeſheim,</hi>

               <p>A ſimple wound of the head by it ſelf is not perillous, neither do any die thereof, if rightly handled: Yet it is well ſaid of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that no wound of the head is to be neglected, becauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it brings danger, yea ſometimes a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

               <p>
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Formius</hi> highly commend the opening of an artery in the temples, for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Hemicrania</hi>; eſpecially if the cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from hot, thin, and vaporous blood, which will yield to no Medicines.</p>

                  <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> propounds four Remedies, confirmed by experience: Namely, An Iſſue in the back of the hand, between the thumb and fore finger; opening of the vein in the forehead, and the corner of the eye, and Horſe-leeches to the temples. He is not content to apply two or three, as ordinarily is done, but ten or twelve, round about the temples; whence comes a great attraction of blood, which may draw forth the whole matter of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Among the proper Medicines for the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, from what cauſe ſoever it ariſeth, <hi>Vervain</hi> is the chief; whoſe water diſtilled, you may both apply externally, and give of it internally, to the quantity of four ounces, with three drops of the Spirit of Salt.</p>

               <p>In the year 1649. <hi>Robert Harman,</hi> of <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> was taken with madneſs; his fits were ſo ſtrong, that I was oftentimes forced to binde him in his bed, which he ſhook with great violence: He was tall, black, and very fierce to behold, eſpecially in the Paroxyſm: He often roared out, making ſuch a hideous noiſe, that the by-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and neighbours were greatly afraid: One night, whilſt he lay bound in his fit, the candle (as I was informed by thoſe that were about him) burnt blew by the ſpace of half an hour, and there was heard ſo ſtrange a deen that the keepers did tremble with fear, not being able to ſtir from their places. All theſe things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I earneſtly beſought the Lord that he would pleaſe to give the cure into my hands, and to bleſs ſuch means as I uſed for his recovery; and that if he were poſſeſſed with any unclean ſpirit, he would leaſe to rebuke him, and caſt him out: Being then but a freſh-water'd ſouldier; Firſt, I opened a vein, and drew away 14 ounces of blood; next, I gave him this potion, which wrought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. ℞ <hi>Diacatholiconis,</hi> ℥ i. <hi>Pulveris ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi> ℈ ii. <hi>Syrupi roſ. ſol.</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>decocti communis,</hi> q. ſ. <hi>Miſce &amp; fiat potio.</hi> Every night, and in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm, he was fumed with this Pouder, which did not only procure reſt, but it did alſo miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the force and violence of the fit; even to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,

               <p>We cannot ſo eaſily ſhun the danger we are incident to by mad Dogs, as that of other Beaſts, by reaſon he is a domeſtick creature, and houſed under the ſame roof with us. The virulency that reſides in his foam or ſlaver is hot and dry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, venenate and contagious, ſo that it doth not only hurt, when as it is taken in by a bite, but even applied to the skin, unleſs it be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with waſhed away with ſalt water or urine; now malign ſymptomes happen ſooner or later, as in ſome, about the fortieth day, in others about ſix moneths, and in others a year after: If the wound or hurt reacheth not unto any nerve, vein, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and if it be not very deep, there may be ſome good hope of cure.

Yet <hi>Avicen</hi> thinks their cauſe is not deſperate, if as yet they can know their face in a glaſs; for hence you may gather, that all the animal faculties are not yet overthrown, but that they ſtand in need of ſtrong Purgations. It is a deadly ſign, to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves on the ground, to have an hoarſe voice, for that is an argument that the Weazon is become rough, by reaſon of too exceſſive drineſs.

               <p>There be ſome who apply to the wound an Onion beaten with the leaves of Rue, &amp; common Salt.

A Catarrh accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a continual pain of the head, is hardly to be cured.</p>
               <p>In the year 1510. there happened a famous Catarrh, with difficuly of breathing, which went almoſt over all the world, and raged over all the Cities and Towns of <hi>France,</hi> with great heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the head whereupon the French named it <hi>Cuculla</hi>) with ſtreightneſs of the heart and lungs, and a Cough, a continual Fever, and ſometimes raving.</p>

               <p>Moreover, although many Authors do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between a Glaucoma, and a Suffuſion, yet they which diligently obſerve may diſtinguiſh them thus: In a Suffuſion there is a white in the very Pupilla, and very neer the Membrane cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cornea; but in Glaucoma it lieth deeper.</p>

               <p>I read of a certain Phyſician, who going up a Ladder to take a Book from a ſhelf, and turning his eyes violently upwards, ſaw all things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned upwards, as though men walked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, which came by the attraction and diſplacing of the Cryſtalline.

               <p>The juyce of Chickweed, or Fennel, dropped

               <p>
                  <hi>Platerus</hi> reports, That he ſaw a blindneſs which came from a round tumor growing in the brain, and compreſſing the Optick nerves, which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103254:77"/>
appeared by opening of the head, after the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was deceaſed.</p>
               <p>As to the Prognoſtick; if this diſeaſe be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that is, if there be a totall loſs of ſight, it is for the moſt part incurable, eſpecially if the Patient be old. But if the obſtruction be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, which only cauſeth a diminution of ſight, but not blindneſs, there is more hope of cure, becauſe then it is ſuppoſed that the humour is not faſtened within the ſubſtance of the nerve, but only gathered together in the brain, about the original of thoſe nerves.</p>
               <p>Some Practitioners do relate, that ſome by a wound in the forehead have been cured of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: In which it is moſt probable, that the cauſe of their blindneſs was the compreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the optick nerves, by the veins and arteries adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſwelling with too much blood, which the wounds aforeſaid emptied forth. Whence <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius</hi> (as <hi>Plempius</hi> reports in his Book of the eyes) was wont, in <hi>gutta ſerena,</hi> with good ſucceſs, to open the middle vein in the forehead, and let it bleed while it ſtop of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Old Phyſicians ſay, that Treacle is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue to ſtrengthen the brain and the eyes, which may be taken by a drachm every night, with Fennel, Eye-bright, or Celandine water, twice or thrice in a week: Nutmeg eaten every morning faſting is much commended if it be long chewed, that the vapour maybe carried to the eyes.</p>

                  <hi>TUmor Linguae,</hi> The Tumor or ſwelling of the tongue, ariſeth either from a cholerick blood flowing unto it, (and then for the moſt part an Inflammation is excited) or from a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh (and then the tongue waxeth white) or elſe from a poiſonous matter, as in the French diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſpeaks of a Brewer that had a great Inflammation of his tongue, which came to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration and brake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> maketh mention of a certain man, whoſe tongue was ſo ſwoln by reaſon of Rheum which fell from his head, that he could not contain it in his mouth.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author reports, that he ſaw a tongue which grew exceeding great, <hi>abſque ullo ſenſu do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loris,</hi> neither would it pit, or yield to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but it was a bare increaſe of the quantity of the tongue, which came by too much nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought and converted into the ſubſtance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:103254:87"/>Tumors of the tongue, for the moſt part, do not endanger the life, unleſs they grow ſo big that they cauſe ſuffocation: <hi>Si linguae tumor ſit durus, lividus, &amp; ad cancri naturam ferè tendens, incurabilis eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A certain Gentlewoman being grievouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with an inflammation of the tongue, in a burning Fever, was thus helped: Firſt, there was taken away from the Cephalick vein four or five ounces of blood, although ſhe had paſſed fourteen weeks of her time, being with child. The ſame day the following Gargariſm was uſed. ℞ <hi>Aquae fontanae,</hi> lb. ii. <hi>julepi roſarum,</hi> ℥ i. ſs. <hi>mellis mororum,</hi> ℥ vi. <hi>aceti roſacei,</hi> ℥ i. <hi>olei vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli,</hi> q. ſ. <hi>ut acidus ſit</hi>; with this ſhe waſhed her mouth, which brought away much flegm: Now and then the dry places were anointed with honey of Roſes, and ſometimes with Butter, and ſo ſhe was cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> cured a Patient of ſixty years, whoſe tongue was very much inflamed, only by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the juyce of Lettice, after purging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> in a deſperate caſe, when the tongue of his Patient grew to a wonderful bigneſs, ſo that he feared ſuffocation, after empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and re-velling medicines uſed in vain apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four Horſ-leeches to the tongue, and in a ſhort time, after plentiful bleeding, it became thin and ſmall, and the Patient eſcaped.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author declares, that he cured a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103254:87"/>
child of ten years old, who had a tongue ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by defluxion, ſo big that it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his mouth (after revulſions by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cupping-glaſſes with ſcarification, and ſharp Clyſters) becauſe the Tumor was ſoft and looſe, only by profound ſcarification of the tongue; and after he commanded that it ſhould be waſhed with Salt water, from whence there came ſuch abundance of humors that the child preſently recovered.</p>
               <p>A certain perſon, by reaſon of the too frequent uſe of Mercurial Unguents, had his tongue ſo ſwelled (from the violence of the Flux which followed thereupon) that it hung out of his mouth the breadth of four fingers: He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this condition by the ſpace of four months, and his tongue being altered by the air was grown three fingers thick. Mr. <hi>Des Grands Prez,</hi> a moſt expert Phyſician of <hi>Greenoble,</hi> being ſent for after bleeding, waſhing of the part, and a Seton faſtned to the neck, took down the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof, chiefly by the uſe of a pouder fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Pepper, Ginger, Muſtard-ſeed, and parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salt.</p>

               <p>Now the teeth are corroded or eaten in by an acride and thin humor penetrating by a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and frequent defluxion even to their roots, and being there contained, it putrifies; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more acrid, it doth not only draw the teeth into the contagion of its putrefaction, but alſo perforates and corrodes them; the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction may be corrected, if after general medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, you put oil of Vitriol into the hole of the eaten tooth; or elſe, if you burn the tooth it ſelf to the root with a ſmall iron Wier, being red hot; you may thruſt this hot Iron through a pipe or cane made for the ſame purpoſe, leſt it ſhould harm any ſound part by the touch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and thus the putrefaction, the cauſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion, may be ſtayed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, corruption may be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103254:95"/>
by cleanſing of the teeth (with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife) from meats that ſtick betwixt them; and likewiſe by waſhing the mouth with Wine: Alſo here are commended the little round balls of <hi>Trallianus, ex opii Thebaici,</hi> ℈ i. <hi>myrrhae, ſtyracis calam.</hi> ana, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. <hi>Piperis albi, croci, galbani,</hi> ana, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. <hi>cum melle ſcillitico conformati, &amp; denti inſerti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Worms breeding by putrefaction in the roots of the teeth may be killed by the uſe of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, by Garglings or Lotions made of Vinegar, wherein either Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> hath been ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, or Treacle diſſolved; for the ſame purpoſe Aloes and Garlick are good to be uſed.</p>
               <p>A Fiſtula is hardly to be cured, unleſs that the tooth be wholly pulled out by the roots: For although the corrupt and rotten filth which inſenſibly diſtills by little and little <hi>(&amp; qui inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in os cum foetore influit)</hi> may by the uſe of Medicines ſeem to be removed, and the Fiſtula cured, yet it will ſoon break out again: But now that the tooth may be the better drawn forth, it may be well rubbed with the fat of green Frogs living in trees.</p>

Yet the luxation of one ſide of the jaw-bone is not ſo dangerous in its reſtitution, as that which happeneth on both: Practitioners affirm, that the jaw, twelve days after it is ſet, is free from the danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.</p>

to be cut off, or ſcarified; but after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation is gone, and the ſuperiour part leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened.

But if it be red and ſwoln it cannot be cut, ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, or burnt without danger, for a greater Inflammation will follow, as alſo a Flux of blood; therefore you muſt endeavour, as he ſaith, to extenuate theſe accidents by other means at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> will not have us to touch the <hi>Uvula</hi> with an Iron to cut it, when it is livid or blackiſh, that is, when it hath malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in it, and inclineth to be a Cancer.</p>

               <p>A certain Gentlewoman was taken with ſo great an Inflammation of the Almonds, and her tongue was ſo infected with many ſmall Ulcers ariſing from a copious defluxion of a very ſharp ſerous matter, that ſhe could not ſpeak, or ſip a little broth, without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
