            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>That dare oppoſe us with an open face,</l>
            <l>They're all dead men unleſs they quit the place:</l>

            <l>He'll buy the Cordial, he's a friend, not foe:</l>
            <l>Then call him quickly, call him; come, I pray,</l>
            <l>I fear me much I'm near a Critick day.</l>

            <l>Oh <hi>Englands</hi> Clergy! look about you now,</l>
            <l>You are the men that have great work to do:</l>

            <l>Thy old Commander marches in the vann,</l>

            <l>When once he bringeth up his Knocking rear:</l>
            <l>And though at preſent, we, in forlorn hope,</l>

            <l>And to all thoſe that plot, combine, and lye</l>

            <l>Oh God of <hi>England</hi> riſe, awake agen,</l>
            <l>In days of old we have thee glorious ſeen.</l>
            <l>In Eighty eight they did invade our Land,</l>
            <l>The Spaniſh Ships Armadoes did Command;</l>
            <l>They came on boldly to the very Coaſt,</l>
            <l>And in a full career they hop'd for roaſt:</l>
            <l>But God Almighty put them all in fear,</l>
            <l>And with his Fire-ſhips did ſcatter vann and rear:</l>
            <l>He rais'd up brave Conductors, Engliſhmen,</l>
            <l>That made the Spaniards homewards go agen;</l>
            <l>All this was done in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days,</l>
            <l>To God Almighty <hi>England</hi> give the praiſe.</l>
            <l>And in King <hi>James</hi>'s time did they contrive</l>
            <l>To blow up mortal men while yet alive;</l>
            <l>But Heaven forbad the Stroak, and turn'd the blow</l>
            <l>Unto their final fatal overthrow.</l>
            <l>And in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt our King</l>
            <l>Mighty combuſtions on the Land did bring;</l>
            <l>They ſtirr'd up Fathers wrath againſt the Son,</l>
            <l>And almoſt was the Nation quite undone</l>
            <l>By Civil Wars, which they fomented ſo,</l>
            <l>As laid poor <hi>England</hi> all in blood and wo,</l>
            <l>And ſent our Gracious Prince, of bleſſed memory,</l>
            <l>By fatal blow into eternity.</l>
            <l>When this was done Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> our preſent King,</l>
            <l>They ſent into Exile, ah curſed thing!</l>
            <l>But God was good, and brought him back again;</l>
            <l>And now the Crown doth on his Head remain:</l>
            <l>This was not all enough, but into Court</l>
            <l>Theſe Monſters creep agen to make ſome ſport.</l>
            <l>And while this Toad in Boſom warm doth lye,</l>
            <l>It ſoon begins to plot conſpiracy.</l>
            <l>So deep their Plot was laid, ſo under ground,</l>
            <l>So dark, ſo helliſh was th' intended wound,</l>
            <l>By Poyſon, Piſtol, and by Silver ſlug:</l>
            <l>But Heaven defeated this their fatal Drug;</l>
            <l>And while the Horſe was eating a few <hi>OATS</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His griping belly filled was with Bots;</l>
            <l>And thus the Plot came out; and truth it was,</l>
            <l>Though now there is no Plot: ſo let it paſs;</l>
            <l>'Tis no great matter, Jeſuits and Prieſts</l>

            <l>All this is nothing, there is yet no fault,</l>

            <l>And though the Fact be plainly prov'd on Tryal,</l>

            <l>What can his Holineſs and <hi>Rome</hi> deviſe,</l>
