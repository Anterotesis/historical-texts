         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>SINCE while the providence of God hath been pleased in great Mercy, to continue us together as happy Yoak-fellows and Partners in each others felicity, we did still live in all godly amity and friendship as became us being so nearly united, I having still the same Bowels of compassion now in this time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity as ever I had, I cannot tell how to shew that reall Affection and tender care due to my other-self's (as I may truly and really call you, and that young Offspring that God hath given us, you being as a Fruitful-Vine, and they even as so many delicious Olive-branches standing round about our Table) then by bestowing my little time given me here, or at least some hours (separated from the great imployment that I am about, to prepare for Death and my happy State in another World) to give you some cordial instructions that you may think upon when I am Dead and gone, and some Grave and serious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations that may be fixed on your Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause coming from your dear, tho now departing Husband. That so tho Death that King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors may separate us for a while, yet when it shall please the Almighty of his fatherly Goodness to remove you out of this miserable Vale of Tears, that then we may meet in those Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Regions of Light, where the Malice of men c<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnot reach us, where are Rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for evermore.</p>
               <p>First Therefore, my Advice to you is, that as your constancy to me in performing the duty of the relation in which you stood in toward me has been no way blameable (abiding with, Comforting, Cherishing, and Condoling the sad Estate of me your nearest and dearest alliance, never departing from me unnecessarily even to the last Moments of my Life) so you would not be in this time of sad Affliction too much cast down and dejected, but walk even as a Child of Light, remain constant in your duty to God, especially in the great parts of his Divine Worship incumbent on all.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Let your private Prayers and Accesses to the Throne of Grace be often, be no stranger at the gate of Mercy while there is an Ear of favour open, and be incouraged, since God hears the Cry of the Widdow to defend her from all dangers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Be also frequent in Reading and consulting the Holy Scripture, they are the Oracles of truth, and there you may find the Treasures of wisdom and knowledg, thence you may suck promises, that will be as Milk flowing from the Breasts of true Consolations; Oh! I can say it truly that from those Fountains have Streamed such Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials into my Soul as now enable me to go through with this great and sharp Suffering with Patience, knowing from thence that no strange thing hath happened to me.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Be no stranger to the Ordinances of God as hearing the word for your Edification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments for your Confirmation, and be sure neglect not the private Duties of your Family, let your House be a little Sanctuary and let your Children and your Servants be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways present at the times of Prayer and Reading the word, so that it may be said by you as by Good <hi>Joshuah</hi> of Old. <hi>As for you and your House you will serve the Lord:</hi> I shall onely urge that of the Apostle, <hi>Pray without ceasing, and be allways abounding in the work of the Lord, because you shall find your Labour will not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. That I may speak more particulary to thy present sad condition, tho it be sad, yet Oh! Be sure murmur not at our heavenly Fathers dispensation, he knows what is allways best for us, Oh! remember that he hath told us, <hi>Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in Heart,</hi> and when you find your Spirit sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then support it with reflexion on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer great Gracious goodness of God; Oh! think what things he hath done for others, and for thee, and believe he is able to make up the Loss to thee, and be better then Ten Husbands; possess thy Soul in Patience and a quiet submission to his will, and while thou art tost with troubles in this World, believe that the rest will be more sweet to which thou art going, tho the way be strowed with Thorns, through which I must now Pass before thee.</p>
               <p>These are the Duty's I most ardently press thee to as to thy self, but as thou now Standest in the relation of a Mother to Fatherless Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are left Young and left among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temptations and when they grow up will be lyable to many Corruptions and it is your part to bring them up in the <hi>Nurture and Fear of the Lord.</hi> That so we may all Rejoyce in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Blessings of the New Jerusalem, so you will discharge the p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of a Religious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by Dedicating those the Lord hath lent you to his Service. And in Order to this,</p>
               <p n="1">I. Be not over indulgent, let not thine Eye pity the correction of thy Son, nor thy Soul spare for his Crying, be ready to give all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions with Gravity and Kindness, that so thy Love may seem to melt them to make them fit for the impressions of Counsel.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Be sure to give them that Education that may be fit for them under good Governours that you may not neglect upon all occasions to Instill into them the principles of true Religion, and that you may by no means suffer the growth of Sin or corruptions in them, but repress it in the Budd and First Motions of it, and allways consider that if you <hi>Train up a Child in the way he should go, when he is Old he will not depart from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for thy Servants, be sure that they that abide in thy House may be such as are of honest conversation, that in their Lives they may <hi>Adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> and be sure thy own example may be a direction to them, and reproof also if they do amiss. This I thought fit to leave for thy direction in the relation of a Mother and Governess of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But because the words of a Father De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased may have some influence on my dear Babes, to them, therefore I shall leave some thing as a Fathers Legacy among them.</p>

               <p>And to you my Daughters behave your selves with Modesty that you may be a comfort to her that bare you, and Honour to your Sex; bear patiently all and every one of you, all Injurys and Wrongs that may be offered, and live in Love one with another; which that you may do, your Fathers Blessing rest upon you, and the Allmighty keep, defend and direct you, till he having guided you by his Spirit, bring you to those Regions of Light and Immortality, is the Prayer for you all,</p>
