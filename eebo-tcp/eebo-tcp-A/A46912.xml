            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>KIng <hi>David</hi> (that holy man, great
Prophet, and good Magiſtrate)
longed for, and accepted of a
Bottle of Water from his three
Worthies, drawn out of the Well at the Gate
of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which was then the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> his enemies, though
he drank it not, but poured it forth before
the Lord as an offering, to quench the thirſt
of his droughty Army; I hope, my Lord,
his Exam I may (in ſome part) be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
to your Lordſhip to accept of this
ſmall Tract preſented unto you by one Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
though you read it not, which was
by him collected during his ſad Reſtraint
and Captivity within the ſtone walls and
<pb facs="tcp:57243:3"/>
iron grates of a Priſon, the pleaſant Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of a Goaler, but the Charnel-houſe
to hide men ruinated by their diſlocated
and broken fortunes.</p>
            <p>It would (my Lord) be an act worthy your
Honors owning, to inſpect a little into the
premiſes hereafter mentioned; And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, my Lord, diſdain them not for
the indigency of the ſtyle (for he that wrote
them wants Learning) but mind them for
the Truths therein contained.</p>
            <p>If your Honor thinks that a living Dog
is better then a dead Lyon, then let Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
move your Lordſhip (as God hath
now planted you in Authority) to look upon
the dying condition of living men in a
Priſon.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip (perhaps) may be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Goaler, that perſons under the
power of his Key want not for ſubſiſtence:
I do affirm (my Lord) that ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a notorious falſhood; and, that if it
lay in his power, the Priſoners of <hi>Ludgate</hi>
would be of all priſoners the moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p>My Lord, it would adde Excellency to

out where thoſe noble and great Legacies
are buried, and in whoſe hands they died,
which formerly belonged to that Priſon,
Generations yet to come would finde reaſon
to engrave your Action in Golden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
            <p>When your Lordſhip views the Revenues
of the <hi>Keeper</hi> to ariſe from nothing to ſix

will amaze you; but if your Lordſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders,

a man, and that it is haraſſed out of the
decaying Eſtates of poor men, I hope then
it will be beyond your admiration.</p>
            <p>My Lord, frequent Viſitations of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

               </gap>lowing premiſes, and therefore to
you I thought it convenient to declare my
Reaſons for the publication thereof: It doth in
it ſelf concern each particular Member of this
City, and all men that are Merchants or Traders
in any way within this Commonwealth. The
rich Citizen or Merchant it concerneth,</p>
            <p>I. For that their way of Trade oftentimes is,
to truſt young beginners, that have but ſmall
ſtocks, upon day, and if they proſper, they pay
for their Credit; but if they fail, having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezled
the ſtock intruſted with them, their
Bodies are immediately forced to priſon; this
book ſhews you what you gain by that, proving
what your Experience could not but tell you,
<hi>That priſons pay no Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Money-lender or rich Uſerer, it declares</p>
            <p>II. That ſuch as are layd in upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
have no reaſon to take care for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of debts, nor do they; for you ſhall finde
they here meet with Charges and expences to
ſpend what they have in their hands, and doe it
for the moſt part, and are thereby diſabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
any Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>To ſuch who think men have ſufficient in that
priſon to maintain them,</p>
            <p>III. It ſufficiently proves the contrary, fully
acquainting them with what Benefits accre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Them who hereafter ſhall be priſoners there,
it informs,</p>
            <p>IIII. What Fees and Charges they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be lyable to and pay, their poverty or

they ſhall be partakers of during their

            <p>Them who againſt good Times do now adays
withdraw their Charity,</p>
            <p>V. It ſerves to undeceive, ſhewing the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
given, how they are beſtowed, and the ſad
loſs of their great donations, to invite all pious
and good men to their former Charities and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities.</p>
            <p>Its principal end and intendment, being this
in general, to ſhew the rich Creditor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <p>When the Priſon was in this
condition, there happened to be
priſoner there one <hi>Steven Foſter,</hi>
who (as poormen are at this day)
was a Cryer at the Grate, to beg
the benevolent Charities of pious
and commiſerate Benefactors
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57243:7"/>
that paſſed by: As he was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his doleful Office, a rich Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of <hi>London</hi> hearing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
enquired of him what
would releaſe him? To which he
anſwered, Twenty pound, which
ſhe in charity expended; and
clearing him out of Priſon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him in her ſervice, who
afterward falling into the way of
Merchandize, and increaſing as
well in wealth as courage, wooed
his Miſtreſs, Dame <hi>Agnes,</hi> and
married her.</p>
               <p>Her Riches and his Induſtry,
brought him both great wealth
and honor, being afterwards no
leſs then Sir <hi>Steven Foſter,</hi> Lord
Mayor of the Honorable City of
<hi>London;</hi> yet whileſt he lived in
this great Honor and Dignity,
he forgat not the place of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57243:7"/>
Captivity, but mindeful of the
ſad and irkſom place wherein poor
men were impriſoned, bethought
himſelf of enlarging it, to make it
a little more delightful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
for thoſe who in after times
ſhould be impriſoned and ſhut
up therein: And in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
acquainted his Lady with
this his pious purpoſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in whom likewiſe he found
ſo affable and willing a minde to
do good to the poor, that ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to expend as much as he
ſhould do for the carrying on of
the Work; and having Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
adjoyning thereunto, they
cauſed to be erected and built,
the Rooms and places following;
that is to ſay, The <hi>Paper houſe,</hi>
the <hi>Porch,</hi> the <hi>Watch hall,</hi> the
<hi>Upper</hi> and <hi>Lower Lumbries,</hi> the

                  <hi>Cellar,</hi> the <hi>Long-ward,</hi> and the

which Chappel is an Inſcription
upon the wall containing theſe
words:</p>
               <p>This Chappel was Erected and
Ordained for the Divine Worſhip
and Service of God, by the Right
Honourable Sir <hi>Steven Foſter,</hi>
Knight, ſometime Lord Mayor of
this Honorable City, and by Dame
<hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife, for the uſe and
godly Exerciſe of the Priſoners
in this Priſon of <hi>Ludgate,</hi> Anno
1454.</p>
               <p>An act of ſo great piety and
worth in a holy and religious
Couple, is left without a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
in theſe uncharitable times,
which ſooner ſets the Stamp of
Authority to Demoliſhments and
Devaſtations, than gives the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor

the increaſe of piety, vertue, and
godlineſs.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe gave Maintenance
for a Preaching Miniſter, which
I ſuppoſe is in the hands of the

or ſome by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
who to this day do

oftentimes as burdenſome
as their debts, and are by the

               <p>This worthy Gentleman (ſure)
had ſome prophetick inſpection
into the Times that after him

ſeemed needful to his judicious

Candles for the uſe of the Houſe

money mentioned before, doth
not anſwer that Charge by far,

of Charge we grant to be good;
Then Extraordinary Charges are,
when any poor priſoner is ſick, and

when any dieth, and is buried at

               <p>Here I obſerve two things: Firſt,
That ſome whoſe Names are in the
forementioned Table, are not ſet
down in this Book of Legacies, out
of which I took this Catalogue,
for there is wanting Sir <hi>Steven
Foſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Allen</hi> Mercer, Mr.
<hi>Wyat,</hi> &amp;c. And ſeondly, That
what Legacies are now belonging
and paid to the Priſon, are onely
the later Gifts of Benefactors;
thoſe large Donations of Charity
given before the Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57243:30"/>
too full of Superſtition, and
looking with faces like the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Gifts of Papiſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought good by Avarice and
Covetouſneſs to be obliviated:
Nor knew they a ſurer way to do
it, that they might be utterly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
from the eyes of after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but by conſulting (as it were)
with their Religion and tender
Conſciences, who ſoon reſolved
them, That the wiſeſt way would
be to demoliſh the Idolatrous
Tombs and Sepulchres of thoſe
beſt of men, and greateſt of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
and to take from before
the eyes of the Godly thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Braſs, which ſpake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their good works and deeds,
defacing them as vain-glorious, &amp;
pretending they would be more
advantagious to a thriving State to
have them expoſed to ſale.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57243:30"/>
The Sum of theſe known Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is about 70 l. but ſome of
them I find are out of date, having
run their full race and time out,
therefore I do think 60 l. is the
extent of what annually comes in.</p>
               <p>The ſmaller ſort I finde to be
rightly beſtowed, that is, for the
<hi>Relief</hi> of the Priſoners in bread,
or otherwiſe. And thoſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received by the <hi>Maſter of
the Box:</hi> The greater Sums are
beſtowed for <hi>Releaſe</hi> of Priſoners,
as they call it: The way of Relief
is to be underſtood, the ſupplying
of them with neceſſaries, as victuals
or money: That called Releaſe, is
thus: That when a poor man hath
got his Diſcharge from both <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ters,</hi>
and run the Gantlope of
Clerks Fees, and fobb'd Actions,
whereby his ſmall ſtock is utterly
exhauſted, and he hath not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

with to run quite through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Extortions, he ſtops at
the doore. By the Turn-key is
brought him a Bill of Fees to be
paid (which I ſhall ſpeak of when
I come to treat of <hi>Charges</hi> and
<hi>Fees</hi>) wherein Lodging leads the
Van, which he not being able at
preſent to pay, ſhall be detained
until he either doth, or elſe give
ſecurity to pay it, though perhaps
his Creditors took his own Bond
for twenty times a greater Sum: if
he can procure no ſuch ſecurity
there he muſt lye until the next
Quarter, or that ſome Legacy be
brought by ſome Company, or
other perſon, for to diſcharge Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and then by Petition to
them preſented, ſigned by the
Keeper (which he doth for his own
ends) very likely the man ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57243:31"/>
Corruption in ſome, and Policy
in others, hath made it cuſtomary
now, that theſe larger Gifts never
come within the Priſon, but are
ſwallowed up in the Paper-Office
by the Keeper, for Lodging and
Fees (which is that <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis</hi>
I before ſpake of) contrary
to the intendment of the deceaſed
Donors.</p>
               <p>I have heard it credibly ſpoken
by a knowing and rational man,
that theſe moneys (and much more
than theſe) was at their appointed
times uſed to be paid to the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
of the Houſe, who kept the
moneys in ſtock, and if a Priſoner
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay there that might be diſcharged
from his Creditor or Creditors,
for the ſum of three, four, or five
pound, did by his eaſie Addreſs
procure the ſaid money, and his
diſcharge immediately followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57243:32"/>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That Lodging was not
then exacted <hi>cum privilegio,</hi> as
now it is, the more the pity: But
this I am confident of, that of this
ſixty pound a year, or thereabouts,
there is not above Ten that the
Priſoners taſte of, the reſt by that
other Project is converted into
Lodging-money, as I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now I have begun to unlock the
hid Treaſures of <hi>Ludgate,</hi> I intend,
according to my poor ability, to
ſignifie what more I underſtand
to be given them ſreely, and for
their neceſſary Suſtenance, and not
to the uſe before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>To be upon the Charity of the
Houſe is the accounted benefit
which a poor man receives, and
that he is admitted unto by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſhewing the Copy of his
Freedom to the Maſter-Keeper,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57243:32"/>
two Stewards, and ſeven Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;
and of this kinde there are
about fifty in number, ſometimes
more, ſeldom leſs now adays, who
partake of what Moneys is begg'd
at the Grates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p>I gave you an account of ſix
Cryers, and their maner and turns
of Crying; and alſo that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by them begg'd, was put into
the cuſtody of the Maſter of the
Box until the Accompt-day, and
it is ſo; at which time it is caſt up
by the Stewards and Aſſiſtants,
and after the charges of the Houſe
is taken out of it for that moneth,
as the buying of Bread for the
Charity-men, and Ample-men,
(that is, ſuch as are not upon the
Charity) the buying of Candles,
the paying of Officers their ſmall
Salaries, and other things incident
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57243:33"/>
and neceſſary for the Houſe, as I
have ſhewed; then I ſay, they in
the next place caſt it up into ſhares
or dividents for each Charity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
which done, the Bell being
rung, they come all up into the
<hi>Chappel,</hi> where the Under Steward
reads in the Accompt-book to this
purpoſe: We the Stewards and
Aſſiſtants, having peruſed the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
for this moneth, being ſuch
a day of the moneth, do finde that
it hath pleaſed God to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us out of the Boxes, by good
Benefactors (the Houſe charges
being deducted) the ſum of eight
pound eight ſhillings (or the like)
to be divided amongſt fifty Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity-men
and women, which comes
to three ſhillings four pence apiece,
for which we bleſs God, and give
thanks.</p>
               <p>A man hearing this reade, would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57243:33"/>
he not, being on the Charity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to receive it, think you? But
ſtay, when he comes to the Maſter
of the Box to have his ſhare, he
ſhall finde him to write thus in a
Paper:

               <p>This I have often found to be
the Accompt, nay ſometimes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all in a moneth, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
every mans ſhare hath come
to ſixteen, eighteen, or twenty
ſhillings a moneth; and at a good
time, as <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> it
may be three or four pound apiece,
therefore this may well be called
<hi>Ludgate, What it is: Not what
it was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is done, becauſe with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57243:34"/>
Keeper it is <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> &amp;c.
though there is a pretence of an
Order of the Lord Mayor and
Court of Aldermen for his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it, but I could never ſee it:
and if there be, it was granted
when <hi>Charity</hi> did (as <hi>Iuſtice</hi> ſhould
do) <hi>run down like a mighty ſtream,</hi>
but the channel being now almoſt
quite dried up, the banks thereof
having been cut by the oppreſſing
hand of Wars and Calamities, it
is now high time for the preſent
Lord Mayor and Court, to ſearch
into the reaſon of its granting, and
to abrogate it, for poor mens lives
are much concerned therein, to
my knowledge; for three ſhillings
four pence will go further with a
ſick and indigent man, then a groat
of ſix pence will, eſpecially in a
Priſon.</p>
               <p>I will give you a ſhort Example
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57243:34"/>
of an honeſt and charitable act of
the Maſter Keepers, for which I
think he had no Order of the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen:
It pleaſed God to inflict ſickneſs
upon me after my being in Priſon
about a moneth or ſix weekes, I
then not being upon the Charity,
and being a very poor man, and
altogether friendleſs (a poor wife
and childe excepted) was at the
Accompt-day allowed four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
eight pence by the Stewards
and Aſſiſtants, in conſideration of
my charge in my ſickneſs, and my
known poverty, which the Keeper
underſtanding, took half of it for
his Lodging, and left me the other
to repair my broken and diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fortunes. I could give other
like Examples of his kindneſs to
Priſoners, but that is not here my
buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57243:35"/>
The freeſt Gift, and now moſt
eſteemed Benefit, is that of the
Lords Mayors basket, which is
twice (or thrice ſometimes) in a
week, and is divided amongſt poor
Priſoners: His Lord ſhip likewiſe
ſends in light bread ſometimes
when he takes it from the light Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
which is likewiſe a great help
when it comes.</p>
               <p>What is ſent in by the Clerk of
the Market, as Chumps of Beef,
or any other kinde of proviſion,
and likewiſe by the Water-bayliff,
as unſized Fiſh, but that very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is (as I told you) expoſed to
ſale as in a Market amongſt the
Charity-men, by which meanes
every man receives a like benefit.</p>
               <p>I may conclude this fourth Head
with this obſervable Truth, That
all the benefits (I mean of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
formerly given to Priſoners,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57243:35"/>
doth not adde to their relief a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a day, which is ſmall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
And that if it were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
amongſt the Priſoners in
general, as it ſhould be, it would
not amount to a peny day for each
man. To come now to</p>

that purpoſe, for which Entrance,
(or turning of the Key) the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pays fourteen pence.</p>
               <p>Having paid that, and being
turn'd into the Priſon, his next
work is to fit himſelf with a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is of three ſorts, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
rates, and is one peny, two
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57243:36"/>
pence, or three pence <hi>per</hi> night.</p>
               <p>Being furniſhed by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
of the Houſe with lodging,
his next payment is for Sheets,
which is eighteen pence, and is paid
to the ſaid Chamberlain, who is
accomptable to the Maſter-Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at a certain rate for the ſame,
whoſe goods they onely are.</p>
               <p>Before he ſhall repoſe himſelf in
his new provided Lodging, his
Chamber fellowes will acquaint
him with a <hi>Garniſh</hi> of 4 ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lings,
to be by him paid, and by them
ſpent, either in <hi>Coals</hi> or <hi>Candles</hi>
for their own proper uſe, or elſe in
a Dinner or Supper, as they can
agree; for non-payment of which,
though through poverty, or for
refuſing through obſtinacy, his
Clothes ſhall be taken privately
from him in the night (or <hi>Mobb'd,</hi>
as they call it) which ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57243:37"/>
by he knows not who, until
ſuch time as he hath paid the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
farthing.</p>
               <p>Having reſted one night, he ſhall
the next day be called upon for a
due of ſixteen pence, which is to
be paid to one of the Stewards of
the Houſe, and is called <hi>Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,</hi>
with which <hi>Candles,</hi> &amp;c. is
bought for the uſe of the Houſe,
every night ſet up in places neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fees and Dues muſt be
paid by every Priſoner be he never
ſo poor, at his Entrance, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all to eight ſhillings, which
I have particularly mentioned, to
undeceive ſuch who think <hi>Ludgate</hi>
to be ſo free a Priſon, and that the
Fees are ſmall, and the Benefits
and Priviledge therein very great,
which in their due place I have
diſcovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57243:37"/>
But now to adminiſter a word of
Inſtruction to ſuch as deſire, (not
being brought in upon, nor ſued
to Execution) to have liberty to
go out: It is wrought by two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, though by one and the
ſame Engine, <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He, I ſay, that would have his
liberty, muſt procure to go either
with a Keeper, or elſe upon Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
In order to which, he muſt
ſend to each <hi>Compter</hi> to know what
Actions are Entred againſt him,
which muſt be certified under the
Clerks hands, and will coſt four
pence the Search, as much for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Action, and four pence for the
Clerks hand to them.</p>
               <p>This being done, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to go out with a Keeper, he
muſt for his firſt days progreſs pay
two ſhillings ſix pence to the Head
Turnkey, twelve pence to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57243:38"/>
Under-Turnkey, &amp; eighteen pence
to the Keeper that attends upon
him, which is alſo a Priſoner; and
twelve pence to the Turnkey, and
as much to his Keeper every day
of his going out afterwards.</p>
               <p>If a Priſoner will go out without
ſuch an Attendant, it muſt be by
Security of two men, ſuch whom
the Keeper or Turnkeys ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of, and judge ſufficient, each
of them entring into Bond ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for his true impriſonment, and
likewiſe one other Bond for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Lodging to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-keeper;
for which the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
takes as his Fee, five ſhillings
at the leaſt, nay, I know ſome of
whom he hath demanded twenty
ſhillings, for his good will to let
him out after Bonds ſealed, for
which the Priſoners muſt pay too,
with ſome ſaucy expences to boot,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57243:38"/>
and what they condition for week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
muſt be truly and punctually
paid, or he is ſoon fetch'd in and
deprived of Liberty, and his Bond
cancell'd and made void.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing a Priſoner to end
with his Creditor, and that he
bring in his Diſcharge from each
<hi>Compter,</hi> he ſhall then find to pay
at his <hi>Exit,</hi> the ſeveral Fees fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>viz.</hi> Two ſhillings the
Maſter-Keepers Fee, 14 pence the
turning of the Key, twelve pence
for every Action that lies againſt
him; if he be charged in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then it is two ſhillings ſix
pence, and as much for every <hi>Writ</hi>
that lies againſt him: theſe added
to his Lodging, proves ſometimes
as much, or more than the original
Debt, and yet perhaps the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
never the nearer being ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The juſtneſs of taking which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57243:39"/>
Fees, I refer to the Legiſlators to

               <p>Having ſtept thus far into the

               <p>Now if an Objection ſhould be,
<hi>That there is not ſo many conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

then the money is loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:57243:40"/>
To this I anſwer: That it may,
and wil be affirmed, that take thoſe
who are abroad upon Security,
which likewiſe pay for their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with thoſe that are within,
which muſt pay, that then theſe
beds would not contain them.</p>
               <p>And to the ſecond, That when
men do dye, and though they be
maintained in their ſickneſs, and
buried after their deaths by the
Charity of the Houſe, yet the
Keeper will ſeize upon whatſoever
they have in the Houſe; as clothes,
bedding (if they have any) or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters, unleſs he be paid his
Lodging-rent by ſome friend; A
cuſtom not uſual, till Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
turn'd the Key; but if a man
had been buried at the charge of
the Houſe, his clothes were by
the Stewards and Aſſiſtants expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſale amongſt the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57243:41"/>
and the money for them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
was put into the Maſter of
the Box his hand, for repairing the
the loſs of the Stock by ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements.</p>
               <p>Having peep'd into every Room
in the Houſe, I think I had beſt
ſtep down into the Cellar too, and
out of barrels of Beer and Ale, I
ſhall finde the Keeper hath a very
conſiderable Profit running into
his purſe.</p>
               <p>He is the Head-butler of King
<hi>Luds</hi> Houſe, onely for his eaſe he
lets it out to another, which is no
priſoner, who allows him ſixteen
ſhillings a barrel for all the Beer
and Ale that is drawn in the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
The Tobaco he meddles not
with, but allows that profit to this
his Under-butler, with which, it is
is ſuppoſed he findes fire, pipes and
Candles, and that I think is all he
can do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57243:41"/>
What he payes a Barrel for his
Beer and Ale to the Brewer, I
know not, but it is ſold to priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at 2 pence a full pot for Beer,
and two pence a quart for Ale,
though none of the ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>His certain weekly draught I
know not, but did you but ſee the
Cellar how it is dayly throng'd
with priſoners and their friends,
you would gueſs it to be about
twenty barrels in a week.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe it ſo, and that he
pays the Brewer 12 ſhillings a barrel
for both, which is as much as it is
worth, then this kinde of Trade
brings in the Keeper about four
pound a week, for which he wets
not his finger. This, if conſtant,
comes to 2 hundred and 8 pounds
<hi>per</hi> yeare. Now notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, yet ſuch is the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57243:42"/>
cruelty of the Keeper and his
Turnkeys, that if any drink be ſent
to a priſoner by a friend, they will
take it away at the door, and give
it to ſuch as leaſt want it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
break the veſſels, though
perhaps the perſon it was ſent to,
is ready to periſh for want of a
draught of it: I hope he hath no
order of the Lord Major and
Court of Aldermen for theſe
kinde of practiſes. Authority I am
ſure does think that the profit
thereof belongs to the priſon, but
I finde that it is tranſmitted into
<hi>Blackfryers.</hi> This added to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
In-comes by Lodgings, doth
amount to betwixt 5 and 600 l. <hi>per
annum,</hi> beſides his fees at the door
which I hope is more then the
Conſcience of a good Magiſtrate
will ſuffer to be the annuity of one
Goaler onely. I need not trouble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57243:42"/>
my ſelf to conclude with a prayer
to the Magiſtrate, for regulating
theſe things, becauſe the beginning
ſupplies that in ſpeciall to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
impowered with Authority,
as well as good Conſciences, (I
hope) to do it: And truly after
my tedious writing of this <hi>Tragi-Comedy,</hi>
I think it fit to repoſe my
ſelf and Reader with a Song fitted
to the purpoſe, compſed by a
merry Drolliſt that was lately a
