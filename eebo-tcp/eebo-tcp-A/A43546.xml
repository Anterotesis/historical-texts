            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis enſuing trifle was not a voluntary, but a piece of obedience to the collected body of the Clergy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> their Commands gave it firſt life, ſince publication: Some Schoolmen ſay Angels (to the enervating Chriſts Divinity) may Create; ſurely were the ſentiment true, it might be uſefull to me at this time: I might hope thoſe Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Angels might work ſomething out of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. However I deſire that nothing of Divinity may be injur'd by it; of which it contains many rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb facs="tcp:41691:3"/>
ſuch as Pedlers uſe to broak in, and thoſe but narrowly handled, becauſe being many they ſhoulder one another for elbow room: yet I muſt aſſert ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Election in them too; Your Lordſhip knows the Meridian of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and they were in ſome meaſure fitted for the Longitude and Latitude of many of the Clergy there: That is, the ſtate th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y have been (not are) in, through the wiſe conduct and great ſedulity of the Reverend Fathers of the Church, and your Lordſhips (in a moſt eminent manner) in your own Province, where you have wrought great changes with little; not made ruine, and power the Inſtruments of your Reformation, but ſolid convictions, and amicable inſinuations; So that now, though all the Dioceſs be right, no man complains of wrong; and the once ſeduced are not affraid of their Biſhop, but aſhamed of themſelves: a vertue ſo much the greater in you becauſe acted on the ſcene, and to many of the perſons by whom in bad times your ſelf ſuffered, when Loyalty and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodones were your Lordſhips greateſt Crimes, and Schiſme and Perſecution their Virtues, yet their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psntance has kept them ſafer, than your Innocence could you; and your mercy has changed them, when their cruelty could not you.</p>
            <p>My Lord finding your influence ſo generally benign, I could not fear a ſoure aſpect; if my underſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:41691:3"/>
could not, my memory might relieve me from your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to my ſelf which are freſh and recent; my hopes muſt be the ſame with the Moons now, who by ſheltring her ſelf under the Suns beams, has all her ſpots hid: Your Lordſhip has goodneſs enough to communicate theſe truths; that theſe papers were the ſcrapps of an ill memory, diveſted of all helps from Books, the products of almoſt an inch of time (but two poor dayes) the ſubject inſolite (to preach on a Sacrament before a Convocation) and the Authour having the Sea ſo newly floating in his brains, that it might well drownd all things which it found there. And who will not believe ſuch an Authority, eſpecially when the work it ſelf conſpires to give in ſo clear an evidence to it. Had thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles been removed, poſſibly another air might have animated theſe papers: However, in the unhappineſs of having done ill, I have the happineſs that charity may conſtrue I might have done better. If any think this diſcourſe bends not enough on practiſe, they muſt remember, that it was not conpoſed for the body of the Church but Quire; it was practical for them, it muſt be more by them: the dreſs of it I leave to your Lordſhips favour, but the truth of it to the greateſt ſeverity; for as I cannot offend that, ſo I would not this; being a Father of the Church ſubmits all truths to your cognizance, but having a particular
<pb facs="tcp:41691:4"/>
charge of the ſphere whereto I have the honour of a Deſignation, my motions in it more eſpecially; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as I would at no hand prove erratick, ſo my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall take its meaſures of acceſs or retreat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from your Ecliptick, whileſt your charge: Thus my Lord deſign and duty have ſtept in to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you with this patronage; but had both failed, friendſhip and love would not; that (before this late more Auguſt dependance and ſubordination) had the power of making, and (if they ſhould expire) will alwayes have of keeping me.</p>

The learned muſt confront the Idiot or unlearned in the Text; and 3. His place proves him ſo; for if the Unlearned, Idiot, the ſayer of Amen take up all the people, and poſſeſs but one place (or <hi>Room</hi>) in the Aſſembly, then the vacant chair muſt be left for: the Miniſter, to omit the force of the context, that the Apoſtle is ſpeking of ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, of Prophets, and of Bleſſing, the Prieſts Act; Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then this aſſertion redeemed from ſome obſcurity, I ſhall paſs but this one obſervation upon it.</p>
            <p>That in the time of diſpenſing extraordinary and Miraculous Gifts, <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> yet God was pleaſed ordinarily to make the Miniſtry the ſeat of theſe: For of ſuch gifts the whole chapter ſpeaks, and in ſuch perſons the text incircles thoſe gifts; the wind of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is free, but here it was pleaſed to become a trade wind, and to blow (commonly I ſay) from one corner; for beſides what the text ſeems to favour this in, there are two circumſtances more to help conclude it. Firſt, the Scripture is clear, that theſe gifts were ordinarily diſtributed by impoſition of hands; Gods hands never coming empty: And it will be as eaſily

yielded that though laying of hands was ſometime on other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their ſignifications, yet on no whole tribe of men elſe (and upon all thoſe) hands were laid.

The common voice of late ran that the People were the Church, let that be made good when it can; I am ſure the Governours of the Church and Miniſters do paſs for the whole Church in Scripture and primitive language: What God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to tell

            <p>From whence I ſhall but ventilate this onely probleme; Whether this do not juſtifie extemporary prayer to be the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, and thence condemn all fet forms? I anſwer no; For firſt, Praying in a tongue (miraculouſly given) is here the chief note of praying by the Spirit, not a volubility and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of expreſſon; let thoſe that would bind us to this, bind themſelves to that. 2. If any man now pray by the immediate Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, than that written, is Scripture, and then we may have new Bibles; but if men pretend not to ſuch actions, why are the people deluded with the quoting theſe examples. 3. The mediate acts of the Spirit are no leſs the Spirits acts, than his miraculous; as Chriſts going in a Ship was as truly his paſſing on the water (though not ſo wonderfull) as his walking on the Sea. Now thus he may pray by the Spirit, that prayes by a Form; if he pray for ſuch things as the Spirit

hath told us in the Scripture are pleaſing to God, and for ſuch ends, and with ſuch conditions, and ſuch words; many patterns of which we have dictated difuſedly up and down in the Word, either as prayers for us, or model, to us; And all this is praying by the Spirit objectively: But beſides, when he does enlighten us and enliven us (not extatically but) rationally, and in the way of men, not Spirits; then we pray by the Spirit enabling us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively. 4. This way is better for us; For firſt, afflations were not by way of habit to be uſed when the perſon, but when the Spirit pleaſed; which muſt be ſometimes prepared for (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited as I ſuppoſe) by Muſick in <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and ſometimes waited for as by <hi>Jeremy</hi> 10. dayes, <hi>cap.</hi> 42.7.

By a juſt judgment God has ſuffered thoſe to debaſe the people whom he honoured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they honoured whom he would have debaſed. Tis 3. more ſure for us than even an inſpiration or voyce from Heaven to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.

Tis more orderly, as appears by the confuſion in uſing thoſe truly miraculous gifts in ſtrange tongues, and thoſe again had like to have rebuilt old Babel.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The true uſe of the Sacrament firſt breaks out from the very word, that it is to be a bleſſing and lauding God; becauſe he bleſles us with it, therefore we do him in it; and that not onely for that great and ineſtimable benefit of the redemption of the world by his Son, whereof this is not onely the ſcene but ſeal: But there was another ſort of bleſſing God, commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this Ordinance by antiquity, which <hi>Pancirotius</hi> might have recorded among his <hi>deperdita.</hi> And that was the bleſſing of God for his creation, the agnizing his dominion over the creatures, by this little tribute of the creatures as a chief rent we offer up to him, to acknowledg our holding all the demeſne of our life from him: Thus <hi>Ireneus</hi> urges againſt the Hereticks Who denied that God created the World, <note place="margin">Irencus 1.3.34.</note> this acquittance of the Church under her hand (and ſeal) confeſſing the contrary, by offering up daily to him the marrow of all the creatures and ſtaffe of the world, in bread and wine.</p>

But moreover the very throat of Tranſubſtantiation ſeems to me to be cut from this denomination of this Sacrament, by deſtroying the foundation or baſis that ſupports it; for if thanksgiving be the nature, and almoſt the whole office of the Sacrament, than it is not tranſmuted from what it was to become What it was not by any operative words of Inſtitution: tis true this is annexed to the office of the Sacrament, but the whole vip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that lyes in the Prayer (or Thankſgivings) of the Church, that God would be pleaſed (for his people) to effect this; <note place="margin">Epist. ad Smyp.</note> this</p>
