            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wee therefore, having earneſtly beſought the LORD to direct Us in this great and Weighty Affair, wherein the Liberty, and Peace of theſe Nations, and the Intereſt of the godly and Faithfull therein is ſo nearly concerned, Do find it our Duty to Declare, and do hereby Declate,</p>
            <p>That we ſhall uſe Our Chriſtian endeavours to the utmoſt, for the begetting a right Underſtanding and Reconciliation between the PARLIAMENT and the ſaid Officers of the ſaid ARMY.</p>
            <p>And We do alſo Declare, That We ſhall through the ſtrength of God aſſert and maintain the Freedom and Priviledge of the preſent PARLIAMENT, that was ſo often and lately acknowledged, the Supream Authority of the Nations, and not ſuffer the Members thereof to be illegally interrupted, or moleſted in the diſcharge of their Duties.</p>
            <p>And We do ſolemnly Vow to all the World, That our only intention in doing this, is to preſerve the Rights of Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, And to Protect and encourage all the godly and faithfull therein, according to Our Declaration to the Churches lately emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Publiſhed: And likewiſe to eſtabliſh the Peace or theſe Nations, and the Government of a Free State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to which We ſtand Obliged by ſeveral Vowes and Engagements made before God and many Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>And as We have within us the Teſtimony of ſincere hearts, and unbyaſed Conſciences to encourage us in theſe Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: ſo we doubt not of the concurrent Aſſiſtance of all the unprejudiced faithful in the Land; For whoſe ſakes principally We are drawn forth to this Engagement.</p>
            <p>And We therefore invite all Our Brethren of the ARMY, and of the MILITIA, and of all others that profeſſe Love to God, and to his People, and to their own, and their Poſterities Liberty, to come and give us their chearful ayd in this Work whereunto the Lord hath called Us, leſt they be made a Prey to the Luſts of Men, and then bewaile the loſſe of this Opportunity which God hath put into their Hands.</p>
