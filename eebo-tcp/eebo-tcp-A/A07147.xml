            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mistris of the Nouices, and Celarier
shall call their Subiects Sisters, the professed
of the Quier shall call alsoe the Conuerse,

call them dames speaking of others that are
professed of the Quier, the Prioresse must bee
called of all Mother; the Mistrisse, of her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
must bee called Mistrisse, the Cellarier
is alsoe to bee called Mother of those that

lett them doe Reuerence each one to the

which noe wayes standeth with the

about spirituall matters, or at lestwise about
such matters as may sauour of spiritt, and
nourish the same;</p>
                     <p>15. In their going and shutting of the

                     <p>18. Whyle they speake with secular
people, and those that come vnto them from

Companion cannot be present, let them
haue another appoynted by the Superiour,
who may heare and see all that is spoken

                     <p>20. If any Religious bee not permitted
to speake with any at the Greate, none may

except they bee such matters as
euery one may well vnderstand them, or
which they know the Superiour will not

euery one is to know that it is most seuerely
prohibited them to accuse any, or blame
them to the Superious, without sufficient

tryed in base and humble Exercises, soe often
as may bee thought expedient, yet they shall
not bee sent to the places appertayning to
the charge of other Officers, except the sayd
Officers consent thereunto; and lett the sayd

vppon whose prudence, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unsayle
the Abbesse may very well rely, in
such difficulties as may occurr: whose alsoe
may well Guyde and direct such Religious
as come vnto them at any tyme for comfort,
or would informe them of matters occurring
according to the Statutes. Therefore they must
bee very discreete and circumspect, noe ways
headdy, free from all inordinate Passions,
Zealous of the common good of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
which they ought to sett fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

maketh for the peace and good disciply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
thereof.</p>
                     <p>2. For asmuch as the Prioresse is wont
to bee admitted to the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ltations, foure
Assistants wilbee sufficient, and they are not
to exceede the number of foure, and the
younger professed among them, must first
in Order deliuer her opinion, before the
Abbesse declare her mynde, or what shee
would haue concluded; lett them all well
and maturely ponder the matter propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1735:50"/>
and if soe bee that the matter may suffer
delay, and bee of great Consequence, lett
them haue longer tyme to discusse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it with themselues, that thereby it may
bee the better determyned.</p>
                     <p>3. Once euery weeke or at least twise
euery Moneth, they must bee called to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
at that houre which the Abbesse
shall appoynte, where shee her selfe must
alsoe preside, and bee present; and one of
these Consulters and Assistants must euery
weeke haue accesse to the Abbesse, to know
of her when the Assistants are to bee called
to Consultation. Before the Consultation
begin, <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus &amp;c.</hi> with the prayer.
<hi>Deus qui corda fidelium &amp;c.</hi> is to bee sayd, and
the Consultation being ended; <hi>Suscipe clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissime

                     </p>
                     <p>4. The things that are handled in Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
most commonly are these, The Causes
and Remedyes of disciplyne broken or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected;
the defects of Officers in their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
the trouble or disgust of any one concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
against any Officer; want of health in
any through indiscretion; dissentions, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretts
meetings, and whisperings; what
manner is to bee obserued in enioyning of
Penances; the Receauing or deliuering of
Messages or writings to Externes; the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1735:51"/>
of Officers; or appointment of new
Officers; the Measure of their diett, to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the defect or excesse committed in
the same; what persons are to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the Conuent, and such like.</p>
                     <p>5. Lett them permitt nothing that may
weaken disciplyne, and if they consult
about the enioyning of any Pennance, after
the thing hath beene maturely determyned,
lett them not afterwards interpose themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
for any moderation. But if vppon better
Information they finde the Case, to stand
other wise then when they consulted about-it,
and that thereby they feare any hurt or
inconuenience may ensue, they must make
it knowne to the Abbesse, and soe committ
it wholy to her discretion.</p>
                     <p>6. Of those things that are propounded
vnto them they may not debate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
out of the place of Consultion, and
then noe otherwise then in the presence of
the Abbesse; and soe in like manner of those
things about which they haue had Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If they shall offend in the contrary,
they must endure the same penance, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other professed should incurr, if they offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the like Case, much lesse may they
communicate vnto others, either within,
or without the Conuent, what hath passed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1735:51"/>
in Consultation, or which may any wise
touch any person of the Conuent; and if
any should vnderstand that Consultation
hath beene had about her selfe, yet none
shall tell her what resolution hath beene
taken about her, but they shall remitt it to
the Relation of the Abbesse her selfe, except
the Abbesse doth otherwise ordayne.</p>
                     <p>7. In their Iudgments lett them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themselues to the Commaundement
of the Abbesse neither may they contend
among themselues, or stand to st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in their owne opinions, they must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
each other with meaknesse, and
propose their reasons with all humilitie,
yet alsoe with Religious freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Where vppon the lady Abbesse must
bee willing to heare their aduises, and must
permitt them to haue their necessary liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in speaking their mynds; yea moreouer
shee must inuite, rnd incourage them, that
herein they carefully doe their Office, and
duty, and if any thing chance to bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by any of them, that may bee distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to her, lett her rather winke thereat,
then that the Assistants bee made afrayde
to deliuer with fredome their opinions, as
they are obliged to doe in matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
to the common good: neither
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1735:52"/>
ought the Abbesse to departe from that
they all Counsayle her, but vppon sufficient
ground and reason.</p>
                     <p>8. If nothing occurr whereof they
should consult yet the Abbesse ought to
call them togeather to see if her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

haue any thing to propound vnto her,
and if nothing of worth doe occurr they
may bee dismissed.</p>
                     <p>9. When the Religious will declare to
the Assistants their mynds concerning those
things which they are not willing to declare
to the Abbesse her selfe, whereby s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an answeare and resolution as the Case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                     <p>10. Euery one must know that they
may not deale about any matter with the
Assistants, but vppon this Condition, that
what they declare vnto them, should bee
made knowne vnto the Abbesse, neither
may they giue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it bee kept secrett and vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

                     <p>11. After the Assistants leaue their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet they may not discouer to others in
any sort those things that haue beene done
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1735:52"/>
or vttered in their Consultations, except
onely such matters as by the Abbesse were

her by any of the assistants, but onely (as

                        </gap> Sisters are admitted
into this Congregation, that by their
pious labours they may serue their God and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1735:62"/>
Creator, and that they may assist those, whoe
haue dedicated themselues to his holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and soe serue with them the selfe

Statutes, Rules and Sacred Vowes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must endeauour to draw that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

Labours, in such sort that they may fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish

of almightie God, and to the Saluation of
their omne Soules.</p>
                     <p>2. The Conuerse Sisters (being noe lesse

in like sort bee prouided for in all things
that appertayne to ther spirituall and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

and impediments that are incident to

                     <p>3. They must know that all such Statutes, that
any wise touch the Religious of the Quiar<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
doe alsoe appertayne vnto them, soe farr
forth as by their State they may bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated

                     <p>4. They vnto whom any perticular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

directions from their Superiour in writing,
the which they must haue sett vpp in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                     <p>5. Euery day they must attend to mentall
and vocall prayer, for soe long a tyme as the
Superiour shall appoynte them, which may
bee longer or shorter as their Labours, and
businesses will permitt them, If they shall
perceaue that they are not soe apt for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

acquaint their ghostly Father therewith that
they may imploy the tyme of prayer in some
other exercise of deuotion.</p>

and <hi>Aue Marias</hi> prescribed.</p>
                     <p>7. They that are admitted for Conuerse
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1735:63"/>
Sisters, after they haue made their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
may neuer passe to the State of the
Professed of the Quier, and therefore they
may not learne to sing, read or write, nor
yet may they bee taught to doe the some.</p>
                     <p>8. They may vse all religious freedome
with their Superiours, for which cause they
may confidently repayre vnto them if they
want any thing, or in their labours finde
them selues ouercharged aboue ther streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
and both Superiour as alsoe all the
rest must loue them as their most deare Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and carry them selues towards them
in all Charitie, beneuolence, and true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
affection.</p>
                     <p>9. If at any tyme the Nouices bee sent
by their Mistresse, or the Professed of the
Quiar by the Superiour to serue in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
or such like places, the Conuerse
must soe seeke to direct them in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that withall they carry them selues
towards them with all religious gentlenesse
humilitie and discretion, neither may they
take more vppon them then is meete in their
proceedings or speeckes, but they must with
sweetnesse teach them, when they see any
rhing worthy to bee amended in them, but
in those things which! appertayne not to
their Offices, lett them in forme their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours

of them.</p>
                     <p>10. Let them auoyde all bitternesse among
them selues, but rather lett them seeke to
nourish that mutuall charitie, which bee
seemeth them, lett them behaue themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
with all obedience towards their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
whom they must reuerence in
most humble manner, the Religious of the
Quier they must honour and respect each
one according to that Estate where in shee
is.</p>
                     <p>11. They must bee very dilligent and
warry that there happen noe danger by
their Fyre or Candle in the places of their
Offices, they must see that all things bee
neate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd cleanely, they must haue a noate
of all such things as are deliuered to their
vse and Custody, that they may make a due
accompt and reckoning of all things when
it shall bee required of them.</p>
                     <p>12. They must bee very carefull and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
that nothing bee vnprofitably wasted
or spoyled in their Offices, they must alsoe
bee very great louers of Pouerty, and in all
the places of their labours they must speake
very sparingly, and for the most parte of
things necessary, and then they must speake
with a submissiue and lowe Voyce.</p>

                     <p>3. They that are notably defectiue either

her to make her Profession before shee

according to that which is decreed in

ordinarily lett none bee receaued, that after
two yeares cannot make her Profession.</p>

they may well ponder and cast with them,
by what meanes they may best with fruyte
vse that benefitt of god his holy Grace and

                     <p>21. They must not ordinaryly bee admitted
to make their Profession before they bee

The Suffrages of the Religious for those that

shall propose to the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopp,
that hee would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to appoynte and constitute
some one Visitor of the Monastery, whose
authoritie shall wholly in all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
of the Bishopp; and the place of his
ordinary residence must bee at the most but
one dayes Iourney from the Monastery, and
he must yearely make a visitation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
and that must bee within the Feasts
of S. Iohn Baptist, and of the Assumption
of the blessed Virgin Mary, if it can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bee soe.</p>
                     <p>2. If at any tyme the Visitation cannot
bee made at the ordinary appoynted tymes,
the Abbesse shall certify the Conuent of the
hindrance, and when the tyme of the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
approacheth; shee must v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of writing to the Visitour, which is sett
downe in the booke of Ceremonyes.</p>

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1735:72"/>3. The Conuent must chouse one that is
skillfull in the practise of Religion, and is
a Religious man, who may assist at the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And because the Abbesse is likelyest
best to know who may bee most fitt
for this purpose, after shee hath deliberated
of the matter with her Assistants, shee shall
propose two or three to the Conuent, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
free vnto them to chuse one of them
or some other, as may seeme meetest to
them.</p>
                     <p>4. During the Visitation all must yeald
their accustomed obedience to the Abbesse,
and other Superiors, in those things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne
to ordinary disciplyne, neither may
they require of the Visitor leaue to doe any
thing before they haue first warned the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse
thereof.</p>
                     <p>5. The Abbesse must deliuer a noate of
all the names of her Religious and Family
to the Bishopp or Visitor, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to visitt, and shee must write downe
what Office, euery one beareth in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.</p>
                     <p>6. To the end that euery one with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aduise may declare to the Visitor their
mynds, and difficulties, they shall deliuer
vnto him in writing what they would say
vnto him. And all must haue free accesse
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1735:72"/>
to the Visitor, that in any sort appertayne
to the Monastery. But they that cannot wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
may explicate to him their myndes by
word of Mouth.</p>
                     <p>7. They shall auoyde and fly all kinde
of exagerations in those things that they
write and propounde, and they shall onely
make a naked Relation of the matter, and
they must maturely ponder with themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
whether their Superiors could not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
sufficiently of themselues amended and
reformed those things which they declare
vnto the Visitor or whether at leastwise
the Superiors vnderstoode the case, that they
might thereby haue prouided some remedy
for it.</p>
                     <p>8. Those things that are to bee confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

which of himselfe he may enquire or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)

                     <p>9. The bookes of accomptes, and the
some of the Prouision they haue made, must
bee shewed to the Visitor, as vnto him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe
must bee declared, what is lett, and
in what manner and by whose ayde and

those of the last Visitation (if any

Orders and Ordinations are to bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

bee thought onely such things, as are onely
accommodated to certayne tymes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>10. If any would deliuer her Complaynte
to the Visitor, lett her see that shee doe

from all Passion, and shee must onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

where of hee examined, neither shall shee
