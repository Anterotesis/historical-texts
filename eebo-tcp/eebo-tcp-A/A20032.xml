         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Furthermore Damianus a Goes,<note place="margin">Damianus a Goes</note> wryteth in his booke <hi>De de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratione Lappianae gentis,</hi> that he was the fyrst that moued Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to speake sumwhat hereof: And that he (Erasmus I meane) was determined to write a iust volume of this matter yf he had not byn preuented by death. Albeit (sayth Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) in his booke entiteled Ecclesiastes, he dyd not keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of so wicked an vngodlynesse, whiche surely is suche, that it may in maner make all Christian men (and especiallye such vnto whom god hath gyuen poure and knowleage) giltie of so heyghnous a crime,<note place="margin">To the christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an princes.</note> that he may take vengeance of them in the day of iudgement before the iuste iudge Chryst.

And these be the very woordes of the woorshipful and lerned man Damianus a Goes, wrytten to the bysshoppe of Rome Paule the thyrde of that name, whom he further char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to looke diligently hereunto, as a thynge moste chiefely perteynynge to the office of Christian prelates.

Consyder with yowre selues if it were onely to get worldely ryches, howe redye and greedy yowe wolde bee to venture a greate deale to get a thyrde part, with owt castynge of any perell by lande or by sea, as the wyttie poet Horase hath in fewe wordes descrybed the marchauntes desyre and aduentures to obteyne rychesse.<note place="margin">The marchant</note>

So it is therfore, that <hi>Andreas Moralis</hi> the pylot, and <hi>Ouiedus</hi> (of whom we haue made mention before) repayred to me, at my house in the towne of Matrite, As we met thus togyther, there arose a contention betwene them two, as concernynge this course of the Ocean. They both agree that these landes and regions perteynynge to the dominion of Castile, doo with one continuall tract and perpetuall bonde, embrase as one hole firme lande or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent al the mayne lande lyinge on the north syde of <hi>Cuba</hi> and the other Ilandes,<note place="margin">The contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t or firme land.</note> beinge also northwest both from <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola.</hi> Yet as touchynge the course of the water, they var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in opinion. For <hi>Andreas,</hi> wyll that this vyolent course of water bee receaued in the lappe of the supposed continente
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4616:173"/>
which bendeth so much and extendeth so farre towarde the North, as we haue said: And that by the obiect or resistance of the lande so bendynge and crookynge, the water shulde as it were rebounde in coompasse, and by force therof be dryuen about the north syde of <hi>Cuba</hi> and the other Ilandes excluded without the circle cauled <hi>Tropicus Caneri,</hi> where the largenes of the sea maye receaue the waters faulynge frome the narowe streames, and therby represse that inordinate course, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the sea is there very large and great. I can compare his meanynge to nothynge more aptely then to the swyfte streame commyng foorth of a mylle and faulyng into the myl poole. For in al suche places where waters runne with a vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent faule through narowe chanels, and are then receaued in large pooles, they are soodenly disparcled and theyr violence broken: So that wheras before they seemed of such force as to ouerthrowe all thynges beinge in theyr waye, it can not then be perceaued which way they runne. The Admiral him selfe <hi>Diegus Colonus,</hi>

But wheras they fyrst take the waye by the mayne sea towarde the North be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they directe theyr course to Spayne, he saythe that in that tract, he felt the shippe sumtymes a lyttle dryuen backe by the contrary course of the water. Yet supposeth that this chaunceth onely by the ordinarie flowynge and reflowynge of the sea: And the same not to be enforced by the circumflec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion or course of the water reboundynge in compasse as we haue sayde. But thinketh rather, that this mayne lande or supposed continent, shulde sumwhere bee open: And that the sayde open place, shoulde bee as it were a gate, enterie, or streyght, diuydyng the North partes of that lande from the South: by the which also, the Ocean runnynge towarde the West, may by the rotation or impulsion of the heauens, bee dryuen about the hole earth. <hi>Ouiedus</hi> agreeth with <hi>Andreas Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tralis</hi> as touchynge the continuall adherence and closenes of the sayde continente. Yet neyther that the waters shulde so beate ageynst the bendynge backe of the West lande, or bee in

such sorte repulsed and dryuen into the mayne sea. But saith that he hath diligently consydered, that the waters runne from the deepest and myddest of the maine sea, towarde the West. Also that saylinge nere vnto the shore with smaule ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles, he founde the same waters to returne ageine towarde the East.<note place="margin">The contrary course of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> So that in the same place, they runne together with contrary course, as we oftentimes see the lyke to chaunce in riuers wherby the obiecte of the bankes, diuers whirlepooles and turnynges aryse in the water. By reason wherof, if any chaffe, strawe, woodde, or any other thyng of lyght substance be caste in any suche places in ryuers, it foloweth that al such as runne with the water in the myddest of the chanell, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede well forwarde: But suche as faule into the bendynge goulfes and indented margentes of the crooked bankes, are caryed ouerthwarte the chanell, and so wander about vntyll they meete with the ful and directe course of the ryuer.

Of this mynde and opinion was Plinie, who better then any other autoure hathe wrytten in xxxvii. bookes al that perteyneth to the naturall historie, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyned al in one volume dedicated to Uespasian Themperour. Wherein, as a prudente historiographer, he declareth suche thynges as he had harde: Attributynge the seconde autoritie to suche as he had redde in autoures that wrote before hym: And thyrdely ioyned to the same hystorie, such thynges as he hym selfe had seene as moste certeyne testimonie. Whose exem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple I folowynge, wyl in this my breefe summarie reduce and represent to yowr maiesties memorie such thynges as I haue seene in yowre Empyre of the West Indies aswell in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes as in the firme lande of the Ocean sea, where I haue serued nowe more then twelue yeares in the place of suruoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the golde mynes by the commaundemente of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke kynge <hi>Don Fernando</hi> the fyfte of that name and graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto yowre maiestie, to whom god gaue great fame and glorie.

As touchynge which thinges and such other lyke, I haue more largely writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten in a hystorie begunne as sone as my age was rype to take suche matters in hande. Wherein furthermore I haue made mention of suche thynges as haue chaunced in Spaine, from the yeare .1494. vnto this tyme. Addynge also thereunto suche thynges woorthy memorie as I haue obserued in other realmes and prouinces where I haue trauayled.

Determynynge notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge for yowre maiesties recreation to make a breefe rehear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sall of certeyne notable thynges wherof I haue more largely entreated in my sayde general historie, and such as may seeme moste woorthy to bee redde of yowre maiestie. Of the which, although a great parte haue byn wrytten by other who haue also seene the same, yet perhappes they are not so exactly and particularly described as of me, forasmuche as in maner all that trauayle into these Indies haue greater respecte to luker and gaynes then diligently to searche the woorkes of nature wherunto I haue byn euer naturally inclyned, and haue ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore with all possible endeuour applyed myne eyes and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to fynde the same. And this presente Summarie shall not bee contrary or dyuers from my larger historie wherin (as I haue sayde) I haue more amplye declared these thynges: but shal onely more breefely expresse theffect therof vntyl such tyme as Godde shal restore me to myne owne house, where I may accomplyshe and fynishe my sayd general hystorie. Where vnto to gyue the fyrst principle, I say that Don Christopher Colonus (as it is well knowen) beinge the fyrste Admyrall of this India, discouered the same in the dayes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke kynge Don Ferdinando and the ladye Elyzabeth his wyfe, graundfather and graundmother vnto yowre maiestie: In the yeare .1491. And came to <hi>Barzalona</hi> in the yeare 1492. with the fyrst Indians and other shewes and profes of the great ryches and notice of this west Empire. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che gyfte and benefyte was suche, that it is vnto this daye, one of the greatest that euer any subiect or seruant hath done for his prince or countrey, as is manifeste to the hole worlde. And to saye the trewth, this shall doubtlesse bee so commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profytable vnto the hole realme of Spayne, that I repute hym no good Castilian or Spanyarde that doothe not recognise the same. And (as I haue sayde before) foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in my sayde generall historie I haue more largely in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treated of these thynges, I intend at this present only briefe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to rehearse certeyne especiall thynges, the whiche suerly are verye fewe in respecte of the thousandes that myght bee sayde in this behalfe. Fyrst therfore I wyl speake sumwhat of the nauigation into these parties. Then of the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the nations whiche are founde in the same, with their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4616:200"/>
rytes, customes, and cerimonies. Also of beastes, foules, byrdes, woormes, fysshes, seas, ryuers, sprynges, trees, plantes, herbes, and dyuers other thinges which are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered boothe on the lande and in the water. And forasmuche as I am one of thorder and company of them that are appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to returne into these regions to serue yowre maiestie, yf therfore the thynges conteyned in this booke shall not bee di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stincte in such order as I promised to performe in my greater woorke.

From Spayne to these Ilandes, is coommonly

And when they are arryued there, they haue sayled two hundereth and fyftie leaques, whiche make a thousande myles, accomptyng foure myles to a leaque as is their maner to recken by sea. Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge from the sayde Ilandes to folowe their course, the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes tary .xxv. dayes, or a lyttle more or lesse, before they see the fyrste lande of the Ilandes that lye before that whiche they caule <hi>La Spagnuola</hi> or <hi>Hispaniola.</hi> And the lande that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fyrste scene, is one of these Ilandes whiche they caule <hi>Ogni sancti Marigalante</hi> (or <hi>Galanta) La Desseada</hi> (otherwise cauled <hi>Desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derata) Matanino, Dominica, Guadalupe, San.

But makynge this viage with experte maryners (wherof there is nowe great plentie) one of the sayde fyrste Ilandes shall euer bee knowen.

Neuerthelesse in this present yeare of .1525. there came foure shyps from the Iland of <hi>San Dominico</hi> to saint <hi>Luca</hi> in Spaine, in .xxv. dayes.

For I was alowed all maner of charges to make searche for the same. And although golde be founde in maner euery where in these regions of golden Castile, yet owght wee not in euery place to bestowe the trauell, and charge to get it owte, bycause it is of lesse quantitie and goodnesse in sum place then in sum.

And the golde whiche is founde in golden Castile, is verye good, and of .xxii. caractes or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in fynesse. Furthermore, besyde this great quantitie of golde whiche I haue sayde to be founde in the mynes, there is also from day to day found or otherwise gotten, great trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure of suche wrought gold as hath byn in the custodie of the subdued Indians and their kynges, aswell of suche as they haue gyuen for their fyne and raunsome, or otherwise as frendes to the Christians, besyde that whiche hath byn vpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken from the rebelles. But the greatest parte of the wrought gold whiche the Indians haue, is base and holdeth sumwhat of copper. Of this they make braslettes and chaines and in the same they close their iewels whiche their women are accustomed to weare and esteeme more then all the richesse of the worlde.

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whiche so euer of these two maners it be founde, eyther in the riuers or ruptures or breaches of waters, or elles in the earth, I wyll shewe howe it is founde in bothe these places,

Therfore when the myne or veine is discouered, this chaunceth by serchyng and prouyng in suche places as by certeyne sygnes and tooken do appeare to skylfull men apte for the generation of golde and to holde golde. And when they haue founde it, they folowe the myne and labour it, whether it be in the ryuer or in the plaine as I haue sayde. And if it bee founde on the plaine, fyrst they make the place verye cleane where they intende to dygge.

And if not, they dygge a spanne deeper, and washe the earth as they dyd before. And if then also, they fynde nothynge, they continue in dyggyng and wasshyng the earth as before vntil they come to the hard rocke or stone. And if in fyne they fynd no gold there, they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe no further to seeke golde in that place, but go to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte. And it is to be vnderstode, that when they haue founde the myne, they folowe it in digginge in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in leuell and deapth vntill they haue made an ende of al the myne which that place conteyneth, if it appere to be riche. This myne ought to consyst of certen feete or pases in length or breadth accordynge to certeyne orders determined. And within that compasse of earth, it is not lawfull for any other to dygge for golde. And where as endeth the myne of hym that fyrste founde the gold, immediatly it is lawfull for any other man that wyl, with a staffe to assygne hym selfe a place by the syde of the same, inclosynge it with stakes or pales as his owne. These mynes of <hi>Zauana</hi> (that is such as are found in the playnes) owght euer to bee sought neare to sum ryuer or brooke or springe of water, or dyke, or standyng poole, to thende that the golde maye bee wasshed, for the whiche pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they vse the laboure of certeyne Indians as they doo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in dygginge of the myne. And when they haue dygged owte the myne, they fyl certeine traies with that earth, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che other Indians haue the charge immediatly to receaue at their handes, and to carye those treyes of earth to the water where it maye bee wasshed. Yet do not they that brynge it,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4616:203"/>
washe it, but delyuer it to other, puttynge it owte of their owne trayes into theirs which they haue ready in their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to receaue it. These wasshers for the moste parte, are the Indian women, bycause this woorke is of lesse paine and trauayle then any other. These women when they washe, are accustomed to sytte by the waters syde, with their legges in the water euen vppe to the knees or lesse as the place serueth their purpose. And thus holdynge the trays with earth in their handes by the handles therof, and puttynge the same into the water, they moue them rownde aboute after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of syftynge, with a certeyne aptenesse in suche sorte that there entreth no more water into the trais then serueth their turne: And with the selfe same apte mouynge of their trais in the water, they euer auoyd the foule water with the earth owte of the one syde of the vessell, and receaue in cleane wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the other side therof. So that by this meanes by little and lyttle, the water wassheth the earth as the lyghter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce owte of the trais, and the golde as the heauier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter resteth in the bottome of the same, beyng rounde and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in the myddest lyke vnto a barbars basen. And when all the earth is auoyded, and the golde gathered togither in the bottome of the traye, they putte it aparte, and returne to take more earth, whiche they washe continually as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>efore. And thus they that laboure in this woorke, do gather dayly suche portion of golde as shal please god to graunt to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of these Indians and suche other as trauaile in the same. Furthermore, it is to bee noted that for euery two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that washe, it is requisite that two other serue them to brynge earthe from the myne, and other twoo to breake the same smaule and fylle their trais therwith. Also besyde these labourers, it is necessarye that there bee other people in the place where they woorke and reste in the nyghte. These are suche as make their breade, and prouyde for vyttayles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessaryes. So that to conclude, there are in all, fyue persons ordinarily assigned to euery traye of wasshers.</p>
               <p>There is an other maner of woorkyng the mynes in riuers or brookes of runnynge waters. And this is, that in auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge the water of his course, after that the beddes of the ryuers are drye and vtterlye emptied, they fynde golde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the breaches, cliftes, and ryftes of stones, and among
<pb facs="tcp:4616:204"/>
all that is in the bottome of the chanell, and where naturally the riuer runneth of greatest force. So that it chaunceth sum tyme, that when the bedde of the ryuer is good and ryche, they fynde in it great quantitie of golde. And therfore yowe maiestie ought to vnderstande for a generall rule, as it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in facte, that all golde is engendered in the toppes and hyghest places of the montaines: And in continuance of time is by lyttle and lyttle browght downe to the vales and plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by showres of rayne, and the faules of sprynges, ryuers, and brookes hauynge their originall in the mountaynes and descendynge from the same, notwithstandynge it bee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes founde in the plaines farre from the mountaynes.</p>
               <p>But when it chaunceth to be founde in great quantitie, it is for the moste parte amonge the mountaynes and in the riuers, or their branches, more then in any other parte of the plaine.

But when the superficial part of the earth was equal with the leuel where the coles were founde, it is lyke that the coles were left there by sum occasion of fyre, &amp; that they fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there in tyme, and that afterwarde in longe continuance of tyme, they were by lyttle and lyttle couered with the earth which the often showers of rayne washed from the mountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, so that by the course of yeares the earth ouergrewe the coles vnto the sayde leuell and measure whiche had before tyme byn the superficiall parte of the earthe where the coles and golde were founde togyther: whereby it maye appeare

               <p>There are also many roughe and hyghe mountaynes with temperate ayer and pleasaunt, cleare, and moderate nightes. Of the whiche particularitie the auncient writers hauyng no certeyne knowleage, affyrmed the said burnte lyne or <hi>Torrida zona,</hi> or Equinoctial to be naturally vnhabitable. As touching which thing I am able to witnesse the contrary by testimonie of syght and feelyng as by most certeine senses, hauyng liued many yeares in this regions, by reason wherof better credit ought to be giuen to me then to suche as haue grounded their opinion onely vpon coniectures. And to speake further of the sytuation of these regyons, yowe shall vnderstande that the coaste of the Northe sea, beynge in the goulfe of <hi>Vraba</hi> and in the porte of <hi>Dariena,</hi> where the shyppes arryue whiche coome owte of Spayne, is in the syxte degree and a halfe, and in the seuenth, and from syxe and a halfe vnto eyght, excepte a smaule pointe which entereth into the sea toward the North That pointe which of this land and new parte of the worlde lieth moste towarde the East, is the cape of saincte Augustine which is in the eight degree. So that the said goulfe of <hi>Vraba</hi> is distant from the Equinoctiall lyne, from a hundreth and twentie to a hundreth and thirtie leaques and three quarters of a leaque after thaccompte of .xvii. leaques and a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From hense the North starre is seene very lowe And when the starres which are cauled the wardens of the north starre, are vnder the chariotte, it can not bee seene, bycause it is vnder the horisontal. And whereas I haue sayde beefore that it rayneth in these regions at certeyne ordinarie tymes, it is so in deede. For it is wynter and summer there at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tymes to that whiche is in Spayne, where the greateste coulde of froste and rayne is in December and Ianuary: And the greatest heate of sommer aboute saynt Iohannes daye at mydsommer or in the moneth of Iuly.

Why doo we maruayle at the towrebearynge shoulders of Elephantes, and not rather where nature hathe placed so many sences and suche industry in suche lyttle bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? where is hearynge, smellynge, seeinge, and feelynge, ye, where are the vaynes &amp; arteries (without which no beaste can lyue or moue) in these so lyttle boddies whereof sume are so smaule that theyr hole boddies can scarsely be sene of owr eyes, what shall we then saye of the partes of the same? Yet euen amonge these are there many of such sagacitie and indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strye as the lyke is not seene in beastes of greater quantitie, no nor yet in man. &amp;c. But to returne to the hystorie. This enemie which nature hath gyuen to these lyttle beastes, vseth this maner to assayle them. When he resortethe to the hyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke where the antes lye hid as in theyr fortresse, he putteth his toonge to one of the ryftes wherof we haue spoken being as subtyle as the edge of a swoorde, and there with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lyckynge, maketh the place moyst, the fome and froth of his mouth beinge of such propertie that by continual lycking the place, it enlargeth the ryfte in such sort by lyttle and lyt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle, that at the length he easely putteth in his toonge whiche he hath very longe and thynne, and much disproportionate to his bodye. And when he hath thus made free passage for his toonge into the hyllocke to put it easely in and owt at his pleasure, then he thrusteth it into the hole as farre as he can reache, and so letteth it reste a good space vntyl a great quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titie of the antes (whose nature reioyseth in heate and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) haue laden his tonge and as many as he can conteyne in the holownesse therof: at which tyme he suddeynly draweth it into his mouth and eateth them, and returneth ageyne to the same practise immediatly vntyl he haue eaten as manye as hym lysteth, or as longe as he can reache any with his tonge. The flesshe of this beaste, is fylthy and vnsauery. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son of thextreme shyftes and necessitie that the Christian men were put to at theyr fyrst commynge into these partes, they were inforced to proue al thynges and so fel to theatyng of

these beastes. But when they had founde more delycate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, they fell into hatred with this.

And this at so lyttle a hole that it could hardely be founde yf certeyne of them were not seene to passe in and owt. But by this way the beares coulde haue no such poure to hurte them as aboue at the sayde ryftes as I haue sayde. There is an other strange beaste whiche by a name of contrary effecte,<note place="margin">A straunge beast whiche seemeth a kynd of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon.</note> the Spanyardes caule <hi>Cagnuolo leggiero,</hi> that is the lyght dogge, wheras it is one of the sloweste beastes in the worlde, and so heauy and dull in mouynge that it canne scarsely go fyftie pases in a hole day. These beastes are in the firme lande, and are very straunge to beholde for the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that they haue to all other beastes. They are abowte two spannes in length when they are growne to theyr full byggenesse. But when they are very younge, they are sume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more grosse then longe. They haue foure subtyle fiete, and in euery of them foure clawes lyke vnto byrdes, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togyther. Yet are nother theyr clawes or theyr fiete able to susteyne theyr bodyes from the grounde. By reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and by the heauynesse of theyr boddies, they drawe theyr bellyes on the grounde. Theyr neckes are hygh and streyght and all equall lyke the pestle of a morter, which is altogyther equall euen vnto the toppe withowt makynge any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or similitude of a headde, or any dyfference excepte in the noddle. And in the toppes of theyr neckes, they haue verye rounde faces much lyke vnto owles: And haue a marke of theyr owne heare after the maner of a cyrcle whiche makethe theyr faces seeme sumwhat more longe then large. They haue smaule eyes and rounde: And nostrylles lyke vnto munkeys. They haue lyttle mouthes, and moue theyr neckes frome one syde to an other as thoughe they were astonysshed. Theyr chiefe desyre and delyte is to cleaue and stycke faste vnto trees or sume other thynge whereby they may clyme alofte. And therfore for the moste parte, these beastes are founde vppon trees whervnto cleauynge fast, they mounte vp by lyttle and lyttle, steyinge them selues by theyr longe clawes. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure of theyr heare, is betwene russet and whyte, and of the proper coloure of the heare of a wesell. They haue no tayles, and theyr voyce is much dyfferynge frome other beastes: for

they synge onely in the nyght: And that continually frome tyme to tyme syngynge euer syxe notes one hygher then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so faulynge with the same that the fyrste note is the hyghest and the other in a baser tewne as yf a man shuld say <hi>La, sol, fa, mi, re, vt.</hi> So this beast sayth, <hi>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha.</hi> And doubtelesse, it seemeth vnto me, that as I haue sayde in the chapiter of the beaste cauled <hi>Bardari,</hi> that those beastes might bee thoriginall and document to imbarbe horses, euen so the fyrste inuenture of musycke myght seeme by the hearynge of this beast to haue the fyrst principles of that scyence rather then by any other thynge in the worlde. But nowe to returne to the hystorie: I say that in a shorte space after this beaste hath soonge and hath paused a whyle, she returneth ageyne to the selfe same songe, and doth this only in the nyght and not in the day. By reason wherof and also bycause of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll syght, I thynke her to bee a nyght beaste and the frende of darkenesse. Sumtymes the Christian menne fynde these beastes and brynge theym home to theyr howses, where also they creepe all abowte with theyr naturall slowenesse, in so much that nother for threatenynge or pryckynge they wyll moue any faster then theyr natural and accustomed pase. And yf they fynde any trees, they creepe thyther immediatly, and mounte to the toppe of the hyghest braunche thereof, where they remayne continually for the space of eyght, or tenne, or twentie dayes without eatynge of any thinge as farre as any man can iudge. And wheras I my selfe haue kepte theym in my house, I coulde neuer perceaue other but that they lyue onely of ayer. And of the same opinion are in maner all men of those regions, bycause they haue neuer scene them eate any thynge, but euer turne theyr heades and mouthes towarde that parte where the wynde b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So it is therfore, that in the firme land there are many sortes of reedes, so that in many places they make theyr howses therof, couerynge them with the toppes of the same, and makynge theyr waules of them in lyke maner, as I haue sayde before. And amonge these kyndes of reedes, there is one so greate, that the canes therof are as bygge as a mans legge in the knee, and three spannes in length frome ioynt to ioynt or more: in so much that euery of them is of ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pacitie to conteyne a lyttle bucket of water.

There is founde an other kynde which suerly is marueylous, beynge lyttle byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a Iauelen, the canes whereof are longer then twoo spannes. These reedes growe one farre from an other, as sum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes twentie or thirtie pases, and sumetymes also twoo or three leaques. They growe in maner in all prouynces in the Indies: And growe nere to very hygh trees whereunto they leane, and creepe vp to the toppes of theyr braunches, which they imbrase and descende ageyne downe to the earth. Theyr canes are full of moste cleare water without any maner of tast or sauoure eyther of the canes or of any other thynge: And suche as yf it were taken owte of the fressheste sprynge in the worlde. Nor yet is it knowen that euer it hurte any that droonke therof. For it hath oftentymes so chaunced that as the Chrysten men haue trauayled in these regions in desolate wayes where for lacke of water they haue byn in great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

to dye for thyrste, they haue escaped that perell by reason that they founde the sayde reedes, of the water of whose ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they haue droonke a great quantitie withowt any hurte thereof ensewynge. Therefore when they fynde these in any place, they make water vesselles of the canes therof, and cary as many of them ful of water as may suffice for one dayes ior<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nay.

At which tyme they take it and hange it in theyr houses where all the cluster waxeth rype with all his Platans.

But
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4616:226"/>
of that which I my selfe haue seene, I can testifie that in the firme lande in the vyllage of Acla there are of this sorte sum taken and kylled of suche byggenes that sixe men with much difficultie coulde scarsely drawe them owt of the water. And commonly the least sort of them are as much as two men may cary at a burden. That which I sawe lifted vp by syxe men, had her shell a yarde and a quarter in length, and in breadth more then fyue yardes. The maner of takynge them, is this.

And when they coomme owt of the sea and bringe foorth theyr egges and go togyther by coompanies from the sea to feade on the lande, the Christians or Indians folowe theyr steppes whiche they fynde in the sande, and soone ouertake them bycause they are very heauy and slowe in goynge, although they make all the haste they can to return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When they that pursewe them haue ouertaken them, they put a stake or staffe vnder theyr legges and ouerturne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> on theyr backes as they are yet runnynge, so that they can go no further nor yet ryse ageyne or turne. And thus they suffer them to lye styll whyle they folowe after the reste which they ouerturne in lyke maner: And by this meanes take very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye at suche tymes as they coome furth of the sea as I haue sayde. This fysshe is very excellent and holsome to be eaten, and of good taste. The seconde of the three fysshes wherof I haue spoken, is the Tiburon.<note place="margin">Tiburons.</note> This is a very greate fysshe and very quicke and swyfte in the water, and a cruell deuourer. These are often tymes taken, as well when the shippes are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sayle in the Ocean, as also when they lye at anker, or at any other time, and especially the leaste kynd of these fisshes. When the shippes are vnder sayle, the biggest sorte are taken after this maner. When the Tiburon seeth the shippe sailinge he foloweth it swymmynge behynde.

are disposed to take them, they cast downe by the sterne of the shippe, a hoke of yren as bigge as the biggest finger of a mans hande of three spannes in lengthe and crooked like a fysshehooke with beardes accordinge to the bignesse thereof, and fastened to an iren chayne of fyue or syxe linkes neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thende, and from thense tyed with a greate rope, fastening also on the hooke for a bayte, a piece of sum fisshe, or hogges flessh, or sum other flesshe, or the bouwelles and intralles of an other Tiburon wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is doubtlesse a good fysshe and of greate commoditie to serue the shippes for vitalles for many dayes. The leaste of these fysshes are moste holsome and tender.

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as in dyuers places of this historie, mention is made of precious stones, I haue thought good to declare sumewhat aswell of theyr prices as of the places of theyr generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that wee may not vtterly bee ignorant of the thinges which we so greately esteeme and bye so deare.</p>

               <p>THe Rubies growe in India: and are founde for the most parte in a ryuer named Pegu. These are of the best kind and fineste, whiche they of the lande of Malabor caule Nunpuclo, and are well soulde if they bee fayre and cleane without spottes. The Indians to know theyr finenesse, put them vppon theyr toonges, coumptynge that to bee best that is couldest and most harde. And to see theyr finenesse, they take them vp with a piece of waxe by the sharpest poynt: and lookynge ageynst the lyght, espie in theim euery smaule spot or flake. They are also founde in certeyne diepe fosses or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes which are made in mountaynes that are beyonde the said ryuer. They are scoured and made cleane in the countrey of Pegu. Yet can they not square and polyshe them. But for this purpose sende them to dyuers other contreys, and especi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally to Paleatate, Narsinga, Calicut, and the region of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>labar, where are many cunnynge Lapidaries.</p>
               <p>And to gyue yow intelligence of the value of these stones, ye shall vnderstande that this woorde Fanan, signifiethe a weight sumwhat more then two of owre carattes: And .xi.

And beinge rubbed vppon the touche stone, they leaue the coloure of copper. And the Smaragde of this sorte is the best and most trewe: And is in value in Calicut, as much as a diamunde and sumwhat more: And this not by weyght, but by greateness, bycause the diamunde quantitie for quantitie, is of greater weyght then the Smaragde. Ther is lykewyse founde an other kynde of Smaragdes, whiche are greene stones, but not so much esteemed. Neuerthelesse, the Indians reserue these to set them foorth with other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones. They leaue not any greene coloure vppon the touche.</p>

For althoughe (as Munster saithe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the region of Moscouia beareth nother vines or oliues, or any other frutes of sweete sauoure by reason of the coulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse therof, neuerthelesse forasmuch as floures (wherof hony is chiefely gathered) may in sommer season growe abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the playnes,<note place="margin">Floures of trees.</note> marysshes, and wooddes, not onely on the grownde but also on trees in coulde regions, it is agreeable to good reason that great plentie of honye shulde bee in suche regions as abounde with floures, which are brought furthe with the fyrst degree of heate and fyrst approch of the sonne, as appeareth in the sprynge tyme not onely by the springinge of floures in fyeldes and gardeynes, but also of blossomes of trees spryngynge before the leaues or frute,<note place="margin">Blossoomes of trees.</note> as the lyghter and thynner matter fyrste drawne owte with the loweste and leaste degree of heate,<note place="margin">An exemple of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heate.</note> as the lyke is seene in the arte of styl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge wherby all thinne and lyght moystures are lyfted vp by the fyrste degree of the fyre: and the heuyest and thickest moy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stures are drawne owt with more vehement fyre.

            <p>Wee wyll intreate of this matter, not as puttynge the same in question as dyd the owld wryters, nor gatherynge iudgement deducted of reasons in way of argument, forasmuch as wee are alredy more certeyne by hystorie that these coulde regions are inhabi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted. Wee wyll fyrst therfore shewe by naturall reason and by consideration of the sphere, declare how by the helpe of man and arte, coulde regions are inhabited withowt domage or destruction of lyuynge beastes: And wyll fyrste speake of the qualitie of sommer,<note place="margin">The qualitie of soomer in could regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s.</note> declarynge howe it is there augmented Yet intende I not to comprehende all that maye bee sayde in this matter, but only rehearse such reasons and similitudes as are most apparent and easy to bee vnderstoode.</p>
            <p>In such regions therfore, as are extended from the burnt line or Equinoctiall towarde the north, as much as the sonne rysethe hygher ouer theim,<note place="margin">The course of the sonne.</note> so muche are they the more burnte with heate, as Affrica, bycause it ryseth hyghest ouer them as they are nearest to the Equinoctiall: and taryinge with theim so much the shorter time causeth shorter days, with longer &amp; coulder nyghtes to restore the domage of the day past by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the moisture consumed by vapour.<note place="margin">Uapours.</note> But in such regions ouer the which the sonne ryseth lower (as in Sarmatia) it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there the longer in the day, and causeth so much the shor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter and warmer nyghtes,<note place="margin">Short and Warme nyghtes.</note> as reteynynge warme vapoures of the day past, which vapours helpe the woorke of the day.

For I haue felt the sommer nyghtes scarsely tollerable for heate in Gothlande,<note place="margin">Gothlande</note> wheras I felte them coulde in Rome.</p>
            <p>This benefite of thincrease of the day, doth augment so much the more in coulde regions as they are nearer the poles: and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4616:289"/>
ceaceth not vntyll it coome directly ouer the center or poynte of the ares or axceltree of the worlde, where the sonne beinge at the hyghest in sommer,<note place="margin">One day of .vi monethes.</note> is eleuate abowt .xxiiii. degrees: In which regions, one continual day consisteth of .vi. monethes from the sprynge tyme by the standynge of the soonne (cauled Solstitium) in the signe of Cancer to Autumne. The soonne therfore, withowt any offence of the night, gyueth his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vppon those landes with heate that neuer ceasethe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge that tyme, which maketh to the great increase of soom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer by reason of continuance.<note place="margin">howe the sommer is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creased in could regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s.</note> We haue now therfore thought good to gather by a certeyne coniecture howe greately wee thinke the soommer to bee increased hereby.</p>
            <p>Wee haue before declared howe hyghe the soonne is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ouer the regions that are vnder the poles at the staye of the soonne: And so manye partes is it eleuate in Rome at the stay of the soonne in wynter (that is) at the shortest day in the yeare.<note place="margin">Rome.</note> But here, in the mydde wynter, the soonne at noone tyde is beneficiall, and bryngeth foorth floures, roses, and ielefloures. I haue gathered sum in wynter in the moneth of December, not procured at home by humane arte, but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this benig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie of the soonne,<note place="margin">Could nights in hot regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s.</note> continueth not past fiue houres in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall day, forasmuch as thoperation therof is extinct by the couldenesse of the nyght folowynge. But if this benefite myght bee receaued withowt hinderaunce of the nyght, as it is vnder the poles, and so continue many monethes in hot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions vnto winter, it shulde suerlye brynge foorthe manye woonderfull thynges, if moysture fayled not. And by this condition thus propounded, wee may well conceaue that the Romane winter,<note place="margin">The Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus by a similitude of the height of the soonne vnder bothe places, and of the knowen qualitie of the Romane heauen, and by thaccesse of the soonne to such places where the longest day continueth certeyne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, wee maye gather that soommer in places vnder the pole, is lyke vnto and equall with the full Romane sprynge.</p>
            <p>But the more difficulte question, is of the tyme of the .vi moonethes in the whiche the soonne leaueth those regions,<note place="margin">One nyght of vi. monethes</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:4616:290"/>
and goth by the contrarye or ouerthwarte circle towarde the south in wynter.<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> For they say that at that tyme, those regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deformed with horrible darkenesse and nyghtes not increased, which may bee the cause that beastes can not seke theyr foode. And that also the coulde shulde then bee in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>olle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: by which double euyls all thynges constrayned shulde dye, so that no beaste were able to abyde thiniuries of wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and famen insuinge therof: but that all beastes shulde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshe before the sommer folowynge, when they shulde bringe furth theyr broode or succession: And that for these causes, the sayde coulde clime shulde bee perpetually desolate and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>habitable. To al which obiections, we answere in this maner</p>
            <p>As touchynge the nyghtes not increased, I saye, that it was not conuenient to assume that for any reason. For not as the soonne fauleth, so suddeynly commeth the darke night but that the euenynge dooth substitute and prolonge the day longe after,<note place="margin">The twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghtes.</note> as also the day sprynge or dawnynge of the daye gyueth a certeyne lyght before the rysinge of the soonne: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whiche, the residue of the nyght that receaueth no light by the sayde euenynge and mornynge twilightes, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complysshed by the lyght of the moone,<note place="margin">The lyght of the mone.</note> so that the nyghtes are seldome vnaugmented. Let this bee an exemple proued by owre temperate regions, wherby we may vnderstande the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition of the nyght vnder the pole.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he myght vnder the pole.</note> Therfore euen there also the twilightes helpe the nyght a longe tyme, as we wyl more presently demonstrate. It is approued by the Astronomers, that the soonne descendynge from the highest halfe sphere by xviii. paralels of the vnder horizon, makethe an ende of the twylight,<note place="margin">A demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> so that at the lengthe the darke nyght succedeth: And that the soonne approchynge, and rysynge aboue the hyghest halfe sphere by as many paralels, dooth diminysshe the nyght and increase the twylyght. Ageyne, by the positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or placeinge of the sphere vnder the pole, the same is the horizontall that is the Equinoctiall. Those paralelles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are paralels to the horizontal line, are also paralels to the Equinoctiall. So that the soonne descendynge there vnder the horizon, dooth not brynge darke nyghtes to those regions vntyll it coomme to the paralele distant .xviii. partes from the Equinoctiall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:4616:290"/>Other demonstrations hereof are made by certeyne fygures of Astronomie, whiche I wolde haue added hereunto but that I coulde not gette the same grauen or cutte.</p>
            <p>Durynge the tyme of these sayde syxe moonethes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnder the pole, the nyght is destitute of the benefite of the soonne and the sayde twylyghtes, onely for the space of three moonethes, in the whiche the soonne goeth and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the portion of the ouerthwart circle. But yet neyther this tyme of three moonethes is withowt remedy frome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For the moone with her full globe increased in lyghte,<note place="margin">The Moone.</note> hath accesse at that tyme, and illuminateth the moonethes lackynge lyght, euery one by them selues, halfe the course of the moonethe: by whose benefite it coommeth to passe that the night, named as vnaugment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is the reason conceaued of the poure of the sphere wherby we testifie that the sommers and nyghtes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pole, are tollerable to lyuynge beastes.</p>
            <p>But wee wyll nowe declare by other remedies of nature and arte,<note place="margin">Remedies of nature &amp; art.</note> that this coulde so greatly feared, is more remisse &amp; tollerable then owre opinion: so that compared to the nature of such beastes as liue there, it may bee abydden. And there is no doubt but there are autours of more antiquitie then that age in the which any thynge was exactly knowen or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of the north regions. The owlde wryters therfore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded onely by naked coniecture, dydde gather what they myght determine of those places: Or rather by the estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heauen, the which, bycause they felte it to bee hardely tollerable to them selues, and lesse to men borne in the clyme of Egypte and Grecia, tooke therby an argument of the hole habitable earth. The hystorie of Strabo is knowen, that a potte of brasse which was broken in sunder with frosen wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">A brasen pot broken with frost.</note> was brought from Pontus and shewed in Delphis in to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of a greuous wynter.

But we with better confidence and faithe (forasmuch as we are not instructed with coniectures) intend to stande ageynst the sentence of the owld autours: Affirming the north regions within the coulde clime to bee inhabyted with hearynges,<note place="margin">Fysshes of the North seas.</note> coddes, haddockes, and brettes, tunnyes, and other great fysshes, with thinfinite number wherof, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are furnysshed through a great parte of Europe: Al whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are taken in the north sea extended beyonde owr knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage.<note place="margin">The North sea.</note> This sea at certeyne tymes of the yeare, poureth furth his plentifulnesse, or rather dryueth furth his increase to seke newe mansions, and are here taken in theyr passage.

But neyther here beinge able to brynge his sute to passe, he caused the matter to bee moued to the kynge of Portugale Don Alonso the fyfte of that name: at whose handes he founde neither fauour nor money, forasmuch as the licenciate Calzadilla the byshop of Uiseo,<note place="margin">Barnarde knewe not all thynges.</note> and one master Rodrigo men of credit in the science of Cosmographie, withstoode him and contended that there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was nor coulde any golde or other ryches bee founde in the west as Colon affirmed.

The which obiection, as it is grose and simple, proceadyng of the narownesse of the vnderstandyng of such as can not conceaue the large circumference of the lande and sea, euen so may it be answered with this simple demonstration. In a rynge that serueth for the fynger of a mans hande,<note place="margin">A rynge. A circle.</note> the space of halfe an ynche or lyttle more, is halfe a cyrcle. But in a rynge or cyrcle of bygger circumference, as in the hoope of a tubbe, halfe an ynche appeareth in maner a ryght line, althowghe it bee not so in deede, forasmuch as it is not possible for any parte of a circle to consist of a ryght line, neyther any parte of a line to consyst of a cyrcle, sithe the partes must needes bee conforma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the hole, consystynge of such vniforme partes as are in mathematicals.
