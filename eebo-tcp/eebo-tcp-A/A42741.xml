         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Commander of all
Freſh-Water <hi>Fiſh;</hi>
therefore I begin with
him firſt: And he is
Ravenous, that I my
ſelf, at <hi>Boately,</hi> near
<hi>Oxford,</hi> with my
Trole, took a great Over-grown <hi>Pike,</hi>
that was within an Inch of a Yard-long;
and when he came to be opened, he had
an other large one, of above a Quarter
of a Yard-long, in his Belly: And I will,
upon occaſion, bring evidence, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38442:8"/>
                        <hi>Pike,</hi> which was taken out of the others
Belly, had a ſmall Bird that is uſed to
lodge in the Reeds, in the Pouch of it:
But no more of this. Now for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which was, How to catch this</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>depiction of a pike</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>His feeding is generally of <hi>Roach,
Dace, Gudgeons,</hi> or <hi>Froggs;</hi> but above
all, he delighteth moſt in Fair <hi>Gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
and where there is not ſtore of
ſmall <hi>Fiſh,</hi> he feeds of a Weed called,
<hi>Pike-rell-Weed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now your firſt way of Taking a <hi>Pike,</hi>
that I ſhall teach, is, By a frixed Bait,
which is done (if in a ſtanding Water)
by having a Line of about twenty Yards
long, made faſt to a ſtick, ſtuck in the
ground; and having baited your Hook
with a Live <hi>Gudgeon, Roach,</hi> or <hi>Dace,</hi>
throw it as far as conveniently you can,
or in the like-lieſt place you ſee for a
<hi>Pike,</hi> leaving two Yards, or there-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
looſe upon the ground by your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38442:8"/>
Peg, that you may ſee when your Line
is run out ſtrait; at which time be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that you have got a <hi>Pike.</hi> You
may make uſe of as many Lines as
you pleaſe, the more you Lay out,
the like-lier you are to have the more
Sport.</p>
                     <p>But if you would take a <hi>Pike</hi> in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or any other Moving Water, I will
ſhew you the beſt way ever inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which you may perceive by the
Figure.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>diagram of a method for fishing for pike</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Take a piece of Cork, about little
more than a quarter of an Inch thick,
cut it round, as you ſee in the Figure,
and then hollow it round the ſides, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38442:9"/>
lap or wind your Line in, which muſt
be about twelve Yards; tye it faſt
round the Cork, and tye a Hook to it,
baited with a live Bait, as you ſee in the
Figure: And when you have left ſo
much of the Line, at the end the Fiſh
hung to, as you think will reach half
depth of the Water you intend to fiſh
in, catch your Line in the Cleft of the
Stick, which muſt be put through the
Cork, as you ſee the Figure; and this
will boy up your Bait, at any diſtance
you place it.</p>
                     <p>This being done, throw your Cork,
Line, and Fiſh, all into the middle of the
Water you intend to fiſh; if in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Stream will carry it down; in
a Mere or Pond, the Wind will give
it Motion: So that, if you have but
two or three of theſe, you need not
fear Sport enough.</p>
                     <p>Now, when the <hi>Pike</hi> bites, his ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo eagerly, as they generally do,
pulls your Line out of the Cleft in the
Stick, and gives him the whole length
of the Line, to pouch your Bait with:
This being done, he will run up and
down a little, but will preſently be
tyred; but let him go whither he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38442:9"/>
will, you need not fear; For, your
Boy will continually be above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Now to take him, you muſt have a
ſtrong piece of three twiſt Pack-thred,
of thirty Yards long, with a Plummet
at the end, of a quarter of a Pound
weight; which caſt beyond the Line,
between your Boy and the <hi>Pike,</hi> and
let it ſink; and it will bring you both
Boy and <hi>Pike:</hi> So that, try all the
wayes that are, you will find none ſo
pleaſant or profitable as this, to take
a <hi>Pike.</hi>

                     <p>All <hi>Pikes,</hi> that are not half a Yard

Roaſt him in this manner:</p>

Firſt, Open your <hi>Pike</hi> at the Gills,
and if need be, give a little cutt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Belly; out of theſe take his
Guts, but keep his Liver, which you
are to ſhred very ſmall with Tyme,
Sweet-Marjerome, and a little Winter-Savory;
to theſe put ſome Pickled
<hi>Oyſters,</hi> and ſome <hi>Anchovies,</hi> two or
three of both, the laſt whole (for the
<hi>Anchovies</hi> will melt, and the <hi>Oyſters</hi>
ſhould not); to theſe add a Pound of
Sweet-Butter, which you are to mix
with the Herbs that are ſhred; and
let them all be well Salted: thoſe being
mixed with a Blade or two of Mace,
muſt be put into the <hi>Pike</hi>'s Belly, and
then his Belly ſowed up ſo cloſe, that,
if poſſible, it may keep all the Butter
in his Belly. Take not off his Scales:
Then you are to thruſt the Spit through
his Mouth, out at the Tayle: And
then with five or ſix ſplit Stixs, or very
thin Lathes, with a good quantity of
Filliting. Theſe Lathes are to be tyed
round about the <hi>Pikes</hi> Belly, from his
Head to his Tayle, and the Tape tyed
ſomething thick to prevent his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or falling from off the Spit. Let
him be Roaſted very leaſurely, and

                        <pb facs="tcp:38442:11"/>

<hi>Anchovies,</hi> and Butter, mixt together;

from him into the Pan.</p>
                     <p>VVhen you have Roaſted him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
you are to hold under him,
(when you unwind, or cutt the Tape
that tyes him) ſuch a Diſh as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to eat him out of, and let him fall
into it, with the Sauce which is
Roaſted in his Belly; and by this means
the <hi>Pike</hi> will be kept unbroken, and
compleat. Then, to the Sauce which
was within, and alſo in the Pan, you
are to add a fit Quantity of good But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to ſqueeze the Juyce of three
or four Oranges: Laſtly, You may
either put into the <hi>Pike,</hi> with the
<hi>Oyſters,</hi> two Cloves of Garlick, and
take it whole out, when the <hi>Pike</hi> is
cutt off the Spit; or, to give the Sauce
a Hogo, let the Diſh (into which you
let the <hi>Pike</hi> fall) be rubbed with it.
The uſing, or not uſing of this Garlick, is
left to your Diſcretion.</p>

obſerve, That <hi>Breams</hi> do moſt of all
love <hi>Ponds,</hi> and <hi>Meres;</hi> but the chiefeſt
way to Take them, is; firſt, Get as big
a <hi>Red-Worm</hi> as you can find without a
knot: Get a pint of them, or more, in an
Evening, in a Garden, after a Showr of
Rain; and put them, with clean Moſs,
well waſhed, pick'd, &amp; the Water ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
out of the Moſſe, as dry as you can,
into an Earthen-Pot; and change the
Moſſe for three or four dayes, for three

weeks, or a month together; and then
your Baits will be in a good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Having your Baits ready, get your
Tackling in this manner; Take three
long Angling-Rods, and as many, and
more Silk-Lines, and as many large
<hi>Gooſe-,</hi> or rather <hi>Swan-</hi>Quill-Floats;
Then take a piece of Lead made
thus <figure>
                           <figDesc>depiction of a lead weight</figDesc>
                        </figure> and faſten them to the lower
end of your Lines: Then faſten your
Link-Hook alſo to the Lead; and to
the end of your Line: Let there be about
a foot, or ten inches, between the Lead
and the Hook, (but be ſure the Lead
be heavy enough to ſink the Float or
Quills under-water, and not the Quill
to bear up the Lead); and the Link,
next your Hook, muſt be ſmaller than
the reſt of your Line; if you dare
venture for fear of a <hi>Pike,</hi> or <hi>Pearch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, the Worm being well baited, it

gorge up your Bait; and you need

not out too ſoon, but by degrees: And

Shot, eight Inches from the Hook; and

it your ſelf for any other Place: which
is too tedious here to Inſert.</p>
                     <p>Then go down to <hi>Cunnis-Hole,</hi> or elſe
<hi>Maries-Hole;</hi> where pull out your
<hi>Tackle,</hi> and Fiſh there-abouts; Firſt,
Plumming your Ground exactly, that
your <hi>Paſte</hi> may ſwim within half an Inch
of the bottom.</p>
                     <p>The Plummets muſt be made of Lead,
with a Pin in them, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

                           <figDesc>depiction of lead plummets</figDesc>

ſome bigger,
and ſome leſſer, according to the ſize of
your Line: And be ſure that you find
your Ground eeven at the bottom; and
if it be between two little Aſcents, the
Place is the better.</p>
                     <p>Then ſeeing your Float ſwim, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as you would have it, you muſt (in
that very Place) throw in ſome of your
Ground-Bait; and if it be in a Stream,
you muſt knead a little Pibble Stone, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome of your Ground-Bait, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of a Ball, of this ſize;
and that will ſink it to the
bottom, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Water would
cary away: And when
you have thrown in five

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:38442:34"/>
or ſix of theſe Balls, you may Fiſh there.</p>
                     <p>The more you are out of ſight the
better; and you muſt be ſure that you
put not a bigger Bait upon the Point of
your Hook, of your <hi>Red-Paſte,</hi> than
this ſize, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram showing size of bait</figDesc>
                        </figure>; For, if you do, the <hi>Fiſh</hi>
will bob &amp; bob at it, and make you think
you have a Bite, when you have not.</p>
                     <p>Now, you muſt obſerve, That your
Float ſwim juſt over the Place, where
your <hi>Ground-Bait</hi> lies; and then obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(with a diligent and quick Eye)
the firſt Motion of your Float, that then
you ſtrike gently; and, according as
as you find the weight of the Fiſh you
have hold of, to play him: You need not
doubt of Sport enough, following but
theſe Directions.</p>
                     <p>There is an excellent <hi>Stand,</hi> in the
ſecond <hi>Meddow,</hi> on the left-hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>Ferry,</hi> under a <hi>Willow-Tree;</hi>
in the midſt of the <hi>Meddow,</hi> by the
Water-ſide.</p>
                     <p>But in my former Piece (where I did
ſpeak of the <hi>Chub</hi>), I did promiſe that I
would give farther Directions for the
Taking of him; So that, now, I intend
to perform it. And now, when you
have filled your Basket of <hi>Roach,</hi> and
<hi>Dace;</hi> or elſe the Wind is ſo high, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38442:34"/>
you cannot well Angle for them, or
that you find they will not bite; then I
would have you try this way (which
I am going about to teach you) to Take
a <hi>Chub:</hi> And firſt, obſerve, That here
are large ones in <hi>Hackney;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
provide you ſtrong Silk, and
Hair Lines, with your <hi>Swan</hi>'s-Quill-Floats,
as was before directed: And
walk either up or down the River, till
you ſee a Place clear from Weeds, that
you can ſwim your Float half a ſcore
yards without danger of Entangling:
But if you knew the place before, it
would be better; for fear your coming
too near the Water ſhould fright away
the <hi>Chubs,</hi> that may, peradventure, be
there: But this muſt be in ſuch a Place
as I told you before (in my Diſcourſe
of the <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Cheven</hi>); where the <hi>Chub,</hi>
or <hi>Cheven</hi>'s Haunts are.</p>
                     <p>Then muſt you keep as much out of
ſight as you can, that you can but juſt
ſee the Top of your Float ſwim; And
having baited your Hook with a Pellet
of <hi>Paſte</hi> thus big <figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram showing size of pellet</figDesc>
                        </figure>, you muſt firſt
throw in a Ball of your Ground-bait, about
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38442:35"/>
as big as a Walnut without a ſtone in it,
a little broken between your Fingers;
and then follow it with your baited
Hook, and it is very likely you will
have a Fiſh within eight or ten Swims,
or elſe there is none there. But trying
two or three likely Places, you need
not doubt of having a good <hi>Chub,</hi> or
<hi>Cheven.</hi> If you fail in your Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Chub-Fiſhing,</hi> then be upon the
Drable for a <hi>Barbel,</hi> which is in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
You muſt have a ſtrong Line, of
about ſix yards long of Hair and Silk;
which muſt be put (before you faſten
it to your Rod) through a piece of
Lead thus
<figure>
                           <figDesc>diagram showing line and lead</figDesc>
                        </figure>
that it may ſlip to and fro, if any thing
bite at it; and that the Water may
move it upon the Ground, which will
entice the <hi>Barbel</hi> to bite without Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Danger: And being baited with
a good <hi>Lob-Worm,</hi> it is not much to be
queſtioned, but you will Catch a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>

                     <p>NOw, by reaſon that ſome People
in the Country may be ignorant
of the way of Making this <hi>Ground-Bait,</hi>
I thought meet to let ſuch know,
that it is made by cutting a two-penny,
or three penny Loafe (according to the
quantity you would make) into Slices,
and lay them in ſoake into a Platter of
fair Water; which, being ſoaked half
a quarter of an Hour, powr the Water
from it; and with Bran, make the Bread
up into a Stiffe <hi>Paſte;</hi> and then make
that <hi>Paſte</hi> up into two or three large
Balls for your uſe; which you muſt
make uſe of according to my former
Directions. But note, If you Fiſh in
a <hi>Pond</hi> you need not put Stones into
your Bait, but rather Crumble it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis is made by the cutting off, of
the Cruſt of a White-Loafe, that
is two or three dayes old; and
holding it in your hands, being clean
waſhed, about two Minutes in fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
till it be ſoaked; then ſqueeze out
the Water: and (with a little Pains in
working of it in your hands) it will
come to be a very ſtiffe <hi>Paſte,</hi> and hang
mightily upon the Hook without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
off. You may colour it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
red Lead, either more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as you find it moſt agreeable to
the colour of the Water where you
Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>There are many ſorts of <hi>Paſtes;</hi> but
I eſteem this the beſt for any Fiſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting

Honey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I might ſay more, but I think this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
only letting you know, that if
you would be ſet-out like a <hi>Fiſher-man,</hi>
