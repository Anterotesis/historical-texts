            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface, With some praevious Advice to the true-Christian <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A <hi>True Christian doth not intend</hi> to serve his own turn of Christ, (servirsi de Christo, as the Italians say) <hi>but is His true, faithfull, humble, and hearty servant, to his power, &amp; (to make him the more able to be so) He admits of good Helps, and Advice, and till he hath gotten the habit of Devotion, he is not unwilling to, be made</hi> devout by the book <hi>(as we use to speak.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He cannot but think, that service a hard task at the first. For true Christianity, is the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our selves to Christ, and an undertaking to fight under Christ's Banner, against Sin, the World, and the Devil, and so continuing Christ's faithful Soldiers, and servants to our lives end. This we undertook in our Baptism, at our Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Admission into the Church Militant.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>—<hi>Yet, who settles himself seriously and quietly about it? (though upon that depends Etennity.) Who makes the holy Scripture his chief Oracle, and daily Counsellour, in that point? taking-in other Helps (as they offer them selves)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40738:3"/>
               <hi>till our Lord Jesus Christ, by His own glorious Epiphany takes him off, and disposeth of him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his blessed will, and pleasure. But this end of all things is at hand. It's high time, to serve Christ indeed: and in this practice of Christianity, we may well make use of others labours and devotions. But let us withall, be ready to second all their good thoughts and</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum's <hi>by our own fervent prayers, and such like endeavours, for the little time of our short life, and Christian warfare. So shall we end in Rest, and Glory, and Immortality, having lived the life, and died the death of such true Christians. In order to that,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let our sorrow for our sinnes and our combates with our future infirmities keep some Analogy with our former offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let not us misapply our sorrow to any of those troubles that may cause death, but spend all our sorrow upon our sinnes in a true Repentance. And let us not allay or charm any stormes that arise from sin by speculations of the Book of Life, or other mysteries, that exceed our capacity, but by an Oracle within us (the answer, or stipulation of a good conscience, that saies</hi> Amen, <hi>to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performance of God's Will hereafter) which being well done, the trouble of the soul will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as a welcome sacrifice,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let our purged, and sanctified Hearts be the more pltale to obey God hereafter, and more open to receive his holy Graces, and more dilated in giving Praise and Thanks to God for them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let us employ our Anger in chiding our sinnes, and our Fear in keeping Gentinel, that they may creep into our hearts no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Let the notice of Gods threats against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, make us scorn the allurements, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sin hereafter.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Let our Good-Fellowship spend it self most in the entertaining, and cherishing of good thoughts and resolutions, that they may grow up the faster into divine Comforts.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Let us, if we meet with troops of sorrow, not look upon them, but upon Him, that is the Lord of Hostes, and can turn all our sorrowes into joyes, as easily as he turned Water into Wine.</hi>

            <p n="10">10. <hi>Let us, give a serious check (with some authority) to those Idle devices, that are hatched by a luxurious fancy, and spend the animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon mere toyes.</hi>

                     <head>A <hi>short Sermon,</hi> taken chiefly out of the first and last words, in the <hi>book of the Preacher.</hi>

                        </bibl>1. that is, <hi>All things in the world</hi> (whatsoever they may be in our mistaken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) are indeed <hi>extreme vanity, in respect of those things which are above,</hi> which should be the chief object of our desires. If you will hear the Preacher: This is the <hi>summe</hi> of all that is worth the hearing. <hi>c. ult. v.</hi> 13. <q>Fear God and keep<hi>his Commandements:</hi> for that is <hi>the</hi>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40738:7"/>
                           <hi>whole Dutie of man, who being a reasonable Creature, owes that service to his Creator, and to Him alone.</hi>
                        </q> Therefore the Preacher adds, <hi>v.</hi> 14. that <q>
                           <hi>God will bring every thing unto Judgment</hi> (discovering all <hi>our secret thoughts and actions,</hi> good or bad, and passing his last irrevocable sentence upon them all.)</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The best Use that can be made of this truth, may be gathered out of the Preachers own words, directed to every one of us, <hi>c.</hi> 11. 6. <q>
                           <hi>In the morning</hi> sow thy seed, and <hi>in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> withhold not thy hand that is, Lay hold upon all opportunities of doing good every day. Begin, <hi>and persevere to the end:</hi> and do it with all thy might, as <hi>well as thou canst.</hi> c. 9. 10. For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou art going apace:</q>
                     </p>

                     <p>And in all our <hi>Meditations</hi> of Death, and the <hi>last Judgment,</hi> let me comfort my self with this, that He only is to be my <hi>Judge,</hi> that is my blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and hath fully paid the <hi>ransom</hi> for my Sinnes, and desires not the death of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> but the death of <hi>Sin.</hi>

3. Before we leave our Closets, <hi>let us have recourse to some</hi> sett form of Devotion, <hi>wherein we may faithfully and thankfully expresse</hi> God's tender mercies, <hi>and our</hi> bounden duty.</p>
                     <p>Such expressions we may find in the Psalms, and Hymns, and Anthems, or other parts of our publick Service: and such are these.</p>
                     <p>Be merciful to me, O Lord, the God of all mercy and consolation, give me grace <hi>not to pore too much upon the greatnesse of my sins,</hi> but to <hi>fix my thoughts rather upon the greatness of my Saviours love that suffered for them,</hi> and so purchased my lihertie, changing my slavery under sin and Sathan, into the happy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title of the Servant of the most high God, which carrieth perfect freedom along with it.

                        <hi>we have done well,</hi> in the day time, to thank God for it; and what we have <hi>done ill,</hi> to ask pardon, and resolve by the grace of God to do better next day.</p>
                     <p>After our <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> when we draw neer toward <hi>bed-time,</hi> let us remember the <hi>affinitie betwixt Death and Sleep,</hi> &amp; how soon one may be chang'd into the other. That will oblige us to take order, that as the body is to rest, so the <hi>soul also may rest upon her proper pillow,</hi> (the Peace of God that passeth all understanding,) and rely upon the custody of Him, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slumbers, nor sleeps.</p>
                     <p>This being done, doubt not, but (if we <hi>live)</hi> a sweet sleep shall render us chearful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous the next day; and, <hi>if we be carried from the bed to the grave,</hi> (as perhaps we may) thence God will raise us to a better life, and change our vile bodies to the likenesse of his glorious Body; and from our Mother-earth, bring us to our Heavenly Father, whom none can see, and not be everlastingly happy.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>few daies</hi> thus ordered may be an <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to all the rest,</hi> according to this good Beginning.</p>
                     <p>But, what's <hi>all the rest?</hi> Who knows what the rest of our Dayes may prove, whether <hi>few, or none?</hi> 
                        <q>Live well a few dayes, and your life will be at an end, as the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> was wont to say.</q> The <hi>longest life</hi> is but a <hi>few daies: Few and evil,</hi> saith the Patriarch

or what caused the stop and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? that we may be the better provided to avoid it, or remove it another day. And why should we not in the <hi>Morning,</hi> and at <hi>Night</hi> (these two several times at least) <hi>bestow so much pains upon the soul,</hi> to order it, and keep it, as our onely treasure? which whosoever hath lost, hath nothing else to loose or keep.</p>

For when are we so forgetful, as to leave the body one day without meat, and drink, and sleep, and attendance, at <hi>several houres?</hi> Nay with what ceremony, and in what state are those times for the most part strictly observed? Why then should not the Soul <hi>twice a day</hi> look for some little attendance, that is worthy of far more, and better?</p>
                     <p>Twice a day a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> would have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the heavens with some heed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; to put himself in mind, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and invariably the Heavens perform their task; and what is their good order, and purity, and naked simplicity.

                     <p>WE might do well sometimes, to chide our selves into the practice of our Morning devotion, by considering, How much we come short</p>
                     <p>Of those in the first times of the Law, which brought their Offerings unto God every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Especially of King <hi>David,</hi> that prevented the dawning of the Morning, to make his humble addresses to his God <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 147.</p>
                     <p>Of the whole multitude of People in <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie's</hi> time, that were found praying without, at the time of Incense, which was in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Luk</hi> 1. 10.</p>

                     <p>Of the Apostles, in their early entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                     <p>Of those in the Primitive times of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40738:13"/>
Church, who were accused of no worse thing then this, that it was their ordinary custome to meet together at the dawning of the day, to worship Christ with Hymns and Prayers.</p>
                     <p>Of the Papists in our daies, who by their strict observance of their Hours of Prayer, might provoke us to some Devotion in our owne way.</p>
                     <p>I do not muster up these Instances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with any intention to urge a necessity of rising betimes to do it, or of a punctuall tie to a set private Hour. For <hi>Age,</hi> and <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and <hi>studie,</hi> or <hi>labour</hi> over night, and <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>habituall constitutions</hi> of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the like, do qualifie and excuse some in this case more then others. But, I hope, this will perswade us to a more constant morning Devotion, when we see our fit times, and can well do it. And that we may do it then with chearfulnesse and readinesse of heart, (which makes all our Service the better accepted) I will put you in mind of the <hi>Kingly Prophet</hi>'s <hi>delight</hi> in this kind of service, who was able to say, <q>My Soul flieth unto the Lord before the Morning-watch. <bibl>

For he that in a <hi>sense</hi> of his own <hi>miserable estàte,</hi> esteemes himself the most <hi>unworthy</hi> to be suffered to look up to Heaven, or be admitted to any accesse neer the Mercy-seat; he is likely to be the <hi>first</hi> that shall be <hi>looked upon,</hi> and called nearer.</p>

In such <hi>cases,</hi> we must not <hi>expect</hi> to be <hi>heard,</hi> unlesse it be to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our <hi>folly,</hi> and presumption.

                           </gap>, that is, our prayers must be grounded upon some just cause, lest he answer our childish Petitions with [you ask you know not what.] The best way is to confine and conforme our <hi>Prayers,</hi> as well as our <hi>Actions</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> of God: and if we ask any thing agreeable to his will, he will hear us. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>order,</hi> wherein to ask it, we may learn that out of the <hi>method</hi> of our <hi>Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and his own <hi>Precept,</hi>

                        </gap> in that place.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Heaven,</hi> and such <hi>spiritual graces,</hi> as fit us for that, must have the <hi>first place</hi> in our Prayers; and all <hi>other things</hi> must not onely follow in a <hi>second place,</hi> but with <hi>subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40738:25"/>
to the good will and pleasure of God, with <q>
                           <hi>fiat voluntas tua,</hi> thy will be done. For if it be good for us, he will grant it, either in that particular, or in something better: we must submit to his holy will, with <hi>non sicut ego,</hi> not as I will, but as thou wilt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39</q>

                        <q>Ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that <hi>wavers,</hi> is like a <hi>wave of the Sea,</hi> driven with the wind, and tossed up and down. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6.

                     </p>
                     <p>For indeed, to distrust him, is to offer <hi>injury</hi> to his <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> he having promised to hear us, when we ask as we should.

                     <p>
                        <q>God is nigh to all them that call upon him faithfully.</q> 
                        <hi>Ps,</hi> 145. 18.</p>
                     <p>We may have it in our Saviour's own words. <q>What things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. <hi>Marc.</hi> 11. 24.</q>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40738:25"/>
But this <hi>Faith</hi> must be <hi>grounded</hi> upon the <hi>mediation of our Lord,</hi> and Saviour, as himself hath taught us, <q>VVhatsoever you shall ask the Father <hi>in my name,</hi> he will give it you <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23.</q> Therefore in this <hi>confidence</hi> we must remember to <hi>preserve</hi> our <hi>reverence,</hi> and learn another Lesson from our blessed Saviour: that is,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To pray without <hi>Battologies,</hi> and <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies.</hi> 
                        <q>VVhen you pray, use not <hi>vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,</hi> as the heathen do, that think they shall be heard for their much speaking, and babling: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This vice proceeds commonly from ignorance and inadvertency: therefore if you will hear the wise man's advice, <q>Be not <hi>rash</hi> with your <hi>mouth,</hi> and let not your <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>hasty</hi> to utter any thing before <hi>God:</hi> for God is in <hi>heaven,</hi> and thou art upon earth, therefore let thy words be sew, or let thy <hi>Prayers</hi> be <hi>short. Eccles.</hi> 5. 2.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Short,</hi> I say, not alwaies in <hi>time,</hi> for Christ himself prayed all night; nor avoiding <hi>all repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> for therein may lie the best expression of our Hearts, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. and 136.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>short,</hi> that is, cutting off the <hi>vanity</hi> of <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unnecessary</hi> words. Such as we might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to use any where before our betters: which made the Son of <hi>Sirac</hi> joyn them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <q>Use not <hi>many words</hi> in the <hi>company</hi> of your Elders, saith he, and much lesse should you use much <hi>babling</hi> when you <hi>pray,</hi> when
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40738:26"/>
you speak to <hi>God</hi> himself. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 7. 14.</q> For in both cases <q>A <hi>Fool's voice</hi> is known by the multitude of words: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 3.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we should not come to God with the <hi>sacrifice of Fools,</hi> who consider not what they do. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                     <p>VVhen we have taken order for this, to come as we should do, there is yet a fourth Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To <hi>pray with fervency,</hi> and (which will easily follow upon that) with <hi>perseverance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For we must be affected with the <hi>value</hi> of what we ask and seek after.</p>
                     <p>I know not what we do in <hi>other cases,</hi> when we seek any thing that we long for. We are so <hi>intent</hi> upon it, and so inquisitive onely for that, that we hardly observe what <hi>else</hi> comes in our way; or, if we do, we desire nothing more, then quickly to be rid of it.</p>
                     <p>Such should be our <hi>earnest Intention</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Indeavour</hi> for the success of our Prayers.</p>
                     <p>VVe may raise this thought a little higher, if vve will recall how often we have sought and <hi>longed</hi> for our dearest friends, and <hi>other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> on earth of lesser <hi>value.</hi> How the very memory of them hath <hi>tickled</hi> our hearts: our <hi>groanes</hi> alone, our <hi>discourses</hi> in company; our <hi>phantasies</hi> in the day, our <hi>dreams</hi> in the night have run that way.</p>
                     <p>VVhen we recall this, we may be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in seeking after the <hi>best gifts,</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40738:26"/>
comforts by <hi>Prayer,</hi> our thoughts were never <hi>taken up</hi> half so much with eager <hi>persuit,</hi> and <hi>longing</hi> after them.</p>
                     <p>If ours were not, some others were. This is the way, wherein King <hi>David</hi> was excellent, and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the <hi>Syrophaenician,</hi> and other like <hi>importunate Suiters,</hi> that would not be denied. They knew their <hi>earnest desires</hi> were like <hi>wings</hi> to <hi>mount</hi> them up, and procure them admittance to the <hi>throne</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore they never tendred themselves in that <hi>remisnes,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> disliked in King <hi>Jcash,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13. 19. or of which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> accuseth himself (in his <hi>Confessiens)</hi> where he tells us, that this was his fault before his Conversion. He laboured and prayed for a chast heart; but he did it so <hi>faintly,</hi> as if he would be denied: And (he saith himself) he should have been sorry to have been heard too soon.</p>
                     <p>So do we many times. VVe make fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>devotion,</hi> and knock at the gates of Heaven, but we run away, before we can have our Answer. VVhereas we should be both <hi>earnest</hi> in the <hi>suit,</hi> and tarry <hi>Gods leisure</hi> for the grant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>For it is the <hi>fervent prayer</hi> of a righteous man, that availes much with God.</q> 
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Such were holy <hi>David's prayers</hi> wont to be, set forth in the sight of God, as the <hi>incense. Ps:</hi> 14. 2.

                     <p>Now they will more happily and easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe this fervency, and intention of spirit, that are able to follow Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s advise, to <hi>joyne Sobriety,</hi> amd <hi>Watchfulnesse</hi> unto <hi>Prayer.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. For Sobriety makes us fit to watch: and if we bring not a <hi>hearty vigilant prayer,</hi> we may pull a curse upon our selves, rather then a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. We cannot but thinke so, if we consider, that Prayer is one of the <hi>chiefest Services,</hi> that we performe to God: and therefore we must not think, that God will indure to have that done <hi>coldly,</hi> and <hi>lazily,</hi> and <hi>carelesly. Prayer</hi> gives us accesse unto the Throne of God, and leave to speake, and hope to have <hi>Audience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Divine Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Therefore should we study to offer it up, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with those <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>virtues;</hi> and <hi>ushered</hi> in with that <hi>preparation,</hi> that may put us in further hope of <hi>Acceptance,</hi> after we are heard.</p>
                     <p>In that regard, the holy <hi>Saints</hi> of God, in all ages, being to commence some speciall suit unto God, have not been unwilling, many times, to prepare themselves with <hi>Fasting,</hi> and lay hold of <hi>all other good helps,</hi> whereby they might come as well fitted as they may be, for a businesse of so <hi>high consequence,</hi> as that of <hi>Prayer.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darknes had light enough, to discover this truth unto us. For, hence it was, that in their <hi>Natalitia,</hi> they had a custome to make them a <hi>Posie</hi> of Herbes, and those <hi>stinking herbes,</hi> such as grow in their fenny, and foggy places: to show the <hi>Affinity</hi> we have with <hi>Mire</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> the <hi>morish,</hi> and baser parts of the <hi>Earth,</hi> from whence we begin the <hi>top</hi> of our <hi>Pedegree.</hi>

Such is the <hi>Mold</hi> wherein we are <hi>cast,</hi> that come after <hi>Adam.</hi> And so much cause our holy <hi>Mother,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> hath to direct us (in our <hi>Te Deum)</hi> every day to give <hi>humble thankes to our Blessed Saviour,</hi> that for our sakes, <hi>he would not abhorre</hi> even the <hi>Virgin's wombe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Man either wayes considered, in his <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> (from the <hi>Earth,</hi> or from a <hi>Woman)</hi> is a subject too meane, to detaine us any longer. We will rather looke a while upon the <hi>Misery that waits upon him,</hi> which had so <hi>fearfull</hi> a <hi>beginning,</hi> as may presage no rare <hi>sequel</hi> of his <hi>story,</hi> while he is in this <hi>House of Clay,</hi> this foule Prison, and stinking Sepulchre of the body.</p>
                     <p>In the view of this Misery, first we may look upon the <hi>shortnes</hi> of Man's time here.</p>
                     <p>So short it proves to many, that they never come alive into the world. For, the <hi>Mother,</hi> or the <hi>Midwife</hi> is (now and then) a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayer</hi> in the birth. And the question being but of a <hi>weake vessell</hi> (of the mother I meane, as well as of the child) that <hi>which is borne must sometimes be hindred</hi> from being <hi>borne alive:</hi> lest she that promiseth a <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, make way for her owne <hi>funerall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A child, that hath but a <hi>weake thread of life</hi> to <hi>hold</hi> by, when he is delivered of his <hi>Mother.</hi> For that is to him as dangerous an escape, as she hath, in being delivered of him.</p>
                     <p>After this hazard, is he likely to hold out, that is thus born of a <hi>woman?</hi> For, we say,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40738:37"/>
                        <hi>the woman is the surer side.</hi> Then is he marked out for an issue of the weake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> vessell. And so (when he is newly born) he is <hi>presented</hi> to the <hi>world</hi> more <hi>naked, infirm, ignorant,</hi> and <hi>destitute</hi> of <hi>help</hi> then any other creature.</p>
                     <p>He's <hi>born</hi> with a <hi>faculty</hi> of nothing but <hi>wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi> Wherein he showes enough of the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But, for any other ability, there is no <hi>Creature,</hi> but goes <hi>beyond</hi> him in his <hi>birth.</hi> Which I speak not of living, and sensible creatures only. For, the very trees (that have a far inferior degree of life) have better <hi>clothed,</hi> and <hi>armed</hi> their young <hi>issue,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them, against all <hi>injuries,</hi> then any <hi>woman</hi> ever will set out one, that is born of her.</p>
                     <p>It is no <hi>wonder,</hi> if all <hi>children come into the world crying,</hi> that have so much reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their sad condition.</p>
                     <p>And yet (would you think it?) <hi>We can</hi> quickly <hi>forget</hi> our <hi>Principles,</hi> and as soon as we are grown up, be as brisk, and jolly, and proud, and busie in the world, as though we were born like the stoutest of all Creatures, and could not with the <hi>fillip</hi> of an <hi>ague,</hi> and the <hi>blast</hi> of 100 <hi>diseases,</hi> be <hi>turned</hi> again to our <hi>womanish weaknes,</hi> and (which is further) <hi>into the very earth too,</hi> from whence the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest peice of manhood was taken.

                     <p>I will bring you acquainted with them both, in the order wherein they are named, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning first with <hi>Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Peace,</hi> (true <hi>Christian peace)</hi> begins at home, in a peaceable setled mind. St. <hi>Basil</hi> cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a sweet composure, and temper, following upon the subjection of the sense &amp; appetite to reason, &amp; all the faculties of body, and soul to the will &amp; service of God.</p>
                     <p>For it dwells in a heart that is at unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self, and with alll other but Sin, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> A heart that is conscious of no crime, but what is washed off by repentance. And so having lost the trouble and sting of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, is easily reconciled to God, and, for his sake, to all the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40738:48"/>
Such is this Peace, so apt to communicate it self to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To them both. For it hath not the happy reward <hi>(the Vision of God)</hi> by looking toward God onely, but rather by <hi>looking upon men,</hi> and being at peace with them.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> intimates as much, where he puts <hi>pacem inter vos</hi> [have <hi>peace</hi> among your <hi>selves]</hi> before <hi>Deus vobiscum,</hi> [the God of <hi>peace</hi> will be <hi>with you.]</hi> For that implies, that we may cozen and deceive our selves in the apprehension of our peace with God, whom we have not seen, if we stand not in good termes of peace, and love with men, whom we have seen.</p>
                     <p>That is the evidence of the other. And it must be <hi>Peace with all men</hi> too. For if we are at peace with them onely, that are at peace with us, what thanks have we? Do not even Sinners the same? But if we are ambitious of drawing near to the God of Peace, we must be at peace with our <hi>Enemies</hi> too; and love <hi>them,</hi> as He loved, and did good to us, when wee were <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, we must not begin our addresses to him, till we have first made sure for that <hi>Peace.</hi> Whatsoever else we present before his <hi>Altar,</hi> it will never be accepted, unles we first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that love to all others, which is the first thing belonging to our Peace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> hath it in plain words.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40738:49"/>
                        <hi>Cum his qui oderunt pacem</hi> [I was at peace with them that hate peace. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 120. 5, 6.] That's <hi>durus sermo,</hi> you will say. Have we no limitation in this case? yes: we have one in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advise to the <hi>Romans,</hi>

                           <hi>Si fieri potest,</hi> [if it may be,] and <hi>Quantum in vobis est,</hi> [as much as in you lies] <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For you remember the <hi>league</hi> between <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> when they kissed each other, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks. <hi>Ps.</hi> 85. 10. We must not forsake <hi>divine truth,</hi> to <hi>purchase</hi> our <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>men:</hi> we must not hazard our eternal peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, to make sure for peace here below. Nor must we flatter men in their <hi>vices,</hi> and lull them asleep in sin, by that <hi>meanes</hi> to keep them in peace, and love. If their <hi>faults</hi> come in our way, when we have a fair occasion to work upon them, we may not spare them, though we study this precept <hi>of living in peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such and the like <hi>Cautions</hi> we may propose to our selves, in the prosecution of our peace with <hi>men:</hi> and (with that proviso) if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it with our best endeavours, we have done enough for our Peace. For it is enough for us to <hi>follow</hi> it. We cannot alwayes <hi>overtake</hi> it, and have <hi>peace</hi> as we would. To be fully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of peace is for the blessed Saints above. It is enough for us to do <hi>our parts,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the happy success from God, the great <hi>Peace-maker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>follow</hi> it we must, we that are Christians.</p>

For where should the <hi>study</hi> and <hi>care of peace</hi> be expected, but <hi>among us.</hi> And yet we see, we are often at more variance, then all the world beside. The enemy hath sowed his Tares of Schism and Sedition so thick, that they spoile the growth of the Church, and are ready to choke and entangle the best Corn.</p>
                     <p>And all the while, whose <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> fight against the common Enemy of Mankind? what is become of those <hi>pious accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> and <hi>zealous benedictions</hi> antiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon those that studied the peace of the Church? <q>

                        <hi>Ps.</hi> 133. He speaks it but of <hi>peace among Brethren.</hi> VVill you ask me the Question?</p>
                     <p>First how <hi>good</hi> it is? <hi>R.</hi> It is so good, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good without it; and where that is, (by a <hi>rare Alchymy)</hi> it turns <hi>all to good.

                     <p>It is not the <hi>dew of Hermon,</hi> that can like us so well, though it bring the hope of Fruit and profit along with it: Neither the sweet oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the head of man; nor the sweet dew upon the face of the Earth: nothing so pleasing as Peace.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>sweet singer of Israel</hi> never seems to have pleased himself better, then when he got into his Song <q>—<hi>abundantiam pacis: Ps.</hi> 72. 7. </q>That is his <hi>full</hi> Musick: There he is in his sweetest strain, when he sings of <hi>abundance of peace,</hi> so long as the Moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.

                     <p>WE shall need to say no more of the terms, wherein <hi>Holines</hi> is proposed.

This <hi>Holines,</hi> so clearly and fully discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it self (both by eschewing evil, and doing good) may well be set in the <hi>first place</hi> (before <hi>peace)</hi> either as absolutely necessary, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in it self; or as being the best meanes, to conduct us to our <hi>Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, no hope of <hi>Peace</hi> without a <hi>good life.</hi> If we will be <hi>Filii pacis,</hi> and look for the blessing of <hi>Peace</hi> to rest upon us, we must begin with <hi>[eschewing evill, and doing good.]</hi> Our seeking and labouring for the best <hi>peace</hi> will be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consequence wiithout that.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Word of God</hi> is the Gospel of peace upon these termes.</p>

2. Sin is our <hi>Pollution.</hi> And who can be filled with sweet and pretious virtues, till his Body and Soul are become pure, and fit <hi>vessels,</hi> wherein to receive them? Or what <hi>Doves</hi> will come to <hi>filthy cottages?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sin is our <hi>Deviation,</hi> and <hi>departure</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>goodnes.</hi> First we must <hi>recedere â malo,</hi> get out of those blind wayes, before we can be set in a clear way of <hi>doing good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having seen the Order, wherein this charge is to be taken, I will keep you no longer from the <hi>Duty.</hi> VVe must now learn, what it is to <hi>eschew evill,</hi> or rather first, <hi>what it is not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Recedere à malo:)</hi> To <hi>eschew,</hi> or recede <hi>from evil,</hi> is not to go from one sin to another: to passe from <hi>Prodigality</hi> to <hi>Covetousnes:</hi> to shift from <hi>swearing</hi> to <hi>lying;</hi> from <hi>adhorring Idols,</hi> to <hi>rush upon sacriledge. Rom.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                     <p>Thus to cast out one sin by another, is but to cast our <hi>Devils</hi> in the name of <hi>Belzebub.</hi> That is not to <hi>recede from evil,</hi> but to change the name of evil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Much lesse is it to return from any Sin to the same sin again. That is but to go from the <hi>mire</hi> to the <hi>water,</hi> and thence to the <hi>mire,</hi> and so to keep in a <hi>maze,</hi> and <hi>circle of sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VVhat is it then to <hi>recede from evil?</hi> I will tell you it by the several degrees.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we cannot prevent sin, at least not to <hi>stay</hi> by it, not to dwell in it, not to like it, but to use the best meanes to avoid it, and (as soon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40738:61"/>
as we can) to bid <hi>defiance</hi> to it for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To make such a quick recesse, that our sins do not overtake us, to renew their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and <hi>couzen</hi> us far worse then they did before: especially those that <hi>haunt us</hi> at set times and places. As some men's sins do in their <hi>Shops,</hi> and other <hi>places of gain:</hi> some in their <hi>chambers,</hi> or <hi>Feasts,</hi> or at other times of mirth, and <hi>recreation:</hi> some in their <hi>walks,</hi> and <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly retirements.</hi> From these we must have a quick recesse.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Not onely to be <hi>quick</hi> at it, but to make such a <hi>sure recess,</hi> that we <hi>fail</hi> not of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the wayes of wickednes are slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and perplexed, we walk upon <hi>snares,</hi> we are compassed with <hi>Briars,</hi> and <hi>pits.</hi> Our ignorance, or our blind zeal; our rashnes, or carelesnes; may <hi>plunge</hi> us into <hi>perdition,</hi> before we are well advised how to find the way out.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And Lastly. <hi>Receding from evil</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the forsaking of all sin, without exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or <hi>dispensation</hi> for any. For the least sin can let in another, and so let in death. And the breach of the least <hi>Commandement</hi> can make us guilty of the breach of the whole Law.</p>
                     <p>All these together make up our recesle from sin, and shew what need we have to fly often into the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and beg this <hi>grace</hi> of God, that we may <hi>eschew all sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet (in stead of <hi>eschewing)</hi> how many <hi>hug</hi> and <hi>applaud</hi> themselves in it? Some in their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40738:62"/>
sweet <hi>sacriledg,</hi> and Bread stolen from the <hi>Altar.</hi> Some in their <hi>gainful Vsury,</hi> some in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>false</hi> delights. Till those delights prove the very <hi>Theeves,</hi> that steal away their <hi>time</hi> and the <hi>peace</hi> of their Souls.</p>
                     <p>Here were a happier imployment for such men, to study how they may <hi>leave fin</hi> before it leave them, and so make one step toward the purchase of their <hi>best peace,</hi> by eschewing evil.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>eschewing evil</hi> we must now go on to entertain our thoughts with <hi>doing good.</hi> And no more then needs.</p>
                     <p>For to <hi>decline from evil,</hi> and do no harm, will not serve our turn, in it <hi>self.</hi> To decline from evil is a principle of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the task of a young <hi>Beginner,</hi> or a new <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert;</hi> who must thence go on to Fruits worthy of <hi>Repentance,</hi> or else he may fall short of the <hi>reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the best, to go by <hi>weeping-cross</hi> from our sins, is but like <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> washing our <hi>Saviours feet</hi> with her tears. From thence we should go on to the imitation of her pretious ointments; and filling the <hi>Church</hi> with some sweet odour of our Virtues.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>eschewing evill,</hi> is but our coming out of <hi>darknes,</hi> and the shadow of Death. Our <hi>doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> is our walking in the glory and lustre of a good Life, that others seeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40738:62"/>
Lastly, our <hi>eschewing evil,</hi> is but the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising,</hi> and paring off our carnal desires, which profits nothing, <q>unles we keep the law of good works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25.</q> For, (that we may apply the words of the Apostle,) <hi>Circumcisto prodest, si legem observes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which would be observed by them that dream of a <hi>miraculous Faith,</hi> which is meerly a dead thing without good works, and hath no such <hi>Spell,</hi> as to turn <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and fruitles Professors into <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> Nor have we any reason to expect it should, whether we look to the <hi>end of our Creation,</hi> or our <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For the Apostle tels us, that <q>we were created to walk in good works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10.</q> and <q>redeemed to be a people, zealously given to good works. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</q> 
                     </p>
                     <p>And more then once God himself tels us, that it is his <hi>good will,</hi> and pleasure; and not his onely, but our <hi>glory,</hi> and perfection.</p>
                     <p>So that holy <hi>David's</hi> advice both to <hi>eschew evil,</hi> and <hi>do good</hi> may be taken for <hi>Evangelical advice:</hi> at least it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>l prove so, when we come to see that piece of the Gospel fulfilled, of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> rewarding every man according to his works: <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 27. when we come to see, that they which have done <hi>no good,</hi> as well as they that have done <hi>evill,</hi> must go into <hi>Hell fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I should adde another thing of this <hi>doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> for the <hi>extent of it:</hi> That our <hi>goodnes</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:40738:63"/>
should not be <hi>shrunk up into one or two good deeds.</hi> For as? <hi>eschewing evil]</hi> was found to be the receding from all evil: so [doing good] is doing all the good that may be. The <hi>more</hi> the <hi>better.</hi> and the <hi>sooner</hi> the better, that we be not taken off, by Death or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or some other inability, before our work is well done.

                     <p>And <hi>Charity</hi> may well be the <hi>Breastplate,</hi> which is the tie and preservative of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and lies nearest to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>When this piece of Armour is put on. In the next place <hi>our feet are to be shod</hi> with the <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the gospel of Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>have our Feet shod,</hi> is to be fitted, and ready for motion.</p>
                     <p>To have them shod <hi>with a military shooe</hi> (such as in the brazen, and iron age of sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were their brasse shooes, that armed them against the injuries of the wayes, where, in time of warre, the enemy placed as much danger as he could) is, in Christian warfare, to be provided against the hazard, and perill of a Christian course of life. And,</p>
                     <p>To have them shod <hi>with the preparation of Gospel of Peace,</hi> is to be ready to preach, or the practise what belongs to our peace with God,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40738:66"/>
and Man, as the Gospell directs us. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had not been a Gospell (that is, not so good tydings) without Peace.</p>
                     <p>And, I doubt, though it be a Gospel of Peace, yet there are some great Pretenders to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian warfare, that are not so shod in these evill dayes.</p>
                     <p>Let us take care that we be so as the Apostle intends (such as are ready to use the weapons here commended to us, in the defence of this Gospel of Peace, and the propagation of it) &amp; then we make the next piece of Armour, the <hi>Shield</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> helps to shield, and protect every part about us. Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> joyned it with the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> of Charity, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes. And we may joyn it with all the rest. 1 <hi>Thess:</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>Nay, it is of such vertue, that it is not so much a part of our Armour as indeed the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory it selfe, as Saint <hi>John</hi> speakes. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul (Epes.</hi> 6. 16.) might well ascribe unto that, the repelling of all those dangerous lusts, and temptations that are sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by the <hi>Devil,</hi> or any of his wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. It is our certainly believing the threats, and promises of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that hath the power of quenching those fiery darts, and preventing the venome, which otherwise from thence might spread, and diffuse it selfe to the deadly infection of the Soule.</p>

Wherefore, after a <hi>Shield</hi> of this power, and vertue, we may well heare of the <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> that crownes the head, and makes us now compleat in our <hi>Panoplia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A good Souldier will have a speciall care of this part of his Armour, that defends his head. Both because in the head those prime faculties are placed, that guide the whole body: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a wound there is most dangerous.</p>
                     <p>It is here called the <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi> But let us enquire, what that is, slest we be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the sound of the words.)</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> interprets Himselfe, and tels us what it is (in his Epistle to the <hi>Thess:</hi>

                     <p>It will keep us from drooping, or being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Spes non confundit. Rom:</hi> 5. 5.</p>
                     <p>It will make us to hold up our heads without any feare, what danger soever threatens to afflict us.</p>
                     <p>For, what stormes? what blowes will not be indured by him, that hopes for no lesse then Salvation, and a crowne immortall?</p>
                     <p>And who would not strive to purchase the <hi>Helmet</hi> of that Hope? Which being added to what we heard before, makes up the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it, <hi>Ephes:</hi> 6. 18.

                     <p>He that talkes of the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and Charity, Let him be sure of it <hi>(in corde)</hi> in that part which is covered with the breast-plate: and not boast of the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Opinion, that he hath put into other men: That Opinion of theirs perhaps may hold out, when his Righteousnesse may prove like the Morning dew, that soon passeth away.</p>

                        <hi>for out of that are the issues of Life:</hi> Prov. 4. 23. that is, It is not onely the <hi>Fountain</hi> of our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life,</hi> but thence also are the <hi>Springs</hi> of our <hi>Health</hi> and Solace <hi>here,</hi> and of our Joy and happines <hi>hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well might this <hi>Caveat</hi> come out of a <hi>Kings</hi> heart, and out of <hi>Solomon's,</hi> the wisest of Kings.

                        <hi>[Keep thy Heart]</hi> is the first voice of <hi>Nature,</hi> the main <hi>principle</hi> that she leaves imprinted in the <hi>Creature.</hi> Nor is this enough: but (for the farther safety, and easier custody of the heart) that provident hand of God, that we call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> set it in the securest place, and <hi>walled</hi> it about with <hi>strong Ribs,</hi> and those Ribs (as the <hi>Anatomists</hi> observe) somewhat in the <hi>sorme of Swords,</hi> for a natural defence of this little <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>And as it is in <hi>Nature,</hi> so it is in <hi>Grace.</hi> Grace <hi>begins</hi> with the heart: and having so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, her greatest strength, and Spiritual mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is spent in the ordering of that.</p>
                     <p>In regard of that beginning, <q>
                           <hi>My Son give me thy heart,</hi>

                     <p>So it is in <hi>Nature:</hi> So it is in <hi>Grace:</hi> and so it is in regard of that <hi>common enemy</hi> of Nature, and Grace too. He aims at the <hi>root</hi> of the Tree; he strikes at the <hi>heart:</hi> and if he get any hold there, he keeps that above all keeping, whatsoever he doth for the leaves of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and branches of our outward carriage, and behaviour.</p>

So that every way; In <hi>nature,</hi> in <hi>grace,</hi> in the opposition of both, there is no lesson of such use, and consequence as this, <hi>[Keep thy heart above all keeping.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which words (according to the constant language of the <hi>Holy Scripture)</hi> by the <hi>Heart</hi> we must understand <hi>the Thoughts of the Heart,</hi> or the <hi>whole Soul of man.</hi> For nothing indeed is so perfect an <hi>embleme</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> as the <hi>heart</hi> is.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

Again, the <hi>Heart</hi> is such a <hi>Triangle,</hi> as the <hi>round world</hi> is not able to fill: and the Soul hath an obscure image of more then a Triangle, (of the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> it self.)

But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is yet a greater resemblance in the <hi>very Life of the Heart.</hi> For the Heart lives by a continued breath, <hi>(per <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore (in that regard also) it follows well in <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Keep thy heart above all kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, for out of that are the issues of life.</hi>

                     <p>We understand what is here meant by the <hi>Heart,</hi> and how the Soul is figured in that. Thence we may easily gather, what it is to <hi>keep the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>keep the heart</hi> is the Office of the <hi>Soul,</hi> being watchful and observant over all her <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>affections:</hi> and to <hi>keep the heart above all keeping,</hi> is the Emphasis of Care, and Diligence: In the same phrase which you have <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>with all thy getting get understanding,</hi> that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that, care not for getting of any thing else.

                     <head>XXX. Of the particular consequences (implied in the former Advice, and the delivery of it,) and first of the Possibility of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the heart.</head>
                     <p>IN the Former <hi>Advice,</hi> (and the pathetical delivery of it,) two things are plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. He that saith, <hi>[Keep the heart above all keeping,]</hi> implies that <hi>it must be kept,</hi> there is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40738:70"/>
a necessity of keeping of it.</p>
                     <p>First, we will see the <hi>possibility</hi> of keeping the heart. And that we cannot see more clearly, then in the removal of those <hi>lets,</hi> and <hi>impediments,</hi> that we commonly <hi>pretend,</hi> against the <hi>keeping of the heart,</hi> or at least, we magnify a great deal more then we need, to excuse our selves. Whereas it were better wisdom to <hi>baulk</hi> such Scruples, and rather <hi>keep</hi> our hearts to some absolute Rule, that may raise our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to the highest pitch. Of those <hi>lets,</hi> and so much magnified Pretences, there are especially Four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> to hinder the <hi>meanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, <hi>our own natural weaknes</hi> to apply the means.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third, our <hi>unruly passions</hi> to interrupt them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And then, forsooth, if all this were not, that yet <hi>we can do nothing without a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power,</hi> and therefore we may sit still. These Four,</p>

                     <p>First, we may be mistaken in it. For I doubt not, but that is often <hi>father'd upon the Devil,</hi> that rather issues from <hi>our selves:</hi> according to that of St. <hi>James,</hi>

                     <p>First, they may some of them be <hi>prevented.</hi> For indeed, they are more of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, then we are often aware of. If we did not give the Devil encouragement, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover our weaknes, and put an occasion into his mouth, we should not have him so often, and so buisy about us.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Chrys:</hi> saith, <hi>He is like a dog that sawns</hi> upon us, when we sit at Table. If we throw him some meat, and bestow our favours upon him, we are sure to have more of his company: but if we chide or neglect him, (whensoever he comes) after a while he will not loose his labour so much, as to try a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion upon us. So it is with the Devil, <hi>Resist him, and he will fly from you. Jam.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                     <p>And if he do not fly, if he will try his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, there are <hi>many wayes</hi> also to frustrate his practice, and return it upon his own head.

For whatsoever comes from him, if it vanish without any consent of ours, it shall not be imputed to us, it shall be set upon his score.</p>

                     <p>So that if we scan the case, as it should be, (for the <hi>keeping of the heart,)</hi> we have no such Impediment, in so high a degree, either from the <hi>Devil,</hi> or from our <hi>own concupiscence,</hi> as the ordinary complaints of the world do seem to infer.</p>

                     <p>This is a <hi>sore malady.</hi> We injure our selves no way so much as this.

                     <p>

But, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by entreating we may move God to help us. And so it is our fault only, if we be not helped, though it be his <hi>grace</hi> only, if we be.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, if thou lovest thy self, Do not forsake thy <hi>Heart,</hi> because we can do nothing without <hi>God's grace,</hi> and <hi>assistance:</hi> but watch over it the rather.

                     <p>For, <hi>Wisdom is easily seen of them, that love Her, and found of them, that seek Her. The unfained desire of reformation is Her beginning, and the care of Discipline is love: and love is the keeping of Her lawes, and the giving heed to Her lawes is the assurance of immortality. Wisd.</hi> 6. 12, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>Every way, to ask, to seek, to endeavour, is expected from us. Otherwise, if we are not kept, if we are quite lost, we may thank our selves for it.</p>
                     <p>To that purpose, when God tells <hi>Joshuah, that no man should be able to stand before him:</hi> doth He not adde withall, only <hi>be thou strong, and of a good courage? Josh.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>Yes, he doth so. And we have it four times over, in one Chapter, that we may be sure to take notice of it.</p>
                     <p>And the Royal Prophet hath an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on parallel unto it. <hi>Be you strong, and God shall establish your hearts.</hi> Which I may thus para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase in the language of the wise man, <hi>Keep thou thy heart, and God will keep it.</hi>

art not wanting to good thoughts, and other good helps, they shall never be wanting to thy Heart. For whensoever they faile, it is only because thou art not vigilant, and intent to purchase them, to cherish them to encrease them.</p>
                     <p>For, when the light, by which our hearts are enlightned, is hid, and lost, that we cannot perceive it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (saith St <hi>Basil)</hi> that is, it is not because the light is spent (for that can never be exhaust) but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have done somewhat, that makes us not so well disposed to apprehend the light, as we were before. Or because we are drousie, and dull, and make no use of it.</p>
                     <p>If we are not careles of our selves, we have the benefit of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Prayer, <hi>Father keep them in thy name.</hi> And of God's own promise. <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> But then, we must not leave, nor forsake our selves.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if any man think, by magnifying the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to pull down the possibility of doing that which God Himself calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us so earnestly to do, he takes a wrong course.</p>
                     <p>For, his very calling so earnestly upon us, might breed a security of what is expected from Him: and that, if we be not wanting to our selves, He will not be wanting for those good <hi>Motions,</hi> and that <hi>gratious Assistance,</hi>

that conduceth to the performance of those good actions, which he so desires.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. First, The Actions of the body require some degrees, and continuance, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Time, and Place: but the <hi>thoughts of the mind</hi> conceive sin in an <hi>instant,</hi> without stirring out of their own nest.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, The Actions of the body require some labour, and it may be, some fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer too, for the effecting of them: but the <hi>Heart</hi> alone, without help, without labour, without company, can entertain, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any operation of Hers.</p>

By which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine carelesnes, they do not only remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome, as they were before, but even that good water, that was poured in, is corrupted, and turned to no use.</p>
                     <p>O that they would hear the wise mans counsel <hi>[de custod â cordis]</hi> at least, to cherish their good thoughts, while they have them. For, it is a shame, that true knowledge, and gratious admonition should passe through the Heart so often in vain, as good milke passeth through a strainer, that leaves nothing but drosse behind. It is a shame, that they should forsake the Fountaine of life, when it is so
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40738:76"/>
near them; and take so much pains to dig those <hi>wells</hi> that will hold nothing: while with more ease they might have Wells of <hi>living water,</hi> and a <hi>good heart, out of which are the issues of Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to prevent this in us, if you please, we will now cast about, what might be the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest means, and helps, by which the heart may, and should be thus kept, as it is here intended.</p>
                     <p>Without them we should leave all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Therefore I will give you a short view of them all, as near as I can.</p>

O Lord, thou knowest me as well, as if thou hadst made great search and inquiry after me: thou knowst how I dispose of my self in my times of rest, and retirednes: and (after that) how I fit my self for employment. Thou discernest my most intimate and familiar thoughts and intentions, long before they are actually mine.</p>

                     <p>This the very thought of <hi>Divine Presence</hi> would do. But if we could joyn the comfort of his <hi>Divine presence</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> together, that would be <hi>prae omni custodiâ,</hi> no custody like it.</p>

                     <p>For, if we, when we are possessed with the serious consideration of any worldly thing, are by that so excluded from intention (for that time) upon other matters, that neither the Eye, nor the Ear can discharge their natural functions, upon an object directly before them.

                     <p>WE have seen the virtue of the Prime, and Superior Means. Under which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>subordinate Means</hi> there are. Whereof some are <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and <hi>Preparatory</hi> to the keeping of the Heart, as <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> that make it fit to be kept, and worthy of keeping. Other are <hi>Actual Preservatives.</hi> Of which <hi>suo loco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, We must begin with <hi>Purity.</hi> And it is the <hi>natural beginning</hi> in all courses.</p>
                     <p>What Physitian doth not begin with <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> before he come to his Cordials, and Rules of health?</p>
                     <p>Who puts <hi>sweet odors</hi> into an impure vessel? And how can the Heart be filled with those graces that preserve it, untill it be a pure Heart? then it may.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Junius,</hi> and some others expound <hi>Solomons</hi> words particularly of that. <hi>Keep the Heart,</hi> that is (say they) <hi>purge it, and keep it, like a fountain from all filth.</hi> For, as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> hath taught us. <hi>Not that which comes into the mouth defiles a man: but that which comes out of the Heart. Evil thoughts, murders, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries,</hi> and the like, these come forth of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40738:79"/>
the Heart, and these defile a man.</p>
                     <p>And, if you heare St <hi>Basil,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>—As smoak drives a way bees; as filthy vapours, and smells drive away pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: so doth the corruption of the Heart drive away the Angels, that pitch their tents about us for our defence. If we would keep those blessed Guardians, or any thing else worth the keeping, we must keep Purity in the first place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unto <hi>Purity</hi> we must adde <hi>Constancy,</hi> and <hi>Aequability</hi> of <hi>disposition</hi> (the second care that we propounded, by way of Preparation) that is. <hi>Our thoughts must not be at random,</hi> and <hi>extravagant.</hi> For, it is not Purity alone, which makes that true representation, that must be there.</p>
                     <p>In other cases, you see, <hi>Snow</hi> is a pure white, and yet cannot do it. <hi>Milk</hi> is a pure white, and cannot do it. <hi>Water,</hi> that inclines to a black colour, yet (if it be not hindred by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>propter levorem</hi> it represents any thing better.</p>
                     <p>So is it in the Soul. Confusion, and Inaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is our greatest Impediment, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>A setled, and well ordered mind, a serious reducing of our thoughts to one center, makes way to the keeping of the heart in the right state. Or, at least, adde it to that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we named before, And both together
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40738:80"/>
will make the heart fit to be kept, and worthy of keeping.</p>
                     <p>After we have taken order for them, then we come in the next place, to the particular Means, and Preservatives, by which the heart is actually kept.</p>

                        <hi>XXXIV.</hi> The particular subordinate Means of keeping the Heart.</head>
                     <p>THese may be ranked, in this order.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Fortifying,</hi> and <hi>Defending of the Senses,</hi> the outward passages unto the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The careful guard, and government of the Affections, her Domestical Servants.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Opposition, and <hi>Repulse of worldly thoughts,</hi> the common enemies, that assaile it without.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And lastly, The continual <hi>supply of good Thoughts,</hi> and Meditations, to imploy, and strengthen those Domestical servants, as we called them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first of these is so necessary, that the wiseman had no sooner delivered this caution for a careful watch, and custody of the soul but he presently addes, (for the care of the Senses, and those other parts. that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by them.) <hi>Put away from thee a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard mouth. Let thine eyes look right on</hi> (let no

fair appearance turn them awry) <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet. Bow thine ear to understanding. &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 4 24, 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>There's somewhat, it seems, in the care of the Tongue, and the Feet, that makes to the safe custody of the Heart. But the <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Ear,</hi> and the rest of the Senses, above all other must be looked to.</p>
                     <p>They are the <hi>Windowes,</hi> and the <hi>back-doors,</hi> wherein as the Enemy may creep through to offend the Soul: so her own Servants also from thence may creep out to betray Her.</p>
                     <p>In both these regards (for the dangers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and for the revolts within) we must look well to the Senses; if seriously we intend the custody of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>God hath not mounted the <hi>senses</hi> into the <hi>highest seat</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> there (like false spies) to see, and betray. But, like a careful watch, to <hi>foresee,</hi> and <hi>prevent</hi> the imminent dangers. Either by shutting their doors to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that openly assault; or by keeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof off from those that can poison where they do but touch.</p>
                     <p>That, in all the Faculties of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we may be calm, and quiet.</p>
                     <p>Not tossed about with every breath, that beats at the Ears.</p>
                     <p>Not disquieted with every fancy, that is taken in at the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Not shaked, and affected with every touch</p>
                     <p>

But having all the Senses, as the Organs, and servants of the mind, at the due command.</p>
                     <p>This is our first Help, for the securing of the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second is the guard and government of the <hi>Affections,</hi> her domesticall servants.</p>
                     <p>For commonly the Affections are the <hi>Rebels of our Nature.</hi>

                     <p>So that this is a duty, as necessary as any of the other. For in vaine doth the Soule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her attendants abroad, if she looke not as well to all at home. There is all the mis-rule, if we take not some exact order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Now to fight against these Rebels, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against these so potent, and home-bred Syrens, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est.</hi> To <hi>tame</hi> the <hi>wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of those Affections that must be bridled. To <hi>take off the dulness</hi> of others, that must have the spurre. To <hi>appease Anger,</hi> and lust. To <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose pride,</hi> and <hi>covetousness.</hi> To carry a <hi>strict</hi> hand over other wayes of provocation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is a kind of Martyrdome constantly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure such combats, and not to yeild. Happy is he that can do it best.</p>

And who would not strive for that crowne? where He that doth not resist, but playes with his Affections, and Passions, dallies with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a dangerous fire in his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
                     <p>To secure the heart, in this case, we must <hi>flie idleness,</hi> and too long and <hi>careless intention upon dangerous objects</hi> at a dangerous time. And, above all, we must strive for a due serenitie, and <hi>calmeness</hi> of <hi>Spirit:</hi> and remember that Lesson, which our blessed Saviour commended to our practise. <hi>Discite à me, quia mitis sum</hi> 
                        <q>Learne of me: for I am meeke, and lowly in heart. <hi>Mat:</hi> 11. 29.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this we must be willing to do, that we may, by degrees, exclude the obstreperous, and tumultuary accesle of their importunate, and impudent solicitations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we have gone thus farre, for the safety of the heart: then we must come to the opposition, and <hi>repulse of worldly thoughts,</hi> the Enemies, that hinder, and assault the heart without, and would withdraw it from God.</p>
                     <p>This must be added to the former, at fit times. For, we cannot give advantage to the world, but we must take as much from the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>As it is in the ballance (if the one part goes up, the other goes downe) so it is in the heart commonly.</p>
                     <p>If worldly thoughts fall to the ground, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40738:82"/>
will ascend into the place of them: But when we mount them into the highest place, down go the other.</p>
                     <p>I say, this must be added, at <hi>fit times.</hi> For otherwise <hi>wordly thoughts,</hi> and <hi>businesses,</hi> and <hi>recreations</hi> too, have their time, when they are necessarie, and must not be omitted.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we alwayes alike disposed for heavenly employment.</p>
                     <p>Nor will the object it selfe indeed be gazed upon long by us.</p>
                     <p>And in this Advise, where the wise man saith <hi>[prae omni custodià]</hi> keep thy heart <hi>above all keeping. [Prae omni]</hi> is so farre from exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other thoughts, and employments, that it rather implies many more, but it puts the Superlative, upon this above them all.</p>
                     <p>The heart <hi>may have her times</hi> of other seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainments, or lawfull Recreation. But she <hi>must have her time</hi> of Privacie, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirednesse from them all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Both because <hi>the devout heart</hi> is the <hi>spouse of Christ,</hi> and (as St <hi>Bernard</hi> speakes Christ doth not love, to come to his spouse in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a multitude.</p>
                     <p>At least, he will not knock every day at that heart, where there is so much other businesse, that there is no leasure to let him in.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then againe, because <hi>whensoever the Soul would mount her selfe</hi> to heavenly specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if she be surprised with worldly affaires,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40738:82"/>
she is like a bird, that hath her feathers limed, <hi>Intangled in them, she is not able</hi> to use so much as her naturall strength, to elevate her selfe.</p>
                     <p>In both these regards, there are seasons, wherein she must be retired to God, and Her selfe.</p>
                     <p>And this is the third of those meanes, and preservatives, that may be used for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After all these. We have no other care, unlesse it be this. How there may be a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall supply</hi> of good thoughts, and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to busie, and strengthen the heart upon all occasions.</p>
                     <p>And such a supply there may be, in the daily perusall of <hi>two great Bookes,</hi> upon which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but Commentaries) the <hi>Booke of the Scriptures,</hi> and the Booke of the <hi>Creatures.</hi>

                     <p>VVE have seene, that the Heart <hi>may</hi> and <hi>should</hi> be kept, above all keeping. We have seen <hi>what Meanes,</hi> and Helps there are for the keeping of it.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore so <hi>keep it, as our onely treasure,</hi> which whosoever hath lost hath nothing else to lose or keepe.</p>
                     <p>We are carefull enough, that <hi>the Bodie and Apparrell,</hi> and every thing else about us, be <hi>neat and cleanly kept,</hi> and repaired. When are we so forgetfull, as to leave the body one day without meat, and drinke, and sleepe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance? Let us do as much for the Heart, and Soule, which is worthy of farre more.</p>
                     <p>Let her be <hi>Lodged</hi> in a roome worthy of Her, Let Her be <hi>Fed</hi> with her own proper food. Let her be <hi>reposed</hi> upon her owne pillow, that passeth all understanding.</p>
                     <p>To keep it thus, is to follow the counsell of the wise man, and to prove wiser then He was. But to imploy so pretious an Instrument to any base use, is the Act of a man, that hath lost his wits.</p>
                     <p>I will say more. It is no better then <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that a Soule, which hath been offered to God, as a reasonable sacrifice, should (after
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40738:84"/>
that) be made an organ of sensualitie, and a Cage for Devils.</p>
                     <p>No better, did I say? Nay it is farre worse. For it is not onely the withholding of a Vessel consecrated to the service of God, but it is <hi>an Attempt upon the Image of God</hi> Himselfe. The Heart here being the Soul, and the Soule a Character of the Divinity. And therefore not to be prostituted to publick infections, but kept pure, and safe, above all keeping. Our <hi>answer to all Attempts against it,</hi> being that which was our first answer in Baptisme <hi>[Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renuncio] I for sake them all.</hi> We undertooke that once, and failed of it. Let us now resolve, and do it.</p>
                     <p>And, that we may be inabled to doe it. Let it be our humble prayer, that God would <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a new Heart within us,</hi> and then <hi>give us strength to keep it, as we ought.</hi> And (to the same end) | that He would give us grace to lay sure hold upon the Prime, and Superiour Meanes, and keepe close unto Him, the living God, out of whom indeed are the issues of Life.</p>

and <hi>outward reverence,</hi> that is fitting for us. The Holy, and Princely Prophet carried this thought along with him, when he went to Gods House, and how doth he expresse it? <hi>We will go into thy Tabernacle, and fall low, on our knees before thy Foot-stool,</hi> (that is, <hi>before the Ark.

                     <p>AFter our Reverence and Devotion hath made a good entrance; that the rest of our Employment in God's house may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to that good beginning, it will not be amiss to say somewhat before hand of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, and Sermons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of these, the first thing I would say, is that the Church is the <hi>proper place</hi> for them, not any secret Conventicles.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> commonly made that <hi>choice</hi> for his Preaching, where it might be had. <q>He taught daily in their Synagogues.</q> 
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> did the like. They went into the <hi>Temple</hi> at the <hi>hour of Prayer. Act.</hi> 3. 1. And for their <hi>Preaching</hi> there, they had <hi>direction</hi> to do so from no lesse then an <hi>Angel,</hi> who spake it in these words: <hi>Go, stand, and speak in the Temple to the People. Act.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another thing to be said of <hi>publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> is this: that being publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they should appear to be so by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory:</hi> that is, <hi>Prayer</hi> should ascend to Heaven not from the <hi>Priest</hi> alone, as if it were onely his, but from all the <hi>People</hi> too: their <hi>hearts</hi> going along with him, and their <hi>tongues</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it to be theirs also, by joyning with him in the <hi>Responsals,</hi> and their <hi>Amen,</hi> which is the <hi>seal</hi> that confirms it to them. They to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40738:91"/>
be parties, and partakers in the benefit of that Prayer.</p>
                     <p>And so for the <hi>Sermon:</hi> the Preacher should not preach to himself onely, (though his heart should <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>most</hi> be affected with it, yet) if it be the word of God that is delivered by him, as Gods Embassador at that time, then the Hearers should <hi>lay it up,</hi> and give it their <hi>Amen,</hi> by their <hi>Practice,</hi> which seals up the benefit unto them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third thing we should desire, that we may have <hi>all the service,</hi> without mangling, or maiming; have it as <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> prescribes, not leaving out Prayers, or Lessons, for the Sermon's sake, but upon special occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>For whatsoever the <hi>Sermon</hi> may prove, we are sure the <hi>Lessons</hi> are the <hi>word of God,</hi> and God speaks to us by them: which we cannot say of our Sermons, unlesse they may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to that Touchstone of the written word of God, and thence receive their Warrant.</p>
                     <p>And be the Sermon what it should be, yet they are much mistaken, who think they have done their <hi>Service,</hi> if they come soon enough to hear the <hi>Sermon:</hi> For the <hi>Sermon</hi> is the work of <hi>another,</hi> and tendred in God's behalf to us; but our <hi>service to God,</hi> (though it be in both in our hearing and praying, yet is it) rather in our <hi>prayers,</hi> and other the like publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church. For which especially
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40738:92"/>
Churches were erected, and from which they were called <hi>Oratoria</hi> in the Primitive times; and before that, in both Testaments, <hi>Domus Orationis,</hi> Houses of Prayer, where we meet him, and make our solemn Addresses unto him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our next desire would be, that we may have our <hi>Prayers</hi> in that Form, wherein the Church tenders them, without <hi>Battologies,</hi> and <hi>extemporary flashes.</hi> For that which is enjoyned by the <hi>Church</hi> is most <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>warrantable,</hi> and wherein the whole Church joyns with us, in the <hi>same petition,</hi> and the <hi>same terms,</hi> beside many other advantages which they have.</p>
                     <p>And the very proposing of them in a <hi>sett Form,</hi> is that which the Church learned from God himself.</p>
                     <p>In times of great affliction, wherein there was need of <hi>hearty prayer,</hi> it was God's <hi>own direction</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Hosea: Take unto you words, and return unto the Lord, and say, Take away all iniquity &amp;c. Hos.</hi> 14. 2.</p>

                     <p>And it seems the Christians had it in the first times of the Church. For, St <hi>Jerome</hi> saith, they were wont so to thunder out their <hi>Amen,</hi> and sing their <hi>Psalmes,</hi> that the noise ecchoed with it.

                     <p n="1">1. But let us a little bethink our selves, whether it be not a <hi>Solecisme, to sing and not to be chearful.</hi>

                     <p>I said, He is best served with those. I will say more. He cannot well be served by any, but such as are (in effect) aequivalent to them.</p>
                     <p>Take the best <hi>Praise</hi> that ever was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holiest Saints, and it is but <hi>ex ore infantum, &amp; lactentium,</hi> as weak an expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if it came <hi>out of the mouth of the babes,</hi> and sucklings.</p>

                     <p>THese are the rather to be observed, that our Devotions may be accompanied with the prayers of others in our behalf. In which regard, I think, we should do well, when our <hi>necessary occasions</hi> detain us from the publick places of <hi>Prayer,</hi> yet (as neer as we can) in the set times of publick prayer, to commence our sutes unto God.</p>
                     <p>Of the great <hi>Elijah</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 36. (whose Prayers were so powerfull when he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Baal's</hi> Prophets by fire, though he was then far from the Temple, yet we have this observation of the time. <hi>It came to passe at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the Prophet came neer, and said, The Lord God of Abraham &amp;c. And then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice.</hi> v. 38.</p>

                        <hi>Ezra</hi> picked out that time, when he lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the affinity with strangers: 1 <hi>Esdr.</hi> 9. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>At the evening sacrifice (saith he) I arose from my heavines, and fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The book of <hi>Judith</hi> hath the same note upon her humbling her self by prayer. <q>It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time that the incense of that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was offered in Jerusalem. <hi>Jud.</hi> 9 1.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is worth your observation, how God hath met with them, that interrupted that time. And (when he would do a favour) how he hath often made choice of one of the hours of publick Service.</p>
                     <p>The first of these we find in <hi>Samuel.</hi> 1 Sam. 7. 8, 10. <q>As he was offering up the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, the Philistins drew neer to battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Israel:</hi> but the Philistins might easily perceive, that they had better chosen another time. And it was not long before the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had a sign, that God looked gratiously upon their Sacrifice: for he thundred with a great thunder that day upon the Philistins, and they were smitten before <hi>Israel.</hi>

                     <p>We lost all by <hi>eating</hi> the forbidden fruit: let us salve all by <hi>abstaining</hi> from that which is not forbidden.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>[to abstain from all]</hi> may be taken in a large extent. To abstain from whatsoever may <hi>hinder us</hi> from being <hi>admitted in stadium:</hi> hinder us from <hi>running</hi> when we are there: from <hi>continuing</hi> to the end, when we do run: or <hi>Abstaining</hi> from too much <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>wantonnes,</hi> that may infeeble the body and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sot the mind.

                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40738:105"/>
And if too much <hi>wealth,</hi> or other like por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage clogge us in the way, from that too, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what must be emptied by our Almes (or some other good deeds) that our pace may be the quicker.</p>
                     <p>All this may be couched in [abstaining from all things.] But most of the Fathers (St <hi>Aug:</hi> especially) confine it to <hi>Abstinence</hi> in Diet, in the aforecited place of St <hi>Paul.</hi> And so it fits the Similitude there. For, they that run in a race, abstain from meats (from using them in any excesse) because it would make them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and short winded.</p>
                     <p>And that this <hi>Abstinence</hi> is a Meanes to all intended by the Apostle, I shall endeavour to show, by a double help, and benefit, that</p>
                     <p>Abstinence brings to us, seen in the<list>
                           <item>Body,</item>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Body, the necessary instrument of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Soul, that hath no other way to use, and master the Body.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first, and main <hi>Help</hi> that by Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, accrues to the <hi>Body</hi> is, that it makes it <hi>serviceable</hi> by being the <hi>best Physitian</hi> to cure, or prevent most diseases, which otherwise would annoy it.</p>
                     <p>In which I would be understood <hi>sano sensu.</hi> For I speak not of those diseases that are layd upon us for trial: nor of those which proceed from known, or unknown accidental causes.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40738:106"/>
This being premised, I may say, that Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is a <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> or, at least, a cure for most Diseases.</p>
                     <p>This agrees with Reason. For, our life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the harmony, and proportion of the Humours, and Elements, a regulate course preserves it: a disorderly course destroyes it.</p>
                     <p>And it is confirmed by the Testimony, and Practise of most Physitians, who, as they tell us, that crudity is the mother of most diseases, and more receive their death's-wound at the Table, then in the Field. So in their Practise they cure most by Evacuation.</p>
                     <p>Thereby agreeing, that most <hi>diseases proceed</hi> from <hi>fulnes.</hi> Which produceth <hi>fuliginous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, abundance of blood, putrefaction of crude humours,</hi> or whatsoever we may call the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper from that meat and drink, which was not made to dull and oppresse, but to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and refresh the spirits, And from which if there happen any malady, it cannot better be <hi>castigated,</hi> or <hi>prevented</hi> by any thing then by <hi>Abstinence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Abstinence <hi>cures within,</hi> where the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady is. It cures <hi>without precipitation,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the humours, and without the <hi>losse</hi> of <hi>precious time.</hi> Both which Physick, and exercise are commonly guilty of.</p>
                     <p>And I doubt not but Abstinence would quickly cure many, that are weak, and sick, by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40738:106"/>
reason of too various, and too much nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who deceive themselves, and go a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way from the cure: seeking <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors,</hi> and <hi>succulent meats,</hi> in a conceit of weaknes, and fear of cold diseases. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that too much juycie meats <hi>oppresse nature,</hi> and hot wines <hi>fill</hi> the <hi>head</hi> with <hi>foggie vapours,</hi> whioh being turned into ill matter, and condensed, become the original of some distempers, which were never feared.</p>
                     <p>These refreshments are not for such as live <hi>at ease,</hi> but rather for such as often spend their spirits in <hi>labour,</hi> or <hi>hard study.</hi> For others, moderate Abstinence is far better; better for their <hi>health,</hi> and better for the <hi>prolonging of their daies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which appears in this, that the most austere and <hi>abstemious</hi> sort of men, in all ages, (though they lived at ease, and used little exercise) have been the most <hi>healthfull,</hi> and the longest livers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I must tell you one thing more. To a healthful and long life, Abstinence adds a <hi>light body,</hi> agile, and <hi>fit</hi> for any <hi>emploiment.</hi> For where the Diet is moderate, proportioned to the body, the temper, the season; there the <hi>concoction</hi> (the work of the Stomach) must needs be good, and so the <hi>blood</hi> also good, and the <hi>humors</hi> pure, untainted, and fit for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: fit for God's service, especially fit for <hi>[currere]</hi> for those services that require a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40738:107"/>
quick dispatch: that is, for the best and noblest actions, that cannot well be atchieved by a troublesome body. With which I will close up those things which Abstinence brings to the body.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Abstinence</hi> stretcheth her virtue farther still, being beneficial to the whole Man.</p>
                     <p>And first she derives safety and vigor to the <hi>Senses.</hi> For instance, where there is no crude deflux into the nerve and organ of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and <hi>seeing,</hi> there the Sight and Hearing must ordinarily be more lasting, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, and exact, unlesse it be extinct, and decayed by Age, or Study, or some Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor doth she stay at the Senses. The <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> themselves participate of that good that proceeds from Abstinence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anger, Lust,</hi> and <hi>Melancholly,</hi> must needs be abated, when their ordinary fewel, that keeps in the fire, is taken away. <hi>Griefe, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Heavines</hi> must needs be corrected, when those Humors, that feed them, are drawn dry.</p>
                     <p>Thus doth Abstinence charme the raging spirits; make a man affable, chearful, tractable, and reduce all to the right state. In case of <hi>lust</hi> especially, that kind of Devil is seldom cast out but by Prayer, and Fasting too.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Benefit of Abstinence goes yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, extends it self to the <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> For whereas Intemperance sends
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40738:107"/>
up a cold obstructive humour, that possesseth the Brain, and so dulls the memory, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Faculty, that both of them weakly apprehend, and hardly retain. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a just and moderate Abstinence <hi>quickens the wit,</hi> sharpens the <hi>Invention,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> (as far as the Constitution is capable,) and makes the spirits and apprehension true, and pure, <hi>instar speculi,</hi> So that both the <hi>species of Earthly things,</hi> and the <hi>contemplation of Heavenly</hi> is more to the life, and so illuminate, as an intemperate muddy brain cannot be. for <hi>Anima sicca, anima prudens.</hi> Wisdom dwels not where the vapors of Meat and Drink have too much to do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nay, Abstinence flies higher yet. It makes our <hi>Prayers,</hi> our <hi>Meditations,</hi> our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions</hi> lesse distracted, more facile, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, more delightsome.</p>
                     <p>And as Faith is the prime, and inward Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; so (of secondary and external things) Abstinence gives the greatest advantage to all spiritual and heavenly virtues: So many helps doth it supply, so many obstacles doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move in every Christian, and Religious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let not so much be crammed in for the Vegetant, as shall not onely indanger the whole body, but hinder all the superiour Faculties, the Senfes, the Affections, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Understanding, and Devotion too.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40738:108"/>
But rather let us use that Christian Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, without which we cannot be so fitted to <hi>run the race that is set before us,</hi> that in the end, we may win the Prize and Crown of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                     <p>We have reason so to do, in regard of those Advantages, that we see it brings to the body, and to the Soul.</p>
                     <p>By all which (if wee look upon it with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial eyes) it is truly amiable, as most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, to Nature, to Reason, to Virtue, to Religion, the Continence of men, the Chastity of women; the vigour of a living, and the ease and quiet of a dying man: and not so much the means to a Crown as a crown it self, and more virtual to the head of him that wears it, but ever ending with a Crown incorruptible.</p>

                     <p>OUr Saviour being asked, which was the <hi>greatest Commandment,</hi> gave this answer in effect; That the greatest Commandement is <hi>to love God with all our heart, and soul, and mind:</hi> that is, as <hi>well as we can,</hi> or <hi>totis viribus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath it; <hi>ut totius dilectionis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eò ourrat,</hi> that the whole current of our love may drive that way, as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> well
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40738:108"/>
expounds it. This is the greatest, and the next is like unto it, <hi>to love others as well as our selves,</hi> not <hi>quantum,</hi> but <hi>sicut,</hi> or <hi>eo modo,</hi> or <hi>in ordine ad Deum,</hi> in reference and subordination to our love to God, which is the <hi>modus</hi> of loving our selves.</p>
                     <p>God looks at nothing more, then this hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unfeigned love of him: nor should we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing more, nothing being more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to our selves.</p>
                     <p>For it is <hi>that</hi> Love, which <hi>covers the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our sins,</hi> and <hi>presents us</hi> and all our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions acceptable to God,</hi> who regards nothing that is not derived from that Fountain.</p>
                     <p>If that were not Motive enough, who would not love him above all, in whom are <hi>all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and loves,</hi> in an eminent manner, beyond our apprehension? And in the fruition of whose love, we have a fair way made to the enjoying of everything else worth the loving?</p>
                     <p>But may we not stop a little, when we look upon our selves? What are we (poor and vile Creatures) that we should aspire or dare to make tendry of our love to him, with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence?</p>
                     <p>True: But since he will not onely <hi>accept</hi> it, but peremptorily <hi>command</hi> it, and command it in the <hi>first place,</hi> we <hi>may</hi> and we <hi>must</hi> frame our selves to do it. And the more we can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Divine Affection, the better we may think our pains to be spent all the dayes of our life.</p>

                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:40738:109"/>
I shall therefore endeavour to help it in this method.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First taking a view of <hi>Love</hi> in general.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then particularly, of <hi>Divine love:</hi> not omitting the <hi>waies</hi> and <hi>attractives</hi> of them both.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>inclination</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> and mind to that which is beloved.</p>
                     <p>Wherein there is no sence of labour, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but rather a languor, and impatience of not having a speedy success of our endeavours to find out, and enjoy that which is desired. For it is supplied with a <hi>continual Fervor,</hi> and <hi>dilated</hi> with a sweet complacence, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing apprehension of the happines we might have in the fruition of what we desire, and long for.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it doth not much need any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Reward, or any thing else to maintain it in vigor, but onely the hope of acquiring that which is beloved.</p>
                     <p>There's none of us all, but have our share more or lesse in this pleasing Affection. And it should be our daily prayer, and care, that we be not mistaken in the object of the Love we pitch upon. To which purpose we should be most vigilant over those parts, where <hi>Love</hi> makes the <hi>entrance.</hi> The ordinary wayes are the <hi>Ear,</hi> and the <hi>Eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, the <hi>Ear hath a door to admit it.</hi> A door, that no Key opens so well as a <hi>good report:</hi> That
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40738:109"/>
will easily make us love those, whom we never saw:- <hi>ut eos saepe, quos nunquam vidimus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamus,</hi> saith the Orator. No Musick can set anothers Heart-strings to the same tune with ours, so soon as this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beside this of the Ear, there's a second, and more frequent passage to <hi>Love,</hi> from the <hi>Eye,</hi> (either the Eye of the <hi>Body,</hi> or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the eye of the <hi>Mind.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Love hath the same Fountain that our loving Tears have; they come out of the Eye, and thence fall into the Breast.</p>
                     <p>So doth all <hi>Love,</hi> from the Eye slide into the Heart: and then it needs no Letters of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; <hi>there it pleads, and conquers for it self.</hi>

                     <p>So it is in all Love, and so it is particularly in <hi>Divine love,</hi> which is an <hi>inclination,</hi> and <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the <hi>heart to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. First it comes in at the <hi>Ear. Fides ex auditu,</hi> saith the Apostle, and so doth Love: <hi>Amor ex auditu.</hi> It begins as that Psalm doth, <hi>Auribus audivimus,</hi> (Ps. 44. 1.) <q>we have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us.</q> 
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It comes in at the <hi>Eye</hi> too. For, from the eye of the <hi>understanding</hi> (by which we see the worth of what we love) it is conveyed by <hi>Faith</hi> into that welcome, which the Heart is easily made ready to <hi>embrace</hi> it withall.</p>
                     <p>Now that we are so taken with love at the

                     <p>They must be holy and <hi>devout eyes</hi> that can so take him, and we had need to look to it, that our eyes may be such. And when they are such, that God may yet divert them from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous objects, and vouchsafe his own love to kindle them withall, that is, the light of his countenance, some gracious aspect from him. wherein the <hi>Soul</hi> may see him as the <hi>fairest of ten thousand, Cant</hi> 5. 10. the most amiable of all that can be loved,) and hear him with that affection, which was commonly his, that said, <hi>Thy word is sweeter to me, then the hony and the honey comb: more to be desired then gold, even much fine gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I may ask, first, concerning the <hi>Eare,</hi> (the first passage to <hi>love,)</hi> who hath not heard of the Majesty, Wisdom, Goodnes, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and other attributes of God? that are able to ravish the love of any soul. <hi>Dies diei eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat scientiam.</hi> There is no speech, or language, but that voice is plainly heard and understood in a l the world.</p>
                     <p>If we will make the right use of our Eares, we cannot but advance our love to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then I may ask as much for the <hi>eye,</hi> the other passage.</p>
                     <p>Hath not every mans eye (the eye of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40738:110"/>
or of his Understanding) been so far <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> as to discover some clear beams, some cast of his love, (not onely in the general wayes of Providence, but) in the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefits, mercies, and indulgencies, that are or may be conferred on him, and should be the <hi>attractives</hi> of his love; so many wayes doth he display his <hi>Amoris insignia,</hi> his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens.</p>
                     <p>And the truth is, we should never come to be so happy as to love him, if he did not <hi>invite,</hi> and <hi>woe</hi> our hearts first by his own Favours, and preventing love; which is the <hi>Adamant</hi> of Love, and was so powerful in him, that it should now draw our <hi>hearts to heaven,</hi> as once it brought him from thence to Earth, to give us a touch of his ardent love, in his humility and Obedience, and especially in shedding his dearest bloud for our sakes.</p>
                     <p>All this did he, to win our love to him, without whom we could not love, nay live, and move, and have any being: and from whom are all the wonders of our Creation, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and all the promises of future, and eternal Happines.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>preventing love</hi> of his is the hand, by which he drawes all men to the <hi>confession of his goodnes.</hi> And if we adde to this the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favours</hi> to our own persons, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to win our Hearts, and fix our love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:40738:111"/>
But we notwithstanding are so hard to be won to him, and so ready to forsake him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the allurement of very trifles, that we scarce make a stop to ask our selves the question, why we <hi>tire</hi> our love with so <hi>many objects,</hi> so infinitely below the value of this one.</p>
                     <p>For what is it that we would have?

                     </p>
                     <p>Or would we partake of <hi>true Riches,</hi> or <hi>knowledg,</hi> or <hi>pleasure?</hi> Then study the love of him, who is the <hi>unum necessarium</hi> to all these ends and purposes.</p>

                     <p>Is not all this true? And yet are not we commonly so far from thinking, how to <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase his love,</hi> that we busy our selves most in that which heaps up the treasure of his wrath, and provokes him to plague us with many fearful judgments.</p>
                     <p>Into these dangers we plunge our selves in the persuit of our ugly sins, but what lovely virtues do we compass with the like hazard, for his sake, that is Love and Charity it self?

What shall we say more of this love? It hath such preheminence above all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that the Wise man, in his Love-song, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to the <hi>Banner,</hi> the most eminent thing in all the Army. <hi>Vexillum ejus super me amor,</hi> under which we venture our lives for his sake.</p>
                     <p>And with this eminence it hath such <hi>value</hi> and <hi>esteem,</hi> that (without it) nothing is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny value: <q>Neither Circumcifion availes any thing, nor uncircumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5.</q> but faith, that works by love, (that is, a lively working Faith, that is set on work by this Love.)</p>
                     <p>So little hope there is for any thing else to be esteemed, though we could come in with long Catalogues of our worth in any kind.</p>
                     <p>If we should boast our Nobility, we should be easily answered by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 8. <hi>Qui diligit, ex Deo natus est.</hi> Every one that loves, is born of God: and to be born of him, is true Nobility.</p>
                     <p>If we could shew our greatness in <hi>Riches, Honour, Knowledge,</hi> or any other way, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would answer all with <hi>Nihil prodest,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. <hi>Si linguis hominum &amp; Angelorum.</hi> 
                        <q>Though I speak with the tongue of men and Angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brasse, or a tinkling Cymbal.</q> 
                        <q>And though I have the gift of Prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and have all Faith, so that I could move Mountains, if

 I have not Love, it profits nothing.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, above all other things, let us beg this of Almighty God, that he would vouchsafe his <hi>own love,</hi> to kindle ours with all; the light of his countenance, some gracious aspect from himself, that may draw the soul to his love.</p>
                     <p>If this be our hearty prayer, there will be nothing wanting on God's part, while we are not wanting to our selves.</p>
                     <p>But there's the hazard. We may be careles, and perverse, doting upon somewhat that hath a fair outside, but within a sting, and poison, that is accompanied with a worm that never dies.</p>
                     <p>In this dotage, our <hi>love</hi> hath an <hi>ear,</hi> and an <hi>eye,</hi> easily opened to the <hi>seeming-sweet</hi> intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sin; but no <hi>eare</hi> for the <hi>best charmer,</hi> (charme he never so wisely,) nor <hi>eye</hi> for him that is the delight of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and daily <hi>invites</hi> us to a love, attended with that security, and delight, and advantage, that is not to be found in any other love.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For <hi>Security</hi> first.

                     <p>The nearer we come to it here, the better. And (to that end) to our best endeavour we must adde <hi>our fervent Prayers, that God would shed this love in our heart by the Holy Ghost, and keep us in the same Love.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THese Meditations were primarily intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for such as live a Collegiate, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative kind of life, freest for Retirements, Out of which commonly are taken the fittest Spies, and Intelligencers for the Kingdom of Heaven. In such men, rather then others, we expect as hearty desires, and serious resolutions of a constant progress in Piety, as appeared in <hi>Caeleb,</hi> and <hi>Josuah</hi> towards the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. For they, being in a more Regular course of life, begin every Morning <hi>in via Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra,</hi> that is, in the way that leades to Gods House, where they are daily furnished with excellent Sermons and Prayers: I mean with the Lessons duly read out of the word of God, and with the Common Prayers of the Church, the best expressions of our daily wants. Who would not think such men in a fair way, in due time to be received into the Promised Land, with Joy, and Blessedness; while many other straglers in the Common Road, demurre so long upon it, that they often loose themselves at last, by diverting into some Wilderness of Trouble and vexation.</p>
                  <p>Those of the first ranck, in a better Retired course, (in some other employment) so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in <hi>viis Domini,</hi> are, or should
<pb facs="tcp:40738:117"/>
be, most of them, of <hi>David</hi>'s mind, and men after Gods own Heart, first seeking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the Righteousness thereof, resolving to follow <hi>David,</hi> rather then <hi>Saul,</hi> in hope they shall not end like <hi>Saul,</hi> but as <hi>David</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Saul</hi> began with seeking, and following after Asses, though he quickly stumbled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a higher employment then he knew well how to manage: but <hi>David</hi>'s walking so much <hi>in lege Domini,</hi> proved to be the better choice, and got him at last as good a Title as <hi>Saul</hi>'s was, upon better tearmes, and with a better blessing, and seconded with a Heavenly crown.</p>
                  <p>Indeed a man might guess, that <hi>Saul</hi> dreamed of some such Happiness sometimes, because we read of some of his Enthusiasms, and some of his accidentall employments in good company. Though it was so seldome, alas! that all wondered at it, and it begat a Proverb <hi>[is Saul also among the Prophets]</hi> But when he fell once (to the purpose) upon worse courses, and followed the bias of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, his punishment followed as hard after them, like a Fury, and haunted him to death, as appeares by his own last words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>a costly-embroidered Coat hath laid fast hold on me, and will doe so, while my life and soul is within me:</hi> which (in the force and weight of the original words) seemes to bear this meaning. My enemies doe now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass me about, and which way soever I look,
<pb facs="tcp:40738:118"/>
I see nothing but the grim picture of Death. But my greatest anguish is from my guilty Conscience, which represents unto me the likeness of such an Embroidered Coat, as I have seen the High Preist wear upon his Ephod. That puts me in mind of my rashly Murdering of many innocent Preists (whose Coat I should have somewhat regarded) and doing it upon a vain and slender pretence, by the hand of <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> who after he had slain no less then 85 persons of that Holy Order, then smote the whole City of the Preists <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The sad memory of this is now the worst sword that can goe through mee. Therefore, any Sword, in this extremitie, shall have leave to rid me, if it can, from this ghastly fight.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended <hi>Saul</hi> in the face of his Prophane Enemies, without any Preist to assist him: which is enough to fright all others out of his careless waies.</p>
                  <p>After his Death, the Crown was set upon <hi>David</hi>'s head. Whose constant Pious Life, and Holy Devotions (in Hymnes, Psalms, and Spiritual Songs) are left, as the best Patterns, Directions, and Encouragements to all Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And we are sure enough, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, after his own use of them (to shew the difference betwixt His end, and <hi>Saul</hi>'s) was happily assured to be one of the Heavenly Quire above, and there Crowned again with an immortal Crown of Glory.
<pb facs="tcp:40738:118"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> is an ancient Pattern, a Royal Prophet, and Grand Guide to such, as are willing to fight the Battles of the Lord, in their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage towards the true Land of Promise,</p>
                  <p>If we would have another, an Eminent Holy Person of our Time, and Profession, and Country, whose memory is yet fresh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us: In the <hi>Appendix</hi> I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to represent Him unto you, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to acquaint you with somthing, that may be useful to your Evening-Devotions.</p>

Why should I keep you any longer from the <hi>Pretious Perfume of his sweet Name?</hi> Such a one was the most Learned and Reverend Lord Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> that <hi>singular Linguist, Incomparable Preacher,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, (that is, the greatest, and most remarkable Divine of that age.)</p>
                  <p>It is not long since he appeared amongst us, as a <hi>burning and shining light,</hi> or a <hi>Starre of so great a magnitude,</hi> and in <hi>so high a Sphere,</hi> that he could not but be taken notice of; yet was he (more or less) locked up, <hi>every day in some Private Holy Retiredness,</hi> in the midst of his great and publick employments, Being <hi>Bishop of Winchester, Lord Almoner, Dean of the Chappel, and Privy Counsellour to King James,</hi> after he had been first Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Elie. His Charitable, and every way, exemplary life,</hi> and his <hi>Pious and Learned works,</hi> speak him best and loudest, as you may be better informed by that R. R. and Worthy Prelate, the Lord Bishop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> in his Funeral Sermon, which is Printed at the end of Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Sermons in <hi>folio.</hi> I have the more reason, with all thankfulness, to make Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mention of Him, because he was pleased to make himself the cheifest Guide, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of my Studies, and put me into the happiest Method, and order of them.</p>

                     <p>O how I wish, that all men would make good use of all that refers to this Inquisition, and narrow search into the state of our souls; that should have more care taken upon them then is ordinarily spent upon the body every day. Therefore, I hope, none will be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I mustered up so many good Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions together, with such a noise about your eares, as it were, with so many Drums and Trumpets (at such an unseasonable time of the night) rather to keep you waking, then to afford some help towards your quiet rest.</p>
                     <p>I think indeed, the first night (though you make choice of a Fasting night) wherein you settle your selves, to the purpose, about this most Christian, and most necessary expression of our duty unto God, and love to our selves, will prove full of trouble, for that part of the night: and your prayers may seem to be the <hi>voice of crying</hi> (as the Royal Prophet speaks of his, in his several nights, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 6.) But this is your happiness, that such a troublesome, and sad peice of such a night, may (by God's bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) work as great a Miracle, as the turning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40738:143"/>
the Water into Wine, and the changing a Face sullied with salt teares, into a most cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance.</p>
                     <p>The solitariness of that part of a night, may be answered with the company of a merry heart of our own (which is a continual Feast) all the dayes, and nights of our life. And (after this uncertain life ended) it may be crowned with everlasting Joy and Happiness, in that only place of blisse, where all teares shall at once be wiped quite away from all faces; and all hearts compleatly filled with true Joy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In hope of this beleif in you, I will now goe on to that, which I promised in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, Of an Antidote and Preservative against future Relapses, worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred every night: You shall receive it from the hands of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> that you may know to whom you are beholden for it.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>That is, If a man hath repented of a sin, and after fallen into the same sinne again, it is a sign, that he pulled not that sinne up by the rootes.</p>
                     <p>For there are some sinnes rooted, and grounded in other sinnes (as Envy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Pride, and Vain glory) In all such, till the root be quite pulled up, and Humility set in the place of it; cut the branches as you please, some what will bud up, and appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40738:143"/>
And as some sinnes are the root of others, so some sinnes are the food of others; as we use to say <hi>(sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus)</hi> Lust useth to feed well, to fare deliciously and plentifully. Therefore there is a Devil that cannor be cast out but by prayer and Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And we may safely say, that Fulness of Bread, and Idleness, as they are the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of many Virtues; so they are the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishers of most Vices. But when we know the true Root, and Cause, and Food of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, it is half cured. It grows late, and we need say no more of this, <hi>Verbum sapienti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may think, that I am ready to take my leave of you, and bid you <hi>Good night,</hi> adding not a word more of that hard Scrutiny, or what else, belonging to it, may fit it for a happy conclusion. And indeed, I and all the world must leave you, when you are for that business, which (though it be most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable) is the most unpleasing to us all, that are great sinners.</p>
                     <p>Yet, that I may take my leave the more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and that you may find the better night, I will say one word more (a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.)</p>
                     <p>If in the foot of your accompt, you find sinnes so great, and so many, that great and many terrours begin to disturb you. Strive to arm your selves with all the armour of God, and be not so much affrighted, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40738:144"/>
to goe on. For if your inward eyes (with the use of your best optick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) have found out so many of your own sinnes, or multitudes of your worst enemies: let your other eyes (by the help of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) furnish you with as good store of the best weapons, that can be used, in your defence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lachrimae arma.</hi> Prayers and Teares are the weapons that <hi>David</hi> used so long, that he washed his bed with them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 6, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Teares are the weapons that <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen's</hi> Eyes had such plenty of, that she could wash our Saviors feet with them.</p>
                     <p>Bitter Teares are the weapons made <hi>Peter</hi> goe out of the place where he denied his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, into a fitter place, wherein he might presently beg that mercy of God, that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divel from ever haunting of him, with the memory of that foul Deniall.</p>
                     <p>And if you fain would, but cannot weep as they did, think of those Prayers (without any mention of teares) that long before these Weepers were born, turned <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Israel,</hi> and moved God to let him and us know, that the Lord of Hostes was overcome with his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate way of <hi>[non dimittam nisi—]</hi> which shewed the power of his Prayers, that wonne him the Name of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let us prove out selves true <hi>Israelites,</hi> by so following of him; if we can extort no Teares, or so few dropps as cannot be poured into God's bottle, and intitle us to the name
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40738:144"/>
of Followers of the other great Champions. For if we can begin with no weapons of Tears, but (without them) broken and sorrowfull penitent Hearts, yet, if we resolve to fight the more valiantly hereafter, under Christ's ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the use of some other spiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, doubt not but the Father of all Mercyes, and Mercy it self, will gratiously receive us; having invited all so freely to come to Him, that are weary and heavy laden with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable burden of their sinnes: and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not by his teares only, but by his pretious blood so fully satisfied for poor penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>I am not sorry that I have shewed you the way how to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and use such weapons in your prayers, since God Himself hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the way, how he may be overcome. And, I hope, you are not sorry, that I have shewed you the way, how to make the night of your Scrutiny (whensoever you make choice of it) a happy and joyfull night, in the close,</p>
                     <p>But when you have well passed over the time of your Scrutiny (in all the nights after) a short Meditation of the Affinity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sleep and Death, will easily produce a Prayer and Resolution, with an eye to that, before you make to much haste to lye down, and rest in your bed, betweèn those sheets, that may prove your winding sheets, for ought you know.</p>

A further supply for the Evening, you may take out of the pious Bishops Devotions, which shall now follow, that you may see, how he usually prepared himself for his quiet sleep and rest, after his daily labours. I wish, all may use them whith his spirit: and remember that like the winding up again of the Clock, such is the necessary Recollection of our selves at night, after the disturbances and discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our selves in the day time, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary employment, and duties of our Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our occasional Commerce with other men.</p>
                     <p>In this task, our best method will be</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First to reflect upon our sinnes of the day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then upon the hazard of the night, against which we had need to be armed by our prayers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then upon the blessing and praising of God, for his former works of mercy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and the confidence which we have in his custody of us this night, and for ever.</p>
                     <p>In this part I find no papers of the good Bishop, but only in Greek, which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent in that order.

After the Hymn, if you are not inclinable to sleep, then (that the better use may be made of your last Prayers and Meditations, concerning the wonders of our Creation, Preservation, and Divine Omni-present Assistance) I will furnish you with a short Paraphrastical Exposition of those Verses of the 139 <hi>Psalm,</hi> which I commended to you before, as fit for the time.</p>
                  </div>

                     <head>A Paraphrastical Exposition of some Uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the 139 Psalme.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. O Lord, thou knowest me as well, as if thou had'st made a narrow search and strict examination of all my inward parts, Thou art privy to my times of Rest and Retirement, and (after them) thou seest, how I fit my self for employment, and how I demean my self in it; Thou observest my intimate and familiar thoughts, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intentions, long before they are actually mine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thou art no stranger to my labour in the day, or my repose, sleep, and dreames, in the night; Thou art throughly acquainted will all my recreations, and all my best, and worst actions, and all my faillures, or more perfect proceedings in the whole course of my life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is not a word at my tongues end but thou can'st discern it wholely, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40738:151"/>
before it come óut; Thou hast no need that I should express it unto Thee, for Thou, Lord, knowest it better then I doe; And as well do'st Thou know, and observe what care I use, not only in the governing of my thoughts and deeds, but also in the bridleing and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of my Tongue, which I keep not in with good heed, besides, the hedge of my Teeth (which is my Monitor to warn me of it) all my Religion will prove vain, and of no esteem, in thy pure eyes, who art the great Judge, and rewarder of all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thou do'st compass me as close on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side (as a City is beset in the straitest siege) I can stirre as little from thy Presence, as if thou had'st laid thy hands upon me to hold me fast.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Thy knowledge of me, and of all my thoughts, words, and deedes, is so high above my capacity: that I can neither comprehend it nor hinder it, nor be concealed from it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For whether can I goe to hide my self from thy knowledge of me; How can I be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from thy dreadfull omnipresence (that frights thine enemies) or deprived of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable omnipresence (which is the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defence of thy servants)</p>
                     <p n="7-8">7. 8. If I could mount my self as high as Heaven, or couch my self as low as Hell, If I were as nimble and swift, as Light it self (which is like the wings of the morning) and could be conveyed in a moment from East to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40738:151"/>
West, land disposed of in the most remotest parts of the Sea</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Even there must I expect to be led by Thy hand, and no other, but Thy gratious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct could be my guide.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If I should think to hide my self in some dark corner, the darkest night would not therein differ from the clearest day.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. For to Thee (the glorious Fountain of Light) the day and night (the clearest, and the darkest places) are all one.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And the abstrusest, and most secret parts about me (my very Reines, the seat of Affections, and Original Inclinations to sinne) lie all open, and naked to thy view, who did'st cover me with flesh, and compact me with bones, and sinewes, in a secret place, in my Mothers womb:</p>
                     <p n="13">13. So that if there were no other cause, yet for my very Creation alone, I am bound, with all thankfulness to admire, and blesse, and praise thy holy Name. My soul cannot but be affected, with that strange, and curious workmanship, even to astonishment and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. For there is not so much as the least bone, or member of my body, but takes along with it, an apparent stamp, and impression of thy divine Power and Wisdom, while my body it self (to say nothing of the rare facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soul) was so cunningly, and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought and imbroidered with Veines and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40738:152"/>
Sinewes, Arteries, and other incomparable varieties of necessary parts; which as they were first framed, and moulded secretly in my Mothers womb: so are they not now, all of them, exposed to the view of every eye, but shew themselves only, by the use that's made of them.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. All this frame, and substance of the body, lay open and naked to thy all-seeing eye, while it was yet an imperfect Embryo, under the hand of thy mighty power, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable wisdom, that lap'd up all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, rowling and winding them up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as orderly, and exactly, to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat number, as if they had been all Register<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Book, with directions how, and in what method, they should be placed.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. All this seemed to be so punctually contrived (before they had their right frame and fashion) that they might be day by day, moulded and ordered, by a strict, and insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of growing to perfection.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. O how dear and pretious should all these things (that belong to thy Creation, and Providence) be in my sight, that seem (in my poor apprehension) as the effect of much thought, advice, and contrivance, in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of so many several parts and wayes, that I should be never able to recollect the summe of them</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Should I venter upon it, with my poor Arithmetick, I were as good settle my self to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40738:152"/>
number the sand of the Sea; In various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of them, I may lull my self a sleep, and yet when I awake, return to Thee again, in a fresh way of Rapture and Admiration, of thy wonderful works: And if this were my employment every day, and constant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of my thoughts every night: Yet were it too impossible for me, in the course of my whole life to comprehend.</p>
