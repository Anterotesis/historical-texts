         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this made me fret out worse than gumd Taffaty, that neither in any one of those Kingdomes, (no nor yet within the walls and water-works of mine own country) could I either find or heare, (for I gaue a Crier a King-Harry-groate to make an oyes) no nor read of any man, woman or child, left so wel by their friends, or that caryed such an honest mind to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Castalians,</hi> as to keepe open-house for the seauen poore Liberall Sciences: nor once (which euen the rich cubs and fox-furd curmudgens do) make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good cheere so much as at Christmas, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery cobler has licence (vnder the broad Seale of Hospitality) to sit cheeke by iowle at the table of a very Aldermans deputy.</p>

when they saw a most cruel man of warre pursue them, but suffred all to sinke or swim, crying out onely, Put your trust in God my Bullies, &amp; not in vs, whilst they either hid them selues vnder hatches, or else scrambled to shoare in Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats: yet thou (vndanted <hi>Nobody</hi>) then, euen then, didst stand stoutly to thy tackling, step coragiously to the helme, and manfully runne vp &amp; downe, encouraging those (with comfortable words) whose hearts laie coldly in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

So that I, that (like a Match) scarce gaue fire before, to the dankish powder of their apprehensions, was now burnt vp my self, in the flames of a more ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards thee, kindled by them.

I know the Stationers will wish me and my papers burnt (like hereticks) at the Crosse, if thou doest (now) but enter into their Shops by my meanes: It would fret their hearts to see thee at their Stalls reading my Newes. Yet therein they deale doubly, and like notable dissemblers, for all the time of this Plaguy Allarum, they marcht only vnder thy cullors: desirde none but thy company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none but thy selle wert welcome to them: none but <hi>Nobody</hi> (as they all cride out the thine immortall commendatious) bought bookes of them: <hi>Nobody</hi> was their best, and most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous customer. Fye on this hollow-hearted world! Do they shake thee off now? Be wise, and come not neere them by twelue-score at least, so shalt thou not neede to care what disgraces they shoote at thee. But leauing them to their old tune, of <hi>What new Bookes do you lack?</hi> prick vp thine eares like a March-Hare (at the sudden cry of a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of hounds) and listen what newes the Post thats come from <hi>Winchester</hi> - Terme windes out of his horne.</p>
            <p>O that thou hadst taken a lease there (happy <hi>Nobody</hi>) but for one moneth, the place had (for thy sake) bin well spoken of for euer. Many did heartily pray (especially Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen, and Players, besides the Drawers, Tapsters, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Inholders, with all the rest of the hungry Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of <hi>Westminster</hi>) for thy going thither. Ten thousand in <hi>London</hi> swore to feast their neighbors with nothing but plum-porredge, and mince-pyes all Christmas, (that now for anger will not bestow a crust on a begger) vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all the Iudges, Sergeants, Barristers, and Atturnies, had not set a foot out of dores, but that thou only (in pomp)

(sauing them that labour) hadst rode the iourney, so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily did they thirst after thy preferment. For hadst thou bin there, those black-buckrom tragedies had neuer bin seene, that there haue bin acted. Alas! its a beastly thing to report. But (truth must out) poore dumb Horses were made meere Iades, being vsed to villanouslie, that they durst neither weihy nor wag taile. And though the riders of them had growne neuer so chollerick, and chaft till they foamd againe, an Hostler to walke them was not to be had for loue or money. Neither could the Geldings (euen of Gentlemen) get leaue (for all they swet til they dropt again) to stand as they had wont at Rack &amp; Manger. (no, no, twas enough for their maisters to haue that honor) but now (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against all equitie) were they cald (when they little thought of any such matter) to a deere reckoning for all their old wilde-oates.</p>
            <p>A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracy there was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst all the Inkeepers, that <hi>Iack Straw</hi> (an ancient rebell) should choak al the horses: and the better to bring this to passe, a bottle of hay was sold deerer then a bottle of wine at <hi>London.</hi> A trusse cost more, then maister Maiors trusse of <hi>Forduch,</hi> with the sleeues &amp; belly-piece all of bare Sattin to boote: Which knauery being smelt out, the horsemen grew pollitick, &amp; neuer sate downe to dinner, but their Nags were still at their elbowes: so that it grew to be as ordinary a question, to aske, <hi>What shall I pay for a Chamber for my selfe and my Gelding all night,</hi> (because they would not be Iaded any more) as in other countrey townes, <hi>For my wife and my selfe,</hi> for a beast and a man were entertained both alike, and that in such wonderful sort, that theile speake of it, <hi>In aeternam rei memoriam.</hi> For most of their roomes were fairely built (out of the ground, but not out of the durt) like Irish Houels, hung round about with cobweb-lawne very richly, and furnished, no Aldermans Parlor in <hi>London</hi> like them: for heres your bed, there a

stable, and that a hogsty, yet so artificially contriu'd, that they stand all vnder one roofe, to the amazement of all that behold them.</p>
            <p>But what a childishnes is it, to get vp thus vpon their Hobby-horses, let them bite a the bridle, whilst we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the men. As for the women, they may laugh and lye downe, its a merry world with them, but some-body payes for it. O <hi>Winchester</hi>! much mutton hast thou to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for, which thou hast made away (being sluttishly fryed out in steakes, or in burnt Carbonadoes) thy maid-seruants best know how, if they were cald to an account. It was happy for some, that 4. of the Returnes were cut off, for if they had held together, many a one had neuer returned from thence his owne man. Oh beware! your <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>-Goose is tenne times more dangerous to surfet vpon, than your <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> Shambles-Capon.</p>
            <p>You talke of a Plague in <hi>London,</hi> &amp; red Crosses set vpon dores, but ten plagues cannot melt so many crosses of siluer out of Lawyers purses, as the <hi>Winchesterians</hi> (with a hey-pas, re-pas) iugled out of theirs to put into their owne. Patient they were I must needes confesse, for they would pocket vp any thing, came it neuer so wrongfully, insomuch that very good substantiall householders haue oftentimes gone away with crackt crownes, &amp; neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaind of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If euer mony were currant (<hi>à curre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do,</hi> of ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning away) now was the time, it ran fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore clients to the Atturneys &amp; Clarks of bands in small troopes (here 10 &amp; there 20) but when the Leaguers of <hi>Winchester</hi> cried Charge, Charge, the Lawyers paid fort, they went to the pot full deerely, &amp; the townesmen still caryed away all the noble and royall victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. So that being puft vp with an opinion, that the Siluer Age was crept into the world againe, they denyed (in a manner) the Kings Coyne, for a penny was no money with them. Whensoeuer there shall come forth a Prest
<pb facs="tcp:6091:8"/>
for Souldiers, thither let it be sent, for by all the opinion of the best Captaines (that had a charge there, and haue tryed them) the men of <hi>Winchester</hi> are the onely seruiceable men this day in <hi>England:</hi> the reason is, they care no more to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among small shots, than to be at the discharging of so many Cannes of beere: Tush, us their desire, to see those that enter vpon them, to come off soundly, that when they are gone, all the world may beare witnes they came to their cost.</p>
            <p>And being thus (night and day) imploid, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally entring into Action, it makes them haue mightie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, so that they are able to soake and deuoure all that come in their way: A Rapier and a Cloake haue bin eaten vp at a Supper as cleane (and caryed away well too) as if they had bin but two Rabbet-suckers. A Nag serued but one Seruing-man to a breakefast, whilst the Saddle and Bridle were brewd into a quart of strong Beere.</p>
            <p>This intollerable destroying of victuals being lookt into, the Inhabitants laid their heads together, and agreed among themselues (for the general good of the whole Towne) to make it a towne of Garrison. And seeing the desperate Termers, that stroue in lawe together, in such a pittifull pickle, and euery day so durty, that when they met their Councell, they lookt like the black Guard, fighting with the Innes of Court, that therefore all the Househol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders should turne Turke, and be victuallers to the Camp. By this meanes hauing the lawe in their owne hands, they rulde the roast how they listed: insomuch, that a common iugge of double Beere skornd to kisse the lips of a Knight vnder a groate. Sixe howres sleepe could not be bought vnder fiue shillings. Yea in some places a nights lodging was dearer than the hire of a Curtizan in <hi>Venice</hi> twice so long. And (hauing learnd the tricks of <hi>London</hi>-Sextons) there they laid foure or fiue in a bed, as here, those other
<pb facs="tcp:6091:8"/>
knaues of Spades thrust nine and tenne into one graue. Beds keeping such a iustling of one another in euery roome, that in the day time the lodgings lookt like so many Vpholsters Shops, and in the night time like the <hi>Sauoy,</hi> or <hi>S. Thomas</hi> Hospitall. At which, if any guest did but once bite his lip, or grumble, he was cashierd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for a mutinous fellow, the place was not for him, let him trudge. A number stood with Petitions readie to giue mony for the reuersion of it: for <hi>Winchester</hi> now durst, (or at least hopt to) stand vpon prowd termes with <hi>London.</hi> And this (thou beloued of all men) is the very pith and marrow of the best and latest Newes (except the vnmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of certaine Treasons) that came with the Post from <hi>Winchester,</hi> where if thou hadst hirde a Chamber (as would to heauen thou hadst) thou wouldst neuer haue gone to any Barbers in <hi>London</hi> whilst thou hadst liude, but haue bin trimd only there, for they are the true shauers, they haue the right Neapolitan polling.</p>
            <p>To whose commendations, let me glew this piece more, that it is the most excellent place for dispatching of old suites in the world, for a number of riding suites (that had lyen long in lauander) were worne out there, only with seruing amongst the hot shots, that marcht there vp and downe: let <hi>Westminster</hi> therefore, <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and <hi>Fleete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streete,</hi> drinke off this draught of <hi>Rosa solis,</hi> to fetch life into them againe, after their so often swounding, that those few Iurors that went thither (if any did goe thither) haue tane an oath neuer to sit at <hi>Winchester</hi>-Ordinary againe, if they can choose, but rather to breake their fasts in the old Abbey behinde <hi>Westminster,</hi> with Pudding-Pyes, and Furmenty.</p>
            <p>Deliuer Copies of these Newes (good <hi>Nobody</hi>) to none of thy acquaintance (as thou tenderst me) and thou shalt commaund any seruice at my hands: for I haue an intent

to hire three or foure Ballad-makers, who I know will be glad for sixe pence and a dinner, to turne all this lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Prose into more perfectly-halting Verse, that it shall doe any true-borne Citizens heart good, to heare such doings sung to some filthie tune, and so fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
