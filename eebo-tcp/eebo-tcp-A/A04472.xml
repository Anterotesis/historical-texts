            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now some long tyme si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reuerende father bishoppe <hi>Iewel</hi> deliuered vnto the people of his charge the Exposition vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the epistles of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> when manie his hearers thought it worthie to be made common, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him earnestly (euen as since his blessed departure out of this life they haue
<pb facs="tcp:25001:3"/>
often required me) to publish the same. It is very likely that he would, if he had liued, haue perused these his trauailes, and some others, &amp; haue drawne them to the vse &amp; benefite of the Church: and rather haue spent his time in setting forth matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderstand towards the attainement of saluation, than in folowing their humour anie longer, whom neither the weaknesse of their owne cause, nor the force of the truth, nor the defence thereof by so waighty autorities of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the ancient catholike fathers, and of general councels; could content or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to forsake the waie of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereunto they were entred, and of troubling the Church of God, with their writings against the truth.</p>
            <p>This his purpose hee partlie declared in giuing his last answeare to a booke written by Maister <hi>Harding,</hi> entituled, <hi>A detection of sundrie foule errours, &amp;c.</hi> For answere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he thought not good to charge with number of bookes, or to encomber the world with needelesse labours: but onelie by a shorte augmentation of his former
<pb facs="tcp:25001:3"/>
defence of the Apologie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to discharge Master <hi>Hardings</hi> quarels. For reason whereof he saith: I cannot imagine, that anie my poore labours shall be able to end these quarels. For a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man will neuer lacke wordes. I haue endeuoured for my simple parte, to say so much as to a reasonable man maie seeme sufficient. If any thing be left vnanswered, either it was nothing, or nothing worth. Wherein hee was of like minde vnto that famous learned man Maister <hi>Bucer,</hi> who speaking of the new and fresh supplie that is made among the aduersaries of our Christian religion, said thus: <hi>Veteribus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondimus, novos quotidie legimus, nihil adferunt novi, quid ergo faciemus?</hi> Aunswere hath beene made by vs to their olde Writers: wee reade their newe Writers which come foorth dailie, which yet bring no newe matter or proofes with them. What then shall wee doe? What else, but (as he giueth counsaile) laie downe al affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fauour of parties, and peruse that hath beene saide in matter of controuersie on both sides, and iudge iustly of that is
<pb facs="tcp:25001:4"/>
alleadged, and with feare and reuerence be careful of our own saluation. For, after the trueth is once found out, whosoeuer see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth farther, seeketh not for the truth, but for errour. The Apostle willeth <hi>Titus,</hi> to staie foolish questions and genealogies, &amp; contentions, and brawlings about the law: for they are vnprofitable, and vaine. And also to reiect him that is an heretique after once or twice admonition. In like cafe he said vnto <hi>Timothie:</hi> If anie man teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and consenteth not to the wholsome words of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godlines, hee is puft vp, and knoweth nothing: but doateth about questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; strife of words, whereof commeth enuie, strife, railings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil surmisings, froward disputations of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of corrupt minds, &amp; destitute of the truth, which thinke that gaine is godlinesse: from such separate thy selfe.</p>
            <p>Now, bicause he himself had some good liking to publish this exposition, and the matter thereof is so fit for our time, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing maie be more: and there is not (as I can learne) anie interpretor vpon these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
<pb facs="tcp:25001:4"/>
in the english tongue: and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons vpon them, were the last fruits, and trauailes hee bestowed in the cathedrall Church of <hi>Sarum:</hi> I made choice of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g manie other excellent monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his paines taken in the Church of God, &amp; gaue my best diligence to peruse his notes thereupon, and to draw them to some such perfection, as might carrie to the Reader the whole waight of his matter, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie diminution, euen as fully as he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, so far foorth as the notes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnder his owne hand, might direct me. The which I most humblie commend to the fauourable protection of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: whom I beseech so to accept my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indeuor herein, as I haue beene careful to answere your Honors commandement, in giuing foorth some part of his laboures to light.</p>
            <p>In this discourse, as there are manie good things fruitfully declared, the vse and practise whereof is common to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with al Christians: so are there two matters, the one of Vsurie, the other of Antichrist: that is, of the bane and poison
<pb facs="tcp:25001:5"/>
of the common wealth, and of the infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and decaie of the Church: wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed more paines to open them, and make them manifest, that all men might know and abhorre them, and beware of them. What hath beene wrought by these two mischiefes to the vndoing in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; substance, and to the vtter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the soules and bodies of manie thousand subiects of this realme, within these late yeares, it is to the griefe of all good men, too wel knowne.</p>
            <p>If therefore in the duetie of a good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he standing in his watch, hath discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these enimies to al ciuil and christian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and if now so many yeares after his entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into rest by these means he cal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your good Honor, to step forth in fresh courage into the battaile of the Lorde of hostes, and to vse and employ the great giftes of wisedome and aucthoritie which God hath bestowed vppon you, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and stir vp others the worthie and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table captaines set ouer the people, to be a fenced wal betwene them, and these so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous monsters, and dangerous enimies:
<pb facs="tcp:25001:5"/>
what remaineth, but that your Honour put to your hande, and doe that for the comfort of Gods people, which, besides hir excellent Maiestie, and hir honorable Counsaile, no other can do, in giuing life to al such lawes, which haue beene deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by men of great godlinesse and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haue beene confirmed by high authoritie to the suppression of Vsurie, and to the setting foorth of Gods glorie? The God of glory, and of power, who hath called your Honour to his seruice in high place, strengthen you to doe his wil, and grant you many and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous daies, to the comfort of his Church and his common weale.</p>

In like maner the Church of God which was gathered at <hi>Rome</hi> grew proude and high minded, &amp; boasted themselues ouer the Iewes. The <hi>Galathians</hi> forsooke the good waie of the gospel, whereunto they were called, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did walke.

Albeit the Iews withstood them and beted them fore, albeit false brethren vsed diuers secret meanes to drawe them from the loue of the truth: yet they kept still their stedfastnesse: and could not be driuen from their faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by crueltie of persecution, nor by subtiltie of craftie persuasion. <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Athens,</hi> a place far distant from thence, sendeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to knowe in what case they stoode. So carefull was he for that house which he had built: for, the fire which he had kindled: for the graffes which he had planted: and, for the children which he begot among them. When <hi>Timothie</hi> made report of their constancie, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued stedfast in those things which they had learned: he writeth this Epistle, to commend them, and to exhort them to abide stedfast in their faith: that they become not like the foolish <hi>Israelites,</hi> which longed after the flesh pottes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and were vnmindfull of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from bondage vnder <hi>Pharao:</hi> that they returne not like filthy dogges to their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, and like vncleane swine to their puddles of-mire: that they looke not backe againe after they haue put their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to the Lords plough, and so make themselues vnworthie the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>

God, and bring foorth the fruits of the gospell. There were among them that liued idlely, and did trouble the church without a cause: whom he reprooueth, willing them to be quiet, and to meddle with their owne matters, and works with their handes. Others mourned ouer the dead without measure, euen as if they had no hope: whom he instructeth in the resurrection, and comforteth with the spéech of the blessed comming of our Lord, when we which liue shall be caught vp to méete him, and so we shall euer be with the Lord. Others reasoned fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the later daie, when it should be, when the sonne of God shoulde appeare, and when the worlde should haue an ende: as if man might reach to the knowledge hereof. But them also he reprooueth, and warneth that they take care rather to watch, and looke for the Lordes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that they may be founde readie, hauing their loines girded, and their lampes bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

The matter of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle is plaine, and treateth not of déepe and profound mysteries. The maner of vtterance which the Apostle vseth, is open and cuident.

which knewe not God: and that they watched you and your doing: that their eye was vpon your housholde, your wiues, your seruauntes, and your children: vpon your selues, and your words, to espie if they might finde any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to speake euil of you. I did beséech you by the glorious comming of our Lorde, and saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jesus Christ, that the name of God might not be il spoken of through you. You can not denie this.

               <p>
                  <hi>As a father his children.</hi> What maner care is it that the father taketh of his children.

               <p>Let such as are fathers, and haue children, knowe in what sort they must be careful. Your children are a good blessing of God, they bée members of the bodie of Christ, &amp; the sonnes of God. The kingdome of heauen belongeth to them. God hath appointed his Angels to guide and leade them, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

euil: and their Angels be in the presence of God and doe beholde the face of their father which is in heauen. They be fresh plantes of the Church. Who knoweth what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie instruments they may be in the common wealth, and in the house of God? It is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to féede them, and to nourish theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with necessarie sustenaunce. For this do the heathen that knowe not God: and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and brute beastes, and the birdes which haue no vnderstanding. They bréede vp their young ones, and are tender and paineful to prouide for them. The asse though she be dul, the Beare, and Lion, though they be wilde and cruel, yet séeke they farre and néere to get wherewith to helpe their young. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be anie, or can bee any which doeth forsake and leaue his owne, he is more beastly than the foolish Asse, and more vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than most cruel Beares, and Lions, and Tigres.</p>
               <p>But in this part men are for the most part ouer careful. For this cause many build their houses with bloud, and séeke possessions by iniquitie: they ioyne house to house, and fielde to fielde, and wil dwel alone vpon the earth: they oppresse the poore and néedie, and doe wrong to the widowe, and the fatherlesse: they make money their God, and spoyle one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25001:41"/>
an other: and al to prouide for their children. This is the couer and cloake for al their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiefe, they may not leaue their children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided. Unhappie are the fathers, which in this sort care for their children, by the ruine &amp; spoyle of the néedy and innocent, and so breake the commandement of God: because their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shal be with the wicked in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone. And vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie are their children, because they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their fathers wickednesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shal also be partakers of punishment with them. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, <hi>I haue seene <note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note> the wicked strong, and spreading himselfe like a greene Bay tree. Yet hee passed away, and loe, he was gone, and I sought him, but hee could not be found.</hi> His roote was déepe, his stocke strong, his braunches broade, he spread ouer and shadowed the whole countrey, yet he passed away. He departed, his sonnes died, his house soone decayed, and his name was in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time quite forgotten.</p>
               <p>Oh howe much better then is it to furnish the mindes of your children, and to instruct them in godlinesse, to teach them to knowe God, to leade their life vertuously, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them, and correct them for dealing il.</p>
               <p>The beginning of wisedome is the feare of God. Let them then learne what that good and

The worde of God is pure and giueth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the simple: it is a light to their footesteps: it teacheth those that are young to amende their wayes.</p>

               <p>Infancie is the first part of our life, and as it were the foundation thereof. Where a vertuous and godlie childhood goeth before, there a godlie and vertuous age followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Contrariwise, when the fathers are not carefull to teach their children to knowe God, and to know themselues: when they doe not bréede them vppe in vertue: nor reprooue them when they doe amisse: they become corrupt in their vnderstanding, and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in their doings, voide of al knowledge, and grace, and of reuerence, or féeling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <p>If an earthly Prince speake, or send mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto vs, we giue al shewe of reuerence, and heare him with al diligence. This word is not of flesh and bloud, it procéedeth not from Kings or Emperours, or from parliament, or from councels of men: but from GOD the father and from Iesus Christ. When this worde is read, Princes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours stande vp, and laie downe their sword, and vncouer their head, and bowe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and doe reuerence, bicause they knowe it is the worde of GOD, which God himselfe vttered, that it should be as the deaw of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to moisten our soules, as a well of water springing vp to euerlasting life: as a sauour of life vnto life: and the verie power of God vnto saluation to euerie one that beléeueth. Without this worde wée can receiue no comforte, wée can not sée the light, nor growe in saith, nor abide in the Church of God. It is the word of reconciliation.

               <p>Therfore when the Epistles, the Psalms, the Chapters, and the Gospell are read in our hearing, let vs remember whose worde wée heare. Let vs thinke thus with our selues. These are the words of our gracious GOD. My God openeth his mouth from heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.

               <p>What is the cause why so manie so little regarde the worde of GOD? Why they doubt it, and suspect it? Why they are so soone wearie of it, and beare it not that reuerence, that belongeth to it? Bicause they thinke not, neither from whome it commeth, nor with whose bloud it is sealed, nor to Inhose benefite it is written. Let vs not be ashamed to giue place to the worde of GOD, to awake our senses, and to submit them, and our wisedome and learning, and bodies, and soules vnto it.

               <p>The Churches of God in <hi>Iudea</hi> were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably bered and afflicted, they were hated of al men, and counted vnworthie of life.

them. They hearde of their mildenesse and of their constancie, and were stirred vp by their example. They did hearken after them, and were carefull for them as for their brethren, and the members of the same bodie.</p>
               <p>You haue heard what numbers of late haue béene persecuted and put to death among vs. Wherefore? because they turned from idols to serus God as he hath commanded, and did put their trust in him. You haue hearde how patiently and méekely they went to their death, and what a plentiful haruest God hath raised of their bloud. For the death of his saintes is precious in the sight of the Lorde. Their bloud cannot be spent in vaine. Wee must remember their patience and zeale, and the cause why they suffred. We must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, or set light by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for which they so ioyfully gaue their liues.</p>
               <p>And it is not ynough that we be mindeful of such examples as we haue had at home. We must also carefully consider of other Churches abroade. God hath kindled a fire: he wil haue it burne. O what formentes doe our brethren daily suffer? What crueltie is deuised daily against them? I speake not of death onelie but of rackings, and wonderful extremities, more painefull than death. Wherefore are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25001:48"/>
these thinges done vnto them? Because they are turned to the true and liuing God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léene in the name of Jesus Christ. Some they hang by the hands, and drawe vp with a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and binde great weights of leade at their héeles to rent them, and teare their bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. Some they haue tied vnto great pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of timber, and haue put fire at the soales of their féete. They haue opened their mouthes, and made them drawe in Lawne into their bodie. A thing most cruel, and yet which they haue practised, the maner whereof hath béene thus reported. They laie it so farre in the mouth, that a mans breath easily draweth it into his bodie, and so it is conueighed into the stomacke. When it is wel setled, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the tormentour and taketh the Lawne by the other ende, and rasheth it sodainelie with such a force, as it séemeth, he doth plucke out the verie heart and entrailes: such a rare &amp; strange kinde of crueltie as is not practised vpon most notorious rebels and traitors. As for death, 40 or 50 at one time haue béene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together, and burnt in one fire. They haue set vpon the seruauntes of God, and compassed the Church where they haue assembled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray vnto God, and murthered them in their innocencie, whiles they lifted vp pure handes vnto God. The French king, by the

He wasted, defaced, &amp; vnpeopled it, not for that they were théeues or rehels: but because they beléeued in the name of Christ. Consider how many are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and in the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> They are not so farre from vs, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea from <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> They ioyne next vnto vs. God is blessed in his saints, and holy in al his workes, no crueltie is able to quench his truth. There is no counsel, which shal preuaile against the Lord. He giueth increase, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth children in fréede of their fathers. The more are slaine by the enemies, the more spring up by the working of his spirite. The more are hewne downe, the more multiplie. We may not be strangers in this case. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boueth vs to consider the afflictions of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. They belong vnto vs: We must pray to God for them, that he wil put an ende to their misenies: otherwise, wee haue not the spirite of God, we beare no loue, nor care for his bause.</p>

O in what case then are they, that are carlesse and make no regard of the people of God: which hunt after manie liuings, and bend not themselues to do good? which serue their owne bellie, and séeke to be rich, and eate vp the people of God, as if they were breade? They cannot say they haue a desire to sée the face of their flocke, and that their heart is with them. Howsoeuer they finde time for other matters, they can neuer take time to know their shéepe, and to doe the worke of their ministerie among them. They care not for them, they thinke not of them. They plant not, they water not, they watch not, they giue no warning of the daungers at hand: they teach them not to denie ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and worldlie lusts, and to liue soberly, and righteously, and godlie in this present world.</p>
               <p>It were happy if al such were remoued out of the Church of GOD. They destroie the soules of manie, and leade them to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their negligence.

It might haue béene that their weakenesse should in like sort haue béene overcome, when the tempter tempted them. And so the gold which hée had left with them might haue béene tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into drosse, &amp; the light into darkenes, and the kingdome of God taken away from them. For then had his labour béene in vaine, and they had receiued the worde to their owne damnation.

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sinne that a man doth, is without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but he that committeth fornication, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against his owne bodie. God is the auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of such. He wil iudge the adulterers, and fornicatours.

               <p>V. 5. And not in the lust of concupiscence, euen as the Gentiles which know not God.</p>
               <p>Giue not your selues ouer to filthie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the horse and mule which haue no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and, as the Gentiles which haue no feare of Gods iudgement. Their heart, and minde is vncleane. They know not God, they knowe not themselues. They knowe not the difference of this life, and of the life to come. Therefore they knowe not sin, or if they know it, they refraine it not, but follow the lustes of their corrupt nature, and giue themselues to wantonnesse, to worke al vncleannesse, euen with gréedinesse. Thus the Apostle setteth downe, what is the fruite of ignoraunce, and whereto a man groweth, that knoweth not God. That deuotion therefore, which some say is the daughter of ignorance, hath no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with true holinesse. <hi>For this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>

               <p>V. 6. That no man oppresse or defraude his brother in any matter, for the Lorde is an auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of al such thinges, as we haue also told you before time, and testified.</p>
               <p>Let no man defraude his brother, neither by false weight, nor by false measure, nor by lying words. Let your measures, &amp; weights, &amp; wordes be true: let your gaines be iust &amp; true, that God may blesse them. His blessing will make you rich, and whatsoeuer he blesseth not, shal wast &amp; consume, and do you no good. Doe vnto others as you would they should do vnto you. This is true dealing and vpright.</p>
               <p>If thou speake more than is true, if thou take more than thy ware is worth, thy conscience knoweth it is none of thine. God will destroy al the workers of iniquitie. He that delighteth in sin, hateth his owne soule. The mouth that accustometh to lie, slayeth the soule.</p>
               <p>Defraud not thy brother: he is thy brother, whether he be rich or poore: he is thy brother, and the sonne of God. Wilt thou do wrong to thy brother? wilt thou oppresse the son of God, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of god? God is his father, he wil not leaue it vnpunished in thée. If he be simple and vnskilful, abuse not his simplicitie. God is the God of righteousnes. Deale iustly,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25001:66"/>
that thine owne conscience accuse thée not. Teach not thy sonnes nor thy seruauntes to deceiue others, and to gaine by wickednesse. After they haue learned of thée to deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they wil deceiue thée also. <hi>Iob</hi> prayed daily for his children.

And that you may the better consider hereof and sée the whole matter of Vsurie, I will shewe you first, what Vsurie is: then, whence it spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; what are the causes of Vsarie: thirdly, what commeth of it, what hurt it worketh to the common wealth: and I will laie soorth such reasons, as may make any good man abhorre it: Then I wil declare what the holie fathers, and the Apostles, and Martyres, and Christ, and God himselfe haue thought and spoken of vsurie.</p>

               <p>Vsurie is a kinde of lending of money, or corne, or olle, or wine, or of anie other thing, wherein, vpon couenant and bargaine, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiue againe the whole principall, which we delivred, and somewhat more, for the vse and occupying of the same. As, if I lend 100. pounds, and for it couenant to receiue 105. li. or anie other sum, greater than was the sum,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25001:67"/>
which I did lend. This is that which we call Vsurie. Such a kind of bargaining as no good man or godlie man euer vsed. Such a kinde of bargaining as all men that euer feared Gods iudgement haue alwaies abhorred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. It is filthie gaines, and a worke of darkenesse. It is a monster in nature: the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of mightie kingdoms, the destruction of flourishing states, the decay of wealthy Cities, the plagues of the world, and the misery of the people. It is thest, it is the murthering of our Brethren, it is the curse of God, and the curse of the people. This is Vsurie. By these signes and tokens you may knowe it: for wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it raigneth al those mischiefes ensue. But how and how many ways it may be wrought, I wil not declare. It were horrible to heare: and I come now to reprooue Vsurie and not to teach it.</p>
               <p>Let vs sée then what is the cause hereof and whence it groweth, who is the mother, the nurce, or the bréeder of Vsurie. For it gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not euerie where, nor among al men. Manie hate it, and detest it, and had rather die, than liue of such spoile. It is not of God, for God straitly forbiddeth it. Neither is it founde among the children of God: for loue séeketh not her owne profite, but to doe good to her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:25001:67"/>
Whence then springeth Vsurie? Soone shewed: euen thence whence theft, murther, adulterie, the plagues, and destruction of the people doe spring. Al these are the workes of the Diuell, and the workes of the flesh. Christ telleth the Pharises, <hi>You are of your father the <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> Diuel, and the lustes of your father you wil do.</hi> Euen so may it truely be saide to the Usurer, thou art of thy father the Diuell, and the lust of thy father thou wilt doe, and therefore thou hast pleasure in his workes. The Diuel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and put in him this gréedinesse, and couetousnesse of gaine, for which he was content to sell his maister. Iudas heart was the shoppe, the Diuel was the foreman to worke in it. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith: <hi>They</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>that wil be rich, fal into tentation and snares, and into manie foolish and noisome lustes, which drowne men into perdition and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <hi>sinne is of the Diuel.</hi> Thus we sée, that the Diuel is the planter, and the father of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse, desire of money, vnsatiable gréedinesse, deceitfulnesse, vnmercifulnesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, oppression, extortion, contempt of God, hatred to the brethré, and hatred of al men, are the nurces and bréeders of vsurie. It springeth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:25001:68"/>
from Sathan, and groweth, and is watered, and fed and nourished by these cruell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable monsters.</p>
               <p>Let vs see farther, what are the fruits which come of Vsurie. For perhappes it doeth some good, and you may thinke, that manie are the better for it. These therefore are the fruites. It dissolueth the knotte and felowship of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: it hardeneth mans heart: It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men vnnaturall, and bereaueth them of charitie and loue to their dearest friendes. It bréedeth miserie, and prouoketh the wrath of GOD from heauen. It consumeth rich men, it eateth vp the poore, it maketh banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, and vndoeth manie housholdes. The poore occupiers are driuen to flée, their wiues are left alone, their children are helplesse, and driuen to begge their breade, through the vnmercifull dealing of the couetous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dauid</hi> laieth out the wickednesse of the country where he was persecuted, he saith <note place="margin">Psal. 54.</note> of them, <hi>Non defecit Vsura &amp; dolus in plateis eorum, Vsurie &amp; deceit departeth not from their streetes,</hi> one séeketh to spoile and eate vp an other. These are the commodities and the fruits of Vsurie. Such is Vsurie in the middest of a Citie, and such good it worketh, as fire doth, when it is set to the roofe of a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25001:68"/>
house, or as the plague doth, when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the middest of the body and toucheth the hart.</p>
               <p>We haue heard whence Vsurie springeth, and what hurt it doth. Which, whosoeuer considereth, may finde cause ynough to loath it, and forsake it. One asked of <hi>Cato, What it was to commit Vsurie. What is it</hi> (saieth hée againe) <hi>to kil a man?</hi> He that is an Vsurer is a murtherer. The same <hi>Cato</hi> saith, <hi>Our fathers punished a thiese, with paiment of the double of that he had taken, but the Vsurer was alwaies condemned to paie foure times the valewe.</hi> They were wise men. They thought that an vsurer was much worse than a théefe.</p>
               <p>For a théefe is driuen by extremitie and néede: the Vsurer is rich and hath no néede. The théefe stealeth in corners, and in places where he may be vnknowne: the vsurer open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldely at al times. and in anie place. The théefe, to relieue his wife and children: the Vsurer to spoile his neighbour, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe his wife and children. The théefe stealeth from the rich, which haue inough: the Vsurer from the poore that hath nothing. The théefe fléeth and will be séene no more: the Vsurer standeth by it, continueth, and stealeth still: daie &amp; night, sléeping and waking, he alwaies
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25001:69"/>
stealeth. The théefe repenteth of his déede, he knoweth he hath done wrong and is sorie for it: the Vsurer thinketh it is his owne, that it is well gotten, and neuer repenteth, nor sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth, but defendeth, and maintaineth his sinne impudently. The théefe, if he escape, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times becommeth profitable to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and bestoweth him selfe painefully in some trade of life: the Vsurer leaueth his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, forsaketh his husbandrie, giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to nothing, whereby his countrey maie haue benefite. The théefe is satisfied at length: the Vsurer hath neuer inough. The bellie of the wicked wil neuer be filled. As the sea is neuer filled with water, though al the streams of the world runne into it: so the gréedinesse of an Vsurer is neuer satisfied, though he gaine neuer so vnreasonably. The sea is profitable: the vsurer is hurtfull and dangerous. By the sea we may passe and come safely to the hauen, but no man passeth by vsurie without lesse or shipwracke.</p>
               <p>Now heare what the godlie and learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church haue thought of vsurie. No doubt they were godlie men, and wrate hereof, as God had inspired them, &amp; as others before them had done. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Quid</hi>

               <p>He that is an Vsurer, wisheth that al others may lacke and come to him and borow of him: that al others may lose, so that he may haue gaine.

                  <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Prophet setteth downe the <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> wrath of God against Vsurers, <hi>He that hath giuen foorth his money vpon Vsurie, or hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken increase, shal he liue? he shal not liue</hi> saith the Lorde.

Therefore when he reckoneth the offences of <hi>Ierufalem,</hi> and declareth the heauie plagues that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared against that wicked Citie, he saith, <hi>Thou</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>hast taken Vsurie and encrease, and thou hast defrauded thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me sayeth the Lorde God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde therefore I haue smitten mine handes vpon the couetousnesse, that thou hast vsed.</hi> Thou hast doone iniurie to my people, that thou mightest make thine owne gaine. Thy wrongs and oppressions doone by Vsurie rise vp into heauen, therefore I wil gather thée, and blow the fire of my wrath vpon thée, sayth the Lorde.</p>

Thus hath GOD spoken, euen the Lorde of heauen and earth, which can scatter thy gold in the winde, and blowe it to nothing. Thus hee speaketh to thée, that hearest, and readest his worde, which knowest that his wil is, thou shouldest not lende thy money to Vsurie. Thou doest oppresse (saith he.) Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? thy brother for whome Christ vouchsafed to shed his bloude. And what brother? him that was poore, which came to thée for néede, to séeke thy helpe. Howe? wickedly, closely, falsely, craftily, deceitefully, like an hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, vnder colour to doe him good. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? with thy money, thy gold, and siluer, which God hath giuen thée to relieue the poore and néedie withal.</p>
               <p>God hath saide, thou shalt not take Vsurie, and what art thou that despisest the voyce of the Lorde? whose words wilt thou heare, that wilt not heare the words of God? remember the wordes, you can not forget them. Thou shalt not take Vsurie of thy brother, he is poore and fallen in decay: thou shalt not be an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto him: thou shalt not oppresse him with vsurie. For it is crueltie, and abhomination in the sight of God: therefore wil God powre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of Christ, and of God, but shal be cast into the vtward darkenesse.</p>
               <p>But some wil say, al kindes of Vsurie are not forbidden. There may bee cases where Vsurie may stande with reason and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. And herein they say so much as by witte may bee deuised, to paint out a foule, and vglie Idol, and to shadowe themselues in manifest and open wickednesse. What so euer God saieth, yet this or this kinde of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, say they, which is doone in this or this sort, is not forbidden. It profiteth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, it relieueth great numbers. The poore should otherwise perish, no man woulde lende them.</p>
               <p>By like good reason, there are some that defende theft, and murther, they say, there may be some case, where it is laweful to kil or to steale: for God willed the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to rob the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to kil his owne sonne <hi>Isaac.</hi> In these cases their robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and the killing of his sonne were laweful. So say they. Euen so by like reason doe some of our Countreymen maintaine Concubines, Curtizans, and Brothel houses, and stand in defence of open Stewes. They are (say they) for the benefite of the Countrey: they kéepe men from more daungerous inconuenience: take them away, it wil be worse. Although

               <p>But <hi>Samuel</hi> saide, hath the Lorde as great pleasure in burnt offeringes and sacrifices, as when the voice of the Lorde is obeyed? behold, to obey is better than sacrifice. And to disobey his holie will, is to renounce and forsake him.</p>
               <p>So may we say to the Vsurer. Thou hast deuised cases, and colours to hide thy shame, but what regarde hath God to thy cases? what careth he for thy reasons? the Lorde woulde haue more pleasure, if when thou hearest his voice thou wouldest obey him. For what is thy deuise against the counsel, and ordinaunce of God? What bolde presumption is it for a mortal man to control the commaundements of the immortal GOD, and to weigh his heauenly wisedome in the balaunce of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine foolishnesse? When GOD sayeth, thou shalt not take vsurie, what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD art thou, whiche canst take Vsurie? When GOD maketh it unlaweful, what art thou, oh man, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, It is laweful? This is a token of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate

               <p>Wilfulnesse, and presumption, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that such men are impudent, and past shame. Hee that offendeth of simplicitie, maie finde mercie. But they whiche of pride and boldenesse goe against the knowen trueth, and doe that thing which they knowe to bee ill, and deuise shiftes to colour that, which all reason, and learning, of God, and men, and nature it selfe haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they are fallen into temptation and snares; and into foolish lustes which drowne them in destruction.</p>
               <p>GOD is the Lorde. We are but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes: hée hath made vs, and not we our selues: wee are but as claie in his handes: wee can not repeale the lawe that God hath established: wée must obey it. We may not do the thinges that séeme good in our owne eyes, they may deceiue vs: but we must doe whatsoeuer GOD biddeth vs to doe, and forsake to doe those thinges which hée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.</p>
               <p>Thus much for an entrie to those, which

May a man take his owne dagger, and therewith committe murther? or may a man take of his owne fire, and therewith burne his neighbours house? Hée that sayde, <hi>Thou shalt not kil,</hi> hath also sayde, <hi>Thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not commit Vsurie: thou shalt not defrande thy brother in bargay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Hée is not vnrighteous, that he wil iudge the murtherer, and will not condemne the Vsurer. In that day the Vsurer shall knowe, whose money it was, wherewith he defrauded his brother. His money shal not helpe him, he shall haue no shift to conueigh himselfe from the wrath of God: he and his

               <p>But the Nsurer will saie. The poore man came to me, I was not in haste to séeke him. Hée <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ued his case to mée. I tooke pitie of him, and lent him money. Since then hée and al his haue béene the better. Here you shal see the great kindnesse and pitifull heart of this rich Usurer. He draweth his purse, giueth out his goods, and helpeth the poore, and the poore is much eased by him. But alas what help is this? euen such as he findeth, that in the middest of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>it of an ague drinketh a greate draught of cold water. No doubt he is refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and cooled, and for that present time much the better. But after a while when his heaues renewe the heate encreaseth: his heart pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, his pulse beateth, his mouth is drie, his tongue burneth: he is more terribly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than euer before. So fareth it with him that borroweth money vpon vsurie. He looketh in his hand, and séeth somewhat. It is not his owne; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t is he refreshed therewith, and much eased. The yeare passeth, the daie of paiment draweth on, the creditour calleth for money: then, then the heates and fittes, and agonies beginne to growe.

Thus doeth the gentle vsurer helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the poore in time of his necessitie: as if a man woulde cure a sore finger by cutting off the arme: or as if he woulde cure the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe of the eie sight, by the pulling out the eies: or as if he woulde quench thirst by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing poison to drincke: or as if to saue one from drowning in a boisterous tempest, he woulde caste him ouer the boate into the sea.</p>
               <p>The Scorpion embraceth a man swéete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his legges, but in the meane while striketh him deadly with his taile. His face looketh amiably, his taile poisoneth. So an Usurer looketh faire, and giueth good wordes: but at the end he vndoeth.</p>

Euen so he that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon Vsurie, findeth himselfe wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amended, and reioiceth: but he is st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ng, and eaten vp and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by it. Most men confesse that this kind of vsurie is forbidden, because it relieueth not, but spoileth and consumeth. God take the liking of it out of all mennes heartes, then shall they be the better able, to iudge of the other sortes, which they yet thinke allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>What if one rich man lende money to another? What if a Marchant take money to vsurie of a Marchant, and both be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and both be gainers? Here is no sting, nor byting. What shall wée thinke of this? What if a théefe or a pirate take vsurie of a pirate or a théefe, and both be partakers of the gaine, and be both of them holpen? Lette no man mistike the comparison. For, as I said before, a pirate or a théefe is not so noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as an Vsurer. Here, saie you, hée
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25001:76"/>
that lendeth is a gainer, and he that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is a gainer. It doth good to both. If both be gainers, who is the looser? for vsurie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer passeth without working lesse. Take this as a rule, there is neuer Vsurie without losse.</p>
               <p>Here, I pray you to lend me your minds, and consider what I saie. A Marchant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp of his neighbour a hundred poundes, and must answere againe a hundred and ten poundes He bestoweth it al in corne, and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his hundred poundes, a hundred quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of corne. He sendeth it to the market, the people haue néede of it, and buie it. If he sold it for eight groats a bushel, he might make vp his hundred pounds, and be a gainer. But vnlesse he make vp a hundred and ten pounds to discharge his vsurie, he must néedes be a looser and vndone. But vndone he wil not be: he wil rather vndoe manie others. Therefore he sefteth price at thrée shillings the bushel, and and so maketh his money, and payeth the Vsurer, and saueth himselfe, and is no loser. Who then payeth the tenne poundes? who is the loser, anie man maie sée. The poore people which buie the corne, they finde it, and féele it in euerie morsell they eate. Thus, if the Marchant borrower be not hindered by the Vsurer: yet the people that buie his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25001:76"/>
wares are plagued. Thus it is no harde matter to finde, that howsoeuer Vsurie be vsed, it is alwaies daungerous, and beguileth the people, and is therefore the destruction and ouerthrowe of the common wealth.</p>
               <p>But, saith he, why shoulde I not make money to yéelde me gaines, as well as my wares? I lende my shoppe for a yeare, or two, or thrée, so manie péeces of Veluet, Sattins, Taffata, Grograine, Chamblet, Hollandes, &amp;c. And for the vse he shall paie me by the yeare fortie poundes, and in the ende restore me my shoppe, so manie péeces of Veluet, &amp;c. so long, so broade, of the same making, so good, so fine as were the other. This saieth he is lawfull, therefore the other is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>No, no, this is not lawfull. It is not lawfull so to sette out thy shoppe. It is V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, it is forbidden. But he that taketh the shoppe shall be a gainer: who shall be the loser then? they that buie the wares must néedes buie at the dearer price. Wée maie not allowe one ill thing by the allowance of another. He should rather saie, Vsurie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vppon wares, is not lawfull, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Vsurie for bare money is lesse lawfull.

This maie be done, it is no Vsurie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? It is a plaine gift with a condition. The principal is gone from me for euer: I haue no right vnto it, it is none of mine.

               <p>Againe, I lende my neighbour twentie poundes vntill a daie. He hath it fréely, and friendly without any vsurie. Yet I say to him,

I praie you be carefull for it. The daie commeth, my neighbour commeth not: I lacke my money, and because I lacke it, I loose fiue poundes. He commeth afterward and offereth me mine owne mony.

               <p>A poore Orphane left in his Cradle hath a hundred poundes stocke. This stocke may be put out to Vsurie. And the Vsurie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. This is a déede of charitie, it is no Vsurie, as shall appeare. For, if the hundred poundes should lie still without enerease, and be bestowed from yeare to yeare to the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if the stocke be put to occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and into an honest mans handes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will grow to the reliefe of the Orphane, and yet his stocke remaine whole. This is charitie to reléeue the infant, that can not relieue himselfe. The like is, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:25001:78"/>
occupie for him, and to doe with his stocke, as it were his owne, only to maintaine him with the encrease therof. This is not Vsurie. Why? because hee that taketh the stocke of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or of the mad man, or of the diseased marchant, is not bound to answere al aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and casualties that happen. As, if to like vse I take a stocke in cattaile, &amp; they die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my default: or a stocke in money or wares, and the wares be burnt by fire, or the money stollen without my default, I am not bounde to answere the principal: therefore it is no V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</p>
               <p>But he that taketh money to Vsurie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gaine or loose, or whatsoeuer happen vnto him, he must answere the whole stock he borrowed. And this is it that vndoeth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and maketh them banquerupts. But this happeneth not in this case. He that occupieth the Orphanes money or stocke, is charged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vse it as his owne, and no otherwise. If it perish, or decay, or miscarie without his fault, he is not bound to answere it. Therefore, as I saide, it is no Vsurie.</p>
               <p>Yet say they further for defence of Vsurie. It is suffred in other countries, in <hi>France, Spaine, Italie, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. the lawes permit it. And what lawe doth suffer it? I trowe, not the law or God, for that lawe straitly forbiddeth it.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25001:79"/>
But what speake I of the lawe of God? the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile lawe condemneth Vsurie, the canon lawe condemneth it, the temporal lawe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, and the lawe of nature condemneth it. And howe is that sufferable by anie lawe, that by so many Lawes is condemned? or how is he worthy to liue among men, that despiseth the authoritie of so many lawes? or what will you iudge of that man, that wil bee tempered and ordered by no law? neither by ciuile, nor by canon, nor by temporal, nor by lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor by lawe of men, nor by lawe of God. I say not, howe may wee thinke him to be a man of GOD? But, howe may wée thinke such a one to bée a man? for it is the part and duetie of a man to bée ruled by lawe and reason.</p>
               <p>But it is euerie where, and therefore to be suffered. Too true that it is common euerie where. Woulde God it were false. It vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth al the world. So the Diuel is euery where, and suffered: so are the Stewes suffered in <hi>Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, Lombardie, Naples, Venice,</hi> and in <hi>Rome. Rome</hi> is called the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Citie, the most holie hath his seate there, and yet suffreth he the stewes in <hi>Rome.</hi> So were the <hi>Canaanites</hi> among the people of God and suffered. But they were as goades in their sides, and as thornes in their eyes. As these
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25001:79"/>
were suffered, and as the Stewes are suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and as the Diuel is suffered: so and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise are Vsurers. Such good, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe they. For they are the children of the Diuel: their houses bée the shoppes, wherein the Diuel doth his worke of mischiefe. They be <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and enemies of Gods people. They bee goades in our sides, and sharpe thornes, and prickles in our eyes. God graunt that the lawe may espie them: and the people abhorre them: and they may repent and loath their wickednesse.</p>
               <p>Some other are bolde to take authoritie for Vsurie from Christ himselfe. He sayeth, <hi>The kingdome of Heauen, is as a man that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>into a straunge countrey, called his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and deliuered to them his goods, &amp; vnto one he gaue fiue talents, and to an other two, and to an other one. And sayde vnto them, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie vntil I come.</hi> The first did so, the seconde accordingly. They encreased his stocke, &amp; are commended for their Vsurie. The third wrapt his talent in a Napkin, and kept it together. His maister returned, and chid him and sayde. <hi>Wherefore gauest not thou my money into the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
                  <hi>banke, that at my comming I might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it with vauntage?</hi> Therefore Vsurie is allowed by the mouth of Christ. The two first are commended, not for any thing else,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:25001:80"/>
but for the gaine they made by Vsurie. The third is rated and rebuked, not for theft, nor adultery, but because he layd not out his stocke to Vsurie.</p>
               <p>What? and is Vsurie allowed? and allowed by the witnesse of Christ? howe can that bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for Christ, as we hearde before doeth plainely forbid it. How is it then? what is the meaning of this parable? This it is. When Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his gospel vnto his Disciples: he gaue them charge to be diligent, &amp; to multiply, and encrease the number of them that shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue. To this purpose he sayeth, be as careful in this businesse for the glorie of GOD, and the saluation of your brethren, as worldly wise men shew themselues in séeking wicked <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Beholde the Vsurers, they occupie their stocke, and make it growe, &amp; so of fiue pounds make tenne, and of ten make twenty pounds, and so they become rich. So deale you in the giftes, and knowledge, that God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you, giue them to the exchaungers, put them out to Vsurie, encrease the Lords stocke. If they be diligent and faithful in the thinges of this world, how much more ought you to be so, in heauenly thinges?</p>
               <p>This therefore is the meaning. Couetous men, and the children of this world be wise in their generation. You are the children of light,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25001:80"/>
be you also wise, and doe you so likewise in your office and seruice, as you sée them doe. So he sayth, <hi>Beholde the foules of Heauen, learne</hi>

                  <hi>how the Lilies of the fielde growe.</hi> What of this? the Lilies are but grasse: the Foules of the ayre are but Birdes.

So doeth Christ speake this parable of the Vsurer, that as he is diligent in doing il, so we should be painful and readie to do wel.</p>
               <p>But shal Vsurie therefore be lawefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ draweth a comparison, or maketh an example by an Vsurer? if it were so, wée should doe many thinges otherwise than wel.

and dead faith, in which they can doe no good, can not serue them. Euen so shal not your faith if it be dead, and voyde of al good workes, saue you.

As God did wil the Israelites to take example of the Ido, laters: And as Christ biddeth take example of the false steward, and as <hi>Iames</hi> of the Diuels: so is this parable an example of that which is commendable: that is, the diligence of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes: Vsurie is no more allowed by this, than idolatrie and falshoode and the diuel is by the other. Some wil say, I haue no trade to liue, I must néedes giue my money to Vsurie, or else I must begge. This is it that I spake of. This sheweth that despaire and mistrust in the prouidence of God, is the mother of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie. If this were cause why he should be an

So if euery man in the Church of God, séeke to do that to them belongeth, the Church shal florish, and be in quiet.

               <p>Herein standeth the comfort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion.

When Christ appointed his Disciples to goe and preach, hée sayde, <hi>I sende you as sheepe in the middest of wolues,</hi> They will scourge you, you shall bée hated of al men. As the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel

encreased in any place, these words were fulfilled. The godly were put to death for the name of Christ.

Oh saide they, he was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende sage father: oh he was a wise young man, learned, zealous, and a great stay in the Church. Why would God take him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time? there is not nowe any one left, whom we may beholde, or heare, or followe. We are left comfortlesse, and without hope. After this sort it is likely the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> mourned, when they behelde the persecution of the Church of God among them.

But when he hearde that <hi>Ioseph</hi> liued, and did sée him with his eyes: when he did sée that he was a Prince, next in place to the King, and had al the Countrey at commaundement: then hée knewe he had mourned without a cause.

Paul</hi> sayth, God haue mercie vppon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus,</hi> (he was sicke, verie néere vnto death) and not on him onely, but on me also, least I shoulde haue sorrowe vpon sorrowe. If God had taken <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> out of life,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25001:90"/>
no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> would haue sorrowed. What néede more examples? Christ mourned for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> and shed teares for him. <hi>Then saide the</hi>

                  <hi>Iewes, behold he loued him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wée are not therefore forbidden to mourne ouer the dead: but to mourne in such sorte as the heathen did, we are forbidden. They, as they did neither beléeue in God, nor in Christ, so had they no hope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life to come. When a father saw his sonne dead he thought he had beene dead for euer. He became hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, changed his garment, delighted in no companie, forsooke his meate, famished him selfe, rent his bodie, cursed his fortune, cried out of his Gods. Oh my deare sonne, (saith he) how beautifull, how learned, and wise, and vertuous wast thou? why shouldst thou die so vntimely? why haue I offered sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and done seruice to my Gods? they haue made me a good recompence. I wil trust them no more, I wil no more call vpon them. Thus they fel into dispaire, and spake blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
               <p>Therefore, saith <hi>Paul</hi> you may mourne, as did the holie men of GOD: but in such sorte as the vnfaithfull sorrowe for their dead, you maie not mourne. You are the sonnes of the holie fathers: fashion not your selues therefore like to the heathens, do not as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25001:91"/>
they did, neither in feastes, nor in marriages, nor in your attire, nor in your mourning, nor in your pastimes. But behaue your selues as becommeth the children of the most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
               <p>But why may not Christians mourne, and continue in heauinesse? because it is no newe thing, for a man to die: because he goeth the waie of al flesh. Againe, they that departe this life, are not dead, they are not gone for euer, as the heathen imagined. They are laid down to take rest quietly for a time. The deth of a godlie man is nothing else, but a sléepe. So saith our sauiour of <hi>Lazarus, Our friend</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Lazarus sleepeth: howbeit Iesus spake of his death.</hi> So it is saide of <hi>Steuen. And they sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Steuen, who called on God, and saide, Lord Iesus receiue my spirite. And hee kneeled downe, and cried with a loud voice, Lord laie not this sinne to their charge, and when he had thus spoken, he slept.</hi> Whosoeuer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the peace of conscience, he may saie, I will lie downe and take my rest. Thus doeth the man of God repose himselfe. For Christ is vnto him both in life, and in death aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. He saith with the Apostle, <hi>Whether we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>liue, wee liue vnto the Lord, or whether wee die, we die vnto the Lord: whether wee liue therefore or die, we are the Lords.</hi> He goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:25001:91"/>
his graue, as into a bed: he forsaketh this life, as if he lay downe to sléepe: he shall shake off his sléepe, rouse himselfe, and rise againe. As we wake out of sléepe, we know not howe: so shall we rise againe, though we knowe not how. As we are much refreshed, and our bodies strengthened by sléepe: so shal we rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in much more strength, and our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shal put on incorruption, and our morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, immortalitie. So often then as we goe to our beddes, lette vs thinke of our resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from death. Who is sorie to goe into his bedde? what father lamenteth to sée his childe lie quietly, and take his reste? why then shoulde he so mourne for his death? wherein GOD dealeth mercifully with him, and doth translate him to the glorie of the sonnes of God, where is no death, nor feare: but we shal be made like to the Angels of God.</p>
               <p>The bodie rotteth in the grounde: yet God preserueth it, that it shal not perish. His spirite shall returne to it againe, and it shal liue. God is able to bring this to passe. He hath promised so to do. He hath done it alreadie, and wil doe it againe. <hi>When Christ came neare</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk: 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to the gate of the Citie of Naim, there was a dead man carried out, the only begotten sonne of his mother, which was a widow, and much</hi>

people of the Citie was with hir, and when the Lord saw hir, hee had compassion on hir, and saide vnto hir, weepe not. And hee went and touched the coffin, and they that bare it stoode still, and he saide, I saie vnto thee, yong man, arise. And he that was dead sate vp, and beganne to speake, and hee deliuered him to his mother. Lazarus <hi>was laide in his graue, he had béene foure daies dead, his bodie did stincke,</hi> Yet when Christ cried with a loud <note place="margin">Iohn 11.</note> voice, Lazarus come foorth: then he that was dead, came foorth bound hand and foote with bandes, and his face was bound with a napkin. Iesus saide vnto them, loose him, and let him goe. Saint Mathew <hi>saith,</hi> The graues <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> did open them selues, and manie bodies of the Saints which slept, arose, and came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holie Citie, and appeared vnto manie. <hi>These fewe stories witnesse vnto vs the rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of our bodies vnto life.

               <p>Who considereth not the swallowes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birdes? they sléepe al the winter long. But when the spring commeth, they come to life againe, and are séene abroad. What crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

so little, so vile, and so little worth, as the stie? Yet by those so base, and contemptible things, doth God teach vs to know our selues and our estate. The greatest part of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are as dead. They créepe into chinks and corners, as into their graue, and lie there without life, without féeling. Prooue it who list, he shall sée it so. The bodie is dead, the wings moulted. Yet the verie same flie so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and so vile shall be refrozed againe at the spring, and shall liue in the warme weather, and haue the same wings, and the same féete, and the same bodie. If we be hard of beléefe, to giue credite to the word of God, these are manifest proofes to teach vs the resurrection of our bodies.

This is my hope laide vp in my bosome. <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>willeth</hi> Timothie <hi>neuer to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this doctrine,</hi> Remember that Iesus <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>This is an article of our faith.

               <p>Therefore let not your heartes be dull through vnbeliefe. As God was able to saue the bodies of his seruantes, that they were not hurt in the fire, as he was able to kéepe <hi>Ionas</hi> safe, in the whales bellie: so can he

The Judges sitte on high, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with noble men, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, attended on with Constables, and bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifes, and the state &amp; presence of the countrey: the théefe is brought foorth piniond, and bound in chaines and fetters. The poore wretch stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in great feare: his conscience accuseth him, and sayth, thou didst steale, thou art worthie to die. The boyce of the Judge is as a blast of thunder: the face of the Judge terrible to him, as hel fire. But the innocent that is wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprisoned, and hath not offended, he séeth himselfe cleare, his conscience ercuseth him, and therefore reioyceth at the comming of the Judges. He thought it long before they came. These, saith he, wil strike off my shackles, and set me at libertie. Their voice vnto him, is as the voyce of life: he beholdeth them, and they are as the angels of God.</p>
               <p>Such shal bee the shewe and sight of the sonne of GOD, he shal come downe with maiestie from heauen: the Trumpet of God shal sounde, and be hearde from the one ende of the heauen, to the other: and whosoeuer shal
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25001:97"/>
heare it, shal quake for feare. Then shal he be the iudge ouer al flesh. Then be shal shew him selfe to be King of Kings, and Lorde of Lords. Then shal he not come in humilitie, méeke nesse, and mercy: but with dread and terrour of iudgement, and iustice. Not with twelue poore Apostles: but with twelue thousande Angels to attende vpon him. Not in the preaching of the Gospel, &amp; calling sinners to repentance: but in the sounde of a Trumpet, wherewith al the corners of the earth shal be amazed. Then shal he not say, come vnto mee al ye that trauaile, and be loaden, and I wil refresh you: I am sent to the lost Shéepe of Israel. He shal not say, Father forgiue them, for they knowe not what they do. But, you haue béene ashamed of me, and of my worde, before men: therefore now wil I be ashamed of you before my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father.</p>
               <p>Then shal they that despired y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, know what they despised: and the blasphemers shal reape the fruit of their blasphemie. Then the carelesse Sheaphearde which hath not fed the Lords shéepe, but neglected them, and left them at al aduentures: which hath betrayed his flocke, and giuen them to bee a praie vnto the Woolfe: shal receiue a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for his treason. Then the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, oppressour, and Vsnrer, shal haue their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:25001:98"/>
life layde open before them. Then shal euerie eye sée him. <hi>They shal see him, whome they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>pearced through:</hi> they shal sée his woundes, which they did not regarde. They shal sée his Sworde readie drawen to slaie all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and shal fal downe for feare of him that sitteth vpon the throne, and of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>But the harts of the righteous shal reioyce. They shal lift vp their heades, and sée him in whome they haue trusted. Then they shal say, this is the day which the Lorde hath made, let vs reioice and be glad in it. Come, let vs reioice vnto the Lord: let vs come before his face with praise: lette vs sing lowde vnto him with Psalmes. Such shal be the state and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and honour, and maiestie of our God, when he shal come downe from heauen for our deliueraunce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the dead in Christ shal rise, first.</hi> The earth shal open &amp; yéelde foorth her dead bodies: that so they may be ready with vs that remain, to go before the presence of our iudge. <hi>Which are dead in Christ.</hi> Who are they? They whom he chose out of this world: and which haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen God for their portion: whome God hath sealed vnto the day of redemption. Which haue saide, Christ is to me both in life, &amp; death, aduantage. And, I liue, not I now, but Christ liueth in me. And againe, whether we liue or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:25001:98"/>

               <p>They are dead in Christ which commend them selues wholie vnto him, and say, O Lord in thée haue I trusted, let mée neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. I desire to be losed, and to be with Christ. Into thy handes, O Lord, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my spirite, thou hast redéemed mée, O Lord of truth. To be shorte, whosoeuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the Lord, he dieth in the Lord. He in whom Christ liueth, which hath a tast and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christ in his heart: he that reioiceth in Christ, and looketh for that blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the mightie God, and of our sauiour Jesus Christ: he is a shéepe of his pasture, he is a member of his bodie, he is the apple of his eie: he liueth and dieth in Christ. Blessed is he that so liueth and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for he shall rise with Christ in the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the righteous, and shal haue his part in the land of the liuing.</p>
               <p>V. 17. Then shal we which liue and remaine, be caught vp with them also in the cloudes, to meete the Lord in the aire: and so shal wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be with the Lord.</p>

We which shall sée al these things, shal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be caught vp our selues. But here you must note, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not this of his owne person, and of them that liued in his time, as if they should continue aliue vntil the ende: or that the world should haue an ende, before they should die: but he sheweth what shal be the state of such, whosoeuer shal then remaine aliue. And againe, marke, that he saith not, we which liue and remaine, shall die soorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or, our bodies shall be turned into dust, and so our soules alone go to méete the Lorde: but, whether we be standing or sitting: doing well, or ill occupied. <hi>Wee shall be caught vp.</hi> For the Trumpet shall sodainely blow, and then the dead shall rise, and we shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

Then shall they eate of the trée of life, which is in the middest of the paradise of GOD. They shal hunger no more, nor thirst any more, neither shal the sunne light on them, nor anie heate. God shal wipe away al teares from their eies. Then shal they féele those ioies, which eie hath not séene, nor eare hath heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man. Such an end shal they haue, whosoeuer feare the Lord.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I néede not write of times and seasons, in which these things shall be done. Your selues haue béene taught the word of God, you haue learned what his wil is: you know the day of the Lord shal come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as a théefe. And how commeth a théefe? not in the day time, not when a man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany about him, not when he is watched: but in the night, in the darkenesse, when al light is out, when the good man of the house taketh his rest, when the seruants are asléepe. Euen so when the light of the truth is taken away, when the hart of the goodman of the house is at rest, and his eies are darkened, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sée: and al his senses drowned in worldlie

               <p>Marke that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, yée haue no néede that I write vnto you of times and seasons: &amp; that our sauior saith, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons. What may we think then of them that write bookes &amp; almanackes, and say, such a yeare, and at such a time, Christ shal come, and with these spéeches fray and mocke the world? <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apostle of Christ, an elect vessel of the holie ghost, he said, I haue no néed to write of it, you cannot know it. What néede is there nowe that such bookes and pamphlets should be written? why should the world be troubled with such vanities?</p>
               <p>Spare me your patience, and giue me leaue a little to deale with these wisards. Tell mee, thou that doest measure and beholde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of heauen, and markest the coniunoions, and oppositions, and aspects of the starres: and by that wisedome canst foretel the things that shalbe done hereafter: where learnest thou this skil? how commest thou by this déepe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? <hi>Paul</hi> was taken vp into the third héaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; heard words which cannot be spoken, which

are not lawful for man to vtter: yet he knew not this secret, nor might not know it. What art thou then? art thou greater than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Christ? hast thou béene taken vp into some place higher than the third heauen? hast thou heard such words, as are not lawfull to vtter? if it be so, why doest thou vtter them? wilt thou take that vpon thée which the holie Apostle dareth not? arte thou of Gods priuie counsel? the angels and archangels know not hereof: and shal we thinke that thou knowest it?

               <p>And what is that which thou boastest? the knowledge of that terrible daie, when all flesh shall appeare before the Judge. Euen of that time, which God hath put in his owne power. O vaine man, thou knowest not thine owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Albumazar</hi> or <hi>Haly.</hi> What is <hi>Manilius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus, Albumazar</hi> and <hi>Haly?</hi> What are they but Heathens, Painims, and Jnsidels? Were they not voide of all knowledge of God? were they not the enimies of the crosse of Christ? these neuer beléeued in God, howe could they then know that day, when he would iudge the world? Let thy common reason reforme thée. Can <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> knowe this, when the Angels of God cannot knowe it?</p>
               <p>To what end write they thus? to giue a token of their knowledge? nay, hereby they proclaime and publish their sollie and want of knowledge. These two hundred yeares, there haue euer béene some, which haue aduentured to tell such newes, and to saie, in this yeare or that yeare, you shal haue doomes daie. Such a daie will Christ come to iudgement, and the world shall haue an end. They haue appointed many such yeares, and daies, and houres. The yeares be gone, the daies be past, &amp; the houres be slipt away, but the world abideth, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth witnesse of their follie.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of these men is good. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they moue the people to repentance. For, when men thinke the ende of the world is at hand, they wil beare the lesse affection of the things of this world. This is not the waie to teach repentance, and amendment of life. The
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:25001:102"/>
people may not be taught by lies &amp; fables. If this had béen good for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God himselfe would haue vsed it. God graunt them grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which thus presume of knowledge, and reach so high and yet know nothing.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet reason further with them. How haue they this knowledge? of certaintie, or by coniecture? if of certaintie, then it must néedes be so, it cannot faile, nothing can let it. But you wil say, it is a coniecture, it may so bée: and it is likely, for such a day, shal be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in a fierie house: and therefore al things shal be consumed with fire. Alas, what hath <hi>Saturne</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> to doe with the day of the Lorde? They are but crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are no Goddes. They are starres made to giue vs light, why should they leade vs into darkenesse? in the day of the Lorde they shal be melted and perish with fire. Why then trouble they the worlde with such vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and set those thinges downe for trueth, whereof they haue no certaintie, but onely a gesse and coniecture?</p>
               <p>And what time chose they to cast abroade these newes? the same, in which the Gospel through the mercie of God, is wel knowen of most men. Euen nowe tel they these tales, when all men knowe, that Christ sayeth, the Angels in heauen knowe not of that day
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:25001:103"/>
and houre. The Angelles beholde the face of God, and stand in his presence, yet know they not the day of the Lorde. This is a secret, which God reuealeth not vnto any.</p>
               <p>Children can reprooue this follie in them, and say, <hi>Mitte arcana dei, caelúmque inquirere quid sit, Seeke not to knowe the secretes of God, nor what manner thing the heauen is.</hi> Know thy self, that thou art but a mortal man crawling on the grounde like a worme. Hée that wil stare vpon the sunne, may be blinde and loose his eyes. God hath giuen thée know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in measure: thou canst not knowe, as much as thou wouldest. Knowe that is fit for thée to knowe, and speake that is laweful to be spoken. Thinke of the commaundementes of God, to followe them. Search not into his workes, to be curious in them. For he that is curious in searching the maiestie of God, shal be oppressed and confounded by his glorie.</p>
               <p>Thus much we may wel knowe, that the Lorde wil come, that al fleshe shal appeare before him: that the worlde, the heauen, the earth, the sunne, and the moone shal haue an ende: that the day of the Lorde shall come so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, as a Théefe in the night. This war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning GOD hath giuen vs, that we shoulde not be taken vnwares, but that wee repent, and stande in readinesse, and watch, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:25001:103"/>
pray, that wee may bee caught vp into the cloudes to méete our redéemer.</p>
               <p>V. 4. But you brethren, are not in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that that day shoulde come on you, as it were a theese.</p>
               <p>5 Yee are al the children of light, and the children of the day, wee are not of the night, neither of darkenesse.</p>
               <p>6 Therefore let vs not sleepe as doe other: but let vs watch and be sober.</p>
               <p>7 For they that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night.</p>
               <p>8 But let vs, which are of the day, be sober, putting on the breaste-plate of Faith and Loue, and the hope of saluation for an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</p>
               <p>9 For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine saluation by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>10 Which dyed for vs, that whether wee wake or sleepe, wee should liue togither with him.</p>
               <p>Your conuersation is in heauen, from whence you looke for the sauiour, euen the Lorde Iesus Christ. Ye were once darkenesse, but nowe you are light in the Lorde, walke as children of light, approouing that which is pleasing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. That day shal be dreadful,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:25001:104"/>
and come sodainely vpon the wicked: but to you it shal not séeme sodaine, which feare the Lorde, and put your trust in him, and take al care to be in readines at his comming. Arme your selues strongly: the enemie séeketh to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe you. Your enemie is the Deuill with al his force. Your strength standeth not in your owne prowes, or manhoode, but in the mightie power of God: put on therefore the breast-plate of faith and loue, he that belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth shal be saued, he that abydeth in loue, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in God, &amp; whosoeuer putteth his trust in him, shal not be confounded.</p>
               <p>Here I may take occasion to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the troubles of warre, howe Sathan séeketh by it to disquiet the Church of God. Who hath not hearde what force is this day raised in this realme? who hath not hearde of it? but let it not trouble you. God wil turne al to his glory. I loue not to speak of such things. Yet somewhat I must speake thereof, the time enforceth me.</p>
               <p>This is the first disturbance and breach of that blessed peace in which God hath so long and so quietly preserued this realme since the time that hir Maiestie came to the Crowne. It giueth great occasion to the enemie, to breake in vppon vs: it is the spoyling of our Countrey. The barbarous souldiours rush

But Christians ought to be thankful in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in thraldome, in aduersitie, in shame, in miserie, and in death it selfe.

In al these thinges God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vs, and sayth, I haue giuen them thée, thou hast them at my handes: vse them well, and be not vnthankful.</p>
               <p>If I would stande herein, and declare what rauses we haue to giue thankes vnto God, I shoulde neuer make an ende.

In this worlde, as there is a <hi>Iacob,</hi> so is there an <hi>Esau:</hi> as there are manie that loue Christ with an vnfained hart, so are there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that serue Antichrist: and as there be many true professors of the trueth of God, so are there manie despisers of the same. This wée maie sée here at home within this realme. We maie sée it, and mourne and lament for it in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Their practises are opened: they haue broken out into open rebellion, to the breach of the peace both of GOD and man. They saie with their lippes, GOD saue Quéene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> yet they holde vppe their sword against her. Alas, what hath she deserued at their handes? she hath alwaies dealt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, without crueltie, without shedding of bloud. God preserue her that she maie long raigne ouer vs, and bring al her enimies to confusion.</p>
               <p>What pretence make they for this their doing, that hereby they séeke to haue religion refourmed? Thankes be to GOD: religion is refourmed farre better than our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knewe it these many hundred yeares.

But they would haue the Masse. What find they or sée they in it, wherfore they should so desire it? Trie things saith <hi>Paul.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine and trie the masse. What do we learne by it? what doctrine, what godlinesse in life, what comforte for saluation? It is a dumb and deadly seruice. The people are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be at it, it is the verie kay of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: the people are bound to be present at masse: yet they neither receiue anie thing, nor eate, nor heare, nor vnderstand anie thing. You are wise, you haue reason, you are the children of GOD: be you iudges herein, and iudge vprightly, for it is Gods cause. Will they call this the Lordes supper? Is this the sacrament of our redemption? Is this that which <hi>Paule</hi> receiued of the Lord, and deliuered vnto the Church? Is this the shewing foorth of the Lordes death vntill hée come?</p>
               <p>They woulde haue the Popes auctoritie restored.

God is the God, and giuer of peace. Whence then commeth diuision &amp; dissention of mindes? What is the cause that the whole worlde is so shaken with sectes and troubles?

It reuealeth things that were hidden, it discloseth the couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those, who kept the people in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, to make gaine and marchaundise of their soules: it ouerthroweth mightie buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges and holdes of Merites, of pardons, of Masses, of Purgatorie, which by the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and wisedome, and power of this worlde

were exalted against God. This is the onelie cause of al this strife and trouble.</p>
               <p>We haue néede of peace, of the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science within our selues: of peace, from the rage and furie of the world: and of peace and loue among those that are of Gods honsholde. Let vs séeke peace at the handes of God, and he wil stablish vs in the peace of his gospel, and so giue vs the rest and peace of our soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanctifie you throughout.</hi> The God of peace, blesse you, &amp; kéep you vnoer the shadow of his wings, that your whole spirit, and soule, and bodie, maie be kept blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. Here marke, that the Apostle diuideth man into thrée partes, <hi>The spirite, the soule, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> So that hée séemeth to make the spirit one thing, and the soule an other. Howe is it then that we diuide man into two parts, the soule and the bodie, and saie that he doth stand but of two parts? There is no difference, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is al one. For <hi>Paul</hi> diuideth the soule into two parts. The first is reason and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which he calleth the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The other is, will &amp; affection, which he calleth the <hi>Soule.</hi> For as God hath giuen vs reason to sée what is good: so hath he giuen vs wil to séeke after that which is good. Reason hath eies: Wil is blinde, and cannot sée the waie. Therefore wil
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:25001:123"/>
must be ledde and guided by Reason. Reason must go before. Wil must follow after. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reason is compared to the husband, and Wil to the wife. If Wil take in hand to rule Reason it is no lesse disorder, than if the wife will aduenture or take vppon her to rule her husband. Therefore in this place Reason, which is the principal part of our soule is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Spirit, and Will which is the other part, is called the Soule. So the spirit is not a seuerall substance, but the soule and the spirit are one soule, euen as the bodie and the fleshe are one bodie. Thus therefore <hi>Paule</hi> praieth for the Church, the God of peace sanctifie you throughout, that your spirit, your reason, and vnderstanding: your soule, your will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: your bodie and your flesh, may altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pure and holie: that they may be found innocent and vpright in the daie of the Lord.</p>

bands. He hath not lost one of al them, whome his father had giuen him. He knoweth his shéepe. None shalbe confounded that put their trust in him. There is no condemnation to them that be in Christ Iesus. He is faithfull, he will performe this vnto you, not for your merites, but for his owne name, and for his mercie sake. Bicause he is faithfull, he wil not despise the worke of his owne handes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Epistle, hée wrote somewhat touching the latter day and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and saide, that that daie shall come as a théefe in the night: and therefore arborted them to watch, and praie, and to prepare themselues to be in a readinesse.

The false Apostles did fondly and malitiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly mistake his wordes: and deuised meanes thereby to disquiet the mindes of the faithfull, and to trouble the Church of God. Thus could the Prince of darkenesse, the olde Serpent, and deceiuing spirite, turne the truth of God into occasion of slander. In the meane while the Apostle was farre off from them at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> But when he heard of their case, hée sent vnto them this other Epistle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hée declareth more plainely that matter which before séemed doubtfull, and séeketh to satisfie their hearts, and to remooue them from that errour, which they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>In discourse hereof, he taketh occasion to speake of Antichrist, of whome wée heare much, and haue had warning often. Hée tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that he shall come in working of signes, and wonders: that he is the man of sinne which shal thrust himselfe into the place of Christ. Hée sheweth who is Antichrist, and how we may know him, what things hée shall doe, what credite he shall haue in the worlde: and by what power hée shall be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and confounded. After this he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of idlenesse, and of bodily labour, and requireth euerie man to liue in the sweate of their browes, and in painefull trauel, as God

The whole matter of the epistle is so fit for these dayes in which we liue, as if it were purposely written for vs. For we liue in the later age of the worlde: and it cannot be but the end of al thinges is at hande, and that the glorious appearing of our Lorde shal b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Paule, and Syluanus, and Timotheus.</hi> This Epistle was sent, not onely from <hi>Paule,</hi> but also from <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Syluanus.</hi> These thrée were al guided by one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Vnto the Church of the Thessalonians,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:25001:127"/>
                  <hi>which is in God our father &amp;c.</hi> You are (sayth he) the beloued of God, you are his people, and he hath assured his mercie vnto you: you haue the promise, and the earnest of the life to come. Here let vs marke the state of that countrie, as it was then, and compare it with it selfe as it is now. Then it was the church of God: for otherwise <hi>S. Paule</hi> would not so haue called it, according to the grace of God giuen vnto him he layde the foundation, he planted and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their hearts, and God gaue the increase. So that they receiued the worde in much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tion: and the worde of the Gospel sounded from them not only in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Achaia,</hi> but their faith towardes God was spread also abroade in al quarters. In such sort were they a Vessel sanoified vnto honour, ful of blessing, and ful of the mercie, and grace of God.</p>
               <p>But what is become of that countrey? In what case standeth the church of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> at this day? It is now the Sinagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, vnder the tyrannie of the Turke, and such as are enemies of the crosse of Christ. Such a change hath the right hande of the Lord wrought in that place, which hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times béene his holie Tabernacle. I thought good to marke this, that we might vnderstand how vaine a thing it is, to put confidence in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:25001:127"/>
or churches, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of our fathers.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> whose founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was surely built by <hi>S. Paule</hi> himselfe, for which he was so careful, vnto which he wrate special letters to commende their increase in godlinesse, and their stedfastnesse in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is forsaken, and laide wast. If the worke which the spirite of God wrought by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, be decayed, whose work may we thinke shal stande? <hi>Ieremie</hi> spake vnto the people of the Jewes, saying, <hi>Trust not in lying wordes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>saying, the Temple of the Lorde, the temple of the Lord, this is the temple of the Lord.</hi> That temple GOD himselfe commaunded to be built, the forme and fashion thereof God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe deuised, and appointed, therein he placed his Tabernacle, and sette vp his mercie seate, therein he shewed foorth his maiestie, and the glorie of his countenaunce. Yet, al this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, God saide by the prophet, trust not in these wordes, they be lying words, and wil deceiue you.</p>
               <p>As the Prophet spake of the temple at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> so may it be sayde of any other church throughout the worlde. So may it be saide of the Churche of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wée may say, trust not in lying wordes, saying, the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Say not thus with your selues, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:25001:128"/>
is built vpon a rocke so surely that it can not be moued, or that no winde can shake it: say not, the faith of that Church can neuer faile. These be lying wordes, trust not in them, for Christ neuer spake any such thing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It neuer had promise of more special priuiledge, than was giuen to the Church at <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> Reade the Scriptures, beholde the words of our Sauiour, and consider them, yen shal finde no spéech made of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any promise, nor péece of promise, wherein he bindeth himselfe more to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than he hath done to other churches, or to this of <hi>Thessalonica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thessalonica</hi> was beautiful in the sight of God, the Lorde of hostes had pitched his tentes rounde about her, the name of the most bolie was placed in the middest of her, shée enioyed like spirituall peace and prosperitie, as did the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of the almightie: she was as a Citie fenced within it selfe: but the Lord hath taken away the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce from her, shée hath forsaken the waies of righteousnesse, she hath left off to serue the Lorde, and is become the place which the Lorde hath forsaken: there is scarce anie rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant left there of those which call vppon the name of our saluation, and loue the Lorde Iesus with an vnfained heart. This is the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:25001:128"/>
Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. And is his hande shortned, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or is his zeale abated that he wil not, in like seueritie deale with such as forsake him? If he spared not the natural braunches, if <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> were ouerthrowne because of her ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, it cannot be that hee wil spare other places, that doe the like, but that they shal also be cut off. This is it that our Sauiour hath saide in the Gospel by <hi>S. Mathewe, Therefore say I vnto you, the kingdome of God shal be taken from you, and shal be giuen to a nation, which shal bring foorth the fruites thereof.</hi> Such terrible, &amp; dreadful examples hath God layde before our eyes, to kéepe vs in his feare, and in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>V. 2. Grace be with you, and peace, from GOD our Father, and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>This is the salutation of <hi>Paule,</hi> in al his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles: to say, I wish that the blessing, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and loue of God may light vppon you. But for the better consideration hereof, &amp; that we may know how earnestly we ought to pray vnto God for this grace and peace, which the Apostle wisheth to the Churches: let vs looke into our selues, and sée how miserable we are, if wee be left voyde of this grace, and if God take his holy spirite away from vs. By nature
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:25001:129"/>
what are we other, than the bonde slaues of sinne? We are not able to lift vp our eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, nor to beléeue in GOD, nor to praise him, nor to cal vppon his name. We are not sufficient of our selues to thinke anie thing as of our selues. Vnlesse hee open our lippes, wee cannot shewe foorth his prayse: Vnlesse hée heale our deafenesse, we cannot giue care to his worde: Vnlesse he giue vs vnderstanding heartes, wee cannot take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Apostle prayeth, that they may receiue such measure of Gods grace, as may quench in them the fierie dartes of the wicked, and enhable them to holde fast that worthie thing, that is committed vnto them, and may kéepe them holic and vndefiled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the glorious comming of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>

And that they would

heare them not onely in the Church, but also at home in their houses. They taught them, the hurt and daunger of ignoraunce, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the scriptures hath béene the cause of her esies, and that it hath brought in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, and of maners. This was the order and vsage of the Church in the time of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostles, and of our first fathers. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were guided by the worde of God, they were made partakers of the holie mysteries, and al thinges were done in the Church to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying.

May we say of <hi>Rome</hi> that it holdeth fast the forme and fashion of that church which Christ and his Apostles left vnto vs, and which the holy ancient fathers continued? nay, rather, we may say of them with <hi>Chrisostome:</hi> they may haue the chestes and cofers wherein the treasure was sometimes kept, but the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they haue not. We may say, it is not

               <p>
                  <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the Idols of the heathen, were not so dishonored of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, as the almightie and euerlasting, and onely true God is dishonoured in that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. I speake of it, as it is nowe, and as it hath béene these many yeares. For in the time of our elder fathers, it had great testimonie of true holinesse. <hi>Ignatius</hi> called it <hi>castissimam, most chaste. Tertullian</hi> saide, it was a happie Church, because the Apostles of Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red martyrdome in it, and left their whole doctrine vnto it. And in like sort did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giue vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was in those times reuerent and worthie commendation. But now, saith he, <hi>O Roma, à Roma, quantum mutata vetusta es? nunc caput es scelerum, quae caput orbis eras.

These be his words, <hi>Vtinam à religione ad superstitionem, &amp;c. Woulde God they were not gone wholie with generall consent, from religion to superstition: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith ro infidelitie: from Christ to Antichrist: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God to Epicure: saying with wicked heart and filthie mouth, there is no God. Neither hath there bene this great while anie pastor or Pope, that regarded these things. For they al,</hi> both Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and other <hi>sought their owne: and not so much as one of them, sought for the things that pertaine to Iesus Christ.</hi> Yet, say they, there can be no departing from faith in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the faith thereof cannot faile: for Christ hath said, <hi>I haue praied for thee, that thy faith</hi>

there can be no decay. This is the saying of some, who humble not themselues to knowe their errour: who loue the praise of men more than the praise of God: whose glorie is their shame, which mind earthly things.</p>
               <p>The Apostle saith, there shall be a departing that it shal be, not among the Jewes, and Jnfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, but among those which were reckoned to be of the housholde of faith, and the children of God. What is it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they shal depart, or wherein the decay shall be? doth he meane their riches, their gold, and siluer, &amp; bread, &amp;c. No, but the doctrine of the gospell, and faith in Christ. The pure words, which as siluer from the earth are tried, and purified seauen times in the fire: the wel of water which springeth vp into euerlasting life, shal decay in the house of God. The people shall shut their eares that they may not heare the truth, and shall giue héede vnto spirites of errour, and doctrines of diuels which speake lies through hipocrisie.</p>

                  <hi>not thy selfe. Be not high minded, but feare. For if God spared not the naturall braunches: take heede least he also spare not thee. Thorow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe they are broken off, &amp; thou standest by faith. Behold therefore the bountifulnes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie of God. Towards them which haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, seueritie: but, towards thee, bountifulnesse, if thou continue in his bountifulnes: or els thou shalt also be cut off.</hi> That is, if he spared not the Iewes his owne people, how wil he spare thée that art but a stranger? If thou continue not, thou shalt be cut off. It may be thou shalt also depart from the faith, as the Iewes haue done: then shalt thou be as a withered branch, &amp; shalt not draw any moisture from the roote: then wil God also forsake thée: and thy end shal be worse than the beginning. I trow in saying thus: he said not, <hi>Thou shalt not erre.</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre, what néede haue they of that church, either of the Scriptures, or of the fathers, or councels? Perhaps through this pride, they grew first to despise the holie Scriptures, &amp; would not direct their waies by them. They are high minded, and boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they are as mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which shal not be mooued. Yet our Sauiour likeneth the Church sometimes to shéep, as in the <hi>15.</hi> of <hi>S. Mathew, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of Israel.</hi> Sometimes to children, which are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:25001:149"/>
simple, and soone beguiled. Sometimes to a Vine, which is weake, &amp; easily throwne down: sometimes to the moone, which waxeth and is also in wane, and many times giueth no light. The ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers compare the church of god to no one thing so vsually, as to a shippe. And who knoweth not how a ship is tossed hither &amp; thither? how it is in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of sands &amp; of rocks, and of pirats, &amp; in danger of drowning by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? If the shéepe were not a straying kind of cattel, what should they néede a shéepheard? If little children could guide themselues, what néede had they of a guider? If the vine did not hang down, and lie on the ground, what néede were there of proppes or of one to set it vp? If there were no feare for the passage of a ship, if it could not miscarie, what should it néede a Pilote? Let no man therefore saie: the church is safe for euer, it cannot erre, it can not decay. Such words are deceiuable, and lying words. For, false Prophets shal come. There shalbe a desolation: there shal be a departing, euen in the house of God: and that daie of Christ shall not come, except there come a departing first. <hi>And that, that man of sinne be disclosed, euen the sonne of perdition.</hi>

               <p>The godly preachers, sit also in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of god: they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministers of Christ, &amp; disposers

There they exhort, &amp; teach, and reproue, and correct, and instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in righteousnesse. Antichrist sitteth not in the Church after this sort. He teacheth not, nor exhorteth the people. He maketh that no part of his office. How sitteth he then? What shal he say, what shal he doe? The Apostle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>He exalteth himselfe against al that is called God, or that is worshipped.</hi> He shal be honoured with the honour that is due vnto God.

Hée selleth merites, the forgiuenesse of sinnes: the sacrifice for the quicke and the dead. Hée maketh marchandize of the soules of men. Hée laieth his filthie handes vppon the Lordes annointed.

               <p>But <hi>Paule</hi> was not tyed to any one citie, or Ilande, or countrey. He had authoritie to preach to al cities and countries: to al landes and Ilandes from the east to the west. So did Christ appoint his Apostles: <hi>Goe ye into all</hi>

and to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the rest of the Apostles: that they should goe into al the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any of the Apostles should haue staide in one only place, and haue gone no farther, he had offended, and done otherwise than Christ commaunded.</p>
               <p>Here we sée howe foulie they are deceiued which say, <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did sitte there fiue and twentie yeares. They that say so, knowe not what they say. It is an errour. Christ made <hi>Peter</hi> an Apostle, and not to sit as a Bishop at <hi>Rome.</hi> He sayde vnto <hi>Peter, Goe into al the worlde:</hi> thou shalt be a witnesse vnto me, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outmost coasts of the earth: I sende thee vnto al the churches, and not to one alone. The like charge receiued <hi>Paul:</hi> he trauailed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therefore sayeth he to the <hi>Thessalomans.</hi> Ye remember that when I was with you, I tolde you these thinges. The spirite of GOD warned me to goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </gap>nsue. It was mine office, I was bounde so to doe, least you might be deceiued. I told you Antichrist should come, euen that man of sin, the sonne of perdition, which should destroy himselfe and others also. I tolde you he should be an aduersarie of the Gospel of Christ: that he should aduaunce himselfe ouer al the kings and powers of the world: that he should sit as God in the holy place: that the people should giue him place to sit in their harts, and in their consciences.</p>
               <p>This warning the Apostle gaue to the <hi>Thessalonians.</hi> The like warning he gaue to other Churches where he taught the Gospel: and the same is also spoken vnto vs. They knewe by his teaching that Antichrist should come. We know by the markes which he hath giuen to know Antichrist, that he is alreadie come: and that, the very same is come, which the Apostle describeth: that he is growen vnto his fulnesse, and hath stalled himselfe in the place of God.</p>
               <p>V. 6. And nowe yee knowe what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth: that hee might bee reueyled in his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paule</hi> séemeth not in these wordes to say, what letteth the comming of Antichrist: but what shal stay the comming of Christ. For so be maketh entrie into his matter: I beseeche
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:25001:160"/>
you, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye be not troubled as though the day of Christ were at hand. Let no man deceiue you by any meanes. For the day of Christ shal not come, except there come a departing first, and that Antichrist be disclosed. Euen so here he sayth, ye know what withholdeth Christ, and why he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not. Euen this, that Antichrist might first be reueiled in his time. His time is appointed. The spring commeth not, vntil the winter haue gone before: the night goeth before, and then the day commeth. And so shal not the glorious maiestie of Christs comming appeare, before the dreadful and daungerous dayes of Antichrist shal come. There shal be no deliuerie, vnlesse bondage goe before.</p>
               <p>Antichrist shal bring the worlde into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: he shal do violence to the saints of God: he shal be as a continual storme, and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the church. The godly shal looke vp to heauen, and cal for ayde: they shal crie vnto the Lorde, and he wil heare them. They shal say, <hi>O come Lord Iesus, thy kingdome come,</hi> confounde thine enemies. Then wil hee not staie: he wil appeare, and she we himselfe in glorie. In the meane while this is the cause of his stay, this letteth his comming: Antichrist must first come. This I take to be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles meaning. It agréeth with the beginning.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:25001:161"/>
It is simple, cleare, and plaine, and without danger of errour.</p>
               <p>Antichrist shal appeare, not when he wil: but he shalbe reuealed in his time. His time is the time of darkenesse: when shepheardes and the guides of the people shal be carelesse: when the word shal be loathed: when the light shall be put out: when superstition shal reigne: when ignorance shal haue the vpper hand: when the creature shal not be knowen from the creator: when there shal be no feare of God, no regard of godlinesse: when the people shal not knowe neither wherefore they pray, nor whom they worship, nor in whom they beleeue: then shal it appeare that Antichrist is come, then he shal shewe himselfe: this is his time.</p>
               <p>V. 7. For the mysterie of iniquitie doeth alreadie worke, onely he which nowe letteth, shal let til he be taken out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The mysterie of iniquitie doeth alreadie worke.</hi> Let vs not be deceiued. Antichrist shal certainly come, and shal drawe many into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. As it was with Christ, at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, he was in the world, he did the workes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet fewe knewe him: So shal it be with Antichrist, hee shal be in the worlde, he shal worke his iniquitie, and fewe shal know him. <hi>Paule</hi> liued more than fiftéene hundred yeares past. Yet then he saide the mysterie of the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:25001:161"/>
doth alreadie worke. The diuel is not idle, sayth he, Antichrist euen nowe worketh, when as the bloud of Christ was fresh: when as yet the Apostles and many other witnesses of our redemption by Christ were liuing. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi> sayth, <hi>Euen now are there many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>come alreadie.</hi> So soone was his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation cast, his plot laide, his way prepared, and his work begun. So long sithens did <hi>Paul</hi> sée some which delited in the workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: which were the enemies of the crosse of Christ, which serued their belly and not the Lord, euen then did he sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréeuous wolues not sparing the flocke, should enter in among them. Al these were the forerunners and the harbingers of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>We may not thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antichrist shal come as a robber by the high wayes, or like a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, or like a tyrant that burneth our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or sacketh our cities, or destroyeth our fieldes, or pulleth downe al that is before him. Wee may not looke that hee should say I am Antichrist, I am that man of sinne, I am the sonne of perdition, I am the aduersarie, and am contrarie to Christ. He shal not shew forth himselfe in such a sort, he shal not so speake of himselfe. He is suttle and cunning, hee shal deceiue the learned and the wise: he shal cast himself into a colour of holinesse: he shal fast,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:25001:162"/>
he shal pray, he shal giue almes and shewe mercie: he shal walke as if he were a disciple of Christ: he shal counterfeite an Angel of light. He shal goe before, and the worlde shal follow him. So shal the mysterie of iniquitie worke. His life, his religion, his doctrine shal be close &amp; hid, and secret. Antichrist worketh in mysterie. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth, <hi>Ingemuit totus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>

So shal the learned and wise be deceiued. They shal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Antichrist vnwares. They shal say, we defye him, and detest him, and yet shal fal downe and worship him. This is a mysterie. So secrete shal his dealing be, it shal not bee knowen to many.</p>
               <p>He shal walke in craftinesse, and handle the worde of God deceitfully: he shal mingle his lies with the truth of God: he shal mingle his poyson with the wholesome foode of our soules; so closely and suttlely, that it shal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be espied: he shal goe forwarde by little and little, and so winne credite, and conueigh him selfe into the heartes of the people.

They shal both grow vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The day of the Lord shal reueale them and set ech part by it selfe. This is a mysterie, and as it is secret, so is it long in working.

So shall they créepe to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, so shall they poure out their soules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, so shall they séeke counsell at his mouth, so shall they fetch light at the Prince of darknesse.</p>
               <p>This mysterie, saith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> doth alreadie worke, it shall increase and goe forward and growe to a perfection. A thorne when it is yong is soft and gentle, ye may thrust at it with your finger, it wil not hurt you: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it waxeth and groweth hard &amp; stubborne, it will pierce to the flesh and drawe bloud. A Beare when he is yong is harmlesse and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yée may dandle it, and dallie with it, as with a whelp, it hath not chambers to gripe, no téeth to bite, nor pawes to teare: but after it wil growe, and become fierce and cruel like the sire. A serpent when it is yong, is litle and pretie: it hath no sting nor poison. You maie take it in your hand and laie it in your lap, it will not burt you. After, it will encrease in benime, and grow in mischiefe, and be like it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:25001:163"/>
selfe: then it wil shake the sting, and cast poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and prooue dangerous.</p>
               <p>Such a thorne, such a beare, such a serpent is Antichrist. At the first he shall séeme soft and gentle, and pretie and innocent. After hée shal growe fierce, and arme himselfe with sting and poison. But a thorne though it be soft, is a thorne: a beare though he be little is a beare: a serpent though it be pretie is a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Euen so Antichrist, though he séeme gentle, milde, and simple, yet is he Antichrist. He groweth by degrées, he wil be like his sire, his pawes wil be dreadfull, his mouth wil be deadly.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer knowe the nature and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an earthquake, how it groweth and how it worketh, know, that at the first it is some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle winde, gathered and kept in some hollowe places of the earth: there it lieth closely some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for manie yeares, without giuing foorth anie noise, without stirring or shaking. One may walke ouer it and perceiue nothing. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it groweth strong and violent, it séeketh a maie out, it forceth it selfe, it gathereth Srength and commeth abroade, it wil staie no longer. Out it breaketh, and teareth the earth, and renteth rockes, ouerthroweth moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, shaketh down townes and cities, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth by whole riuers: it inflameth the aire,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:25001:164"/>
raiseth thunder, roareth vp into Heauen, and astonieth the worlde. Such is the working of an earthquake: so great and mightie at the ende, so little and simple at the first. Such shall be the mysterie and comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. At the beginning he shall be like a litle winde, and shall enter into the hollownesse and darkenesse of the Church, but after, hée shal shake the whole world. He shal shew forth himselfe at the first with countenance of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holinesse, that he may closely and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily, and secretly wreath in himselfe. Few shal be able to vnderstand the mysterie of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. After, he shall be opened, and appeare as he is.</p>
               <p>Who would thinke there were anie euill in forcing of virginitie, chastitie, or single life? He that is vnmarried, careth for the things of the Lorde, howe he maie please the Lord, that he may be holie both in body, and also in spirit. Would God it were so with al, that haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the profession of single life. But the colour is faire. Hence hath it growne, that Bishops, and Priests, and yong men, and maidens haue continued single. This see<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med strange, and a myracle, and a matter of great holinesse. But this is a mysterie: this is a waie to bring in Antichrist. Marke what <hi>Saint Paul</hi> speaketh héereof, <hi>They shal forbid to marrie.</hi> Of whom <note place="margin">

speaketh he? Of Antichrist, and his Disciples. They shall forbid lawfull marriage, as vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and as a state of life vnfit for their holines. Yet Christ Iesus the sonne of God did neuer forbid it. His Apostles were married and had wiues.</p>
               <p>This, saith <hi>Saint Paul</hi> is a marke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, by this shall he be knowne. Forbidding of marriage is a doctrine of Diuelles: not of Christ, or of God, but of diuels.

               <p>Who would thinke there were anie euil in the keies of the Church? They are the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the law, and the disclosing of the wil of God.

If any shal not obey mée, they are cursed before God: God and I haue one iudgement seate, we sit together, I can do, whatsoeuer God can doe.

               <p>Nowe the Emperour holdeth the whole power and authoritie ouer the worlde: but it shal be taken away from him, and then shal Antichrist come, when al stoppes and lets shal be remoued.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:25001:168"/>
yet so long as the Emperour shal stande and prosper, he wil not suffer any part of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be abated.

A traitour can not vsurpe the crowne so long as the right king is able to stande and maintaine his state. Antichrist is a traitour. A traitour both to God and man.

               <p>Who shal he be then, or of what condition, that we may knowe him? Some haue said, he should be a Jewe of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> some that <hi>Nero</hi> the bloudy tyrant should rise again and hee should be Antichrist: some that hee should be a mightie persecutour, which should rage and range ouer the whole worlde, rase towers and castles, set on fire the Church and oratories, and kill whom so euer he méeteth: <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> saieth he shal be begotten by the Diuel, and himselfe shal be a diuel. These de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises were imagined and written many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares sithence, as euerie bodie were best able to deuise. But these are fables, and haue no grounde. To say the trueth, Antichrist shal neither be a Jew, nor <hi>Nero,</hi> nor one begotten by the Diuel. He shal be a Christian, he shal be a Bishoppe, and a holie father, and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of great shewe and countenaunce in the worlde.

               <p>Nowe the Emperour hath the rule ouer the worlde. Let him kéepe it. There shall a time come when he shall loose his possessions: then Antichrist shall appeare. When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire shall be dismembred, and the kingdomes belonging to him shall departe from him, then shall be the comming of Antichrist. Who will looke into the storie of things and times past, shall perceiue the meaning of the Apostle: and how the empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> being so great, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed and brought to nothing: and in what sorte Antichrist, which was once so poore and simple, so little regarded and obscure, might growe to be so great, and auaunee himselfe aboue Kings and Princes. The empoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the one, was the enriching of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I tolde you, that the empire of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained sometimes a great part of the worlde, as <hi>England, Fraunce, Spaine, Germanie, &amp;c.</hi> Where is <hi>England</hi> nowe? It is diuided from, and is no part of the Empire. Where
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:25001:173"/>
is <hi>Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, Illyricum?</hi> where is <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe? They are taken awaie from it, and are now no part of the Empire. Where is <hi>Macedonia, Thracia, Graecia, Asia, Armenia, &amp;c.</hi> Wée can not thinke of them, but with heauinesse. They be nowe vnder the Turke: they are taken awate, and are no part of the Empire. What is become of the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce which the Emperour had in al the world? Hée is nowe in comparison no bodie. What part of al the Empire is left vnto him? Not one. He hath not left him one Citie, or towne. What is become of al which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him? They are dissolued, taken from him, and his estate is brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>In the meane while Antichrist encreased, and grewe to wealth by spoile of the Empire. The Bishoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> hath at this daie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Countries and Lordshippes, Poore <hi>Peter</hi> had none. Howe then came he by them? By the spoile of the Empire. He hath the title of <hi>Forum-Iulium.</hi> Where hath hée it, but of the spoile of the Empire? Where hath hée so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie countries beginning at <hi>Luke,</hi> and onward to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> but by the spoile of the Empire? Hée hath <hi>Rauenna Forum Sempronij, Beneuentum</hi> and <hi>Spoletum.</hi> Al these he hath by the spoile of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:25001:173"/>
the Empire. Hée claimeth the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of <hi>Sicile,</hi> hée is the Lord <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> is his vassall, and pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him tribute. Hée hath <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe. It did belong vnto the Emperour. Howe grewe it to the Bishoppe? whence hath hée it? By the spoile of the Empire. Wée sée then, that the Emperour is abated: that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is encreased, and so encreased, that hée hath made the Emperour to be his man, to beare his traine, to wait vpon him, to knéele downe, and to kisse his foote. This could he neuer bring to passe, whiles the Empire stoode whole, and the Emperour was able to make his parte good. But these things were doone, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken, <hi>The Kings of the earth shall giue their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 17.</note>

               <p>Now then séeing the empire is so decayed, and abased, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> so highly aduaunced into his seate and authoritie (so highly I say) that some are bold to say, <hi>The Pope hath the princehoode of all the whole worlde, and, The Pope is king of kinges, and Lord of Lords:</hi> Let <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where giuen great light to this prophecy, shew vs hereby also to knowe who is Antichrist.

These things are done by the finger of God.

               <p>V. 13. But wee ought to giue thankes alwayes to God for you, brethren, beloued of the Lorde, because that God hath from the beginning chosen you to saluation, through sanctification of the spirite, and the faith of trueth.</p>
               <p>14. Whereunto hee called you by our Gospel, to obtaine the glorie of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>God hath chosen you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, his election is sure for euen The Lorde knoweth who are his. You shal not be deceiued with the power and suttletie of Antichrist, you shal not sal from grace, you shal not perish. This is the comfort, which abydeth with the faithful, when they beholde the fal of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. When they sée them for sake the trueth, and delight in fables. When they sée them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their vomit, and to wallowe againe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:25001:200"/>
in the myer. When we sée these thinges in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we must say, alas, they are examples for mée, and they are lamentable examples. Let him that standeeh take héede that he fal not. But God hath loued me, and hath chosen me to saluation. His mercie shal goe before mée, and his mercie shal follow in me. His mercie shal guide my féete, and stay me from falling. If I stay by my selfe, I stay by nothing, I must néedes come to grounde. Although al the worlde shoulde be drowned with the waues of vngodlinesse, yet wil I holde by the boate of his mercie, which shal safely preserue me. If al the world be set on fire with the flame of wickednesse, yet wil I créepe into the bosome of the protection of my Lorde, so shal no flame hurt me. He hath loued me, he hath chosen me, he wil kéepe mée. Neither the example, nor the companie of others, nor the entising of the diuel, nor mine owne sensual imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor sworde, nor fire is able to separate me from the loue of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lorde. This is the comfort of the faithful. So shal they wash their hands in the bloud of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>Therefore saieth <hi>Paule,</hi> you are my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: I haue begotten you in Christ, God hath giuen you vnto mee, he hath made the Gospel which is come vnto you by my ministerie.

               <p>But howe may we knowe that God hath chosen vs? howe may we sée this election? or howe may we feele it? the Apostle saith, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough sanctification, and the faith of trueth,</hi> these are tokens of Gods election. Haue you receiued the gospel? it is the light of the world, it teacheth vs to knowe that God is God, and that wee are his people. The credite you giue to the Gospel, is a witnesse of your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. We beléeue what soeuer God speaketh, because it is the worde of God. For his word is trueth. We beléeue that Christ is the lambe <note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> of God, that he hath taken away the sinnes of the world: because it is the word of God. We <note place="margin">1.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Matt. 9.</note> it is the worde of God.

We beléeue, <note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:25001:201"/>
they that trust in the Lorde, shal not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, because it is the worde of God. We <note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> beléeue, we are saued by grace through faith, and that not of our selues, it is the gift of God: not of workes, least any man should boast: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the word of God. We beléeue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Hcb. 11.</note> faith it is impossible to please God: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that faith commeth by hearing: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <note place="margin">Rom. 10.

We beléeue that <note place="margin">Reu. 18. 19.</note> Antichrist shal be confounded, and bereft of al his glorie, because the worde of the Lord hath spoken it. His word is righteousnes and truth. We wil alwaies beléeue that is true, therfore we cannot but beléeue the word of God.</p>
               <p>Faith knoweth no falshood, it beholdeth the truth onely, and not al truth, but the truth of God. It is not setled vpon vanities, nor vpon errors. Unlesse it be truth by the word of God, whatsoeuer thou holdest in opinion, is not to be called faith. The <hi>Turke</hi> is setled in errors, he perswadeth himselfe hee is rightly setled, he calleth his opinions, Faith and beléese. Yet this is not faith, because it is not the faith of truth, it hath not the worde of GOD to assure it. Therefore when men wil say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue our Masses, beléeue our sacrifices: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue our transubstantiations, and our real presences: beléeue vs what soeuer we say,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:25001:202"/>
beléeue that we can not erre, beléeue that you are in a good beléefe, if you say you beléeue as the Church beléeueth, though you knowe not how or what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church beléeueth. They abuse and mocke the people of God. There is no truth in this doctrine. It neuer past out of the mouth of God. God ordeined not Masses, nor that the priest should offer sacrifice for the quicke and dead. Therefore it is no matter of faith, it is folly, and vanity, it is vngodlinesse, it is errour, it hath no substance. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth such doctrine, maketh much of a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, he can not hold it.</p>
               <p>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the worde of God. The worde of God is trueth. The Gospel is the worde of God, and the power of God to saue them that beléeue. The beliefe of the Gospel is laide vp in our heartes by the spirite of God. He bringeth vs to the knowledge of the trueth. This spirite beareth witnesse vnto our spirite that we are the sonnes of God.</p>
               <p>This spirite teacheth vs to withdrawe our mindes from worldly cares, to cal our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to a reckoning, to thinke of the dreadful day of iudgement, to repent for our former sinnes, and to serue GOD in holinesse and righteousnesse.

I haue spoken to you, I haue written to you. I haue shewed you the whole counsaile of God. The word which I spake to you, is the verie worde of God.

You did beléeue it, you receiued it not as the word of men, but as it is indeede the word of God. Become not now vnfaithful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you spie many infirmities in your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: although you sée them fal into offences, and ware couetous, and giue euil example in their life and conuersation. Although you sée the faith of manie shalten, and that they haue put away from them a good conscience, and turne backe from the loue of the gospell which they once séemed to professe, and so are gone out from among you: yet stande you vpright. Hold fast y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine which you haue receiued: and continue in the things which you haue learned, and be perswaded that they are able to make you wise vnto saluation, through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

               <p>Such were in the dayes of our fathers, and such there are in our dayes, such <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> such idol worshippers, such srorners of Gods word, such scribes and Pharises, such <hi>Alexanders,</hi> such false prophets, false Apostles, and false brethren, we haue more than a good many in our dayes. They pretend the Gospel: no man more. In company of protestants, they wil be protestants, in company of others, they are quite become contrarie. They come to the church, and receiue the holy communion: they resort secretely to corners where they heare masse. They like the one, and like the other. They like the light, and they loue darkenesse, and make no difference betwéene them. These are readie to serue Christ, and also readie to serue Antichrist: faithful neither to God, nor to <hi>Baal.</hi> And this is among many counted the highest point of wisedome, to be able so to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and hide himselfe, that you shal not know what profession he is of, to what church

These hinder the passage of the Gospel, and blaspheme the holie worde of their saluation, and do al that in them lyeth to abolish the light of Gods truth. <hi>S.

Whereas I was an Apostle of Christ, the first fruits of the gospel, a chosen vessel, called from aboue, and set apart from mine owne owne, to be the embassadour of God into the worlde, and had so much to do: Yet I vsed my hands, and pained my bodie, to get my bread. I liued like one of <hi>Adams</hi> children in trauell of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and sought my bread in the sweate of my browes. Not that I might not lawfully haue

liued vpon you, and haue required my main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at your hands. It was lawfull for me to haue done so, for the workman is worthy of his hire. God hath appointed that he which teacheth the Gospel, shall liue by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This matter <hi>S. Paule</hi> reasoneth with the <hi>Corinthians, Haue wee not power to eate and</hi>

Who goeth a warfare at anie time at his owne cost? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruite thereof? or, who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke?</hi> I might eate and drincke at your charge, and require charges of you for me, and mine. I am the souldior of God. Christ is my captaine: I haue planted the vine of the Lord of hosts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, I haue fed you, you are the shéepe of the house of Israel. The hire due to the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: the fruit wherof he should eate which kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the vine, and the milke which Christs shéepe yéeld to their féeder, is nothing else but your charitable beneuolence towards the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Christ. Againe, <hi>It is written in the law of Moses. Thou shalt not muzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne.</hi> He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naileth for thée, that thou maiest liue.

Now if we by our labour minister to you the breade which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from heauen, is it much that you giue vs the bread of the earth? <hi>Do you not know that they which waite at the altare are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the altare?</hi> It hath so séemed good vnto GOD, it is his appointment, he hath established it by his lawe, and it is most agréeable to the lawe of reason, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Yet this is also to be weighed in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof, that whosoeuer asketh the paie of a souldiour, must buckle his armour, and goe a warrefare. He that drinketh the wine, must plant the grape: he that requireth milke, must féede the flocke: he that wil not be mureled, must thresh the corne: he that reapeth carnall things, must sowe spirituall things: he that requireth the bread of the earth, must minister to his hearers the bread of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:

The minde of man is euer stirring and doing somewhat. If it be not doing well, it is doing ill.

This is a hard saying: yet saith <hi>Paule</hi> I my selfe haue kept it. I haue fulfilled it in mine owne bodie.

               <p>The maister of the shippe séemeth to bée idle, to sit stil, and to doe nothing. He stirreth not the pumpe, he driueth not the oares, he soundeth not the déepe, he rideth not the ropes, he skaleth not the shrowdes, hee runneth not hither and thither, forewarde or backwarde, vnder the hatches or aboue. Hée sitteth stil, holdeth his peace, and looketh vpon the loade starre, and in appearaunce doth nothing. But his labour passeth all the rest. Whithout his labor, al the paines which the other Mariners take were lost. Were it not for his labour, the shippe woulde soone strike vpon rockes, and be stayed in the sandes, and they al should perish.

séeth the filthinesse which thou hast done in the house of God, and therefore saieth: <hi>In nomine Dei,</hi> &amp;c. in the name of the liuing God, and of Iesus Christ, before whome I stande, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whome al flesh shall appeare: by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his word, and by the power of the holie ghost, I diuide thée from the felowshippe of the Gospell, and declare, that thou arte no more a member of the bodie of Christ, thy name is put out of the booke of life: thou hast no parte in the life to come: thou arte not in Christ, and Christ is departed from thée. I deliuer thée to Sathan, the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thy rewarde shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone. Thou shalt sterue and wither, and not abide.

               <p>As for the Iudge and Minister, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth sentence against thée, hée mourneth and lamenteth for thée. When he striketh thée, hée striketh himselfe.

Therefore, when he doth excommunicate thée, from the brethren, he cutteth off an arme from his owne bodie. <hi>Ieremie</hi> dealt roughly with

that wicked wight <hi>Absalon,</hi> he wrong his <note place="margin">2.

Let their hearts sée the wrath to come, and thy heauie displeasure, which they haue deserued, and hangeth ouer their heads. They are thine, saue them, and let not satan preuaile against them.

Bring them to the fellowshippe of the Gospel: make them liuely stones méete for thy building, builde vp the walles of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> So careful is a good minister for the people of his charge, be they neuer so vngodly. Yea the more they lack the comfortable grace of God, the more must be the care for them.

               <p>18. The grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ be with you al.</p>
               <p>I neede not commende peace vnto you. It is the garde and strength of mighty Princes: it is the nurse and fosterer of the Church of God: it is the wealth and prosperitie of the worlde: it is the comfort and quietnesse of our conscience: it is truce taken with God and man, and our owne selues. I néede not to tel you who is the worker of peace. You knowe God is the God of peace. Worldlie
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:25001:221"/>
peace séemeth to be made by the wil and liking of men: but God moueth their heartes, and establisheth it. But the peace of the heart, and quietnesse of minde passeth al vnderstanding. The power, and wisedome, and strength, and riches of al the world are not able to make it. It is the glorie of God, that hee alone is the God of peace.</p>
               <p>I pray for you, that nothing may be doone among you, to the hinderaunce of peace: but that it abide with you alwaies, not for a while, not in prosperitie onely: but in persecution, in your death, and for euer. If God be with you, you shal haue peace. And if you loue one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and kéepe his word: God wil come to you, and loue you, and abide with you, and giue you the comfort of his peace.</p>
