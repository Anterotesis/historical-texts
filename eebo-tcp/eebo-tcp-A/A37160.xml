            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT I. INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ALL Governments, well and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted, as ſoon as they began to form themſelves into a Politick Exiſtence, have ſeparated from Private Uſe a certain Proportion of their Wealth, and aſſign'd it to the Uſes of the Publick: And this has not only been thought a point of Wiſdom by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nations, but Confederated Cities and States have done the ſame; for the <hi>Grecians</hi> had a Common Treaſury kept in the Temple of <hi>Apollo Delphicus,</hi> ready at all times to ſupply ſuch Affairs as they manag'd with united Councils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66111:10"/>
'Tis ſo neceſſary to particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that there never was a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth without a Publick Stock, which was either great or little; ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the State continued in Peace, or was harraſs'd with Wars; but moſt commonly according to the Prudence or Weakneſs of ſuch as Govern'd; for there have been Examples (as ſhall be ſhewn by and by) of States wiſely rul'd whom Wars have inrich'd, and of others looſely manag'd that have been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh'd in times of the profoundeſt Peace.</p>
            <p>Commonwealths either in their firſt Inſtitution have alotted part of their Territory, or in their further Progreſs have aſſign'd part of the Lands coming to 'em by Conqueſt for the conſtant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the State, both in War and in Peace; and this they probably did, that they might not be compell'd, at every turn, to call upon the People for Contributions.</p>
            <p>Where the Government has been by a Single Perſon, the Prince has had his Portion of Land for his domeſtick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, as appears in the Inſtance of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> whoſe Fields upon his Expulſion were made Publick; but the Burthen of any War lay upon the whole. In the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66111:10"/>
Kingſhips ſettled by the <hi>Hunns, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> where the Expedition was at the Common Expence of all, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Country was divided. The Prince had his Proportion, his principal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Commanders had theirs, and the Common Soldier was not without his Share: Thus <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> when he prevail'd in <hi>Africk</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to himſelf the Provinces <hi>Bizacena, Azuritana, Getulia,</hi> and part of <hi>Numidia;</hi> and to his Army he deſtributed by way of Inheritance <hi>Zeugitana,</hi> and <hi>Affrica Proconſularis.</hi> In the Eſtabliſhments made by the Northern Nations, in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lands ſo held, certain Services were due from the Soldier to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and from the Captain to the Prince; and upon the ſtrength of ſuch Tenures, in after times, the Deſcendants of theſe People, and their Kings, did ſubſiſt and make their Wars: but of this in another place.</p>
            <p>What they thus took, or what was alotted to 'em as their Share by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact among their Followers, Good Princes have always reckon'd as belonging to the Publick, and they always made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between what they held in their Private Capacities, and what they held as Publick Perſons, and Heads of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66111:11"/>
Commonwealth. And tho in the Eaſtern Monarchies erected by Force, and which were Invaſions upon the Common Rights of Mankind, the Prince might account himſelf Supream and uncontrollable Lord of the whole, and not bounded by any Laws; and tho theſe Tyrants look'd upon the People as no better than ſo many Herds of Cattle, yet it was not ſo in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government as 'twas model'd by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and as he meant it ſhould be tranſmitted to his Succeſſors; and moſt certainly it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in the ſeveral Kingdoms erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Hunns, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> upon the Ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. All which ſhall manifeſtly appear in the Series of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Good Princes have not only made a Diſtinction between what was their own Patrimonially, as the Civil Law Books term it, and what the Stte had an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in, but many of them, as we ſhall ſhow by and by, in Care of the Publick, and right Oeconomy, have equal'd the moſt prudent Commonwealths.</p>
            <p>And no doubt ſuch Thrift was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteem'd a Point of the higheſt Wiſdom, becauſe, the expences of War conſider'd, even in the remoteſt times, ſhatter'd indigent Governments, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66111:11"/>
wanting Princes, have been ſeldom known to compaſa great things; beſides, being without Money, the Nerves of War, they are obnoxious to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and Invaſions of their Neighbours; not but that wealthy Countreys have been and may be invaded, but we mean that thoſe Nations are moſt liable to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, and conquer'd, where the People are Rich, and where, for want of good Conduct, the Publick is poor. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there are infinite Examples in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, of Kings, whoſe Neceſſities have made Taxes, too often repeated, the only Fault in their Reigns, and who have thereby loſt the Affection of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide the Dangers, Foreign and Domeſtick, that ariſe from Profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in what belongs to the Publick, it depraves all the different ranks of men; for in profuſe Governments it has been ever obſerv'd that the People from bad Example have grown lazy and expenſive, the Court has become luxurious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, and the Camp inſolent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</p>
            <p>Where waſting the Publick Treaſure has obtain'd in a Court, all good Order is baniſh'd, becauſe he who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, and be frugal for his Prince, is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66111:12"/>
look'd upon as a common Enemy to all the reſt; Virtue is neglected, which raiſes men by leiſurely ſteps, when Vice and Flattery will in a little time, in a Miniſtry who mind not what is given away, bring a man to a great Eſtate; nor is Induſtry cultivated, where he does his buſineſs ſufficiently, who knows which way to apply, and how to beg in a lucky and critical moment: And, at ſuch a Seaſon, many of the Peoples Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives loſe their Integrity, when they ſee others running from every Bench to ſhare in the univerſal Plunder of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Kings reduced to Streights, either by their own, or by the negligence of their Predeceſſors, have been always involved in dark and mean Intreagues; They have been forc'd to court ſuch as in their Hearts they abhor, and to frown upon thoſe whoſe Abilities and Virtues they ſecretly approve of and Reverence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Heads of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as in Law and in Reaſon they ought to be, they have often been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to put themſelves in the Front, ſometimes of one, and ſometimes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party, as they ſaw it prevalent: A Policy in the end ever fatal to Rulers. Being intangled, they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd

when a Nation is plung'd in Debts, which generally, in all times, have produc'd ſo many Hurricanes, and popular Storms, as have made wiſe men, at ſuch a ſeaſon, not deſire to hold the Helm; and this has fatal Conſequences, for then the Ship is left to the Guidance of giddy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Pilots.</p>
            <p>All this good Princes have ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; and when either the greatneſs of their Minds, or the Benignity of their Nature, has led them to be too open handed, they have retreated as ſoon as poſſible from ſo falſe and dangerous a ſtep. But leſt they ſhould be careleſs in a point ſo neceſſary to the Common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and ſo much for their own Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Wiſdom of the Laws has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for their Safety in this matter, which fence the Prince's Revenue with divers Conſtitutions and Reſtrictions, all intended to preſerve it from the Rapine of thoſe about him; in order to which the Politic of well near all Countries has contriv'd that his Gifts ſhould paſs and be regiſter'd in ſeveral Offices, to the end that either ſome faithful Miniſter ſhould put him in mind, or that he himſelf ſhould have leiſure to repent of Liberalities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66111:13"/>
Not only the Law of this Kingdom, but of other Places, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, provide that the Prince ſhould not be deceiv'd in his Grants; for he whoſe Thoughts are employed in the weighty Cares of Empire, is not preſum'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect minuter things, ſo carefully as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons; The Laws therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him againſt the Surprizes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of Deceitful Men.</p>
            <p>For his further Security the Laws like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inflict ſevere Puniſhments upon thoſe who defraud him in his Stores, Treaſure, or Revenues, counting ſuch Publick Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers more Criminal than petty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theives.</p>
            <p>But the Laws ſeem chiefly levell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe in whom he repoſes the greateſt Truſt, therefore the Legiſlative Power of all Countrys has rigorouſly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted upon ſuch Miniſters and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, through whoſe Fraud, Negligence, or Crime, his affairs have ſuffered any damage, of which in its proper Place we ſhall give variety of Preſidents.</p>
            <p>And when he has been exhauſted by the too great Munificence of his own Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and through the falſe Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſubtle Contrivances of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and when thereby the Publick has become weak, ruined, and unable to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66111:14"/>
protect it ſelf, he has been aſſiſted by the Laws, and ſuch as have been vigilant for his ſafety, jealous of his honour, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the common Good, have thought it their Duty to look into his Gifts, and to reſume his Grants, of which we ſhall give divers Inſtances and Examples.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the Wiſdom of the Laws, and of Law-makers, it has been always a Point of the higheſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to keep within its proper Veins this Lifc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>blood of the Body Politick, ſo prone have corrupt Miniſters ever been to urge Princes to needleſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Bounty, eſpecially when they themſelves are to be the largeſt ſharers in it.</p>
            <p>Kings are the Fathers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but unleſs they keep their own Eſtates, they are ſuch Fathers as the Sons maintain, which is againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, who makes all theſe Cares deſcend, and places Foſtering, Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Protection in the Parent; but the Prince is our common Father, and therefore all that tends to his Safety, Eaſe, and State, is due to him, however the leſs he is neceſſittaed to depend upon his Children, the more he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66111:14"/>
And Kings are not to accompt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Fathers of a Party only, or of none but thoſe who ruſh into the Preſence and whiſper to 'em, they are Fathers of the whole Body of the People; They are not to reckon themſelves Fathers of of their Favorites only, as <hi>Harry</hi> the 3d of <hi>France</hi> did, who ſaid <hi>he Would grow a good huſband when he had marrye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Not that Mankind repine that the Prince ſhould have Friends, with whom he may communicate his Thoughts, and unbend his Cares, nor to ſee ſuch Friends the better for his Favours, 'tis warranted by Examples in the beſt Reigns; <hi>Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> cheriſh'd, inrich'd, and promoted by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> were yet as dear to the reſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they were to that wiſe Emperor: But they behold with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation

Men exalted, who return not to the Prince reciprocal kindneſs, who abuſe his Favours, who ſell his Words, who, by falſe Repreſentations, traduce all others, that they may engroſs him to themſelves; who arrogate to themſelves all the Good, and lay upon him the blame of unfortunate Councils, who have no regard to his Honor, when their own Safety is in queſtion, whoſe Advices tend to their own private Profit, without Conſideration of their Maſter's, or the Publick Welfare; who draw all Lines to their own corrupted Center, whoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is not gratify'd with any Honors, and whoſe Avarice is not ſatiated with multiplicity of Employments, nor with repeated Gifts and Grants out of a ſtript Revenue, and an exhauſted Exchequer. 'Tis ſuch a ſort of Favourites and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that the People hate, and exclaim againſt, and whoſe Heads they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach at laſt.</p>
            <p>Without any regard whither or no it be between Sun and Sun, if the Prince is robb'd the Country pays it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Hue and Cry hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the Robbers, Governments are not to wonder: 'Tis true, they now and then eſcape, eſpecially when in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations upon the Publick there are

from this, That the moſt Wiſe, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and moſt Heroick of our Kings (as ſhall likewiſe appear by and by) have given way to Inquiries of this nature, and not thought it inconſiſtent with their Royal Dignity and Honor, to reſume even their own Grants, when they have been repreſented by the whole Body of their People as hurtful to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>In Democratical Governments War did commonly unite the minds of men; when they had Enemies abroad they did not contend with one another at home, which produc'd one good effect, that then the Adminiſtration of Affairs was left to the beſt and ableſt Hands. They choſe for their mutual Strivings, for ſetting afoot Factions and dangerous Brigues, times of the profoundeſt Peace, and at ſuch ſeaſons men grown Popular by wicked Arts, ambitious Pretenders, light Orators, and the worſt ſort of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, had the moſt ſway and Authority among the People, which occaſion'd <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> to utter theſe memorable words to one of this ſtamp, <hi>I am at preſent againſt War, tho it puts the Power into my Hands, and tho ſuch turbulent and naughty Spirits as you are, govern all things in times of Peace.</hi> But notwithſtanding it has thus

happen'd in ſome Commonwealths, it has prov'd otherwiſe in mix'd Governments, where the ſeveral parts of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have their diſtinct Powers, Rights and Priviledges: And particularly in this Kingdom it has been ſeen that mens minds have been moſt diſunited, when there was the greateſt need of Concord. Among us heretofore foreign Wars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of allaying Factions for the preſent, have ſet 'em in a higher Flame, and, contrary to antient Prudence, when we wanted the beſt, the worſt men have got to be at the Head of buſineſs: All which did chiefly proceed from the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities to which our Princes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by their Expeditions abroad: For War occaſions Taxes, Taxes bring Want, Want produces Diſcontent, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of the People were ever the beſt Materials for deſigning and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men to work upon; when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is griev'd and ſullen, Parties are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily form'd; when Parties are form'd, at firſt they let themſelves be adviſed and ruled by ſuch as have true Publick Zeal and Virtue, but of thoſe they grow quickly weary, and then they fall into the hands of ſuch as only make a falſe Profeſſion of it, and in a little time they are entirely directed by Perſons, whoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66111:17"/>
ſole drift is to build their own Fortunes upon the Ruins of their Country; in the mean while the ſtrength and number of their Party makes theſe leading men powerful, and gives 'em ſuch weight that they muſt be courted, preferr'd and bought; often they muſt have one half to procure the other; and ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble do they grow, that if they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, they preſently invade all Offices and Employments, in which when they are ſecurely planted, they likewiſe give to one another all the Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the State: And our Hiſtories ſhew, that in former times, Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſtreights by War, have been forc'd to wink at this, and to permit theſe buſie men, then thought neceſſary, to do all, engroſs all, Rob the Publick, ſhare the Crown Lands, and in ſhort to commit what other waſte they pleaſe. Thus as in Commonwealths the worſt men are moſt powerful in times of Peace, under Regal Governments they are ſtrongeſt and ableſt to do hurt in times of War: But whereas in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths Peace has brought ſundry Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, in the Government by Kings it often produces good order, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Adminiſtration; for ſeveral of our Princes, whoſe Neceſſities compell'd 'em
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66111:17"/>
to endure the Rapine of their Miniſters in time of War, have, in times of Peace, diveſted thoſe Publick Robbers of their unlawful and outragious Plunder.</p>
            <p>We have now upon the Throne a King willing and able to correct the Abuſes of the Age, Willing from the wiſdom of his Mind, and the goodneſs of his Temper, Able from that Power and Strong Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which his Courage and his other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Virtues have procur'd Him in the Hearts and Affections of his People. Men readily obey and follow him whom they reverence, for which reaſon ſome Philoſophers have placed the Original of Power in Admiration, either of ſurpaſſing Form, great Valour, or Superior Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; Heroick Kings, whoſe high Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections have made 'em awful to their Subjects, can ſtruggle with, and ſubdue the Corruption of the times; A <hi>Hercules</hi> can cleauſe the <hi>Augean</hi> Stable of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their Faction, by the Number of their Followers, and ſtrength of their Adherents, and ſo let male-adminiſtration proceed on, as thinking it too big to be amended; but magnanimous Kings, who have the People of their ſide, need entertain no ſuch Thoughts and Apprehenſions: they know that theſe Top-heavy buildings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rear'd up to an invidious height, and which have no ſolid Foundation in Merit, are in a Moment blown down by the breath of Kings.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66111:18"/>
wiſe Kings have appeaſed by a juſt and timely Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>None are ſo able to mend what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in State as Kings who enjoy their Crown from the Subjects Gift; May be it has been ſometimes thought harſh in thoſe who were born in Purple to look into abuſes with a Stricter Eye than their Predeceſſors; But Elected Kings are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to come in upon the Foot of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and ſo are juſtifyed, by the Voices of all Mankind, in purſuing the Ends for which they were called by the People; If therefore ſuch Kings are ſevere in looking into their Accompts, If they are frugal of the Publick Money, If they examin into the Corruption of their Officers, If they enquire into the ſudden and exorbitant Wealth of thoſe who have had the handling of their Treaſure, If they rigorouſly puniſh ſuch as in breach of their Truſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Oaths, have converted to their own uſe what belongs to the State, If they abandon and reſign into the hands of Juſtice ſuch as have robb'd them and the Publick, If they reſume what has been obtain'd fraudulently by ſurprize, and upon wrong ſuggeſtions, and If they take back what was too great to give, and much too great to be ask'd, 'tis with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66111:19"/>
the univerſal Applauſe of the People, whom this Care relieves from frequent and heavy Taxes.</p>
            <p>There is no Good which may not be expected from the Wiſdom and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prince who now fills the Throne: When he came over hither he found many of the Chief Rank and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure overwhelm'd in Publick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Vices, and in a Country ſo corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'twas difficult to have a virtuous Court. They who ſhould have help'd him to mend Things, were readier to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Diſorders by which they might thrive, than to ſet afoot a Frugality, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they could not ſo well do their own buſineſs; If they had Preach'd up Thrift, as neceſſary to carry on a long and expenſive War, with what Face could ſuch a Great Man have begg'd ſuch a parcel of the Crown Lands, one a vaſt ſum of Mony, another this forfeited Eſtate, One ſo much Timber out of the Forreſt, his Friend ſuch a Reverſion, his Friends Friend ſuch a large Penſion? And if they had held the Purſe cloſe ſhut up to others, they muſt have bluſh'd when they were begging ſo much for themſelves.</p>
            <p>All theſe diſorders are to be attributed to the Corruption of the Times, and to the neceſſities thereby introduc'd, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66111:19"/>
Parties were to be gratified, when turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirits, who could obſtruct affairs were to be quieted, and when too many expected to be paid for preſerving themſelves, and their own Country from a foreign Enemy; Inſomuch that when our Story comes to be read hereafter, Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will wonder (where the Subjects were ſo craving at Court, and in another Place) how the Prince could ſave, from ſuch a Number of Spoilers, wherewithal to carry on his Wars abroad.</p>
            <p>The Kings admirable Conduct has wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through all theſe Difficulties, He has given as a Peace when the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the War was deſired by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at home, as better conducing to their dark deſigns. At his firſt coming over he ſav'd that Religion which our mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance under former Princes had put in danger. His prudence kept for ten years a People, divided amongſt themſelves, united againſt the Common Enemy. All the Misfortunes in his Reign have been the Reſult of our proper Corruptions, all the Good the Effects of his own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Virtues will at laſt bear down, and maſter all our Vices.</p>
            <p>He firſt form'd that League which has preſerved the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi> He has with a Confederate Army manag'd a long
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66111:20"/>
War, and brought it to a good Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of which there are but few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Hiſtory; for tho the beginnings of Confederacies have been always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and ſucceſsful, their Progreſs has been generally feeble, and Event unfortunate. By his Intereſt and Power he has made a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> an Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>Collein,</hi> and erected a ninth Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Empire. He has reſtored the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and taken the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle off from the Heads of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, by having been the Cauſe that <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Pignerol</hi> were demolliſh d. He has procur'd advantageous Terms for all his Allies. He has cauſed fortified Towns and large Provinces to be reſtor'd, which had been couquer'd long before He forced his Potent Neighbour to make the the firſt Advances towards a Peace, which is more than Wiſe Men, when the War began, could promiſe to themſelves in their moſt Sanguine Hopes. He made himſelf be ſought to when his Enemies proſper'd, and when the Confederate affairs declin'd. All which are manifeſt Proofs that he is as Great in the Cabinet as in the Field.</p>
            <p>And, to Crown all his Glories, by one Act he has ſhown his Goodneſs to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kind, and given a Demonſtration that he never deſired Power but for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66111:20"/>
Benefit of others: His ſo cheerfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army at the requeſt of his Parlament, is a Proof, beyond all Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he both Loves and Truſts his ſubjects, and that his Noble Mind, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of no ill is apprehenſive of no Danger.</p>
            <p>While Tyrants, who inſlave their Country, are affraid tho inviron'd with Numerous Troops, He knew himſelf to be ſufficiently guarded by the Affections of his People: Many Princes who have taken up Arms to relieve an oppreſs'd Nation, have made it appear, in the courſe of their Proceedings, that they were incited to it by ſome Ambitious Ends, and not alone mov'd by a true deſire of that Fame which follows virtuous Deeds, and the People they came to redeem have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found that they did no more than change one bad Ruler for another; But this Heroick King has follow'd the Pattern of <hi>Timoleon</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who not only reſcued the <hi>Sicilians</hi> from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but likewiſe left 'em in full Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Freedoms: He has ſquar'd his Actions by thoſe of <hi>T. Quintius Flaminius,</hi> who when he had ſubdu'd the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and reduc'd King <hi>Philip</hi> to Terms of Peace, erected an eternal Trophy to his future Renown, when he pronounc'd by the Voice of a Herald, <hi>That</hi> Greece
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66111:21"/>
               <hi>ſhould thence forward be exempt from Taxes, Impoſitions, and Garriſons, and Free to Govern it ſelf by its own Laws.</hi> The ſame Liberties did the King in effect Proclaim for ever to all <hi>England</hi> when he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the Expences, and (which lay more heavily upon us) from the Terror of a Standing Army.</p>
            <p>His happy Reign has not only freed our Perſons, but likewiſe ſet our Minds at Liberty, which had for many Years been inſlav'd by wrong Principles of <hi>

            <p>But a King who would reform the State for the general Eaſe and Benefit of his People, muſt expect to meet with ſome Difficulties, eſpecially if a great many of thoſe about him are Partakers in the Abuſes he would correct: All ſort of Rubbs will be laid in the way, and the Fears of ſuch as may be call'd to an accompt will make 'em ſet all kind of Engines at work.</p>
            <p>Firſt they will put a high Value upon their own Deſerts, and arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Single Merit of the many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions which the whole Nation has both freely paid and Granted: They will produce Preſidents of other Ages, and ſhow long Liſts of Grants obtain'd under former Reigns; but, at the ſame time,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66111:22"/>
they will take care not to mention how ſuch Proceedings have been always Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and often Puniſh'd in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>They will endeavour to blaſt the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch as would enquire into their Actions; and tho perhaps there are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſible Ways and Means left to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the State, but by making 'em diſgorge, and but by bringing them to a Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they will pretend that all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leading thereunto, and all Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this nature, are nothing but the Effects of Diſcontent, and the Reſult of Faction.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, in all their Doings and Councils, they have never had any view but their own private Profit, they will do their beſt to perſwade the World, that no man acts upon Principle, that all is ſway'd by particular Malice, and that there is not left in the Kingdom any Party of men which conſult the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>They who are conſcious of their Guilt, and apprehenſive that the Juſtice of the Nation ſhould take notice of their Thefts and Rapine, will try to give all things a falſe Turn, and to fill every place with falſe Suggeſtions: Sometimes they will accuſe Innocent Perſons, that ſo, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the People upon a wrong Scent,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66111:22"/>
they may avoid the Purſuers, and ſcape unpuniſh'd: At other Seaſons they will boaſt of the Number of their Friends and Adherents, thinking to awe both the Court and Country with an Opinion that their Party is too Strong, and too Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to be reſiſted.</p>
            <p>And, that the knowledge of their Crimes may never reach the Prince's Ear, they will endeavour to engroſs him to themſelves, by miſrepreſenting all others that are not of their Cabal, either as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to his Perſon, or as Enemies to Kingly Government. Thus they did heretofore; and tho there were truly but two Parties in <hi>England,</hi> conſiſting of thoſe who would promote male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, becauſe they got by it, and of thoſe who deſir'd things might be well Govern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, that they, and ſuch as they repreſented might be eas'd; which two ſides were heretofore diſtinguiſh'd by the Names of Court and Country Party; to which likewiſe they could have put an end, whenever they had pleaſed to have miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d leſs occaſion of Complaint; yet they will revive old Names of Diſtinction, giving odious Appellations to the beſt Patriots, pretending there are dangeroes Factions form'd, ſo to frighten the World with Phantoms of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66111:23"/>
their own Creation. Theſe falſe turns they will give, and theſe wrong Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions they will make, in order to drive all Power into what they call their own Party, as if any Prince could be ſafe that ſhould rely upon ſo narrow and Rotten a Bottom.</p>
            <p>And when their Actions ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after come to be examin'd in that Place to which our Conſtitution has intruſted the Inquiry into, and the Puniſhment of ſuch Offences, 'Tis probable That up will riſe ſome Arrogant Man more Zealous for Himſelf than for his Maſter, and cry, <hi>All that we have given among one another we have deſerved by our Seruices, and Labours in the State; what Projects have we not ſet afoot, and what ſumms have we not procur'd? Did not the Miniſters in King</hi> Charle<hi>s</hi>'s <hi>Reign give away the Crown Lands; Recal thoſe Grants, and we are ready to ſurrender ours, Reſume all or none: 'Tis next to Demonſtration that theſe Clamours ariſe from a Diſ ontented Party, who would diſturb the Government; they who lookinto our Proceedings act out of Malice, becauſe of the great thing we have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> France; <hi>what if ſuch a one got a hundred thouſand pound at once, did he not ſave the Nation?

               <hi>For my part I will never meddle more in your Buſineſs; All this tends to leſſen the Monarchy, invade the Prerogative, and to ſet up a Doge of</hi> Venice. <hi>I Sir</hi> (perhaps there may be added) <hi>and the Majority are of this Opinion.</hi> By this high Bearing, and theſe falſe ſuggeſtions, heretofore, well meaning Perſons have been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from reaching at great offenders, and even the beſt Patriots, by ſeeing with what warmth and Zeal the ſmalleſt Corruptions are defended, have been wearyed into Silence; And this has made ſome of our Kings believe that either the Offenders were grown above the Laws, or that the People conſented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o thoſe things which they did not think fit to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. But wiſe Princes ſee through all this, They know that an honeſt and faithful Miniſter will be contented with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Favours; That very often nothing but the ill Contrivance of the Aid belongs to thoſe he employs, and that the Gifts come from the free Affections of the Subject; That Patterns to Rule by are to be ſought for out of Good, nor looſe Reigns; That Inſpections which look too far backward produce nothing; That a few may complain without reaſon, but that there is occaſion for Redreſs when the Cry is univerſal; That no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66111:24"/>
Military Action, or other Merit, can give a Man a juſt Title to Rob the Publick; That even good Miniſters are thought no more on when they are out, and that certainly Bad ones may retire without being miſt; That abſolute Power is not a Plant that will grow in this Soil, and that Stateſmen who have attempted to cultivate it here have pull'd on their own, and their Maſters Ruin. A wiſe Prince likewiſe does not care to ſee Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Officers ſo earneſt to ſave one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for 'tis always at his coſt; Nor does he like that his Miniſters, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, ſhould be able to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Crimes by the Power of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Bad Men have ever given a falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to their Proceedings, and cover'd their Ambition, Corruption, and Rapine with the pretence of their Maſters Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; They make him believe their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs advances him, whereas truly it tends to his diminution, and he is often weak for want of that Wealth and Power which they ſhare among one another: Their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66111:24"/>
Riches has frequently brought Envy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince, but we can hardly meet with an Inſtance of any who in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs has been aſſiſted from the Purſes of his Miniſters, for they are commonly the firſt who fly from his Misfortunes: And tho they pretend that his Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in them and that they make him Strong by the Benefits he lets them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, yet a Wiſe King ſees through all this Artifice, and knows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he who would reap any Advantage from his Favours in the Opinions of Men, muſt make 'em ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they owe them ſingly to his Goodneſs, and not to the Interceſſion of thoſe about him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But of all the falſe Suggeſtions made by thoſe who have arriv'd at great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by wicked Arts, none have prov'd ſo dangerous as theſe, which, in former Reigns, have been frequently inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Cabinet.</hi> Sir, we are your only Friends, ſtick by us and we will ſtick by you. Our Meaſures are diſpleaſing to the People, ſo were thoſe of former Miniſters. A few well united, and in one Bottom, have guided this Nation, and with hard Reins, as Witneſs the Times of <hi>Cromwell.</hi> Mind not the Qualifications of any man for this or that Office in the State, Is he with us? If he be hearty it ought to cover all other

Defects. Turn out, and diſcountenance ſuch as are not intirely with us in all our Councils Make your Court of a piece. Let none preſume to be directed by his own Conſcience, or Reaſon; ought they to be in your ſervice who dare think your Miniſters can be in the wrong? Why do ſuch and ſuch Great Men refuſe ſuch and ſuch Employments, is it not plainly out of Liſaffection to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, or that they like Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity better than any favours you can beſtow upon 'em? Many are infected with Republican Principles, and ſeveral have an Eye towards the other ſide of the water.

'em refuſe to meddle in the Adminiſtration? <hi>with ſuch like falſe whiſpers, in former Reigns, the Ears of Princes have been poiſon'd, And by theſe pretended Friends they were induc'd to Purge, as they call it, till the Body Politick was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted of all its good Spirits: Such a one, who had done a thouſand faithful Services, muſt be laid aſide, becauſe his juſt Fears would not permit him to give into the laſt bad Meaſures. This Man was againſt me; we ſuſpect ſuch another; Some are too cautious, ſome too diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Others left us in ſuch an important Vote; And they grow to that Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by degrees, as to adviſe that a whole Party ſhould be frown'd upon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and utterly trodden down; And thus they Lop, and Lop, on this, and that hand, cutting away the Tall, Sound, and Subſtantial Timber that us'd to ſhelter 'em from the Winds, till, in the End, they leave the Government a Trunk naked, defenceleſs, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every ſtorm; But when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far as to get the Prince to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare openly for one, and againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, they lay the Ax to its very Root.</hi>

Some Kings have thought it Politick to nouriſh Factions in their Court, but then they preſerv'd themſelves Neuter, and ſo made both ſides ſubſervient to their Deſigns, and even this has been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteem'd Subtlety than Wiſdom; but no Prince, that could help it, did ever let Faction grow National; Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if 'twas out of his Power to prevent this Miſchief, twas never thought Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in him to liſt himſelf on either Side; And <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d of <hi>France</hi> is a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtance, how fatal 'tis for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign to become the Head of any Party.</p>
            <p>Partiality is the little Weakneſs of Private Men and unbecoming the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Prince, whoſe Favour ſhould ſhine upon the whole Body of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Sun ſheds his benign Influence upon the univerſal Face of Nature, not warming one Part of the Globe only; If it can be compaſs'd, He ſhould quite root out Faction, but if the Diſeaſe be too inveterate to be cur'd, without doubt 'tis a Point of the higheſt Wiſdom for him to bear himſelf evenly between both, ſo that neither Side may deſpair of Favour, or at leaſt ſo carry it that both Sides may remain in full Aſſurance to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66111:26"/>
find equal Juſtice. Nor is it impoſſible to contrive Matters ſo as to beget an Emulation in Parties which may produce good Effects, that is, by wiſe Governing it may be ſo ordered, that both Sides ſhall be at ſtrife, not which ſhall flatter moſt, but which ſhall do the Prince and the Publick the moſt honeſt, and the moſt faithful Service; And this is done, when, without any regard under what Banners, in a divided Country, Men had liſted themſelves, thoſe Perſons are pitch'd upon for the Miniſterial Part of Government, who are moſt remarkable for their Capacity, Experience, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Knowledg in Affairs; And a Prince who makes ſuch a Choice of Miniſters, will ſoon beget a Virtuous Emulation between the Factions, and ſet both Sides upon ſtriving which ſhall ſerve moſt cheaply, with the feweſt Selfiſh Deſigns, and which ſhall handle his, and the Nations Money, with the cleaneſt Hands: But when by the favour of thoſe that Rule, one ſide is become much ſuperior to the other, this Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emulation ceaſes, and both ſides contend, only to put one another in the Wrong, each ſide obſtructing what the other moves, let it be never ſo much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66111:27"/>
for the Publick Good: But when the Miſchief is grown to ſuch a height, that being of a Party, is to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, if not the only Recommendation, then the Hotteſt Men, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the worſt, and Corrupteſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, are ſure to have the moſt Power; and when the Adminiſtration is in their hands they proceed without Comptrol, for the ſide which ſhould oppoſe them is diſcountenanc'd, frown'd upon, out of Credit, and diſcourag d from inquiring, becauſe their Inquiries are blacken'd and miſrepreſented; And when all this happens, They who have the Power, rob the Prince, waſte his Treaſure, and run him into immenſe Debts: Thus Kings heretofore who ſhow'd themſelves partial to a Party, had the ſervice only of the worſt part of their People, and their Reigns were commonly anxious and unquiet becauſe when engag d with a ſide, they were often forc'd, againſt the Nature of their Office, to protect the Bad againſt the Good, and even to defend the Male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration by which they ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>They who were for Engroſſing the Prince to Themſelves, and who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make him Suſpect all others,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66111:27"/>
gave their pernicious Advice this falſe Turn, That becauſe many Great Men retir'd, and becauſe neither They, nor ſuch as were call'd of their Party, ſhow'd any Inclination to meddle in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, it muſt be that they meditated ſomething elſe, and bore ill will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the preſent Government. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Ambition of Mankind conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, it was a wonder, in former Reigns, to ſee Perſons the moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous for Underſtanding, deep Reach and Experience, employ their time with their Books in making Gardens, or in Building, and that they ſhould not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek thoſe Dignities, to which their Birth and Superior Abilities did in a manner give 'em a juſt Right. Why did they let the chief Offices of the State be polluted by mean Hands? Why did they ſuffer others to ruin that Country which was in their Power to ſave? And why all this Philoſophy in ſo light and buſie Times? Why has there been now and then a kind of a Preſs iſſu'd out for Miniſters, ſo that as it were the Vagabonds and Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were taken in? Why have ſome Men been condol'd by their Friends for having been drawn in to take a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66111:28"/>
Great Place, and why have others been univerſally Congratulated when turn'd out, tho with Marks of Diſpleaſure? when all this happen'd it could not be without a Reaſon, there muſt have been ſome Strong Inducements that ſhould move the Prime Perſons of a Nation to ſhun Employments attended with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Profit. No doubt, in former Reigns, it was Becauſe they did not like the Adminiſtration of affairs, nor the Perſons with whom they were to be ioyn'd; Becauſe they perceiv'd dark De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns carry'd on againſt our Liberties, and that they were not willing to mix in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Councils, nor to participate in the Blame of what they ſhould not be able to hinder; Becauſe they ſaw the Prince Robb'd by thoſe about him, his Crown Lands all ſhar'd and given away, and his Treaſure waſted, and Becauſe they ſaw Things done that would bear no Inquiry, and that could never be juſtifyed before the People.</p>
            <p>They knew that our Laws put little Difference between a Miniſter who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts actual Guilt himſelf, and him who permits others to commit a Crime, which by the Authority of his Office he might have prevented; Therefore when bad
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66111:28"/>
Things were in Agitation, and when deſtructive Advices were promoted, Some have refus'd Employments, others have laid down White Staves, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries Seals, the Privy Seal, the Great Seal, and other Offices of high Truſt, rather than Act againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters true Intereſt, and the Conſtitution of their Country. And for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in former Reigns, the Ableſt and Greateſt Perſons in the Nation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whole Parties of Men, have refus'd to meddle in the Employments and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the State.</p>
            <p>But when theſe Errors may be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which a few commit at the Expence of the whole Kingdom, when things will bear a right Adminiſtration, when the Nations Money may be frugally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, when the Thefts upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic can be look'd into and Puniſh'd, when thoſe Servants may be call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt who have broken their Truſt, and in their Offices conſented to the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Maſter, When true Order is promoted, When that Thrift can be ſet afoot which will eaſe the People in their Taxes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the pleaſant Work of doing Good is to be perform'd, and When they have not before their Eyes

the frightful and heavy Task of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill Conduct, All Perſons will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Government, All Parties will cheerfully come in, and the beſt Men will be the moſt Eager to aſſiſt the state with their Purſes, Councils, Endeavours, and Affections.</p>
            <p>And thus we hope to have fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd their Arguments who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Prince from looking into their Corruptions, by making him believe, that thereby he will injure his only Friends, and who would narrow his Intereſt by confining his Favours to their Party.</p>
            <p>A King never wants Aſſiſtance who will look into abuſes, and their Faction whoſe Intereſt it is to protect Male-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, will be found very weak when He is earneſt to have what has been amiſs amended, becauſe but a few are Gainers by Miſgovernment, and a Multitude are injur'd by it.</p>
            <p>But as all Seaſons are not proper for Phyſick, ſo all Times are not fit for purging the Body Politick; Times of Action and War are not ſo convenient for ſuch Councils as tend to correct A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes in the State.

done in <hi>England,</hi> which the King, in his high wiſdom, may think neceſſary to animadvert upon now when He is at leiſure from His Buſineſs in the Field; And no doubt when He goes upon ſo good a Work, He will be aſſiſted by all the beſt Men of all Parties, and by the whole Body of His People.</p>

            <p>In the fourth Section he will ſhow how our Anceſtors have handled ſuch Miniſters of State, as in breach of their Truſt, did preſume to procure to themſelves Grants of the Kings Lands, And how both this Nation, and other Countreys, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with thoſe who did imbezzle, or convert to their own uſe the Revenues of the Prince.</p>

'Tis true, for ſome Ages the Publick had but little occaſion for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, becauſe, till the Siege of <hi>Veies,</hi> which was about Three Hundred and Fifty Years after the Foundation of the City, their Soldiers had no ſtipend. However to have a Reſerve, which might anſwer any great Emergency, well ſuited with the Foreſight and Wiſdom of that People. As their Empire grew, and as they entertain'd Thoughts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Dominion by diſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they became more ſollicitous to gather ſuch a ſtock as might uphold the State in times both of War and Peace, without burthening the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Enemies. To the Common Treaſury were brought the Riches of <hi>Carthage, Sicily,</hi> of the Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and of the other Conquer'd Provinces of <hi>Greece.</hi> Their Generals, as well as their Statesmen, did not think of building up Fortunes to Themſelves, but of inriching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: And till ſome few years after the laſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, we hardly read of any one who grew wealthy by the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Provinces. In the following Age indeed ſeveral began to convert to their own uſe part of the Spoils gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but they were Men that hatch'd wicked Deſigns againſt their Country, and who thought Private Wealth an Engine very needful for ſuch as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to overthrow Publick Liberty; of which number were <hi>Marius, Sylla, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar:</hi> Among theſe Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the World <hi>Lucullus</hi> may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, who perhaps had the ſame Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the reſt of inſlaving <hi>Rome,</hi> but 'tis probable the Mutiny he found among his Soldiers after his famous Victories, and wonderful conduct, made him out of love with Action, ſo that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in a quiet Life, join'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Luxury, what the others made

Cities, ſo that of them there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but their Names. After this, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerich</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> landed in <hi>Italy,</hi> Plunder'd <hi>Rome</hi> the Second time, carrying away all which even the Rage of <hi>Alarich</hi> had left: In this Century <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> fix'd himſelf and his People in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> obtain'd a firm Footing in <hi>Gaul</hi> after a long Conteſt with the Natives, and the <hi>Romans:</hi> At laſt <hi>Rome</hi> was for the Third time taken and Sac'kd by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> conducted by <hi>Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acer</hi> Prince of the <hi>Heruli;</hi> who was Proclaim'd King of <hi>Italy.</hi> And thus an End was put to the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion, after it had continu'd under Kings, in a Common-Wealth, and under Emperors; about 1228 Years, reckoning from the firſt Foundation of the City.</p>
            <p>And now to recapitulate the Reaſons of this Great Peoples Ruin. Firſt their Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries extinguiſh'd antient Honour, and in its room introduc'd irregular Ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambition brought on Civil Wars; Civil War made Single Perſons too conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remain afterwards in a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſo that the Foundation of their Deſtruction was laid in the Century where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Caeſar</hi> invaded their Liberties; However they might have continued a Powerful
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66111:52"/>
and Flouriſhing Nation for many Ages, if the ſucceeding Princes had imitated either <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> But many of thoſe that follow'd aſſum'd to themſelves, unlimited Athority, and when bad Emperors came, they pulled down what had been building up by the Wiſdom of all their Predeceſſors: They ſeiz'd upon that Treaſure which the Frugality of preceeding Times had ſet aſide for urgent Occaſions, They accounted the Publick Revenues to be their own particular Property, and to be diſpos'd of at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſuch as were Laviſh ſquandred away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Minions and Favourites, that which was to maintain the Dignity of the State. When their Profuſion had reduc'd them to Neceſſities, they fell to laying exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Taxes, and to Pillage the Remote Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; when thoſe Provinces were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd and exhauſted by continual Payments, they became weak and unable to reſiſt Foreign Invaſions: In thoſe naked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs Provinces, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> neſted themſelves, and, when they were grown Strong and Powerful, from thence they made Irruptions into <hi>Italy,</hi> till at laſt they came to Invade and Conquer <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, the very Head and Seat of the Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66111:53"/>
From this brief Account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs perhaps it will appear, That to let Miniſters Waſt the Publick Revenues, or to ſuffer any Negligence and Profuſion of the like Nature, is of dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence both to the Prince and People.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66111:54"/>
Terror of their Arms elſewhere, which they did into <hi>France,</hi> where by their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour they obtain'd that Tract of Land, which from them was call'd <hi>Normandy,</hi> from whence in One hundred and Twenty Years they came, and in one Battle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by theſe Swarms from the North, of Men ſeeking new Seats, the beſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> came into the Poſſeſſion of a rough Warlike People, whom the Luxuries of <hi>Aſia, Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> had neither cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nor refin'd; And theſe new Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants chang'd every thing, introducing in all Places new Cuſtoms, other Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Languages, different ways of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War, new Laws, and new Forms of Government.</p>
            <p>And theſe ſeveral Branches, ſpringing from the ſame Stemm, it muſt follow, that the Fruit they bore would be near of a Taſt; by which we mean that in their Manners, Laws, and principally in their Politick Government, they muſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as indeed they did, very much reſemble one another.</p>
            <p>And whoever looks into the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Conſtitutions of <hi>England, France, Spain, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweeden,</hi> will find, that all theſe Nations, had one and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66111:55"/>
ſame Form of Government; and tho' they might vary in ſome Circumſtances, yet they all agreed in certain Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which were, That the People ſhould have their Rights and Priviledges; That the Nobles, or Men of chief Rank, ſhould have ſome Participation of Power, and That the Regal Authority ſhould be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the <hi>German</hi> Emperors have ſome ſhadow of, and pretend Succeſſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but whoever contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates their Laws, Conſtitution, and Form of Government, will find all ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tincture.</p>
            <p>However, he who conſiders the Migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Men, will perceive, that the Governments which they eſtabliſh'd, were the neceſſary and unavoidable Conſequence of their Expeditions, and that People ſeeking new Seats could not properly put themſelves under any other Form.</p>
            <p>For ſo vaſt a Deſign as that of leaving one's own, and invading a remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, muſt fall into ſome Bold and Great Mind, that could firſt conceive, and then be able to go through with ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; and he who was thus qualified with Courage and Conduct, eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Supream Authority over all the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66111:55"/>
reſt; from whence came, That theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple choſe to be govern'd by Kings. But the firſt Expence of this Expedition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very great, and he who projected it not being able to bear it all himſelf, he Aſſociated to him certain of his Principal Countrymen, who had likewiſe Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Dependants of their own; Theſe in Conſideration of what they contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the Common Deſign, were not only to ſhare, in the Conquer'd Lands, but in theſe Lands to enjoy certain Powers and Priviledges, and to have Names of Honour, by which they were to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd and ſet above the reſt: From whence came, That theſe Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had among 'em the Titles of <hi>Peers, Pallatins, Barons, Earls, Grantz, Graffs, Notables, Grandees,</hi> and <hi>Dukes.</hi> And the Perſons of prime Rank under theſe or the like Appellations, were a diſtinct Part or Member of the Body Politick, and were to protect thoſe who had come under their Banners, and follow'd their Fortune, and were veſted by the Conſtitution with eminent Power, that they might be a Skreen between the Prince and People. But the Labour and Dangers of theſe Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to lie upon the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by whoſe hands the Battles were to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66111:56"/>
fought; and no doubt they had not been tempted abroad if they could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves a better Condition than what they had at home, and if they were to be only Beaſts of Burthen to the Great Ones: For which Reaſon, by Compact with thoſe whom they follow'd, they were likewiſe to have a certain Share in the future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; from whence came, That in the Settlements made by theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſpect was had to the Intereſt of the People: There was reſerv'd to 'em their diſtinct Rights and Privliedges, and Part of the Conquer'd Lands were Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to them, in which, the better Sort had Freeholds, and thoſe of inferior De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, held of their Captains, Lords, and Leaders.</p>
            <p>Their Military Conſtitution, gave like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Form to their Civil Government: Their King as he was Head of the Army in the moving Camp abroad, ſo, when they came to ſettle, he was Head of the Common-wealth: And as the Principal Officers and Chief Captains had been his Council of War, ſo when they had Peace and Reſt, they could not be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to quit that Share in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Affairs, of which they had taſted in the Field; and their Titles and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66111:56"/>
Lands being to deſcend, they became, by Virtue of their Tenures, his hereditary and ſtanding Council; and as in the Field they had wont to adviſe him in difficult Matters, for the common Good of the whole, and to lay before him the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Grievances of their Followers and Dependants, ſo at home it grew their Right to do the ſame. But when theſe Nations came to fix and mingle with the Natives, and when they had made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts and Agreements with thoſe Natives, this united Body (which likewiſe increas'd in Wealth and Poſſeſſions) ſoon became ſo Conſiderable as to make it neceſſary, That what was properly call'd the <hi>Commons,</hi> ſhould be a diſtinct Part of the State, and that it ſhould be Repreſented by Perſons and Members choſen from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus in all theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there has been what was call'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Eſtates, Aſſemblies,</hi> the <hi>Cortez, Diets,</hi> or <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Original Conſtitution, in moſt of the Eſtabliſhments made by theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, and under this Form of Government they continu'd without any material Change, till the Two laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies.</p>

But in proceſs of Time, the Soil alters the Nature of Man, as much as it does that of Plants; warmer Climates did by degrees ſoften theſe rough and Warlike People. Too much Sun produces that Effeminacy, which is the proper Matter for Arbitrary Power to work upon: Therefore all the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> World has been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd, while colder Climates ſeem more tenacious of their Liberties. The <hi>French</hi> were the firſt who ſtoop'd to the Yoke of Regal Authority, not limited by Laws; <hi>Spain</hi> ſoon follow'd, to whoſe Kings their Foreign Acquiſitions gave more Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than conſiſted with the Freedom of their People. At laſt it grew a Mode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong leſſer Kingdoms to imitate what had been done in larger Empires: So that the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Sweeds</hi> were content to make and put on their own Fetters: And we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were deſiring to be like the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about us; had not the Virtue and Courage of a Few ſaved us often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrowly from the Corruption and Madneſs of the reſt, The bad Example of former Kings, the Vices of their Courts, nor our own Riches, have not ſoften'd and deprav'd us quite; and this Iſland having been planted by the moſt Warlike of all the Northern Tribes, and having
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66111:57"/>
ſtill preſerved a few of its old Inhabitants who retain ſomewhat of the antient Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Courage; and this Soil having always bred and nouriſh'd Men of Heart and Stomach, it happens that we ſtill continue Free, and that we keep the main Parts of our Original Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Antient Conquerors have in the ſame manner divided their Acquiſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince, his Chief Fellowers, and the People; but the Tenures, or Rights, by which theſe Lands were to be Held, ſeem particular to theſe <hi>Gothick</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with admirable Polity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd to preſerve the Links of Protection and Obedience, which ſhould hold Prince and People together; for 'tis Natural for Men to Cheriſh and Protect their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and as natural, to Love and Obey thoſe by whom we are Protected. Thus to make all Hold of the King, was almoſt as far as Human Wiſdom could go, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this chief Landlord from committing Waſte in his own, and from injuring thoſe by whoſe Service he was to receive Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. But this Diviſion of Property would not have quite ſuffic'd, unleſs there had likewiſe been made ſuch a Partition of Power, as we have mention'd; for the Greater would have encroach'd upon, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66111:58"/>
ſwallow'd up the Leſs, if the Power of each Part of the Conſtitution had not had certain Boundaries, as well as the Fields and Grounds had Landmarks, of one kind or other.</p>
            <p>Our Ancient Government having its Foundation in ſuch Tenures as the <hi>Goths</hi> introduc'd, it will be neceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon that Subject.</p>

Soldiers, and their Heirs, upon Condition of Defence. But that which properly conſtitutes the <hi>Feudum, viz.</hi> The peculiar Oath of Fidelity and Homage, was an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſign Lands upon the Limits, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed whole Countries to be held by Fidelity and Service. Theſe Tenures were firſt at Will, afterwards for a Term; then they came to deſcend to one Son, afterwards to be an Inheritance. He that held the Fee was oblig'd upon Summons to arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and follow his Lord's Banner, and to ſtand by him in all Dangers: Beſides he was Subject to the Payment of Tributes, Aids or Subſidies. As the Prince conferr'd theſe Fees upon great Lords and Barons, ſo theſe Barons came to confer 'em upon others. The <hi>Germans</hi> had anciently ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like nature; but from <hi>Italy,</hi> they paſs'd into <hi>France,</hi> and from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> And certainly it was a wiſe Inſtitution, To give a new People, who were to be continually upon their Guard, either againſt the Natives, or Foreigners, ſome Intereſt in thoſe Lands, for whoſe Defence they were ſo often to expoſe their Perſons.</p>
            <p>When theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Expeditions had Succeſs, and that a Country was ſubdu'd,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66111:59"/>
there was aſſign'd to the Prince, or he took to himſelf, part of the Land, which he Held in Demeſne, from which, and by the Profits and Strength the Tenures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, he maintain'd himſelf in War and in Peace, without laying, in Ancient Times, any other Burden upon his People. And without doubt, our Kings were moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py when they liv'd upon this Revenue of the Crown, which was neither grievous by its Weight, or Novelty. What the Prince thus receiv'd came chearfully, becauſe the People had good Bargains from the Crown. 'Tis true, they who Held by Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Service, were at more Expence in time of War; but twas the nature of their Tenure, and they bore it; nor did a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Race of Men, diſlike now and then to be in Action. And 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, our firſt Princes choſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from a Revenue that would be Paid without murmuring, and which they might call their own, rather than upon the Manufactures and Trade of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as was practiſed by <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kings and the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, who were always laying freſh Impoſitions upon their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ill ſuited with the free Genius of the Men theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Princes were to Govern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:66111:59"/>
Thoſe Loads upon Induſtry, high Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and what we call Exciſes, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but not thought of in theſe <hi>Gothick</hi> Settlements: 'Tis true, from the time Kings have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red greater Armies than their Crown-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues would maintain, ſuch Impoſitions have been reviv'd in theſe Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Kind of Taxes, from which this ſide of the World had been exempt for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages, were renew'd by Ambitious Princes, who had great Thoughts, and ſmall Territory; of which kind, were <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> Kings <note place="margin">

By theſe Ways and Means of Raiſing Money, <hi>Lodowic Sforza</hi> had heap'd up ſuch a Maſs of Wealth, that not Eight Years before <hi>Milan</hi> was taken, he ſhew'd ſeveral Foreign Miniſters, by way of Oſtentation, beſides Jewels, and other ſort of Riches, in no ſmall quantity, to the Value of One million, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Ducats: A vaſt Summ for thoſe Times. The Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> had likewiſe ſcrap'd up a great Treaſure, by

            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> That the Crown was become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Subjects, in the Sum of 372000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Houſe of Commons thought it reaſonable to relieve the King's Neceſſities out of his own, and by an Act of Reſumption, rather than to charge the People with new Duties and Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> That the Houſe of Commons thought it reaſonable to make the Act ſo general, that they inſerted only Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66111:94"/>
Reſervations or Saving for others, ſo much did they conſult the Publick more than any private Intereſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Writer of theſe Papers thought his Labour would not be unprofitably ſpent, to give an Abſtract of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and Moderations, which the King's Council believ'd at that time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in an Act, which was to be ſo very general and extenſive.</p>
            <p>In theſe Savings, which are in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 185, the Reader has before his Eyes a perfect Image of the Gravity, Care, Exactneſs and Frugality of that Age.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the ſaid Savings relate to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for Employments, or for Lands ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtor'd than granted, or for ſome Liberties and Franchiſes, or for Lands given to Religious Uſes, all which were affected by the Act.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66111:95"/>
the Value of the Grant is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and in others omitted; but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Exactneſs, which runs through the Whole, is a Mark, that where the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue is not expreſs'd, 'twas notoriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. In many of the Savings there is ſomething left and ſomething taken away. The Reader may likewiſe note, That moſt of the Grants of that Age were only for Life.</p>

            <p>'Tis true, his Work will thereby ſeem tedious, but curious Perſons may, perhaps, receive Satisfaction, to ſee the Sence of their Fore-fathers upon this Point.

            <p>He has done impartially, and taken notice of what may make againſt, as well as for his preſent Argument, that the Reader may have the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. And in this Tranſcript he has follow'd the beſt Copies of Records he could procure, ſuch as have been ſign'd and examin'd at the <hi>Tower,</hi> in which he believes there is no material Error, and that they are according to the Original Records, except in Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, or ſpelling Words, wherein all Tranſcribers of Records miſtake and differ with one another: But as to the <hi>French</hi> Records, both in this and the following Section, the Author has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66111:127"/>
them all at the <hi>Tower</hi> by the Rolls.</p>
            <p>As to what was done upon Reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions before the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, he has therein follow'd the beſt Ancient Writers of our Engliſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, whoſe Authority may be rely'd upon, becauſe moſt of ſuch as he has cited, wrote of Things done near, or in their own Times.</p>
            <p>But for their Eaſe, who do not care to read much, and to help the Memory of others, he will recapitulate in a few Words the ſeveral Reſumptions; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he will make ſome few Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the Whole, and examine what Effect theſe Acts of Reſumption produc'd, as to enlarging the Crown-Revenue, and then conclude this long Section.</p>

            <p>18<hi>thly,</hi> That the 33 <hi>Henry</hi> 6. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Land paſs'd away from the Crown, even by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>19<hi>thly,</hi> That in all theſe Acts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept 28 <hi>Henry</hi> 6. the Lands in <hi>Ireland</hi> are comprehended.</p>
            <p>20<hi>thly,</hi> As every ſubſequent Act was more ſtrictly penn'd than that which went before, ſo the Exceptions and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings brought in by <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth <hi>(Henry</hi> the Sixth were at laſt few and frugal) became every Time more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate than the other; ſo that in the End, both Prince and Parliament agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a Reſumption was neceſſary, and would be greatly beneficial to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:66111:129"/>
But now as to the Effects which theſe Acts of Reſumption produc'd; it appears manifeſtly, that they were put in Execution, and that the Savings and Exceptions were not ſuch, as to defeat the Deſigns of the Parliament, which ſome People pretend to ſuggeſt; and 'tis likewiſe evident, that the Crown-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was thereby very much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>For the Records plainly ſhow, that the whole Income of the Crowne, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> 28 and 29. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was reduc'd to Five Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth who ſucceeded, was an expenſive Prince, <hi>Richard</hi> the Third his Brother a frugal Man indeed, but his Reign was too ſhort to make any great Improvements in his Revenue; and yet we find <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh his Succeſſor, Maſter of more ready Money than ever any King of <hi>England</hi> was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or ſince his Time.</p>

            <p>'Tis true, he had very extraordinary Ways of ſcraping up Money, ſuch as Sale of Offices, Redemption of Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſpenſing with the Laws, and the like; but all theſe together pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd only <note n="*" place="margin">Anſwer to the Reaſons, &amp;c. p. 52.</note>120000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> the Two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his Extortions, did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Rapines till towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of his Reign.</p>
            <p>From whence we may reaſonably conclude, that the Principal Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all this Wealth (join'd with his own Parſimony) muſt have been the Crown-Revenue, and that the former Acts of Reſumption with that which was made in his own Reign (which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66111:130"/>
no doubt this frugal Prince took Care to ſee put in Execution) had reduced it to it's former State and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For had no more been left than 5000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> there would have been no matter for his Oeconomy to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that we may very well infer, that the fore-mentioned Reſumptions had reliev'd the King's Affairs, and brought the Crown-Revenue once more into a flouriſhing Condition.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth not only ſpent the immenſe Sum left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but likewiſe a great Part of that Revenue which came to the Crown by ſeizing the Abby-Lands, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to <note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.

            <p>The Writer of theſe Papers does not remember to have met with any Thing relating to Reſumptions in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but the Reaſon why nothing of that Nature ſhould be done in her Time, is very obvious; her Father had alienated from the Crown a great Part of the Abby-Lands, or exchang'd 'em for other Lands (as a Multitude of Acts paſs'd to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his Reign Witneſs:) And it was a ſtrong Security to the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, that thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates ſhould remain in the Hands and Poſſeſſions of private Perſons.</p>
            <p>A Reſumption was thought on in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, of which the forementioned Tracts of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> are a ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Beſides, in the <note n="†" place="margin">Annals of King <hi>Jam.</hi> p. 10.</note>Annals of

                           </note>—The Kyng, our Souve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, had by times ſethen he Reyned upon us Lyvelood, in Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipps, Londs, Tenements and Rents nere hand to the Value of the 5th Part of his Realme, above the Poſſeſſions of the Chirche; by whiche Lyvelood if it had abydyn ſtill in his Hands, he had been more mighty of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, than any of the ſayd Two Kyngs <hi>[ſc.</hi> the Kyng of <hi>France</hi> or the Sowdan of <hi>Babylon]</hi> or any Kyng that now reyneth upon Criſten Men. But this was not poſſible to have done, for to ſum parte thereof the Heyres of them that ſum time owyd it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, ſum by reaſon of Taylys, ſum by reaſon of other Tytles, which the Kyng hath conſidered, and thought them good and reaſonable. And ſum of the ſame Lyvelood hys good Grace hath gyven to ſuch as hath ſervyd him ſo notably, that as their Renown will be eternal, ſo it befetteth the Kyngs Magnificence to make their Rewards everlaſting in their Heyres to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66111:134"/>
and their perpetual Memory. And alſo the Kyng hath gyven parte of Lyvelood to his moſt honourable Brethren, which not onley have ſervid hym in the manner aforeſaid, but byn alſo ſo nygh in Blode to his Highneſſe, that it befet not his Magnificence to have done otherwiſe. Nevertheleſſe ſome Men have done hym Service for which it is reaſonable that his Grace had rewardyd them, and for lack of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the Kyng than rewarded them with Lond: And to ſum Men he hath done yn likewiſe above their Demerits thorow Importunite of their Sewtes.

And yf yt would not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66111:134"/>
then be ſo grete, I hold yt for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtyd that the People of this Lond wol be wyllyng to graunte hym a Snb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidye upon ſuch Commodities of his Realm as be before ſpecifyd as ſchal accompliſh that which ſchal lack him of ſuch Lyvelood. So that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wol wel eſtabliſh the ſame Lyve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lood then remaynyng to abide perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to his Crown without tranſlatyng therof to any other Uſe. For when that ſchal happyn hereafter to be given hytte ſchal nede that his Commons be chargyd with a newe Subſidye and be alwaye kepte in Povertie.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We found by grete Cauſys yt was nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that all ſuch Gyftes as have ben made of the Kynges Lyvelood inconſyderately as not deſervyd, or above the Merites of them that hath getyn them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formyd, ſo that they which have done Service be not over rewardyd, which thyng as me thynketh may not perfitly be done without a general Reſumption made by Act of Parlement. And that ther be gevyn the Kynge by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorite of the ſame Parlement, a grete
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66111:135"/>
Subſidye with which his Highneſs with the Advice of his Counceil, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that have deſervyd rewards, and ought not therefore to have parte of his Revenues, by which his Eſtate muſt nedes be mainteyned, or ought not to have ſo much of the Revenues as they have now, or not ſo grete Eſtate in the ſame.

But yet or any ſuch Reſumption be made yt ſchal be good, that an honorable and notable Counceil be eſtablyſhyd, by the advyſe of which, all new Gyftes and Rewards may be moderyd and made, as yf no ſuch Gyftes or Rewards had ben made before this time. Provyded alway, that no Man be harmyd by reaſon of ſuch Reſumption in the Arrearages o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when ſuch a Counceil is fully create and eſtablyſhyd, hyt ſchal be good that all Supplications which ſchal be made to the Kynge for any Gyfte or Reward be ſent to the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66111:135"/>
ſame Counceil and ther debatyd and delibered. Firſt, whither the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant have deſervyd ſuch Reward as he askyth, and yf he have deſervyd yt, yet yt nedeth, that yt be delibered whether the Kynge may gyve ſuch Rewards as he asketh of his Revenues, ſavyng to hymſelf ſufficient for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenaunce of his Eſtate, or elſe ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyng war no Vertue, but rather a Spice of Prodigality, and as for ſo much it war delapidation of his Crown. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for no private Perſon wol by reaſon of liberalite, or of reward, ſo abate his own Lyvelood, as he may not kepe ſuch Eſtate as he did before. And truly it war better that a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lackyd his Reward, which he hath wel deſervyd, than that by his Reward the good Publicke and alſo the Lond were hurt; Wherfor to eſchewe theſe two Harmes, hyt may than be advyſyd by the Counceil how ſuch a perſon may be rewardyd with Office, Money, Marriage, Fraunchiſe, Privilege, or ſuch other thyng, of which the Crown hath grete Rycheſſe; and veryly if thys Order be kepte, the Kynge ſchal not be be grevyd by importunyte of Sewters, nor they ſchal by importunyte or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage optain any unreaſonable deſires.

O what myghty quiet ſchal growe to the Kynge by this Order, and in what reſt ſchal al hys People lyve, havyng no Colour of grutchyng with ſuch as ſchal be about hys Perſon: As they were wont to have for the gyvyng away of his Londs, and for miſcounceiling hym in many other Cauſis, nor of murmour ageyn the Kyngs Perſon for the miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of his Realm.</p>

            <p>IN the foregoing Section we have taken Notice how careful the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> have all along been, to aſſiſt by Acts of Reſumption, ſuch of their Kings as had been injur'd by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Bounty.

Nor would it have been convenient that the Princes Hands ſhould have been abſolutely bound up by any Law, or that what had once got into the Crown, ſhould have been for ever ſeparated from private Poſſeſſion: For then, by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures and Attaintures, he muſt have become Lord of the whole Soil in a long Courſe of Time; The Conſtitution therefore ſeems to have left him free in this Matter, but upon this tacit Truſt, (as he has all his other Power) that he ſhall do nothing which may tend to the Deſtruction of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>However, tho' he be thus truſted, 'tis only as Head of the Common-wealth; and the People of <hi>England</hi> have in no Age been wanting to put in their Claim to that in which they conceiv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have a remaining Intereſt, which Claims are the Acts of Reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that from time to time have been made in Parliament, when ſuch Gifts and Grants were made, as became bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome and hurtful to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Nor can any Government or State di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it ſelf of the Means of its Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And if our Kings ſhould have had an unlimitted Power of giving away their whole Revenue, and if no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could have revoked ſuch Gifts, every
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66111:140"/>
profuſe Prince, of which we have had many in this Kingdom, would have ruin'd his Succeſſor, and the People muſt have been deſtroy'd with new and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Taxes, for by our Duty we are likewiſe to ſupport the next Prince: So that if no Authority could look into this, a Nation muſt be utterly undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any way of redreſſing it ſelf; which is againſt the Nature and Eſſence of any free Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Our Conſtitution therefore ſeems to have been, that the King always might make Grants, and that thoſe Grants, if paſs'd according to the Forms preſcribed by the Law, were valid and pleadable againſt not only him, but his Succeſſors. However at the ſame time 'tis likewiſe manifeſt that the Legiſlative Power has had an unconteſted Right to look into thoſe Grants, and to make them void whenever they were thought exorbitant. And therein wiſe Kings have given way, and not thought it diſhonourable to join with their People in that which was judg'd to be for the Eaſe and Benefit of the major part.</p>
            <p>But becauſe in Acts of Reſumption the Legiſlature exerts it ſelf in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, and becauſe 'tis a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial of a very ſtrong Operation, and for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66111:141"/>
that ſuch Acts muſt of Neceſſity break into private Contracts, Marriage-Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, Sales upon a valuable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and in many other Inſtances, the Law has fenc'd the King's Revenue with Reſtrictions and wholſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, it has preſcrib'd Forms by which Grants and Gifts ſhould paſs, it has erected ſeveral Checks, and truſted thoſe Checks in the Hands of high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Crown; And laſtly, the Laws have call'd to Accompt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veerly puniſh'd many Men of great Birth and Figure for breaking down theſe Fences; by all which our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſeem to have deſir'd and deſign'd preventing Miſchiefs in their Growth, and that Recourſe ſhould be had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Remedies as ſeldom as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, That not only his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Expences, but that alſo his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities might be ſupply'd without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Capital, innumerable Laws did provide that he might be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceiv'd in his Receipts nor in his Payments, beſides which the <hi>Introitus</hi> and <hi>Exitus</hi> of the Exchequer was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally contriv'd with Check upon Check, and with all the Care and Art imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

But all theſe good Methods were very early overthrown by the Negligence of ſome Princes, but more through the Corruption of their Miniſters.</p>

               <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. who had depos'd his Predeceſſor, and who came in upon the Foot of Reformation, began to make Regulations, and reſtore ſome Order in the Revenues of the Crown.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Year of his Reign the Commons complain'd of outragious Grants, and of great Sums of Mony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed to undeſerving Perſons, the King not perceiving the hurt done him at the time of the Grant.

The King An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>He will be advis'd by the wiſe Men of his Council.</hi> And thereupon ſeveral good Regulations relating to the Paſſing of Grants are eſtabliſh'd, but take the Record.</p>

            <p>Theſe were ſome of the Methods by which the Houſe of Commons endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to preſerve the Crown-Revenue from the greedy Hands of thoſe who were always deſiring therewith to inrich themſelves. But the Kings greateſt Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lay in the very Conſtitution of the Exchequer, which if bad Miniſters had not broken into, our former Princes could not have been robb'd ſo much to the Impoveriſhment of the People.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution of the Exchequer; we may rather call it the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, has contriv'd to put a great many Letts and Obſtructions in the way of deſigning Favourites and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Followers of the Court, and that no Grant ſhould paſs from the King but upon ſtrict Inquiry and after mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
            <p>In order to which the State thought it neceſſary to be at the Expence of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Great Officers, who ſhould be as ſo many Centinels continually watching that the King may not be ſurprized nor defrauded.</p>
            <p>Regularly and according to the Laws of the Land, Grants from the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66111:147"/>
Crown ought to make the following Steps.</p>
            <p>The Petition is firſt made to the King, in which (as we have noted before) the Petitioner ought to incert the true and expreſs Value of the Thing demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The King refers this Petition to the Treaſurer of the Exchequer, now call'd Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe firſt Step is to have a Particular of the Thing petition'd for from the Auditor, if it lies before him, or from the King's Remembrancer, if it lies before him: This Care is taken that the State may not be deceiv'd in the value of the Thing.</p>
            <p>The Petition is firſt referr'd to this High Officer becauſe the Law preſumes that the whole State and Condition of the Revenue lies before him, that he knows what Debts and Engagements the King has upon him, and whither the Expences of his Wars, and the other neceſſary Charges of his Government, are not ſuch, as for the Peoples Eaſe, and by the Rules of Juſtice ought for the preſent to reſtrain his Bounty. If the Thing to be granted be of great Value, if it cannot be given away without great Damage to the Crown, if by reaſon of ſuch Gift
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66111:147"/>
he is hindred from paying his juſt Debts, or from having wherewithal to defray the Charges of the Government, or to provide for the Kingdoms Defence; or if by this and other Gifts he muſt be driven through the failing of his own Revenue, to lay heavy Burthens upon the People; 'tis the Duty of the Lord Treaſurer to repreſent the whole Matter honeſtly and impartially to the King, and to hinder the Grant from proceeding any further. And as a Tie upon him he takes the following Oath. <q rend="inline margQuotes">Ye ſhall ſwear, That well, and truly, ye ſhall ſerve the King our Soveraign Lord, and his People in the Office of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; and ye ſhall do right to all manner of People, Poor and Rich, of ſuch Things as toucheth your Office; And that King's Treaſure truly ye ſhall keep and diſpend; And truly ye ſhall counſail the King, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ye ſhall layn, and keep; And that ye ſhall neither know nor ſuffer the King's Hurt, nor his diſ-heriting, nor that the Rights of his Crown be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by any means, as far forth as ye may let; And if ye may not let it, ye ſhall make knowledge thereof clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſsly, to the King, with your true Advice, and Counſel: And
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:66111:148"/>
ye ſhall do, and purchaſe the King's Profit in all that ye may reaſonably do, as God you help, and the Holy Evangeliſts.</q> It was hardly poſſible to deviſe a more binding Oath. And the Words <hi>Ye ſhall well, and truly, ſerve the King our Soveraign Lord, and his People in the Office of Treaſurer,</hi> are an Evidence that our Forefathers took themſelves to have ſome kind of Intereſt in what was call'd the Crown-Revenue.</p>
            <p>If the Grant meets with no Objection at the Treaſury, the King ſigns a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant directed to the Attorny or Sollicitor-General, who is another Great Officer, impowering him to prepare a Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch a Grant. And if the Grant be of Mony appropriated by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or of Lands annex'd to the Crown by Act of Parliament, or if the Grant be any ways illegal or prejudicial to the Crown, it is the Attorny or Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor-General's Duty to advertiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Attorny has paſs'd it, it goes to the Signet, the Cuſtody whereof is in the Secretary of State, who being a Miniſter in high Office is preſum'd by the Laws to be watchful for the King's Good, and to inquire into all Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Weal Publick. He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:66111:148"/>
to be apris'd of the Perſons Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to whom the Grant is to be made, and likewiſe to underſtand either the Affluence or Want in the King's Coffers, and the general Condition of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. And having an Allowance for Intelligence, he is preſum'd to know the Diſcourſes and Opinions of the People, and how ſuch Grants are reliſh'd: If therefore the Perſon ſuing out the Grant has no Merit at all, or at leaſt no ſort of pretention to ſo great a Reward, or if he knows the Publick to be preſs'd with Wants and Debts; or if he hears that the People murmur at the Taxes which Profuſion introduces, and Clamour to ſee the Nations Mony waſted, by his Duty, as Privy Councellor, and by his Oath he is bound faithfully and plainly thereof to inform the King.</p>
            <p>From the Signet it ſhould go to the Privy Seal, who is likewiſe another Great Officer; who being near the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, is preſum'd to know the Condition of the Kingdom; and therefore the Law has made him another Check. He takes this Oath: <q rend="inline margQuotes">Ye ſhall as far forth as your Cunning and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

to you by his Highneſs committed, not leaving or eſchewing, ſo to do for Affection, Love, Meed, Doubt, or Dread of any Perſon or Perſons, &amp;c.</q>  So that if the Lord Privy Seal, finds that through Corruption in other Offices, or that by Power, Importunity, or partial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Favour, a Grant, tending greatly to the Publick Damage, and to the Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Prince's Revenue, has paſs'd ſo far as to his Office, he ought to ſtop it there, and is bound in Duty, and by his Oath, to lay the whole Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King.</p>
            <p>From the Privy Seal it goes to the Great Seal, in the Cuſtody of the Lord Keeper, or Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who is accompted the Kingdom's, as well as the King's Officer, and there the Grant is compleated; upon which ſcore, in the Eye of the Law, this Great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is moſt look'd upon; his Oath is the ſame with that of the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer. He ſwears, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well and truly to ſerve the King and his People in the Office of Chancellor, truly to Counſel the King, not to ſuffer his Hurt or Diſ-heriting, nor that the Rights of the Crown be diſtreſs'd, by any Means, as far forth as he may let; And if he may not let it,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66111:149"/>
he is to make it clearly and expreſly known to the King, with true Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel; And, in all that he may, he is to do, and purchaſe the King's Profit."</q> So that more than any other, as the higheſt Officer, and as the laſt Check, the Laws preſume him to conſult for the King's good. Therefore if the Grant be exorbitant, if it be made to an undeſerving Perſon, if it notoriouſly ſurpaſſes the Merits of the Suitor, if it was obtain'd upon wrong Suggeſtions, if it occaſions Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy to the Government, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent among the People, if the King's Debts are many and clamorous, if the Nation labours, at the ſame time as the Gift is made, under heavy Taxes; and if the Grant tends greatly to the Hurt and Impoveriſhment of the Crown (with all which Matters the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes ſo great a Miniſter in the State to be acquainted) he is bound in Duty and by his Oath not to fix the Great Seal to the ſaid Grant, but thereupon faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially to adviſe the King: And Chancellors who have acted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and who, contrary to the Truſt of their Office, have ventur'd to paſs outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Gifts, <hi>Douns Outrageuſes,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords call 'em, whereby the Crown has
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:66111:150"/>
been impoveriſh'd, have been heretofore, as we ſhall ſhow by and by, queſtion'd, impeach'd and attainted in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the ancient Steps in Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Grants from the Crown, which were afterwards inforc'd by a poſitive <note n="*" place="margin">

'Tis true, by the Suggeſtion in the Preamble, it looks as if the Act were made to preſerve the Fees belonging to the Clerks of the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, but bringing in Fees to Officers, being never the Object of a Parliaments Care; we ought to conclude that the Houſe of Commons gave that fair Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour (in the Reign of a Suſpicious and Arbitrary Prince) to the Regulations they intended to make as to Paſſing Grants from the Crown. Firſt, the Law directs, <q rend="inline margQuotes">That the King's Grants ſhall be brought to the Principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, or to one of the King's Clerks of his Grace's Signet for the time being, to be at the ſaid Office of the Signet paſs'd accordingly.

            <p>For we may argue thus, It was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV.

               </hi> or the diſpenſing with Laws in force, being declar'd Illegal, it ſhould follow, that the Grants of Crown-Land made for theſe laſt ten Years are void in Law, and revokable at the King's Will and Pleaſure. But 'tis left to the Gentlemen of the Long Robe to determin in this Point.</p>
            <p>However tho' this Doctrin of <hi>Non Obſtantes</hi> (invented perhaps firſt to enlarge the Prerogative for the People's benefit, and made uſe of afterwards to extend it to the King and People's Damage) may have heretofore receiv'd Countenance in <hi>Weſtrninſter-hall,</hi> there is another Place where in no Age it has met with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſons why ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions have been made, might be, Firſt, That it gave Offence to the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative Authority to ſee the Miniſters make uſe of this diſpenſing Power. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That it appear'd the Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66111:153"/>
were wrong upon which the Grants were grounded: That is, that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign did not proceed <hi>Ex certa Scientia,</hi> namely, that he was ſurpris'd and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd in the value of the Thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That he did not proceed <hi>Ex mero motu,</hi> but that the Gift was wreſted from him by his importunate and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Courtiers. That he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Ex Speciali Gratia;</hi> but was rather induc'd to beſtow the Favour, through the neceſſity of his Affairs, to quiet ſome great Man, or to pleaſe ſome powerful Party. And in all probability upon ſuch, or the like Accompts, Parliaments have look'd into Grants, and the beſt Princes have not thought it diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to join in Revoking what had been thus Extorted from them.</p>
            <p>And as to the diſtinction which the Lawyers make between Directive and Coercive: Admit the Forms by which the Law has directed all Grants ſhall paſs, ſhould be only Directive to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and deviſed for his greater Eaſe and Safety, yet without doubt they are Coercive to his Miniſters. No Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers ever intended that a ſolemn Law, made upon mature Deliberation, and preſcribing a Rule in high Affairs of State, ſhould have no effect at all. But the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66111:154"/>
27 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. which Chalks out to the Secretary, Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Chancellor, the regular Steps they are to make in paſſing Grants, would be of no ſort of ſignification, if they may paſs <hi>per Saltum,</hi> and by immediate Warrant, without being enter'd in the ſeveral Offices.</p>
            <p>When Parliaments adviſe the Prince, 'tis humbly ſubmitted to his Wiſdom, whether or no he thinks fit to approve of their Councils: But when by a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law they give Advice, and lay down Rules and Directions in Matters of State for the Miniſters to walk by and obſerve, without doubt they intend, Advice ſo ſolemnly given, ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have mention'd the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Proviſions, Reſtrictions and Forms, which our Anceſtors eſtabliſh'd, and made uſe of, to preſerve the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, by which the Publick was to be ſupported. But notwithſtanding all this, the Wickedneſs of Men was either too Cunning, or too Powerful for the Wiſdom of the Laws in being.</p>
            <p>And from time to time Great Men, Miniſters, Minions, and Favourites, have broken down the Fences contriv'd and ſettled in our Conſtitution; they
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66111:154"/>
have made a Prey of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, plum'd the Prince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to their own Uſe, what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Service and Preſervation of the State.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore proceed to ſhow, That to obviate this Miſchief, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Authority has all along inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with Inquiries, Accuſations and Impeachments, till at laſt ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heads were reach'd.</p>
            <p>For as Courts have been watchful to Rob the Prince, ſo antiently the Barons, and afterwards Parliaments, from time to time have been as vigilant to prevent his Ruin, ſhowing, in the progreſs of their Councils, great Wiſdom mixt with Duty, and Temper join'd with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>

In the 10th of <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was Impeach'd in Parliament upon ſeveral Articles, the Principal of which was, For that being Lord Chancellor, and ſworn to promote the King's Profit, he had purchas'd of the King Lands, Tenements, and Rents of a great Value, againſt his Oath, and ſuch Grants being more than he deſerv'd, conſidering the great Poverty of the King and Kingdom. To which he anſwer'd that he had no Lands of the King, but ſince his being created Earl, and that by way of Exchange.

So that it appears plainly from this Record, That King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, took it to be a Crime in the Lord Chancellor, and againſt his Oath, to take Lands in Gift or in Exchange from the King; for upon the Chancellors Oath the Judgment was grounded, it being in thoſe Days thought and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that he who was ſworn to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the King's Profit, ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelf with the Revenues of the Crown, and as the Record ſays, that he chiefly ought not to do ſo, who was <hi>le Principal Officer,</hi> and who knew the State and Neceſſities both of King and Kingdom.

'Tis true, Men are very unwilling to quit Great Employments, attended with much Wealth and High Honours; and the common Excuſe of ſuch as comply more than they ought, is, That others will be readily found to do the ſame thing: So that they ſhall prejudice themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Advantage to the Publick. Nay, they often pretend to remain at Court on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevent greater and farther Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then this to be Caſe, and that the Tide runs ſo ſtrongly one way that no ſingle Miniſter in his Station is able to ſtem it, and that the Prince will diveſt himſelf of his Revenues, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is otherwiſe advis'd, what does the Conſtitution of this Kingdom require from a Lord Chancellor, a Lord Treaſurer, Lord Privy-Seal, and the Secretary of State, when ſuch Meaſures are taken? What Proofs will clear them before the whole World, that they are no ways conſenting to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and that things are carried by an irreſiſtible Strength againſt that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil they would be thought to give?</p>
            <p>Without doubt they ſtand juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the Opinions of the People, if they give manifeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that their own Hands are clean, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:66111:193"/>
that they do not at all participate in the Depredations that are made upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: If they have ask'd nothing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis a ſign they did not promote Grants; for he who ventures to wrong the King, will rather do it for his own Gain than for the Advantage of another: Therefore a total Self-denial in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is a great Mark of Innocence.</p>
            <p>If they were ſeen to have as large a ſhare in the Plunder as any others; if the King's beſt Lands and Mannors were found in their hands; or, which is worſe, if they had devour'd all the Fleſh themſelves, and left to others only the Bones to pick; if, while the Publick was poor, they had procur'd to themſelves outragious Gifts of Money, as they are call'd in the Records; if it was known that they had procur'd immoderate Releaſes for Money, (now they term 'em Privy-Seals,) and that in an unwarrantable manner: Our Anceſtors look'd no farther, but took the Miniſters to be guilty, and preſum'd, that they, ſingly, for their own Gain and Profit, had incited the Prince to Liberalities inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Welfare of his Crown and Government; and thereupon our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers grounded the Impeachments we have mention'd in this Section.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:66111:193"/>
We do not find in the Records, (except in the Lady <hi>Veſcie</hi>'s Caſe,) that the Anger of Parliaments was provoked againſt the Common Herd of Courtiers, who in all Ages have raked from the Prince whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could: But the Sword of the Legiſlature was directed againſt their Heads, who being Miniſters of State, in his Privy Council bound up by Oaths, <hi>(Aſtricts per lour ſerments,)</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Offices attended with large Sallaries and Profits, did nevertheleſs, with inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Avarice and Ambition, and without any Conſideration of the Publick Wants and Miſeries, rob the Crown of all they could, by a Practice as foul in it ſelf as it was fatal in its Example: For in theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Law has only an Eye to thoſe who are intruſted, and expects the Town ſhould not be ſold, ſurrender'd, or betray'd by the very Centinels who are ſet to watch the Gates.</p>
            <p>Perhaps theſe Great Men alledged in their Excuſe, That none will ſerve a Court without Rewards: But our Anceſtors thought the Appointments belonging to their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſufficient Recompence; and that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment grows very coſtly, when Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt go away with Ten thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Eſtate, for Five or Six Years Service. Nor did our Fore-fathers
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66111:194"/>
think it Reaſonable, that out of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> there ſhould be built up every Year Three or Four New and Wealthy Families.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Ranulphs,</hi> the <hi>De la Pools,</hi> the <hi>Beurlees,</hi> and the <hi>Buckinghams,</hi> of former Ages, might very well expect all they got, or could get, if every Day they were making bold Steps, by which they ran a Hazard of their Necks. But in Times when the Laws govern, and when extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things are neither expected by the Prince, nor ſuffer'd by the People, Miniſters for their Service ought to be contented with a moderate Reward.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable likewiſe, that when they begg'd thoſe large Grants of former Kings, (for which they were impeached,) they ſuggeſted to 'em what immenſe Summs of Money they had got granted for them by the Commons. But if the true Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the State requir'd it, the Gifts would have proceeded without their ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Nor do we find that <hi>Hubert,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a good and faithful Servant, got, or was impeach'd for getting Grants, tho' he had obtain'd Eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Marks for the Redemption of King <hi>Richard.</hi> Beſides, our Anceſtors never thought that procuring Money from
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66111:194"/>
the People ought to commute for robbing the Prince, well-knowing that to be true which my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> has ſince obſerv'd, that theſe Men, ſo dextrous at finding out Projects, and at inventing new Taxes, <note n="*" place="margin">Life <hi>Henry</hi> VII. p. <hi>210.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Our Fore-fathers had good Reaſon to animadvert upon theſe Proceedings; for nothing more tends to corrupt a Country than the eaſie way of getting Wealth by the Profuſion of a Court. It makes Men abandon the Thoughts of raiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Virtue and Merit, and reduces a Nation to the State of which Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">There are but few now that apply themſelves either to do well, or to deſerve well; finding Flattery and Compliance to be the eaſier way to attain their Ends and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Advocates for Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they who give a fair Colour to Corruptions of this Nature, will perhaps urge, that generally the Heirs of ſuch as here are mentioned to have been attainted for theſe Crimes, have been reſtor'd in Blood.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:66111:195"/>
accus'd or coudemn'd. Perhaps, to make the Puniſhment extend beyond the Perſon of the Criminal, is wrong in our Conſtitution; and that all Reſtitutions in Blood whatſoever ought to be favour'd: But Families have been reſtor'd, whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents no Man will pretend to juſtifie. <note n="*" place="margin">Rot.

            <p>'Tis to be apprehended, this Account is rather increaſed than diminiſh'd ſince laſt Year; particularly the Intereſt due
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66111:199"/>
upon <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Bills, and Malt-Tickets will amount to a very conſiderable Sum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides which, there are Arrears of ſeveral kinds, not yet provided for, which will be reckon'd a Debt upon the Nation.</p>
            <p>And over and above all this, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is to be made for the Expences of the current Year.</p>
            <p>But the Honour of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the Credit of the Nation ſeem abſolutely engaged to make good ſeveral Deficiencies, to which we are not only bound by Publick Faith, which ought to be inviolable, but by direct and expreſs Clauſes in Acts of Parliament; ſo that when a Law has Enacted, That ſuch a Debt ſhould be paid by a prefix'd time, all Ways and Means ought to be thought upon to make that Promiſe good, not ſo much for the ſake of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to go a borrowing with (which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments can hardly looſe) but to keep ſacred the Dignity and Majeſty of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>There is no Man will pretend to ſay, but that the Ways and Means of raiſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are extreamly difficult. Almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Branch of our home Conſumption has a Load upon it. Our Foreign Traffick
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66111:200"/>
is already more charg'd than can poſſibly conſiſt wich the Intereſt of a Trading Country. Three Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound, with the ſtrictneſs 'tis now levyed, is ſuch a Weight, that if it be much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continu'd, muſt, in time, certainly ruin all the leſs Free-holders, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt the Gentry of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To lay farther Exciſes upon the ſame Commodities, cannot be done without apparent prejudice to the Duties already granted, the ſame will hold in laying high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Cuſtoms. To charge Land for any long term of Years in times of Peace, is a thing unheard of among our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; and tho' paſt Conduct has made it perhaps unavoidable for ſome Years to come, yet the People will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very ill dealt with by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, if Care be not taken to lay as few Burthens upon their Land as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Some indeed have been of Opinion that the Deficiencies may be ſatisfy'd, and that the Debts may be paid by prolonging the Fonds already granted for a further term of time; but others who love their Country, have thought it diſhonourable and dangerous, that <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſo long pawn'd, and continue for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years in Mortgage. They think it
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:66111:200"/>
not ſafe for our Conſtitution, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with our Civil Rights, that there ſhould be levyed in this Kingdom, for any number of Years, near four Millions annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in Cuſtoms, Exciſes, and ſuch like Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which in ſome future Reign, bad Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may perhaps ſeize upon, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, by ſtopping the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> in order to ſet up an Army, and to ſubſiſt without a Parliament: Of this, good Patriots will be always apprehenſive, and have therefore ever abhorr'd theſe long Fonds, which all the Neighbouring Princes round about us have conſtantly made uſe of for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Liberties of their People.</p>
            <p>Some without Doors, have been for trying ſuch wild Projects, as was that of increaſing the number of <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Bills, which indeed was a good Expedient to lull our Creditors aſleep, and to quiet Things for the preſent, while certain Perſons might have the Opportunity of doing their own Buſineſs, and of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their own Fortunes, but the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick could thereby have reap'd no Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. On the contrary, this Calm in our Affairs, and the not being preſs'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clamorous demands, would have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd and encourag'd ſtill more and more bad Husbandry; and at laſt, the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:66111:201"/>
Debt muſt have come upon us, with the addition of a heavy load of Intereſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (which is unanſwerable) if a War had overtaken the Nation with ſuch a Debt upon it, all due and demandable at a Day, Publick Credit muſt have ſunk at once, upon which would have follow'd Ruin, without Redemption.</p>
            <p>Good Patriots will never think <hi>England</hi> can be effectually reliev'd by any Ways and Means of raiſing Mony, but ſuch as ſhall ſink part of the Principal Debt, and hinder us from being eaten up by that <hi>Canker</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> which has been ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to this Government.</p>
            <p>Nor will <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men (we mean ſuch of 'em as conſider at all) think that Trade can flouriſh, or that Liberty is intirely ſafe, 'till our Payments to the Publick are reduc'd to what they were before the War, <hi>viz.</hi> two Milions Yearly; for this Nation will be ever apprehenſive, That ſuch mighty Sums as we now pay, may hereafter, in the Reign of ſome other Prince, be turn'd againſt the People, tho' given and granted for their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the common Ways and Means of raiſing Money, may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in their future Conſequence, or a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66111:201"/>
preſent Burthen upon the Nation, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports good Patriots to conſider whether or no the Neceſſities of the Government may not be ſupply'd by the Methods which our Anceſtors have ſo frequently put in Practice. By which we mean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no a <hi>Reſumption</hi> of ſuch Lands in <hi>England,</hi> and more eſpecially in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as have lately been granted away from the Crown, would not be a great Relief and Eaſe to the People in their Taxes.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Reſumption</hi> can be made without breaking into the Rules of Juſtice, or without bringing any Reflection upon the King, whoſe Honour above all things ought to be regarded, and if thereby two Millions can be rais'd, to come in the room and place of a Land-Tax, very few People will think it ſtrange for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Authority to <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>exert it ſelf in a matter ſo much for the Common Eaſe and Benefit: And where the Publick is ſo deeply concern'd, but very few Perſons will conſider or conſult the private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of ſuch as have procur'd the Grants. Therefore in handling this Subject, we ſhall endeavour to examin into, and ſtate theſe following Points.</p>

            <p>1ſt. <hi>How far it is conſiſtent with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a Prince to deſire and promote a</hi> Reſumption <hi>by Act of Parliament.</hi> There is nothing more evident in our Hiſtories, than that the moſt magnanimous of our Kings have been the moſt free in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People their Antient Liberties, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as it is now deriv'd down to us, was modell'd by <hi>Henry</hi> the 1ſt, a <note place="margin">Math.

               </note>Prince famous for his Military Virtues, which was confirm'd by <hi>Stephen,</hi> a King active enough in the Field. This Sheet-Anchor of our Liberties, was yet more ſtrengthen'd by <hi>Edward</hi> 3d, as Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as any of our Kings for Perſonal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Victories abroad. That, which
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66111:202"/>
heretofore by Flatterers and Corrupt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters has been call'd <hi>Prerogative,</hi> was never inſiſted upon, but by weak and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Princes, who deſir'd that their Immoderate Appetites of doing Ill, might be juſtifi'd and ſtrengthen'd by more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than was allow'd 'em by the Laws. Magnanimous Kings have always thought, That the Royal Prerogative conſiſted chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Power of doing Good to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of Men, who depend upon their Wiſdom and Courage. <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, that Heroick Prince, who obtain'd the Crown by his own Perſonal Merits, was ſo far from thinking his Prerogative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd by Acts of Grace and Favour, by which good Government might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, that he himſelf deſir'd of the Houſe of Commons, that his whole Privy Council might be named and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed <note place="margin">Rot.

Et qe les dits Chanceller Treſorer &amp; Gardien du Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vee Seale, &amp; autres Officiers, ne facent en tielx Cauſes ſi non per advys du dit Conſil.</hi> The King goes on farther, and deſires his own Authority may be circumſcribed in ſeveral Points; and yet when he made thoſe Conceſſions, he was neither in his Nonage, nor did he doat, nor was he preſs'd by any Inſurrection of the People; and 'tis notorious, he neither wanted Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, nor Courage. But 'tis rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he thought it Honeſt and Wiſe, and no diminution to his Honour, to oblige that People with wholſome Laws and good Government, who had
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66111:203"/>
given him the Crown, and who had been at ſuch Expences to ſupport his Title.</p>
            <p>Magnanimous Kings have not only been Favourers of Publick Liberty, but they have likewiſe been frugal of the Peoples Money, as appears in the Inſtances of <hi>Henry the</hi> 1ſt, <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d, <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 7th, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> which ſhows how wrong their Notion is, who think Wiſe and Thrifty Princes dangerous to the Freedom of a Country, whereas profuſe Kings, ſuch as <hi>John, Henry</hi> the 3d, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, did not ouly waſte the Nations Treaſure, but every one of 'em compell'd the People to fight Pitch'd Battles, in defence of their Civil Rights.</p>
            <p>Gallant Princes deſire to make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eaſie. <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th of <hi>France,</hi> our preſent King's great Grand-Father, ſaid once, he hop'd to order Matters ſo, that every Man in his Kingdom ſhould have a boil'd Capon to his Dinner. None of the Apothegms utter'd by great Men, and ſo much commended by the Antients, could become the Mouth of a King ſo well, as this Noble and Well-natur'd Saying. 'Tis probable, had he liv'd, he would have
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66111:204"/>
brought it about; which if he could have done, 'twould have been a nobler Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phey to his Fame, than all the Victories he had obtain'd. The Honour of a King conſiſts chiefly in doing good to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Body of his People, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Welfare is to weigh with him above all other Reſpects. He is often to diveſt himſelf of the narrow Thoughts which ſway among private Men; and he can hardly be a good Ruler unleſs he does now and then in his Politick, what he would not do in his Natural Capacity. He is a Perſon intruſted by the Common-Wealth, and what he acts in diſcharge of that Truſt, cannot be call'd diſhonourable.</p>
            <p>The Commons in the <hi>Reſumption,</hi> made 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. tell the King in their Bill; <hi>It is for his own Suerty, Honor and Weal, and for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Weal, Eaſe, Reſt, and Suerty of his Land, the which he ought to prefer before the Favour of any Perſon, or any Place, or other thing Earthly.</hi> The ſame Words made a part of the Preamble in moſt-of the other Bills of the like Nature, by which it appears to have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd Senſe of our Anceſtors, that the Reputation of a Prince was never injur'd by Acts wherein the Eaſe and Relief of his People was conſulted: 'Tis true, ſuch a
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66111:204"/>
Miniſter as the Chancellor <hi>de la Pool</hi> had other Sentiments, and gave Advice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind, being willing to countenance his own Depredations by the Example of others: Such as he may engage the King's Honour in the Protection of their Crimes, ſo to ſhelter themſelves under his Wings, and pretend things leſſen his Fame, which will only leſſen their Eſtates: But good Miniſters have always thought that nothing could more hurt the Reputation of a Prince, than to be reduc'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to Courſes, by which his Country muſt be oppreſt with Taxes. 'Twas a common practice with the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> to obſtruct and often to vacate his Maſters Gifts and Grants; yet this great Man was ſufficiently jealous of his Princes Fame. In <hi>Spain, Henry</hi> the <hi>Amirante, Pacieco d' Aſcolone</hi> and <hi>Henry de la Fortuna,</hi> three Grandees, had obtain'd of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> each of em a Million of Livres of Gold, charg'd on the Revenue of <hi>Peru,</hi> and ſhould have receiv'd it at the Return of the Plate-Fleet, but Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <note place="margin">* Bandier le Miniſtere du Card. <hi>Ximenes.</hi>
               </note>annulled theſe immoderate Gifts, tho' <hi>de la Fortuna</hi> was the King's own Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaying; <hi>The Revenue of Princes, tho' great in it ſelf, is always too little for the Neceſſities of the State.</hi> And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66111:205"/>
the <hi>Spaniſh Punto</hi> of Honor, we do not find this Proceeding reſented by King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Before his Greatneſs was ſo eſtabliſh'd, ſeeing a very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Farm of the Silks of <hi>Granada</hi> let for Ten Years, by the Advice of <hi>Don Manuel</hi> the Treaſurer, to which the King had conſented, and which was offer'd at Council to be ſeal'd, he took the Charter and tore it pnblickly (of which the Pieces are kept among the Records of <hi>Arcala,</hi> as a Memorial of this Miniſters Courage and Integrity) ſaying, <hi>Salto,</hi> Don Manuel, <hi>were you not my very good Friend, the King ſhould cauſe your Head to be taken off: Dare you make Grants ſo prejudicial to the State?</hi> Nor did <hi>Phillip the</hi> 1ſt. take it ill that his own, and his Favourites Doings were thus revoked.</p>
            <p>We agree that Princes in all their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to conſider <hi>Fame,</hi> becauſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is one of the main Pillars to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Authority. But let any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man anſwer, Is it not more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a Prince to let the whole People under his Reign, enjoy Eaſe and Plenty, without new Impoſitions and Duties, than to enrich a few Minions and Favourites, with the Spoils of a whole Country? A Prince thirſting after preſent or future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:66111:205"/>
whoſe Example would he deſire to follow? That of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, who by his Frugality brought the Crown of <hi>France</hi> out of Debt; or that of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, who harraſs'd his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to build up four or five great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereby he got no more than to leave behind him ſo many conſpicuous Monuments of his Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>No doubt it has heretofore been thought injurious to the Reputation of a Prince, to be urged by clamorous Debts, to ſuffer many thouſands of miſerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to want what is their due; to have his Troops unpaid, and his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in vaſt Arrears, and to let his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Servants ſtarve, firſt by retrenchments, and then by being without their ſettled Wages and Allowances.</p>
            <p>Theſe are truly Blemiſhes upon a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Glory, and were repreſented as ſuch, by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> aſſembled in Parliament, 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. when they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made Application, That theſe Reflections might be taken away, and that theſe Grievances might be redreſs'd; and affirm'd at the ſame time, That they could not grant any Aid, unleſs the King would actually reſume what had been obtain'd from the Crown by Importunity or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66111:206"/>
upon falſe Suggeſtions, or by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance among the Great ones.</p>
            <p>Seldom any Prince has miſcarry'd in his Fame or Fortune, who has conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued the Publick Good; and who has directed all his Counſels to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys Eaſe and Benefit; but Hiſtory is full of their Troubles and Diſaſters, who have obſtinately adhear'd to a few, againſt the whole, and who have confin'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objects, that Affection which ought to be extended to the univerſal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their People.</p>
            <p>What was done by <hi>Henry</hi> the 1ſt, <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. and by that Hero <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Cordelyon?</hi> What was done by that Conqueror of <hi>France, Henry</hi> the 5th? What that Spirited and Martial Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, deſir'd his Parliament in a Speech from the Throne, to put in Execution, and which he thanked them afterwards for doing, can never be thought diſhonourable in any other King; and among <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, a Prince will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer in his preſent, or future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, for treading in their Steps, and following their Examples.</p>

And without doubt, theſe Noble and Warlike Princes did not think the Regal Power at all impair'd, by giving Way to the <hi>Reſumptions</hi> which were made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Reigns; for in all theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the Legiſlative Authority, Lords and Commons do but act ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viently under a King for his Profit, <note place="margin">

            <p>The Writer of theſe Papers has not leiſure to inquire into the Particulars, but according to the beſt of his Remembrance, a diſtribution of Lands was made to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, concern'd in ſuppreſſing the Inſurrections which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> made during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And moſt certainly, the War <hi>England</hi> had with that Kingdom in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 1ſt, was in a great meaſure carryed on by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſubſcribed here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a view, that the Subſcribers ſhould have the Lands Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd and forfeited, which afterward, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had and the reſt was devided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Soldiers in ſatisfaction of their Debentures.</p>
            <p>In our preſent Caſe the War was not either begun, or carry'd on at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:66111:212"/>
of any Single Perſon, or private Men, but at the common Charges of the whole Nation; therefore in Reaſon and Juſtice the People of <hi>England</hi> ought here to be look'd upon as the General Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers: That the Four Millions levied and expended, is their Adventure, of which the Forfeited Eſtates ought to be the Return; and if any thing conſiderable can be made of 'em, it ought to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eaſing <hi>England</hi> in its Taxes.</p>
            <p>But there is a ſtrong Reaſon of State why the Lands of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in caſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, ſhould never be granted away, but be either deſtributed among Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, or ſold towards defraying the Charges of the War; for if <hi>England</hi> is to be at all the Expence, and Courtiers are to go away with all the Profit, how do we know but that hereafter, for their own Gain, they may purpoſely and adviſedly encourage and Foment Rebellions there? Fourteen Hundred thouſand Pound, once in Thirty or Forty Years, to be ſhared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, would be a very fine Crop for the Men in Buſineſs. But probably the Miniſters in future Ages will be watchful over that Kingdom, and ſuppreſs an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection betimes (when it may be done for a leſs Sum than Four Millions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with three or four Thouſand Men)

               <hi>3dly.</hi> How far in an Act of Reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption it is juſt and reaſonable to look backwards.</p>
            <p>In matters of Government 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſafeſt Courſe to tread in the Steps of our Anceſtors, were it only for this ſingle Reaſon, that 'tis return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far towards our Antient Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which all ſides will agree to have been form'd with admirable Gravity and Wiſdom. In the preſent Queſtion we ſhall therefore ſee (as far we can find in old Hiſtories, or in the Records) how our Forefathers proceeded in Acts of the like Nature, for which we have recited our Authorities in the third Section.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the 1ſt. reſum'd ſuch Lands as his Brother Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> who was an eaſy Prince, had beſtowed in <hi>Normandy</hi> upon undeſerving Perſons. But we do not find he touch'd upon any thing that had been done by his Father, or by <hi>William Rufus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stephen</hi> was preſs'd by the Nation, as well as by <hi>Henry Fitz Empreſs,</hi> to reſume only his own Grants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. reſumed the Grants of <hi>Stephen,</hi> but the matter had been agreed upon in the preceeding Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:66111:219"/>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the 1ſt. did only reſume the Alienations he himſelf had made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. was perſwaded by his Barons to reſume what had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away by King <hi>John</hi> his Father, a Prince ſo profuſe, that in a manner he had quite undone the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Reſumption made by <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d. had relation only to what was done in his own Reign,</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. the Commons indeed pray that the Gifts of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. to unworthy Perſons might be look'd into, which perhaps was done in reſpect of the dotage and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this great Prince fell into the laſt Ten Years of his Life. But what had been worthily beſtowed was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. the Petition of the Commons was, that the Reſumption might look as far backward as the 40th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. and therefore we ſee it came to nothing, and only ended in taking the Profits of all the Lands and Penſions granted for one Year.</p>
            <p>The Reſumptions made in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. extended only to the firſt Day of his coming to the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:66111:220"/>
'Tis true, the Commons in their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. pray that the Reſumption might extend to the Reigns of all the three <hi>Henries,</hi> and the Act paſs'd accordingly: But we may plainly ſee this was chiefly done to condemn their Titles to the Crown; And the Reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption retroſpecting ſo far, was found ſo impracticable, that in the 3d. and 4th. of his Reign, a new Act became neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which look'd no further backward than the 4th of <hi>March,</hi> in the firſt Year of his own Reign.</p>
            <p>The Reſumption made by <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. does indeed look as far backward as 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and ſo takes in the Grants of <hi>Richard</hi> the 3d. and <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. But becauſe there paſſed four ſeveral Acts of the ſame Nature in the Reign of <hi>Edward,</hi> we may preſume that this long Retroſpect could not affect any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of Families, and that it was chiefly level'd at thoſe who by Power and Intereſt in <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign ſtill kept the Crown-Lands, and who perhaps, by new Grants from <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> had defeated the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of former Parliaments.</p>
            <p>The Reader may ſee, that in theſe Reſumption moſt of the Preſidents reach
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:66111:220"/>
only to the preſent, or to the Reign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding, which is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of all Nations, that have prefixt ſome limited time, after which Men ſhould think themſelves ſafe and quiet in their Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>They without Doors who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd that forfeited Eſtates of <hi>Ireland</hi> might not be look'd into, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to obſt ruct the good Intentions of the Parliament, by crying we are willing to Reſume, <hi>provided you will go far enough backwards: We ſhall join in it if you will take in all the Grants ſince the Reſtoration of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> But few are ſo ſhort ſighted as not to ſee into this Artifice; ſuch as are for making their Reſumption ſo large, deſire none at all, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a great many different Titles to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>If it could poſſibly conſiſt with the Rules of Juſtice, if to do ſo would not produce unſpeakable Diſorders, if it would not utterly ruin a great number of Families, no doubt, the Publick la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under ſo many Debts, and Difficulties, ſuch a general Reſumption would be adviſable, all which are ſtrong
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:66111:221"/>
Objections to the making it ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p>To which may be anſwer'd, that the ſame Inconveniences will happen by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forfeitures; we ſhall therefore try to ſhew how the Caſes differ.</p>
            <p>But to clear theſe Points we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat ſome things that have been laid down in the foregoing part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>That the Kings of this Realm have always preſcribed a Power of alienating the Crown-Revenue by their Great Seals.</p>
            <p>That it would not have been conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in the beginning of this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to have bound up the Prince's Hands from all kind of Alienations, for then, by Forfeitures and Attainders, in proceſs of time, the King would have been Lord of the whole Soil.</p>
            <p>That however, Parliments by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Bills or Acts of Reſumption, have all along laid in a claim of the People's Intereſt in this Revenue, eſpecially when the Grants were become exorbitant.</p>
            <p>That the Waſts committed upon the Crown-Revenue produced at laſt <hi>[viz.</hi>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:66111:221"/>
11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.] a poſitive Law porhibiting theſe ſort of Alienations.</p>
            <p>That the force of the Law was eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Clauſes of <hi>non obſtante</hi> incerted in the Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>That theſe Clauſes ſeem condemn'd by the late Act for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. came in, the Doctrine of the Court was, <hi>ſow a little that you may reap much,</hi> and they who were then intruſted with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Purſe, were themſelves for diving into the Princes Pocket. And at the ſame time the Doctrine of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> was to advance the Prerogative as high as poſſible; thus the King was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to give away the greateſt part of his Crown Lands, and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> the People were encouraged to think ſuch Grants were good in Law, the Courtier begg'd and the Citizen bought, ſo that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he was in a manner diveſted of all, and yet they who had ſuffer'd for him and his Father, were few of 'em the better for all this immoderate Bounty.</p>
            <p>Theſe Liberalities of his were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd as the Recompence of antient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:66111:222"/>
but were often the Price of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and the Rewards of Vice. And as <hi>Cyrus</hi> obſerv'd, that in Camps the moſt worthleſs Souldiers are the buſieſt to get Plunder, ſo the ſame thing may be ſaid of a Court expos'd to Spoil, the worſt Men in it are the moſt ravenous and generally make the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation we have now made, did apparently hold true as to King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Court; however ill-gotten Goods ſeldom thrive, and very little of what was thus obtain'd remains with the firſt Poſſeſſors, but is now diſpers'd into a Multitude of Hands.</p>
            <p>Though what he did was ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Crown yet ſuch was then the flouriſhing Condition of our Affairs, that we could bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a great deal of ill Management. Beſides ſome were glad enough to ſee a young Prince neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to depend upon his People, who was apprehended to meditate arbitrary Power. But whatever govern'd the Councels of thoſe times, certain it is that there was no actual Bar put in the Way of his deſtructive Bounty.</p>
            <p>'Tis true (as we have noted in the third Section) 'twas complain'd of, but
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:66111:222"/>
all ended in an Addreſs which had very little in it of the Spirit which our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had ſhewn upon the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Leave was given at the beginning of that Reign to bring in a Bill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; A Bill was twice read, to regulate and reſtrain ſuch Alienations, and an Addreſs was thereupon made, but no conſequence following upon all this, the People of <hi>England</hi> had reaſon to believe that the Parliament acquieſced in what was done at Court.</p>
            <p>The matter did not only Sleep then, but was not, as we can find, afterwards reviv'd, and for many Years it was hardly mention'd in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, inſomuch that Eſtates, though ſo newly deriv'd from the Crown, came in a ſhort ſpace of Time to bear almoſt an equal value with any other ſort of Land.</p>
            <p>But if, as in ancient times, ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Court had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of from Seſſions to Seſſions, if, as heretofore, the Miniſters that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Grants, had been impeach'd, if Bills of Reſumption had been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd though rejected, ſuch Motions would have been ſome Warning to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66111:223"/>
the Nation, the Purchaſers would have look'd about 'em, every Man muſt have known the Hazzard he was to undergo, and he can only accuſe himſelf, who will run into it, when before hand he is acquainted with the Danger.</p>
            <p>But the Legiſlative Authority conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſo long ſilent in the matter, and the Lawyers of thoſe times making no Objection to Titles of this Sort, depending upon their <hi>Ex certa Scientia, mero Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, &amp; Gratia ſpeciali,</hi> and yet more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Clauſes of <hi>non obſtante,</hi> the People were induced to think they might as ſafely make theſe as any other Sort of Purchaſes.</p>
            <p>Hence it was that what belong'd to the Crown but ſo lately, came to be a matter of Publick Traffick among the People, inſomuch that the whole Fortune of very many Families is therein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What</hi> Cato <hi>ſaid is indeed true, if rightly diſtinguiſh'd, that there ought to be no praeſcription againſt the Publick.</hi>

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:66111:225"/>
and in a tract of Time the People was accuſtomed to theſe Eſtabliſhments; but <hi>Cataline</hi> and his Accomplices, not out of Love to the Common-wealth, <note place="margin">Vit.

            </p>
            <p>In the ſame manner moſt certainly King <hi>Charles</hi> acted againſt the Truſt of his high Office, in permitting ſuch a Spoil to be made of his and the Nations Revenue, but no good Man who loves the Peace and Quiet of his Country would deſire to unravel what has been done ſo many Years ago, and in which ſo many Thouſands are concern'd. The Evil is grown too big for Correction, 'Tis like a Diſeaſe which is become in a manner part of the Conſtitution, of which to attempt the Cure would be to kill the Patient. They whoſe Duty it
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:66111:225"/>
was to take Care of the Body Politick have ſuffer'd the Diſtemper to proceed too far. By the Negligence of the State which for Forty Years together has let this Matter go on without Check and Inquiry, moſt of thoſe who are in Poſſeſſion of Grants from King <hi>Charles</hi> are now Poſſeſſors <hi>bona fide</hi> and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors upon a valuable Conſideration. Were they now in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe who had firſt procured the Grants, no doubt according to the Conſtitution of this Kingdom they might juſtly be reſumed. But the Caſe is notoriouſly quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; in the ſpace of Forty Years moſt of thoſe Eſtates have been ſold over and over, and from time to time have paſs'd through ſo many Hands, that a Reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the 1ſt. Day of his Reign (as they propoſe who would load this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to perplex and defeat it) cannot be made without breaking into ſo many private Contracts, Marriage Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Jointures Mortgages, and Sales for Valuable Conſideration, that there is hardly any Tax which probably the People of <hi>England</hi> would not conſent to, rather than bring ſo vaſt a Diſorder and Ruin upon ſuch a number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:66111:226"/>
From what has been here laid down it will appear to any diſintereſted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Grants and thoſe lately made do not ſtand upon the ſame Foot, and that the Caſes differ in many and very material Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>1ſt. The Law is perhaps otherwiſe now than the common and receiv'd Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it then was, but, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, 'tis ſubmitted to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the long Robe to determin in that Point.</p>
            <p>2dly. What King <hi>Charles</hi> had done was winked at, becauſe the flouriſhing Trade, Wealth of the Nation and its long Peace might bear ſuch Gifts which were not to be ſupply'd by new and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Taxes. But our preſent Condition is not the ſame, there was not then rais'd upon the People quite two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>per Annum. England</hi> of late has paid, and for ſome time to come will pay, at leaſt Five Millions <hi>per Annum.</hi> The Publick had not then been exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and was not in Debt; we have in Ten Years actually levyed Thirty Millions and ſtill owe near Twenty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, above four of which are not yet provided for.</p>
            <p>3dly. The Nation ſeem'd to acquieſce

in what King <hi>Charles</hi> had done, for tho' ſomething was mov'd at firſt to reſtrain and regulate Alienations from the Crown the matter had little Progreſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we have not heard it was puſhed on with any Vigour, the Claim was not ſo ſtrongly made as by the Rules of Juſtice to take away from the Poſſeſſors any Pretences to Praeſcription. But in our preſent Caſe a ſolemn Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance has been given from the Throne, <hi>That no grant ſhould be made of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Lands in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>till there ſhould be another Opportunity of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Matter in Parliament in ſuch manner as ſhould be thought expedient.</hi> Afterwards, as we have ſhewn, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was preſented that no Grant might be made of the forfeited Lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And almoſt in every Seſſions a Claim has been put in by the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the People, and as we have ſet forth Twelve ſeveral Bills have been preſented and read all tending to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate theſe Forfeitures to the uſes of the War. So that the new Poſſeſſors of theſe Eſtates cannot pretend that any Silence has given a Sanction to what has been done, or that a quiet and unqueſtiond enjoyment has ſo far confirm'd their
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:66111:227"/>
Right as that thereby they may plead Praeſcription. If any of theſe Lands have been ſold or traffick'd about the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers cannot plead Ignorance; by the Steps made in Parliament they could not but know they bought a litigated Title; the ſame may be ſaid as to Marriage, Settlements, Jointures, or any other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil contract that has Relation to the Grants lately made.</p>
            <p>4thly. What Crown-Lands K. <hi>Charles</hi> gave away deſcended lineally to him from his Anceſtors, The Iriſh Forfeitures have been lately purchas'd with the Blood and Treaſure of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If any Man could think that a Reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption retroſpecting ſo far as the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> Il's Reign would be for the Publick Good, why has it been never ſet afoot or mention'd at any other time but when the Parliament had a deſire, by a Reſumption in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to eaſe the People in their Taxes?</p>
            <p>All the Premiſſes conſider'd, perhaps it will appear to any unbiaſs'd Perſon who deſires to help the Affairs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by a Reſumption, That, to follow the greateſt Number of Preſidents and according to the Rules of Prudence and Juſtice, the Bill ought to look no farther
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:66111:227"/>
backwards than this, or the Reign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding.</p>
            <p>We hope to have made it evident in the Series of this Diſcourſe, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Conſtitution of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the late Grants may be reſumed, We have produc'd variety of Preſidents to juſtify ſuch a Proceeding. 'Tis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped we have given them a full Anſwer who would engage the Kings Honour in Countenancing their Depredations upon the Publick. Peradventure we have produc'd undeniable Proofs that the People of <hi>England</hi> have an Intereſt in theſe Lands, and Perhaps we have ſilenc'd thoſe, who to clog a good thing, would put us upon a wrong ſcent, by propoſing to look farther backwards than in Juſtice and Reaſon we ought to do.</p>
            <p>And, if we have made out all theſe Poſitions, it will not be difficult for good Engliſhmen to think, inferr, and conclude, That more eſpecially the forfeited Eſtates in Ireland ought to be apply'd towards Payment of the Publick Debts.</p>
            <p>The Writer of theſe Papers, from the firſt time he bent his Studies to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:66111:228"/>
of this Nature, has all along endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to propoſe ſuch Ways and Means of raiſing Mony as might give eaſe to the Landed Intereſt of which he hopes what he has formerly publiſh'd is a ſufficient Evidence.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the freedom and Sincerity with which he has handled theſe Points may have drawn upon him powerful enmities but if he has given any Hints by which <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may ſave two Millions and remain this Yearwithout a Land Tax, he ſhall think his Labour well employ'd, and little value the diſpleaſure of Particular and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted Perſons, whoſe, Reſentments ought truly not to fall upon him, but rather upon thoſe whoſe general ill Conduct has made ſo rough a thing as a Reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary.</p>
            <p>However he who looks into any Male adminiſtration ſtirs up a Neſt of Hornets. If any one be touch'd who has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in Procuring Grants all that have participated in his Guilt will be alarm'd, <note place="margin">Tacit. Hiſt. l. <hi>4.</hi>

belonging to theſe Grants well worth the Knowledge of good Patriots; the Writer of theſe Papers is not quite without Materials for it: Nor is he at all withheld by any of thoſe private and mean Fears which commonly obſtruct National Deſigns, but the Truth is he has not this time had leiſure to put ſo Dark and Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icate a matter into any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Method.</p>
            <p>The Manner of procuring ſeveral of the Iriſh Forfeitures has been as criminal by its Circumſtances, as in itsſelf; but of this at another Seaſon. To look into the Depredations lately committed is ſo copious a ſubject, that he who bends his Thoughts this way, is ſure to have matter enough before him; and if all things were well examin'd, it would perhaps be found that the Reſumption here propos'd is not the only way of raiſing Mony to eaſe the People in their Taxes.</p>
            <p>There have been of late Years given in Parliament upwards of Fifty Millions. This immenſe Summ as we all know, has been tranſmitted into two Offices for the uſe of the War. And by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition into thoſe Offices peradventure ſomething very conſiderable is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</p>

The Author thinks he cannot employ his Hours of Leiſure more to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's Service than in Inquiries of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And next Year (if he finds a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of theſe Foul Practices which have been ſo deſtructive to <hi>England,</hi> and ſo prejudicial to the King's Intereſt) he purpoſes to open a new Scene: That Zeal for the Publick which has now warm'd him ſhall not in the leaſt cool, and though he ſhould be left to ſtand alone, he will ſtill combat on, and neither ask nor give Quarter in the Conflict he intends to maintain with the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Age.</p>
