            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the firmament, his necke, shoulders, and vpper parts in the heauens, his armes and hands reaching to East and West, his belly in the whole spaciousnesse vnder the Moone, his legges and feet within the earth. But for that the discourse or discouery of this secret, with the agreeable references to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise therof, falleth not within the line wherwith I haue listed and bounded this Treatise; I wil only from this obseruation of Gods owne imitating of himselfe in the likenesse of the lesse with the greater,<note place="margin">Gods imitating of himselfe, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for our imitating of him</note> gather and infer that which giueth groundworke vnto my purpose: That the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensible wisdome of God, in the composing &amp; ordering of his works in nature, hath so dignified them with all perfection, as that they be left vnto vs as eminent and exemplary patterns, as well for the consolidating, as for the beautifying of that wee worke by arte or policie; as well for conioyning of all discordances into firmenesse, as also for the applyablenesse of particulars in their many seruices, for the vse and beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the whole. It is beyond the compasse of any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that in the morall vertues Christes actions are our instructions; and no lesse may the like rule hold, that in the contriuing of a prudent gouernment, the impressions and footsteps of Gods wisdome (which in things naturall wee contemplate by study) be in the poynt of regiment, our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories for imitation. Wherefore seeing that the vttermost extent of mans vnderstanding, can shape no better forme of ordering the affayres of a State, than by marking and matching of the workes of the finger of God, eyther in the larger volume of the vniuersall, or in the abridgement thereof, the body of man: I account these two to be the two great lights for enquiry and meditation concerning this businesse, and doe worthily omit all other worthlesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, as inferiour starrelights, which oftentimes seduceth


<pb facs="tcp:2682:3"/>
by their dimnesse, and at their best are but deriuatiue and subalterne vnto these. And of these two also (as not daring to gaze too much vpon the Sunne,<note place="margin">Man the fittest patterne to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a ciuill state.</note> and vnable in mine own weakenesse to run the round of such a large co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe) I haue made my choyce to pursue only those applyances, which from the so skilfull workemanship of God in man, may bee well apted to the ciuill gouernment of the assemblies of men: which being of more facilitie to bee vnderstood (as deduced from a more familiar example) and equalling the other both in dignitie (hauing the same authour) and in certayntie (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the fitnesse of their relation) may also sort both agreeably with other mens likings (as bred in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes) and with mine intentions, which seeketh wholy a demonstratiue plainenesse.</p>
            <p>This similitude was both fitly and fortunatly enforced by <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Agrippa his tale of the parts of the body. Liuius lib. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> who being imployed in the appeasing and persuading of the seditious reuoulting commons of Rome, did by a very tale of this proportionable respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the parts in mans body, and the mutualitie of kindnes and ayd afforded from each to other, so sensibly shew them their errour, that surseasing their malignant enuy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were inraged against their rulers (whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as the idle belly that swallowed the labors of their hands) they discerned at the last, that their repining against, and their pining of that belly, whence was distributed vnto them their bloud and nourishment, necessarily tended to their owne destruction; and were thereuppon forthwith reclaymed into their bounds of obedience. The like compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison is most diuinely enlarged by a much better Orator,<note place="margin">The like compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons vsed in the scriptures. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> and in a much more important poynt of the vnseparable vnion of the members of Christ with their head, and of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary communion of their distinct gifts and works amongst

themselues; yea, it hath pleased God himselfe for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation in some measure of his vnmeasurable infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; the incomprehensible nature of his dietie, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe vnto vs as it were some glimse thereof, by this selfe same well agreeing semblance, drawne and borrowed from our weak, mortall, and sinfull bodies. His omni-science is set forth by an all-seeing eye, his omnipotencie by a mightie and outstretched arme, his mercy by the cheerefulnesse of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing countenance, his bountie by the opening of his hand, and filling of all things with his blessings: by which so apt tipes he openeth for our more easie vnderstanding, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnesse of his attributes, and (as I may say) the mysteries of his essence.</p>
            <p>I need not spend any speech in the praise of such familiar and well pleasing illustrations:<note place="margin">In praise of such comparisons.</note> looke but vpon that exsupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and not attainable by humane powers wisdome of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> is not the brightest apparance thereof in compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue parables? but behold a greater than <hi>Salomon,</hi> who without parables spake nothing to them; as if both the depth and delicacie of wits inuention for either prouing or persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, consisted chiefely in such equipolling and Parabolicall applications. It remayneth that before I proceed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing or presenting vpon the Stage of State the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes themselues, to be scanned and considered of, (which I wish may proue themselues right paralele) I do for aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage enterline first a Caution, then a Limitation: My Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is,<note place="margin">A Caution against cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitudes.</note> That no man in streyning too hard, do force the bloud, where he is offered milke. It is easie for a curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iector, euen in the fittest comparisons to make disseuerance by inferring different respects and inequallitie. The dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of things be infinite, and rometh with errour in the circumference, where the well apted likenesse setleth in


<pb facs="tcp:2682:4"/>
the center of truth, and is compacted closely in one onely point of good congruitie, from the which it may neither be drawne awry without wrongfull wresting, nor enlarged too far without extreame torturing. It is the greatest miracle of Gods powerfull wisdome, in the innumerable formes of things, to make so infinite variation; Then it must needs be a great worke of the wit of man, in such multiplicitie of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to find out the well agreeing semblances, To knit and match together sundry things by an aptnesse of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the proper effect of vnion; but to disioyne the well coupled from their louely analogie of each to other, is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diuorce and distraction: Therefore let such makebates (if any be) abate their humor of crossing with dissimilitudes, &amp; content their conceits with that which they shall discerne to be matched with a right mirror, and representingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the shew of a good concordance.</p>
            <p>My Limitation is,<note place="margin">A limitation not to striue too far.</note> That it be not exacted or expected of me, so mincingly to manage this matter, as that vnto euery particuler part or facultie of our humane nature, I must needs find out in the States bodie some seuerall members or braunches entirely matchable to the same; like a picture to be newly drawne by a former patterne, conforming therewith in euery line, shape, or shadow. We vse to say that one man is like an other, if but the faces, yea the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or figures, yea the frownes or smyles, yea the casting of the eyes, or any other shewes in their visages doe seeme to agree, though in other respects or parts there be betwixt them rather apparant repugnances, than any right resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; Then let no man think that I will so be put to my shifts, or that I will impose my selfe so hard a taske, as (by descending to each singuler or indiuiduall) to find for it an euen yoak-fellow, or well matching companion, that may


<pb facs="tcp:2682:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
serue as a relatiue or representatiue vnto it, by the aptnesse of propriety: The which labour as it would be endlesse in toile, so would it be no lesse needlesse in vse; and I hope it will suffice, so to compare or make parity betweene the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Naturall and Politique, that each part may be brought in rather easilie entreated, than streiningly intruded; and rather agreeing naturally, than forced violently. Therefore omitting all industrious curiousity, and friuolous affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of following too far (where yet I must needs fall short;) I onely desire, that where I shall shew a reciprocall likenesse of habitude, affection, or disposition; there the similitude may passe approued, and induce assent: and that where these may not readily be had, there I may find such curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous construction, as that I may neither be charged with partiality of concealing (where it is meet I should be mute) nor be suspected of vnsufficiencie for not pursuing where I can find no footing.</p>
            <p>It is vnfallable what I propound for my first principle, That in euery particular person, there is both the seed and similitude of a State incorporat, yet to imagine or seeke for in each seuered or subdeuided parts, such affinitie and fitnesse betwixt them, as may mutually illustrate each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; were not to tune but to crack the strings, and to make <hi>quidlibet ex quodlibet,</hi> or, <hi>ex quouis ligno Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi> Modestie and discretion bindeth vs to a stint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the which if we shall stretch or streine,<note place="margin">Of enforcing a similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse.</note> we may iustly be said to haue borrowed of the wyer-drawers: we must not compell our applications there to shake hands and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, where discrepance of nature hath estranged and set apart. Were it not ridiculous for absurditie, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for impietie, if in that serious similitude of Christs comming to Iudgement like a theefe in the night, we should


<pb facs="tcp:2682:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(beyond the ge<gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>inall agreeablenesse of their vnlooked for stealing vpon vs) in other most vngodly sences linke in Christ in likenesse with a theefe? Or if that other notable parable of the vniust Steward, were (from the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his prouident preuention) racked with other refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to make his deceiptfulnesse also praise-worthy; who would not conuince such vnfit and lefthanded handling, both of wildnesse in wit, and wickednesse of hart? To conclude, I will knit vp this point thus, That in the knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and according of things diuers into one point of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (making by such their enterchangeable lendings of like reason and respect, a lightsomnesse of proofe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) we must auoid their diuersities as sands and rocks, and keep the right channell of an allowed likenesse; which will conduct vs both safely and delightsomly in this course of comparing.</p>

But beyond all this, the meaning of that sage sentence extendeth yet farther, That in the very composure of man, there is manifestly discouered a summary abstract of absolute perfection, by the which as by an excellent Idea, or an exact rule, we may examine and exemplifie all other things.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:2682:9"/>The Mathematicians haue found out by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of the beautious and vniforme proportion of the body of man, and by the symetrie of the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, their true scantlines and dimensions; yea by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in his full length, &amp; then spreading the armes and legges to their widest compasse, they haue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both the perfect square, and the exact circle: The square, by foure right lines at the foure vttermost points of the hands and feet; the circle, by rounding a line a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout those points, placing the center of their compasse vpon the nauell. The naturall Philosophers reduceth the vastnesse of the vniuersal (comprehending all things that hath either being, or vegitation, or sence, or reason) vnto this same well compacted Epitome of mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifacture.</p>

Therefore this measure (thus induced thereto) I haue made my choice of, to trie thereby the forme of a commonweale, what therein is right or wrye, what redundant or defectiue, what orderly or disproportionable; the helpe of such a briefe, and the trueth of such a standerd, may serue to ballance the matters of deliberation, fitly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating and rectifying all designements and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

Where all will rule, there is no rule, and where none doeth rule, there is all misrule: but to rule well, and to bee well ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is the surest bond of humane societie.<note place="margin">Impugners of magistracie.</note> Such vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routs, as (humourously led in dislikes) denyeth the lawfulnesse of Magistrats, may well bee likened to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne peeuish Male-contents, who ouertoyled with the tediousnesse of life (and that often without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cause) wisheth that they had no soules, it being all one to want in the body a soule, and in the state a gouernour: yet as the body sustayneth no harme or wrong,<note place="margin">Magistracie worketh the good of the people.</note> yea is infinitly benefited and graced by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull working of the soule in his organs; so the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple guided by a iust gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not only are not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by iniured, hindered or abased, but much enabled, eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and aduanced euen to the highest pitch of a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and safe repose.<note place="margin">Mutual offices between soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and subiect.</note> Then as the soule is the forme which to the body giueth being, and essence; and the body is the matter which desiringly affecteth his forme: so both the ruler should wholy indeuour the welfare of his people, and the subiect ought (as in loue to his owne soule) to conforme vnto his soueraigne; that both of them mutually like twinnes of one wombe, may in

It can neuer bee so much as conceaued, that the soule should be without reason, though by the vnaptnes or repugnancie of the organs, his power in working is either interrupted or impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: So gouernment may not bee so much as imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be without law, though the force and life of the law, through the waywardnesse of the subiects, cannot alwayes alike be shewed or seene in his due effects: no not the Soueraigne will infringe lawes, no more than the soule will renounce reason.

            <p>It is worthie the noting,<note place="margin">The Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns loue to their subiects.</note> that albeit the bodie doeth often vnthankefully rebell against the soule, yet the soule euer loueth the body, still seeking to reduce it to the better, euen as a workeman mendeth his tooles, or a Musician his Instruments: whereof good Rulers doe make to themselues this rule, That notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the subiects by their misbehauiour do often cause an incitation to wrath in their Soueraign against them, yet in the punishing of such offenders, he will discouer no hatred to their persons, but to their faults, shewing himselfe grieued and vnwilling to afflict them, seeking rather their chasticement with pitie, than their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with crueltie, and rather to hold a coniunction with them by the mutualitie of louing offices, than to weaken his owne strength by the losse and cutting off the imployable parts of the state publike.<note place="margin">The soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns care of their subiects welfare.</note> The welfare and prosperitie of the bodie giueth to the soule sweet contentment, as secured thereby from the cares, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and griefes which want occasioneth: so the plentifull and abundant estate of the subiects, is by a good Soueraigne both maintayned and reioyced at, sith it giueth to him assurance of supply and comfort in all necessities.</p>
            <p>In the creating of man,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie.</note> God is said to haue breathed into him the soule, whereby the puritie and dignitie

            <p>It was not in the power of the body either to chuse or refuse the soule, but his right of admission depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only on the pleasure of his imediate maker.<note place="margin">Soueraignes ordained by God.</note> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to force the consequence so farre, as wholy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre the peoples liking or electing of their gouernors: yet somewhat to temper the harshnesse, and to restrain the rashnesse of some peremptorie pragmatikes, I may be bold from that auerment of the soules imbreathing, to propound this application comparatiuely from thence inferred, That in this high poynt of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie, God hath reserued to himselfe this prerogatiue ofbestowing that dignitie, according to his owne most vnscrutable counsell: By me (saith he) Kings do raigne.

True it is, that euen in the same phrases all things may be sayd to bee of God, and from God, as the authour, creator, preseruer, and disposer thereof: yet when we find him to single out and appropriat any onething

more especially vnto his owne designements, wee are there to take notice of his greater respectiuenesse, and his ouerswaying greatnesse in the disposing and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that matter beyond the orders and limitations of lawes or customes; yea in such a case he conformeth the secundarie causes, to cooperate with him to his owne ends: as when he framed the peoples hearts, and the concurrance of their consents in the electing of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto the kingly office, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he had before himselfe appointed and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that function. Wherefore as the soule notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the mediate meanes of procreation, is vsually sayd to bee infused from aboue into the body: so the Soueraigne euen in his particular parson, but much more the soueraigne authoritie may notwithstanding the approbation of men, or any other assisting helps in the establishing thereof, be rightly auouched to bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and designed by God himselfe.</p>

Euen that facultie of vegetation (which seemeth so base and drossie, and to hold most of the earthlinesse of the body) hath yet his originall root and plantation in the soule, whether wee consider the same in the power nutritiue for preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in the augmentatiue for perfection, or in the generatiue for multiplication, we shall find it wholy to flow from this fountain: with the nutritiue power must concurre appetition, digestion, retention, and expulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In digestion is required an immutation, a formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an assimilation; in all which so necessarie and fundamentall functions of life, the soule euidently bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth foorth his effecting force, sith neyther without a soule, nor with any more soules than one, the bodie of it selfe could possibly, either so orderly and concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly contriue his owne good by so helpfull meanes, or performe such worthy actions by any natiue vigor. The sensitiue facultie is much more sensibly discerned to take discent from the soule. The sences are as the dores and windowes through and forth of the which he maketh his prospects and passages; yea their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is so vnseparablie annexed vnto the soule, that where he diuerteth himselfe, and giueth no attention, there the eye seeing seeth not, the eare hearing heareth not, and all other acts of any sences, be voyd of percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or apprehending.</p>

There is not in the Commonwealth, any the least synew for mocion, the least vaine for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, the least spirite for life and action, the least strength for defence, or offence, the least member for vse and benefit, which is not replenished with this power, and sucketh from this ouerflowing cesterne, all his subsistance and performance.

Opinion is the forerunner (if not the father) of affections,<note place="margin">Opinion.</note> himselfe a verie misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, between Selfe-loue the mother, and Supposall the sire, which (like an amorous make-loue) woeth at once both the virgin Truth, and the harlot Errour, yet affianced to neither, hath but vnperfect notions betwixt both; from which notions notwithstanding, as the same shall apprehend a conceit of good or euill, the affections taking motion, do start forth, putting


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2682:17"/>
themselues in readines, to repell the imagined euill, and to embrace the seeming good. Vpon the surmise of good, Appetites are excited: These be the attendants, and as it were the Courtiers of the soule,<note place="margin">Sutors in Court like Appetites.</note> who immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately seeking to satisfie their own desires, giueth the soule no rest, till he bestow all his faculties of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wit, and deuise, to accomplish their requests: Princes seldome want the Apes of such appetites, that is to say, begging and flattering petitioners, pleasing and applauding Parasites, who vsing all cunning insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, are neuer without their varietie of sutes, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance their owne good, howsoeuer their Soueraigne be thereby either impouerished or dishonored. Vpon the opinion of euill ariseth that hidious &amp; snakie head of <hi>Medusa,</hi> fearfull, fretfull, greeuing, carefull, repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and dispairing thoughts, filling the soule with the horror of much discomfiture; such malecontents and froward cinicks the Soueraigne oft is pestered with,<note place="margin">Malecontents.</note> who neuer well pleased with the aucthorized procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, (though most approueable) doe still feed vpon their owne disliking conceits, and will alwaies with the Keistrell, flie against the winde, making their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicion (by clamorous complaints) against aucthoritie. These affections of both sorts, being in their originall altogether oppinionat, will sometimes (by reason of the neerenesse that opinion hath vnto reason) make bold to alleage reason for themselues,<note place="margin">Pretenses in treason.</note> and will seeme to be iudicious &amp; iust in their intendements. This wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his semblance (as in the natures before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) so chiefely in some Traitors of better place, who knowing their dignities in neernesse to the Prince, and of commaund in their Countries, will take vpon them


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2682:18"/>
(though intending their owne end) to pretend equitie &amp; honestie, yea, and the Soueraignes aucthoritie also, giuing out a populer pretext of publique good, onely to make way thereby to their foule treasons.</p>
            <p>The mind hath yet one endowment more, which almost equalleth all the rest;<note place="margin">Records and their imbezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</note> which is a faithfull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his fore-attainted knowledges, in whose good trust and custodie, he treasureth vp all his rich acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: what semblance there is thereof also in the soule of State, it cannot be obscure. The Soueraigne is well stored with remembrancers, nothing passeth from him, or setleth in him but by record; All his seates of Iudgement entereth and preserueth the proceedings in causes; and to forge, corrupt, or embezill the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes (whereof any good gouernment hath a tender and strict regard) what is it else, Than as if the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie should be cleane taken from the mind, to the which it is vnseperable, or should become a lying misrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which nor his nature, nor his office can endure.</p>
            <p>These faculties the soule doth shew and exercise, in and with the organs of the body, but he hath a farther and more inlarged force,<note place="margin">Prerogatiue royall.</note> beyond &amp; without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of any concreat or materiall substance, as abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and segregating himselfe to his owne puritie, and aduaunced thereby to a more neere resemblanee of the diuine nature. For as we rightly conceiue of God, that albeit he worketh efficiently, and (if I may so say) na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, by the mediate causes, yet his potencie is not so by them tied or confined, but that he often performeth his owne pleasure by extraordinarie meanes, drawne out of his absolute power, both <hi>preter &amp; contra natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>: So the soule, besides his vsuall &amp; functionarie ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2682:18"/>
in and by the ministerial abilities of the body, hath other peculiar motions and actions of his owne, neither aided nor impeached by any corporiall assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or resistance.</p>
            <p>To this likenesse of God and the soule, let vs also shape our Soueraigntie: which (besides that which is regular in regiment, and from his power and goodnes imparted vnto the people) hath still, and reteineth to it selfe certaine prerogatiue rights of most ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and most free exemptions, whereof true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence (filled with all submissiue acknowledgements, and contented with that portion and interest which it receiueth from regalitie) admitteth no questioning dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and whereof iust gouernours do not so farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the lists, as to do what they lust, but do so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the vse (as God in the world, and the Soule in the body) not to the impeach, but to the support of iustice; not to the hurt, but to the good of subiects.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing perused the seuerall parts and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soule, together with the likenesse and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of soueraigntie therto; not without touching also the dangers and declinations whereunto they both are subiect: I should (if I were not tied within a teather, and thereby restrained from al affectionate discoursing or dilating) frame vnto them both some hortatorie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition vnto circumspect demeanure, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of ensnaring euils, and reprochfull obloquies.<note place="margin">Soueraignes not to be euill spoken of.</note> O let not the pure substance of the soule, for some few his imperfections be vnpurely censured: so neither the deare reputation of anointed maiestie maliciously tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by some slender imputations.

               </note> but wholy of a celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all temper, as from thence both originally ordained, &amp; daily gouerned? or to make him hold comparison with the soule, in that supremest title (which <hi>Euripides</hi> durst bestow vppon the soule) euen to be a God. For which appellation to bee bestowed vppon the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, the God of gods hath giuen vs a warrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all warrants, The manifold and mightie effects, which in, and for the body politique, this states soule performeth, doth ratifie the same by reason also. Is not the body of it selfe a confused lump, vnformed, sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, witlesse, and destitute of all helping meanes to mayntaine it selfe from perishing and vtter dissoluing? and doth not this soule (setting to worke all his assisting powers) quicken it, moue it, care for it, prouide for it, cherish it with his loue, furnish it with his gifts, gouerne it with his wisdome, establish it with his iustice, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

it with his puissance? If then he bee the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and (as it were) a diminitiue of the mightie God, shall not his vassals (both respectiuely to his so high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titelings,<note place="margin">The Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne a God.</note> &amp; gratefully for his great deseruings) refraine their rashnesse of deeming and dooming in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? and rather reuerently recognize the blessed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that bindeth them to loue, than with a Gyant-like presumption seeke to depraue his sacred estimation? to accumilate calumnies and detractions against the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne (so to abase and pull downe maiestie) is like to the pyling vp of hill vppon hill, to warre with heauen: and it may be better called petit blasphemie, for a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to blemish the Soueraigne with soule aspersions, than it is called petit treason for a seruant to slay his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; sith the dutie and priuitie betweene them is more astringent, and the offences against a dietie hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie of sinne.</p>
            <p>There is a question amongst the Philosophers, where and in what part of the body the soule should bee seated; some place it in the head,<note place="margin">The large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison with God and the soule.</note> as in the highest towre, with his chiefe informers, aduisors and assistants round about him; some in the heart, as the middest of his kingdome, from thence to spread and distribute life and spirit more readily to all the parts; and others alotting to it no chiefe seat at all, extendeth it equally vnto all, though it shew it selfe in each member diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently as their capacities or abilities will permit, as if it therein also were in similitude with God himselfe, who being by the infinitie of his essence, euery where, yet is no where circumscribed, bounded with no including limits, or more certainly in one place than in another: but as God is sayd to haue his center euery where, his


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2682:20"/>
circumference no where; to be in all places, yet not placed; and with euery thing, yet mixed with nothing: So the soule communicating to all the parts his essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall nature, is not encompassed by any part, nor is not more present in any one than in all. And as God (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such his vnmeasureable infinitenes of being euery where) is often said possitiuely, &amp; namely there to be, wher he maketh the more apparance of his presence: So the soule may be said there to be resiant, where his force and efficiencies be most discerned; when he attendeth the discussing of Intelligence and reason, then is his chaire of estate placed in the vpper house, and so seemeth to dwell in the head. When he betaketh himselfe to matter of Action, or followeth the feruencie of affections, then he is thought to be conteined within the irascible part enwalled in the breast, and issuing chiefely from the hart; when he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth lower to the place of bestiall concupiscence, then he there also discouereth his presence in those inferior parts. And (in a word) according to the aptnesse or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliablenesse of any part, wheresoeuer he acteth, there he is: because (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth) the efficient must conioyne vnto the effect, &amp; the mouer to the moued.</p>
            <p>If any desire to vnderstand how this discourse of the Soules either larger dilatation of himselfe throughout the whole bodie, or of his more especiall appropriating of his presence and worke vnto particuler parts, will accord by comparison with Soueraigntie in a State ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; let him in like sort examine how fitly the name of the head agreeth with the nature of a Soueraigne; and how properly the heart patterneth the preeminence, and how he doth seuerally conuey and impart to any

part of his dominions, the verie essentiall faculties of his gouernment; without the which no people can euer as subiects raunge themselues into the order, and communitie of humane societie, howsoeuer, as men, or rather as wild sauages, they may perhaps breath a while vpon the earth. It is a truth, that as the Soule, so the power of principalitie in gouernment, (though shewing it selfe in diuerse manner, as the varietie of euents ministreth occasion) yet in all points, and all parts is all one. And that a righteous Soueraigne (as the soule doth in defending and succouring any the least member from destruction and harme) hath an vnpartiall and most respectiue care, which extendeth it selfe (as God and the Soule doth) vniuersally to the whole, and particulerly to each member indiuiduall. The which point of so large dilating his force, (to the resemblance of such two patterns in a manner secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and vnseene) if I might haue leaue to straine a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, I could haue it serue me also thus far, as (at the least) to make a shew in that question propounded by some great Clerks in policie, touching the Princes ouer prodigall imparting of his presence amongst his people: For seeing that both God and the Soule,<note place="margin">Of the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to the people.</note> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so vnlimitably, be yet vndiscerned, in their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as hidden and concealed from the eyes of men; it may seeme to stand more with maiestie,<note place="margin">

a noueltie, for worth a dignitie, and for attayning a difficultie, is more desiringly, and more admiringly esteemed. Hence ariseth in the minds of subiects such egernesse and longing to satisfie their sences in the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, and well knowing of their Soueraigne, as if they were to seeke after the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which sendeth them the ouerflow of their plentie; or after the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of the world, which gouerneth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions and fortunes of their life. It is herof conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a Soueraigne the lesse he is exposed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique obseruance, the more he is presupposed to excell in amplitude of glorie: neuerthelesse it being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable a vertue in a gouernour to haue such a faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and goodnesse of nature, as (remitting the high cariage of his greatnesse) yeeldeth to his people with an affable gentlenesse easie approach for enterlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I cannot tell whether the contrarie sternenesse (in haughtily shunning or repulsing their aspect) will not haue (in the euen eye of a well regarding policie) the greater disallowing. Now let vs passe on to peruse the comparisons, taken from the head.</p>

            <p>Here leauing the head in his vnresistable right of ruling ouer the bodie, I will to the Soule againe, taking a farther view thereof,<note place="margin">The soueraign likened to the heart.</note> as sitting in his other principall seat the hart: when I behold the intricate net or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous web of vaines, spread from it ouer all the bodie; me thinketh I may well liken it to a little spyder, placed in the middest of her work, where she so caringly and cunningly ordereth the matter, that she presently fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the least shake or touch in any though the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest part of her webb. No lesse feelingly doth the hart perceiue, and partake, with any iniurie done vnto his veines. Sometimes hee sendeth forth the bloud and spirits with a full flush, replenishing all parts plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously, other while he rerireth them home with all speed to his little sconce, to comfort and fortifie it selfe.<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund and force of soueraigntie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is admirable to see the swift and sudden recourse of bloud, now stirred outwardly at a start like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and anon posting backe in feare of daunger to the hearts succour, leauing a palenesse and trembling in the outward parts. The heart is the well of life, the furnace of heat, the center of bloud, the first liuing and the last dying part. Agreeably to these vertues or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of the heart, let it be confessed, that euerie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale acknowiedgeth a soueraigne power, from the which it drew his first beginning, of which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth his dearest life bloud, with which it is quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as with a liuing fire, to the which it wholy trusteth, and returneth for refuge, by which it is imployed and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2682:23"/>
directed in all intentions, and without which it fayleth of continuance, and is incontinently dissolued. Then to such a Gouernour which both imparteth to al parts the vaines and artiries of their surest welfare, and hath a sence of any their griefs and wrongs, as of his owne; what and how regardant thankfulnesse, seruice, and obseruance is deseruedly due by the faythfull perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance (with the vttermost strayne of the very heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings) of all obedience to his commaunds and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
            <p>The heart is of all other the firmest flesh, yet not fed with bloud by any vaynes; and from it all other flesh deriueth by veynes his borrowed liuing. I haue heard it argued,<note place="margin">Of the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne all hold what they haue.</note> that a King in like sort is alone firmely and absolute stated, in and to the lands of his realme, and that all other owners take from him by the veynes and conueyances which he passeth to them. That which <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of the heart, That it giueth and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to euerie member, but it selfe receiueth or taketh not from any; is a good pattern of regall magnificence and bountie,<note place="margin">Bountie in a Soueraigne.</note> seeing that nothing more aptly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the nature of the soule, or commeth neerer to God himselfe than to do good, and extend reliefs to others, with free heart and open hand, himselfe in the meane while hauing no need of any. The figure of the hart is shaped sharpe poynted at the lower end,<note place="margin">Soueraignes loue of vertue.</note> and vpward it is more widely spread abroad: To this forme the best princes doe conforme, they open their hearts with a full spread towards vertue, goodnesse, and heauenly things, but do make narrow and close the same against all base appetites of this vnhallowed flesh. The heart is the dwelling place of the affections and inclinations

of the mind, whereof (as of his owne trayne, family, or houshold,<note place="margin">Soueraigns to looke well to them that be neer about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Right wisely doe Soueraignes hereof take this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to vphold their gouernment in a strict stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, tempering all extremities with an euennesse of moderation, that none about them grow too violent or headstrong, which cannot but worke as a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to their persons, so a disproportion to their states.</p>

            <p>There is nothing that is either more gracefull for seemelinesse of shew,<note place="margin">The Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes sports not to be grudged at.</note> or more auaileable to any man for his health, than to haue alwayes a light and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart: and it was yet neuer seene that any part of the body euer grudged at or repugned, but rather willingly furthered the well-pleasing delights of the heart.

In his personall respects he may partake of the mixture of bloud and kindred with the subiects, but soueraigntie admitteth no termes or titles of consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie. In his personall respects hee is as one man, single and indiuiduall, yet as in the right of Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he gayneth the appellation and capacities of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration: In his personall respects death maketh an end of his life and glorie all at once, but soueraigntie neuer faileth (not by the space of one moment still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in a successiue continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:) and as the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the soule (wherunto the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, as in these respects also is agreeably patterned) caused the old Philosophers (not able by their sharpe inquirings to penetrat into the deep profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dnes therof) admiringly to proclayme,<note place="margin">Man the great miracle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> That man was <hi>magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturae

            <p>Let me yet proceed a little farther in the discerning of the wisdome and goodnesse of the Creator, in the ordeining and enduing with propertie of these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall receptacles of the soule, the head, and the heart:<note place="margin">Nor head nor heart haue any power to doe wrong.</note> we doe not find that either of them is naturally enabled to offer any wrong by any meanes vnto the body, or once to encline by any so much as imagination of mischiefe therunto; but contrariwise, fully furnished and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished with store of helping reliefs, to nourish and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the same. For as in God himselfe (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that he should doe any vniustice) it would make a greater proofe of his impotencie, than shew foorth his power: So if he had giuen vnto the soule, or to these parts most replenished with the powers thereof, any such naturall abilitie or qualitie, as might inferre an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury and preiudice to the rest of the bodie; it might rightlyer bee termed a disabling than an enabling, and no way conforming to his image: for what a confusion or rather destruction would ensue, if the head should shrinke vp his sinewes that conueieth his vigor and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

            <p>The Soule also hath made choice of some other principall parts in the body,<note place="margin">Certaine essentiall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the state.</note> which he needfully vseth &amp; imployeth in the ministeriall functions of life; which if they once eyther fayle in their offices, or decay in their essence, the body can neither continue liuing, nor performe his actions: of which sort may bee reckoned, first the lungs and lights, ordeined for the alaying of the heat in the heart, and the necessitie of respiration: Then the liuer, which beginneth the concoction of our susteinance, and the same so prepared, doth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ouer to the hearts more perfect conuerting and accommodating: Lastly, the milt, the gall, and the kidnies, euerie whereof is alotted to some good worke of disseuering the refuse and drossie remnants from the selected and purified nutriment.

which is of vegitation onely, whereas in the head, or heart, he displaieth all his glorie, conuersing with them as with the darlings of his loue, I esteem it of no great merit,<note place="margin">The gifts of statesmen to be wel dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of.</note> to meditate too much of their worth, or to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the likening of them (which to do were easie and obuious) vnto certaine necessarie and essentiall orders or powers in the state.

The first, That as these bee placed so helpfully in the body, with such succeeding each other in their works, as accordeth to an accomplishment of health and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the whole: so there must bee in the publike weale, a wise and politicall ordering of the good gifts and imployments of the chiefe statesmen, that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours be discreetly sorted to the generall good, and not suffered out of course either promiscuously to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude,<note place="margin">Chiefe officers or nobles to be well safgarded.</note> or disorderedly to cause dissentions. The second, that as these parts of chiefe vse for the preseruation of life, be by the prouidence of nature strongly sauegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within an enclosed wall, as more cared for than the rest; so such as be the more noble and more necessarie members of the commonweale, ought to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on with the more tender regard of their safetie, and well prouided for against perilles, least in their ruyne or subuersion, the whole State also receiue a deadly stroke.</p>
            <p>The mentioning of these partes of the bodie (though vpon occasion of setting forth the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soule, in and by them) hath put me in mind of my fore-intended Method; which after a matching of the ruling preeminence to the nature of the soule, calleth me to a suruey or recounting of such obserue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2682:26"/>
respects, as may make the like correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the subiects of a state, and the condition of a bodie: Wherein I must be faine to deale with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the state, as <hi>Minerua</hi> did with the bodie of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> who in the safe conducting, and reducing of him to his true <hi>Penelope,</hi> did transforme him into diuers shapes, sometimes putting vpon him the shew of a rimpled and withered age, and anone againe restoring him to his freshest hew, and lustiest strength: So will I also (holding my intention to make at last an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vnion of the obeying bodie to the soueraigne aucthoritie) turne the same, as I treat thereof, into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent formes, diuersities, and altering respects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as any varietie of consideration shall afford. And I must also further entreat the good patience &amp; licence of my frendly Readers, for affording vnto me such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, as my selfe scantly liketh of; which is of inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and giuing a place in the contexrure of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, vnto some such comparisons, as by there frequent vse in good Authours may seeme to be ouer vulgar, which I could haue been well content to haue auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had they not pressed vpon me with some shew of necessitie, sith the more notoriously their likenesse hath bin discouered &amp; allowed, the more might I be noted either of ignorance in not discerning so publike proofs for my purpose, or of an affected singularitie, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temningly omitting what the worthiest writers haue chosen as diamonds and precious stones to enrich and garnish their works withall. And thus much perhaps I may performe in part of amends, that by such (as it were) my new setting thereof, the same shall be more lightsomly refreshed, and emblazoned with a more

            <p>In the composition of the bodie politique (as of the naturall) there is required a concurrance or euen mixture of foure Elements,<note place="margin">The fower Elements of the bodie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique.</note> which I do reckon to be these following: First, the generous, to aduance and mainteine the state with their well deseruing actions: Then the learned, to instruct and direct with skill in cases of consultation: Thirdly, yeomen with their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to produce and worke the commodities of the land: And lastly Trafiquers which may both vent out by exportation what may be spared, &amp; bring in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries that shall be wanting.

This I think not impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to propound, That where any of these do exceed,<note place="margin">The well mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> or ouer sway the rest, there such distemper (as in the bodilie mixture) inclineth the State to be ruled by that ouer-ruling force. And as in our bodies by the vnequall temper of the Elements the humors get masterie each ouer other (of which humors the diuersities of complexions do arise:) So in the bodie politique, according as either the baser and passiue Elements do preuaile to popularitie, or as the other more worthie and actiue, do reduce to the power of a few; thereof the humor, complexion,<note place="margin">The predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the elements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or passiue, maketh the complexion of the bodie politique.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and disposition of the state is discouered: in so much as (if the Soule or superioritie of gouerning be not strong enough to hold his owne) the exsuperance


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2682:27"/>
of the humour predominant, hauing altered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the bodie, will also violently draw the soule to follow the forme of his temperature: wherefore right needfull it is in any Commonweale, to contriue the true and proportionable mixture of these foure Elements, lest when they be put at odds, reuerting to the originall repugnances of their nature, they do fill the state with hatefull strifes, in the steed of blessefull peace. For as in the bodie naturall,<note place="margin">The elements to be held in concord.</note> if the wisdome of the Creator had not composed into a concord the contrarieties of the first Elements, it had (as still stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the confusion of the first <hi>Chaos</hi>) neuer attained the strength, beautie, &amp; order, which we now admire: So in the ciuill bodie, if prudent policie by aduised tempering of the disparitie of the people, should not conioyne them to a well agreeing consent, how could any hope be conceiued, but that the difference of poore and rich, vulgar &amp; noble, ignorant and learned, fearfull and valiant,<note place="margin">Discords in the parts of one and the same eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> industrious and such as take their ease, must needs by their opposite quallities, not onely deface the dignitie, but also subuert the stabilitie of the state? yea the differences of such as be all of one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, through a naturall emulation, (each part seeking to attaine neerest to the center and perfection of that whereunto he is incircled) proueth oft spitefully trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and must come vnder the care of a well disposing prudencie. For as the more trafiquing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the greater merchants, the happier husbanding the richer yeomen; so the more vertuous may stand vpon it to be reckoned, the more generous. And each exsuperance will disturbe the temper, if for the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such inequalities, and preuention of strife

amongst themselues, the wisdome of the State (taught by natures example) did not vse a correspondent cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. From the discrepance of vnequall temperature, ariseth so sundrie formes and shapes of bodies politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.<note place="margin">Sundry formes of bodies poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</note> Some are hugely big, and their verie greatnes rendreth them vnwildie, hauing their armes and their legs too far a sunder; some verie little, yet well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, actiue and strongly set to saue themselues; some carie a goodly shew on their outside, yet inwardly looked into, haue great defects, as either a foule Soule in so faire a bodie, or some deadly wringes tormenting their verie bowels; Some not so well fauoured or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly shaped, yet are sound enough, and in good health; Some be so fat and ouer fed with wealth, as their neighbours be therby tempted to make attempts against them: some so lean and forlorne, as that their pouertie is their best safetie: some all sluggish and sottish, can scant attend their owne defence, but do so long praie aide of others, till they be made a prey to all; some haughtie and fierce are neuer out of quarrels ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and taking occasions, through the flames of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and the gall of reuengefulnesse, to exercise a continuall enmitie. Thus we see how (after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the bodie naturall) the State ciuill also, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly figured, and varieth his formes, whereof (were I not bound to breuitie) I could of each sort make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and demonstrance in particuler, But it liketh me better, to hold my accustomed course, by speaking in generalitie: for that I may so hope to instruct some, and be sure to offend none.</p>

and principall than the rest, a precedence to bee chiefly prouided for. The bloud (vnto the which the Turke compared his tribute and treasure, inferring therby the moderat expending thereof) though it be deriued and dispersed to all parts, yet is it more abundantly bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the gracing of the face. The heart though it spre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his arteries all ouer the bodie, yet hee beateth and worketh more strongly with his pulses in one place than in another. Not so much as our garments but must be fitted to our bignesse or smallnesse, obseruing therein such difference as ariseth by the diuersities of our bodies: Why then should it be grudged at, if the nobilitie and gentrie of the land (in whom the dignitie and the well-shewing countenance of the state consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth) be better stored and furnished than the meaner of the people? why should any bodie enuie at the glorie of some selected persons, in and by whom the Soueraigne doth more manifestly discouer his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, make shew of his force, and expresse his affections? or why should it be disliked, that honours and fauours, riches, and preferments bee bestowed, or rather fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (regardingly vnto the merits of the vertuous) by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowledge (and as it were taking measure) of their good seruice and honorable deseruings? And (to wade yet further) I will confidently make good thus much more, That as in the bodie it is a greater mischiefe not to nourish and sustaine the sound and seruiceable parts, than not to cut off the diseased and corrupted: so in the Commonweale, not to reward and aduaunce the worthie,<note place="margin">Not to reward worse than not to punish.</note> is more pernicious and of more dangerous consequence, than not to afflict, punish, or pare away the hurtfull and infectious: for where the one is but

spared awhile by lenitie and impunitie in some hope of amendment, the other vnrespected in his goodnesse, is so pinched by that coldnesse of entertaynment, as hee seldome or neuer can come forward and put forth any shoots of vertue. Thence will it fall out, that as in the bodie the decay or corruption of any part, is but the want of that health, soundnesse, or good temper which it ought to haue had, and imployed to the helpe and not to the hurt of the whole: So in the bodie poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, if in the better part thereof (by occasion of such discouragement, &amp; the pronenesse of men vnto naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse more than vnto goodnesse) there bee a want of honestie or vertuous performances, must it not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily effect a generall declination from all true duties? diuerting that to the harme that should haue ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the benefit of the state, and introducing thereby, an ouerswelling tide of sinne, corrupting and confounding all, and that meerely by the neglect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and vertue.</p>

What artificiall deuices will hee not find out, and that with his extremest cost, to grace and set forth the comlinesse of his face? and yet

hideth for verie shame some other parts vnfit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of producing to open aspect? and were it not as vnfitting, that the dignities and degrees of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Dignities ill bestowed.</note> should be promiscuously cast abroad amongst the meaner sort of mechanicall tradesmen, as for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and dressings prouided for the better parts, to be bestowed so low as vppon the feet?

What contestations or accusations by streining all the strings of art, can reach the height of so heinous and most abhorred conspiracies? what vse can there be of any aggrauating or amplifying, when the plainest tale that can be told, may be thought to be but an Hyperbole beyond beliefe? My conceit telleth me, that (notwithstanding any the best sinceritie or integritie not possible to be controlled) the report thereof to forrein Countries, or after ages, will seeme vncredible, and that it will require a great dexteritie and perfection of art, so to deliuer it ouer, as not to haue it censured rather a malicious fiction, than a true storie.

I haue heard of one so far affected to pouertie, as that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all the treasure and iewels of the world in one roome, that he might at once set tehm all on fire: Such a wish had these men so deuoted to Poperie, that they would in an instant, and in one roome, haue destroied the true riches, iewels, the maiestie and glorie of our whole state at one clap.

The tyrannous Massacre of France, (being an elder issue of that same mother Church the harlot of Rome) was inferior in furie &amp; wickednesse to this plot: They had an excuse from the warrant of aucthoritie; these out of their priuat dislikes, conspired the ouerthrow of all aucthoritie: They designed those onely to the slaughter whom they accounted and condemned as offendors in their state, these bundled vp into their butcherie the innocent, and some of their own friends also, whom they could haue no colour so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and ruinate: They ment the mending of their state present, and the securing of their future; these not onely the subuersion of that which now is flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, both in riches <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And which my poore selfe (as the meanesse of my wit and erudition affordeth) euen by the comparatiue respects of the parts in the bodie, which I haue vndertaken to set forth, do condemne to the deepest dongion of hell, whence the fathers and factors of the Romish faith hath first fetched it.<note place="margin">Against idle, vagrant, or vnptofitable people.</note>

            <p>I must yet inferre one obseruation more of natures prouidence,<note place="margin">In the worke of ruling, but one head.</note> whereupon I will set my marke as chiefly to bee remembred: That albeit for the ordering and effecting of other businesses concerning the body, she hath assigned and conioyned more parts vnto one worke: yet for the supremacie of gouerning ouer all, she hath but one head; as if it were vtterly vnpossible, or vnsufferablie mischeeuous, to admit any partnership in the regall dignitie. Let vs imagine a bodie so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, as whereunto two heads were at once affixed,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2682:37"/>
shall not that bodie receiue much damage by the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and confusion of those two heads? must not the bodie in that case either be diuided by alotting of one side to the one, and the other side to the other head? or else be wholy disseuered by a promiscuous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious shufling of the seuerall sinewes, forces, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations from each head proceeding? What we as by fiction doe imagine might bee done in the naturall bodie: Man (that imagineth nothing but euill) and therefore can produce more prodigious errours than nature in her escapes hath euer patterned, hath indeed often brought to passe (though with most cursed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse) in the bodie politique. Haue we not had within this one land of England, the hideous Heptarchie of seuen heads at once? nay hath not the whole Iland of <hi>Britania,</hi>

            <p>Here I find the matter of Vnion to lye so full in my way,<note place="margin">Proofes for Vnion.</note> that euen it stoppeth my passage, forcing me (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the exact handling thereof by others) to giue it some little touch by the addition of proofe from these my comparisons also: for doubtlesse, if in the former times two heads caused the diuiding and halfeing of the bodie; the same reason now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that this one so vertuous and powerfull head

And can any of this entire and compleat body bee either so vnnaturally hard harted, or so vnconsiderat of his owne good, as finding this so happie and long desired reducement thereof vnto one head, will not seeke to be conioyned (euen in all the offices of kindnesse and releefe) rather with the whole bodie, than with the parts of one side onely? or is it fit that there should be any disseuering, siding, or disuniting by different orders, lawes, customs, and other such poynts of gouernment, where necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of communion in all the parts, inforceth a firmnesse of loue, a likenesse of life, and an equalitie of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely such as doe not gladly entertaine this good opportunitie to reunite that which hath so long beene sundred, seemeth to bee better pleased with the imperfection, the weaknesse and misshapen forme of the bodie vnder two heads, and with disagreeing parts, than that the whole strengthening of it selfe with a comely concordance, and vniforme subiection, should bee brought vnder the righteous gouernment of one onely soueraigne head. Therefore if they will not bee thought to dislike, that one head should rule all; let not this offend them neither, that all bee collected and incorporate into one and the same politicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>

            <p>Now (me thinketh) I haue opened a fit passage for my pen into a discourse very large, and scantly to bee limitted; Of the health requisite, the diseases incident, and the remedies, applyable to a Commonweale, that herein also, I may make good my comparison thereof to the body naturall. There is none either so witlesse, or so carelesse, that considereth not of the necessitie of health,<note place="margin">Health, how necessarie in both bodies.</note> which where it wanteth, there can neither be fore-thinking of affayres, nor courage to attempt, nor strength to persorme, nor cheerfulnesse in shew, nor manfulnes in deed; but in the steede of these a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping dismaiednsse, deiected weaknes, and a yeedling faintnesse, deliuereth ouer the bodie into a verie euill, if not forlorne condition. And surely where the bodie politique hath not his health, as being either tainted with infectious corruptions, or infested with publique greuances, there all things quickly runneth awrie, for want both of councell to contriue, and power to doe, what in such cases is behoueable: The haughtynes of valour is turned all to timerousnes the care of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, to a heedlesse negligence; the forwarding of iust actions, to a languishing in his owne afflictions; and his ioint force of peace &amp; loue, into a disseuering and tearing a sunder of all his ioints. Then herein let both the bodies agree, that without health, they haue neither mind of their businesses, nor vse of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, nor meanes of well doing, nor ioy of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

            <p>The mutabilitie of this earthly state stirred by the diuersitie of causes,<note place="margin">Cases of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> admitteth no such certeintie or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie in either of the said bodies, as can quite keepe off or exclude alterations. Let vs then as in the naturall, so in the politicall bodie gouerne the question of change with such choice &amp; discretion, as vnlesse either vrgent necessitie constraine, or euident vtilitie do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise our assent, we may still retaine our wonted orders and vsages with all permanent firmenesse, not affecting or enduring any nouelties: which besides their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted harmefulnesse at their first entring, will aske a continued time of triall, for their gaining of aucthority and acceptation. But where these respectes of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced compulsion, or of a gainfull consideration shall preuaile; how can it be gainsaid, that the feare of the one, or the loue of the other, (euen of a tender sence in nature) should not persuade a voluntarie condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to so well warranted immutations?</p>
            <p>I hold it better phisick to preserue health, than to restore it; and a more commendable care to preuent,<note place="margin">Better keep health, than recouer it.</note> than to cure diseases: so it is a greater wisdome to keep a kingdome in his good gouernment, than to amend it when it is out of order; and to prouide aforehand against mischiefes, than to redresse what is become amisse. We do vsualy account it good wisdome in our health to prouide for sicknes;<note place="margin">To prouide in prosperitie, for aduersitie.</note> and then to furnish our selues with all such necessaries as may best besteed vs, when we shall be either threatned or assaulted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

as in the seasons of the plentie, to store vp against scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and in the times of peace to get and gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more plentifully the many preparations of warre. To discerne an approching euill betimes,<note place="margin">Time preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and to stop the spread thereof before it become through continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vncureable, is a like in either of the said bodies, a foresight most necessarie. We see that a verie whelke doth often breed into a great sore, a small bruze into a greeuous fistula,<note place="margin">Of small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, great mischiefes.</note> and a little distemperature into an extreame feuer: Such shaking fits and horrible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions haue bin felt in the bodie of the Realme, and haue risen from contemptible beginnings, to vncorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible confusions; which who so well weyeth, must be forced to conclude a necessitie of timely care and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect preuention, for auoiding or resisting thereof. He that neglecteth dangers, because the means that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth or threatneth the same be but small, forgetteth what great plagues, the frogs, lice, flies, and grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, brought vpon the land of Aegypt; nay, let him not account so slightlie of any euill (though neuer so little in shew) as not to watch it well, for feare of the worst. We haue a common saying, That an euill weed groweth apace, and as vsuall a practise to roote it out as soone as it sheweth: when one is out of the way, if he be not streight reduced, it is hard to say how far he will straggle; and when the bodie is but a little crazie, if help be not sought, who can tell what extreamitie may ensue. Such petite euils (reckoned of as scant regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable) do often (because their venemous qualitie is not presently perceiued) aduantage themselues by the foolish sufferance of such as should suppresse them; whereby<note place="margin">Against Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration.</note> the way hath bin made for the introducing


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2682:41"/>
of the tolleration of them, euen when they haue gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen more vntollerable: for, such their vnderpropping Patrons, as in their first springing, and (as it were) in the supposed harmlesnesse thereof, afforded them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some little countenancing fauour, will still be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of to beare towards them a certaine tender and relenting fancie, tending to their defence. And in verie deed, such as compassionatly do encline their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to beare with euils, cannot readily find a degree of stay; but are likely enough to hold on with them, as well in their offensiue and excessiue, as in their vnespied or neglected naughtinesse; like to <hi>Milo</hi> that had caried the calfe so long, as that he still caried it when it was become an Oxe. I know it to be propounded by some Polititians, that some euils must be tollerated in the State, like as dregs and grosse humors be entermixed with the bloud, which they affirme to be better for health, than if the bloud were all pure and clean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. But (by their good leaue) this their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is idle and impertinent; for if it be better for the bloud so to be, then it is no euill, but meerely good: and so out of this question of tolleration, I will fetch my ground from a far more aucthorized principle, which is: <hi>Tollite malum e vobis,</hi> and <hi>libera nos a malo,</hi> And will confesse my selfe in this point a Stoycall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesman, by auouching no euill to be so small, (cloak it or extenuate it neuer so much) but that the (<hi>Tollite</hi>) barreth it of Tolleration; and the (<hi>Libera</hi>) setteth vs at libertie, to haue nothing to doe therewith. I know not what nice mitigations, or constructions (by their fauours) they may applie to this word (Euill) but well I wot, that in the prescribed praier taught vs by Christ,

in that verie tearme of (euill) is included and contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Diuell himselfe: And therefore whatsoeuer we assuredlie resolue to be euill, is as absolutely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, as any the limbs or deriued issues of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Now (lest I should be charged by following of a by-path) to haue digressed and raunged from my theame, I will reuert to the proofs and appliances bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the bodie. Let me know of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their stomacks be so strong, as when they be clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with heauie meats which they cannot digest, yet will hold and still deteine the same, neuer once stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to cast them vp? or is there any of them, that in his owne bodie will with his tollerating patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a disease or griefe, if it lyeth in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and rid the same? nay more, admit he be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but a little troubled, and not endamaged at all, yet will he not (for that trouble onely) seek redresse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? let it be but the itching of some salt humour, or a fleabyting (by a sleight touch of the skin, starting all the spirits) can he be so contented, as not to attempt to ease himselfe of such disquieting? Then, from the warrant of God, the sence of nature, the directions of wisdome, the necessitie &amp; dignitie of the State, (which is not only to remoue his opposites, but to aduance it selfe to all perfection) let vs abandon all such party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and ambodexter tollerations, not fitting the Iustice or dignitie, or good of the Commonwealth. Neuerthelesse, lest I should too much lay open my weaknesse, both in discretion by a presumptuous asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueration,<note place="margin">Cases admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of euill.</note> and in iudgement by propounding that for absolute, which may perhaps be thought to accept of some exceptions and conditions; I must annex here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2682:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto some respectiue mitigation, if not a seeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation. It cannot be obscure, but that in a case of vnauoydable necessitie, to auoide thereby the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of a greater euill, the lesser may (though not likingly yet permittingly, though not absolutely yet in some manner, though not perpetuallie yet for a season) receiue a bearing or forbearing conueiance, though not an authorizing approbation. And I must impute it wholy to our impotency, that is so ouerladen with the manifold cumber of euils, and those often of opposite natures, as that we be forced by the repulsing of the worst, to make a seeming shew of electing of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser; scant reckoning that to be any euill at all, which by freeing of vs from a deadlyer mischiefe, may bee dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue wrought vnto vs our wel-accepted good. And sith I haue reduced my reason to this degree of relenting, I must seeke to make some probabilitie of farther prouing this point, by the looking also vpon my first propounded patterne: Our naturall bodies doe willingly and with a kind of chosing, endure some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, because they find the same to free them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more extremely daungerous. The opening of an issue stoppeth the entrance and breed of many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sicknesses: and nature seemeth oft pleased to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yea and to entertayne some enemies contentedly, for the obtayning and purchasing of an ensuing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der welfare. Therefore for a resoluing conclusion whereuppon to insist, I will reconcile any my surmised repugnances with this explayning distinction: Such euils, as either through an impossibilitie of remouing are growne necessarie, and so require rather fortitude to indure them, than any prudencie to make choice of


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2682:43"/>
them, or that by any helpfull vse whereunto they serue, doe seeme to haue put off their former nature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming phisicke vnto vs, partly may, and partly will haue our sufferance. But as I take it, in the very terme of tolleration, is meant and implyed, a dispensing with and vpholding of such euils, as being confessed to bee meerely and altogether of that qualitie, yet neither so forceth vs by the restreint of our power, but that wee may suppresse them; neither induceth vs by the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any behoofe or helpfulnesse, to yeeld them fauour. The discerning of which differences in any particular instances, is fitlier recommended to the adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse of the discreet gouernours, than to bee left to the temeritie of any ouer venturous and peremptorie preiudicator.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point of health: It is so precious and of so vnualuable a worth,<note place="margin">We may hurt to heale.</note> as that when it is not so perfect as wee would haue it, or when it is somewhat impaired, we do not sticke willingly to do to our selues farther hurt, to the end to heale our infirmities the more soundly. Yea, when wee haue no cause at all to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, as being of a constitution not to be disliked, yet doe we then take phisicke for a purpose to preuent sicknesse that may ensue, and to confirme the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our health: So in our bodie of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale it is not to be disliked, that (though there be no great fault found, and all things seeme to stand in good order) yet now and then physicall courses be vsed, by opening some veine, by purging of superfluities, and putting to payne some part thereof, for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie of the generall good: that not onely diseases themselues be auoided, but euen all feare and suspition


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2682:43"/>
may be preuented to the preseruing and assuring of an inuiolable stabititie of the publique quietnesse. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse as in the bodie it is a safe regard not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to moue the humours, than there is likelihood to rid and conquer them: so in the state it requireth a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and ponderous consulting when and how to stirre and atempt such medicinall trialls. Aduisednesse aduentureth not without aduantage, knowing that the awaked Dog (not well awed or ouermatched) will the more insultingly be enraged.</p>
            <p>The diseases that may annoy or indaunger the state, are more than I am able to recount,<note place="margin">The diseases of the State.</note> much lesse can tell how to cure; neither would I (by a more single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring thereof to the diseases of the bodie) giue cause to bee censured, as either superstitiously curious, or superfluously busie-headed. This field is spacious, and incloseth a large circuit of plentifull matter for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: and I take it to be no lesse difficultie succinctly to comprehend, vnder any heads of diuision, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant multiplicitie of diseases in the politique, than it is in the naturall bodie; wherein (as daily experience propoundeth it vnto vs) notwithstanding the almost innumerable and most industrious discoueries of the learned, in so many reuolutions of ages, yet still more and more diuersities doe start vp and occurre to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. I see the pathway and method for an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entrance into a treatise of that nature, by the distinct rehersall of euerie the seuerall diseases, either generall to the whole, or proper to any part: but as I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my feeblenesse, standing confounded by the verie sight of the immensitie thereof, so do I humblie yeeld my meannesse to be farre vnapt to intermeddle, where

            <p>Diseases arise as in the body naturall by distemper of humours;<note place="margin">How they doe arise.</note> so in the politicall, by disorder of manners: and as in the bodie naturall they doe hinder, peruert, and corrupt the orderly actions of nature; so in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall they do impeach, infringe, and resist the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and regiment of a iust gouernance. But as all diseases are not alike either for sharpnesse of payne,<note place="margin">Differences in faults.</note> or likelihood of danger: so neither are all offences equall, either for the hainousnesse of crime, or for the harme that can thereof ensue; a stitch in the side, a pricking in the eye, or a shooting in the sinewes, are eager and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame griefes, yet not so dangerous as the dropsies, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or appoplexies: so be the fierce and smart conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the learned (in matters not of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) exceeding troublesome to the State; yet no way comparable for danger to Atheisme, Popery, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie.<note place="margin">Against equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of sinne.

The diseases of the skinne though they require remedie (because they be diseases) yet they need not so much tendance, plying, or looking vnto, as the gnawing and tearing pangs of the heart.</p>

And against that sort of Lawyers which shall seeke to make vs such fooles, as by continuall lawing to keepe vs still to that play at foyles, to fill them thereby with fees, let vs learne this phisicall lesson,<note place="margin">To be neuer out of law, a great miserie.</note> That as <hi>Medice vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, est misere viuere,</hi> so to be neuer out of law, is neuer to know any happie dayes: for as too much phisicke weakeneth and wasteth health; so to be ouerlaid with law, is the vtter losse and confounding of all comforts of life.</p>

As we like better a Phisicion that is our owne Countreyman, or of some neerenesse in bloud vnto vs, than a forraine borne, or nothing alied vnto vs: so is it well and louingly prouided for, where the Soueraigne (according to such desire) ordereth each people to bee gouerned by their owne natiues. As the Phisicions to encourage and induce their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to take more cheerefully their prescriptions, doe readily foretast the same themselues: so the Magistrats for the drawing of the people to the more willing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of the lawes,<note place="margin">Magistrats must not desist fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their duties for abuses of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto them</note> ought to make themselues exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of integritie in the outward shew of a iust conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.

Neuerthelesse, as the Phisitions misdieting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is no good pretence for the diseased to refuse to be healed by his endeuour: So the obiection of the Magistrats misbehauiour or reproach must not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our subiection from abyding and yeelding to any his orders or iudgements concerning our emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.<note place="margin">Magistrats faults no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them.</note> It is obserued in the nature of Man, that when he is pressed by sicknesse to pray aide of the Phisition, he holdeth nothing too deare for him, rewarding him

Further than this, he findeth one other gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance much exceeding the former, which is, That when he hath with his earnest studie and best cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection decreed and enacted what is to be done,<note place="margin">Magistrats dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for the want of execution of lawes by them made.</note> his prescriptions will not be receiued, nor his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons followed; without the vse and applying whereof, the making of such receipt was a bootlesse labour.
