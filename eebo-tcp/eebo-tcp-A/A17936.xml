            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19840:8"/>
which fighteth againſt his
ſoule. Since Satan hath cast
this ſeed of the Serpent into
our ſoules, there is no ſin ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious,
but ſome ſeed of it
lurketh in our nature; It ſhould
humble us, to heare what ſins
are forbidden by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which if the Holy Ghoſt had
not mentioned, we might have
beene aſhamed to heare of, they
are ſo diſhonourable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the very hearing of the
monſtrous outrages committed
by men, given up of God, as it
yeelds matter of thanks to God
for preſervation of us, ſo of
humility, to ſee our common
nature ſo abuſed, and abaſed by
ſinne and Satan: Nay, ſo cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is our Nature of ſin, that
the mention of it, in ſtead of
ſtirring hatred of it, often kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<pb facs="tcp:19840:8"/>
Fancie to a liking of it:
the diſcovery of divelliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
and ſtratagems of wit,
though in ſome reſpects to good
purpoſe, yet hath no better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in ſome, than to faſhion
their wits to the like falſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes;
and the innocencie of
many ariſeth not from love of
that which is good, but from
not knowing of that which is
evill.</p>
            <p>And in nothing the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of ſin appeares more
than in this, that it hindereth
all it can, the knowledge of it
ſelfe, and if it once be knowne,
it ſtudieth extenuation, and
tranſlation, upon others; ſin and
ſhifting came into the world
together, in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his
time, it ſeemes there were ſome
that were not afraid to father
<pb facs="tcp:19840:9"/>
their temptations to ſinne, upon
him that hateth it moſt, (God
himſelfe) whereas God is only
ſaid to try, not to tempt. Our
Adverſaries are not far from
imputing this to God, who
maintaine Concupiſcence, the
mother of all abominations, to
be a condition of Nature, as
firſt created, onely kept in, by
the bridle of originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
that from hence, they
might the better maintaine
thoſe proud opinions of perfect
fulfilling the Law, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therby. This moved Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> to ſet downe the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
and pedegree of ſin; wee
our ſelves are both the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the Tempted, as
Tempted, wee might deſerve
ſome pity, if as Tempters wee
deſerve not blame, in us there
<pb facs="tcp:19840:9"/>
is both fire and matter for fire
to take hold on, Satan needs but
to blow, and often times not
that neither, for many, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence
ſtirre not up them,
they will ſtirre up to Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.
So long as the ſoule
keepes cloſe to God, and his
truth, it is ſafe, ſo long as our
way <hi>lieth above,</hi> we are free
<hi>from the Snares below,</hi> all
the danger firſt riſeth, from
letting our hearts looſe from
God by infidelity, for then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
our heart is drawn away
by ſome ſeeming good, whereby
we ſeeke a ſevered excellencie,
and contentment out of God, in
whom it is only to be had. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have once forſaken God,
God forſakes us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving us, in
ſome degree, to our ſelves, the
worſt guides that can be; and
<pb facs="tcp:19840:10"/>
thereupon, Satan joynes forces
with us, ſetting upon us as a
friend, under our owne colours;
hee cannot but miſcarry that
hath a Pirate for his guide.
This God ſuffereth, to make us
better knowne to our ſelves, for
by this meanes corruption, that
lay hid before, is drawne out,
and the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne
the better knowne, and ſo wee
are put upon the daily practice
of repentance and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and driven to fly under the
wings of Ieſus Chriſt. Were it
not for temptations, we ſhould
be concealed from our ſelves,
our graces, as unexerciſed,
would not bee ſo bright, the
power of God ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare;
ſo <hi>in our weakneſſe,</hi> we
would not be ſo pitiful and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
towards others, nor ſo je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="tcp:19840:10"/>
over our owne hearts, nor
ſo skilfull of Satans method
and enterpriſes, we ſhould not
ſee ſuch a neceſsity of ſtanding
alwayes upon our guard; but
though, by the over-ruling
power of God, they have this
good iſſue, yet that which is ill
of it ſelfe, is not to be ventured
on, for the good that commeth
by accident. The chiefe thing
wherein one Chriſtian differs
from another, is watchfulneſſe,
which though it require moſt
labour, yet it bringeth most
ſafety, and the beſt is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſafe, than watchfull, and
not onely against ſinnes, but
tentations, which are the ſeeds
of ſinne, and occaſions which
let in tentations, the beſt, by
raſh adventures, upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have beene led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb facs="tcp:19840:11"/>
and by temptation, into
the ſin it ſelfe: whence ſin and
temptation come both under
the ſame name, to ſhew us that
we can bee no farther ſecure
from ſinne, than we be carefull
to ſhun temptations. And in
this, every one ſhould labour ſo
wel to underſtand themſelves,
as to know what they finde a
temptation to them, that may
be a temptation to one, which
is not to another; <hi>Abraham</hi>
might looke upon the ſmoake
of Sodome, though <hi>Lot</hi> might
not, becauſe that ſight would
worke more upon <hi>Lots</hi> heart,
than <hi>Abrahams.</hi> In theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
a wiſe Chriſtian better
knowes what to doe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
than any can preſcribe
him. And becauſe God hath
our hearts in his hand, and can
<pb facs="tcp:19840:11"/>
either ſuſpend or give way to
temptations, it ſhould move us
eſpecially to take heed of thoſe
ſins, wherby grieving the good
Spirit of God, wee give him
cauſe to leave us to our owne
ſpirits, but that he may rather
ſtirre up contrary gracious lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings
in us, as a contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
There is nothing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force, to make us out of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
jealouſie <hi>to feare alwayes:</hi>
Thus daily <hi>working out our
ſalvation,</hi> that God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to goe along with us, and
be our Shield, and not to leave
us naked in the hands of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
but ſecond his firſt Grace
with a further degree, as temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ſhall encreaſe; it is he
that either removeth occaſions,
or ſhutteth our hearts against
them, and giveth ſtrength to
<pb facs="tcp:19840:12"/>
prevaile over them, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
providence you cannot be
too thankfull for; it is a great
mercy, when temptations are
not above the ſupply of ſtrength
againſt them. This care onely
taketh up the heart of thoſe,
who having the life of Christ
begun in them, and his Nature
ſtampt upon them, have felt
how ſweet communion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God in Chriſt,
and how comfortable the daily
walking with God, is: theſe are
wary of any thing that may
draw away their hearts from
God, and hinder their peace.
And therefore they hate temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to ſin, as ſin it ſelfe, and
ſinne, as hell it ſelfe, and hell
moſt of all, as being a ſtate of
eternall ſeparation from all
comfortable fellowſhip with
<pb facs="tcp:19840:12"/>
God. A man that is a ſtranger
from the life of God, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist
tentation to ſin, as it is ſin,
becauſe hee never knew the
beauty of holines, but from the
beauty of a civill life he may
reſiſt tentations to ſuch ſins as
may weaken reſpect, and from
love of his owne quiet, may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from thoſe ſins that will
affright conſcience. And the
cauſe why civil men feele leſſe
diſturbance from temptations,
is, becauſe they are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of temptation, til
God awaken their heart. What
danger they ſee not, they feare
not, the ſtrong man holds his
poſſeſsion in them, and is too
wiſe, by rowzing them out of
their ſleepe to give them occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoughts of eſcape. None
more under the danger of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="tcp:19840:13"/>
than they that diſcerne
it not, they are Satans ſtales,
taken <hi>by him, at his pleaſure,</hi>
whom Satan uſeth to draw
others into the ſame ſnare;
therefore Satan troubleth not
them, nor himſelfe about them,
but a true Chriſtian, feares a
temptation in every thing, his
chiefe care is, that in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſoever hee bee, it proves
not a temtation to him: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
indeed, are more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
called temptations,
than proſperity, becauſe Satan
by them, breedeth an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſorrow and feare, which
affections have an eſpeciall
working upon us, in the courſe
of our lives, making us often
to for ſake God, and deſart his

This Luſt doth worke our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by degrees.</p>
               <p>1 By drawing the minde of
man aſide from thinking on
God and goodneſſe,<note place="margin">

ſudden thoughts in us, of that
which is not good without any
conſultation, giving a man no
time to diſpute the matter with
himſelfe, or with his <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 By inticing and baiting the
hart of man, as men do for fiſhes;
working on the will to bend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſuch or ſuch object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by <hi>Luſt,</hi> as in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
good and pleaſant; and
here though we doe repell ſuch
thoughts as draw, and withdraw,
and ſuch wiſhes as intice and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19840:20"/>
even as faſt as they come to
our conſideration: yet S. <hi>Iames</hi>
tels us here, that they are the firſt
fruits and effects of our concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.
By <hi>Luſt</hi> is meant our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and originall corruption;
the concluſion is, <hi>That all our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are long of our originall ſin:</hi>
I deny not but Satan tempts, and
ſo doth the World; but yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Satan nor the World can
now hurt us, if all be well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
they tempt, but it is by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on our own concupiſcence,
ſhould they finde nothing in us,
we needed not to care thus much
for their tentations. Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was tempted, and had no
<hi>Luſt</hi> in him, and did not Satan
loſe his labour? And all becauſe
nothing was found in him: fire
burns not where is no matter for
it to work upon; no meere man
is tempted and drawne aſide, but
he may thanke his owne concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.</p>
               <p>The greateſt <hi>quaere</hi> is of <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:19840:21"/>
in Paradice, and of the <hi>Angels</hi> in
heaven. The maine anſwer is,
that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of Man as he
is now, not as he was then. The
greateſt matter then is, how ſin
came into <hi>Adam,</hi> which muſt be
from the liberty of his will, hee
was tempted from without, and
ſo was <hi>Eve,</hi> but no motion of
<hi>Luſt</hi> within could draw him to
his firſt ſinne, for then there muſt
needs have beene in him a ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his firſt ſinne, and then the
firſt ſin could not have beene his
firſt ſin; he was of ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he might fal if he would,
and hee did fall, but not without
any tentation ſimply, though
without any from himſelfe, for
he was tempted by the Devill.
<hi>Lust</hi> in Satan was the <hi>occaſion</hi> of
<hi>Adams</hi> fall,<note place="margin">Roff: art. 39.</note> but the <hi>cauſe</hi> was his
owne will;<note place="margin">Contra.</note> his firſt ſin was from
Satans ſin,<note place="margin">Luth. Sandf.</note> (ſin,<note place="margin">De Deſe: l. 3. Sect. 96.</note> I ſay,) for it is a
weake conceit for any learned
man to write that the divill hath
no ſin, becauſe the Law was not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19840:21"/>
given to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proves that
in <hi>forme</hi> he is not ſuch a ſinner as
man is, but a ſinner hee was and
is, being and doing that which
was contrary to the will and
Law of God, laid upon him in
his Creation. The holy Page is
for it, in the very termes, <hi>Io. 8. 44.
Hee was a murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and abode not in the truth,</hi>
therefore a ſinner: He is a Lier
and the father of lies; therefore a
ſinner, and 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 8, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
ſinneth from the beginning.</hi> His
<hi>Luſts</hi> then that were in him, did
draw him to worke upon <hi>Eves</hi>
and <hi>Adams</hi> free-will to draw
them aſide. The Devill was an
Angell, and then he had no <hi>Luſt</hi>
within him to draw him; no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
without, being in heaven,
where was nothing but all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
A Deepe it is then to
conceive, how ſinne came firſt
into the Angels. That one great
Angell (now <hi>Belzebub)</hi> did firſt
fall, and then drew after him the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19840:22"/>
reſt, is like enough; but yet the
queſtion remaines, how the firſt
ſinne came into that Angell ſith
there was no defect within nor
none without: I muſt firſt ſay
that ſin is a privation, an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
no effect but a defect, and
therefore wee are not to trouble
our ſelves to enquire after any
proper and efficient cauſe; God
cannot bee a deficient cauſe, bee
cauſe there can bee no defect in
him, and therefore the defect
muſt bee in the Angell, and wee
muſt reſt in the will of the Angel
who without motion from with
in, or any tentation from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
fell from his eſtate, <hi>abode
not in the truth</hi> as <hi>Iudes</hi> Phraſe
is,<note place="margin">Iude v. 6.</note> left his habitation voluntarily
and maliciouſly, left it becauſe
he would leave it. The firſt ſin
or Luſt was a ſinne then, whoſe
cauſe was (ſuch cauſe as a ſinne
could have) not ſinne, for then
the firſt ſinne could not bee the
firſt ſinne, if there were a ſinne
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19840:22"/>
the cauſe of that ſin; and againe,
we are where we were; and are
left to inquire the cauſe of that
ſin, to which if wee ſay, ſinne, to
have bin the cauſe of that,<note place="margin">Vid. Scot. Collat. 5.</note> then
wee may aske after the cauſe of
that ſinne againe and ſo <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
Here then we muſt ſtop and
ſay, that <hi>Eves</hi> ſinne and <hi>Adams</hi>
ſin came not from any Luſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but from an act of their owne
free will, drawne out by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the devill, and of the
devils firſt ſin, no internall Luſt,
<hi>no externall tempter at all,</hi> was the
cauſe, for there was neither, but
we muſt ſay that of that ſin, ſin
was not the cauſe, but the will of
the Angell created good, but mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and free; no good I confeſſe
can be the univocall cauſe of any
ſin but an equivocal cauſe; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall
cauſe of ſin good may
be, for the will of the Angels
good in it ſelfe was the cauſe, not
by working neither, but by not
working. <hi>Adam</hi> then (to come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19840:23"/>
to him) turning himſelfe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from God:<note place="margin">Cenſur. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt: in ca. 7. Becan.</note> God then took

They dreame then, who ſay that
God tooke away originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
from <hi>Adam,</hi> and that
hee by an act of his will did not

For if concupiſcence it ſelfe, and

the Law of God is ſo pure and

defined to be a thing done with

Gods Law, and Gods Law doth
bind our very firſt and originall
thoughts. A meere and ſingle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
or cogitation of a ſin

ſtraight a ſin, for this was or I
know might have beene in
Chriſt; and <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall
might dutifully have thought of
the thing forbidden him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

in him they could not have riſen,
as they doe in us on ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
the ſudden moving of the

come from an evill fume and are

hatred at all; in the moſt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19840:27"/>
the hatred that is, is but in
part; it commeth in nature ever,
in time moſt an end after the
motion: or if with it, yet that is
not ſufficient, in <hi>Adam</hi> it would
have beene antecedent to the

               <p>Theſe drawings aſide, (mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the powers of our ſoules out

them as much as we can, they are

in what Commandement the

The Luſt St. <hi>Iames</hi>

in every Commandement as
Luſt is. All deſires to a ſinne are
forbidden, where the ſin it ſelfe

for that opinion worth the while
is out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. I had not

and Luſt being ſynonimaes: the
word Luſt is as broad in extent
as the word ſin. The reaſon by
which many thinke to carry it,
is in my opinion very weake;
<hi>Paul</hi> (ſay they) did know when
he was a Phariſie, that Luſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

Philoſophers and heathens as

is a truth, and that by the Law
too, ſuch Luſts are forbidden is as
true. Doth it follow then, that
by the Law forbidding ſuch
Luſts, muſt be meant the tenth or
one diſtinct Commandement?
Why may not the ſenſe run thus,
that <hi>Paul</hi> did not know that in
any of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements ſuch
Luſts were forbidden at all; but
now being made a Convert, his
eyes were ſo opened, that hee
now ſaw ſuch luſts to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

the Phariſes, received and

ſuch an enticing harlot, as will

to entice us; Bookes are full
of admirable matter about the
deceitfulneſſe of ſin; ſhewing,
how the heart firſt deceives us

joyne and deceive our hearts;<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 26</note>

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend to the honeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the two maine treacheries of
Luſt to goe beyond us. 1. Luſt
ſits upon our upper part; and by
probable reaſons to ſee to, ſtrives
to win our judgements, and in
caſe a man looke not well to the
matter; Luſt will ſo bleare his
underſtanding with myſts, that
he ſhall think he hath reaſon to
bee mad, and that there is great
ſence in ſinning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man being a
reaſonable creature is apt to be
caried by reaſon; and if luſt
can once bring us over w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
reaſons, why then the
will is glad of the motion, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19840:32"/>
affections wait on the will, as
on their Queen and Miſtris, and
the ſin is like to be finiſhed and
bring forth death. Againſt this
we are to ſet the Word, and ſith
ſin can ſhew no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the
Word; ſay my reaſon is corrupt
and I am onely for the Word.
2. Luſt works on our inferiour
parts, and ſlatters our affections
with pauſible perſwaſions; and
a man is ſoone taken by faire of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to ſatisfie his affections:
they be quick and ſudden, and it
is hard to hold them in; &amp; when
the fume of ſin hath wound it
ſelf into the affections, it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creeps up into the very judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and eates out all faculty of
diſcerning, and then good goes
for evill, and evill for good.

theſe entiſings of luſt, leſt both
our reaſon and affections go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſin; a world of difficulties
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19840:32"/>
will come in, when we are not
onely to bring in our affections,
but our judgement too: That
Fort loſt is not had againe with
a ſong; remember that we have
not a novice in hand, but are to
deale with an old man which is
corrupt according to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
luſts, ſo <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of all is the deceit of luſt,
when it ſeemes to carry with it
our reaſon: becauſe then it is
next to an impoſſible thing, to
keepe out of the ſnare and
clutches of ſin; an inſtance or
two, and then an end. Why is
it paſt the power of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
with their pens and
tongues to cry downe vſury?
the cauſe is, becauſe moſt men
doe thinke that they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to make the moſt of their
money, and as yet they will ſee
no reaſon againſt it; there is an
unanimous conſent I thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Divines; that to
incloſe is an oppreſſio of an high
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19840:33"/>
degree, and yet many of our
Gentry incloſe more and more
every day, and that they doe it
with an high hand is too plain,
elſe they would not have us in
deriſion as they have; and dare
proclaime that they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe,
ſay all the Preachers in
the world the contrary. A
proud word, and well might
they, if GOD did not ſay the
contrary,<note place="margin">Pro. 13. 23 12 11. 28. 19.</note> as hee doth; the beſt
is, God is not mocked: for we
ſee that the poſterity of the
great incloſers, would be right
glad with all their harts to feed
a poore beaſt in ſome common
and cannot. Thus the Lord doth
laugh at their calamity,<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 31</note> and
mocke when their feare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth:
but why are men ſo ſet
in that ſin? Becauſe they thinke
that they have reaſon to incloſe.
Thus when Luſt hath enticed
and bewitched our reaſon: wiſe
men grow to deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
all I ſay, is in a word. He

wee yeeld often out of a baſe
feare: feare of yeelding occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
us to yeeld, when it is too
much. Many diſpute it, how to
find out the point of difference;
betwixt tentations that are
ours, and ſuch as are wholly
diabolicall; I thinke hee doth
beſt who doth ſtudy how to
reſiſt them, rather than to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them. That there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
I know; but where the
indiviſible point of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
doth ſtand, I know not:
ſome tell us that a man may
finde them out by their ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and becauſe they are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
and not conſequent of
any former occaſion: but to ſay
that our luſt doth not puſh out
as ſudden or as independent
motions and ſuggeſtions is
hard. Beſides for a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19840:37"/>
the difference betwixt
the independency and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

conceive to be a worke to hard

cannot name the ſinne, that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall

agreed on, that Originall ſin is
(virtually) every ſinne; neither
would God have forbidden all

not in it ſeminally ſinnes of all

That, is all evill thoughts, what
ſinne worſe than murther and
adultery? and may we not think
that the holy Ghoſt ſaith not
murther but murthers, not adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
but adulteries? to ſhew
that all ſorts, and ſo the worſt
ſorts of murthers came out of
the heart of man, yea, ſelfe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and all. Neither ſtands
our heart, that is, our luſt, free
from higheſt impieties againſt
God; and therefore thoſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
that is, all ſorts, kinds,
and degrees of blaſpheming are
ſaid to proceed out of the heart;
Sathan need not put them in,
there they are, though he draw
them not out thence, they will
ſpout out of themſelves; ſo that
though the divell did not owe
men a ſpight, yet the luſt of
man may marre all, and will
make ſome ſinne all manner of
ſins whatſoever. I thinke the
divell hath great wrong done
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19840:39"/>
him, when men to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
derive their ſins from
him; when perhaps, Satan hath
not to doe in the provoking
them to ſin thoſe things. He is
not truly acquainted with the
depth of Originall ſinne, nor
ſoundly humbled, who thinkes
he had never done thoſe faults,
except the divell had tempted
him; for a man hath in him all
ſins that be, (at leaſt potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:)
Indeed we read not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mention made in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament

had not this ſinne hid in it then,

it was, but it was not drawne

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19840:39"/>
the heart now, if it were not
there from the very firſt? Is
there a new Originall ſin? or a

to ſhew that there is no new
ſinne which hath not ever bin
radically in our luſt and nature,
elſe we are more in <hi>Adam</hi> than

but luſt had it in ever; and my
concluſion is, that a man doth
carry fire in his boſome, which
hath enough in it to kindle any
ſin, though the divell ſhould
ſtand by and ſay nothing. We
all read that the heart of man is
deceitfull above all things,<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9.</note> yea,
above the divell, why? Becauſe
Satan doth not ſo know the
thoughts of our hearts as wee
our ſelves doe: as alſo for that
Satan cannot come within us to
deceive us, except (as I have

way unto him; how true is that

make the offer, by moving the

or by propoſing ſome object

theſe waies are ordinary, and it
is but rare that the divell will

never ſo much as touch upon
the divell, as knowing that to
bee but a bare excuſe. Indeed

But when men are on their

theſe tentations, I meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19840:42"/>
my ſelfe in theſe ſhort
Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>1. What a Tentation is.</p>
                  <p>A tentation is the moving of
a man to ſome ſin, either by or
without the ſenſes with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to enforce it: it is when
luſt and Satan doe ſuggeſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
and inſtigate a man to
the committing of ſome ſinne,
with ſome ſhew of reaſon. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing is as it is received, that
is, a reaſon which is ſo taken,
elſe ſin can have no true reaſon
for it: who can imagine that
there is any reaſon in it, for a
man to doe that which in its
nature and deſert caſts away
his ſoule and body for ever: but
yet the tentation would never
take, except man, a reaſonable
creature were brought over by
ſome reaſon in appearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> cals ſinners abſurd and
unreaſonable men:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2</note> neither can

ſoone eſpie the folly, that is in

Sometimes wee are tempted to
ſin, and when wee once yeeld
then we are tempted for ſin to
doe this, or that, becauſe wee
have thus ſinned: when a man
is once in a ſin, then we are apt
to fall into tentation of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
or worſe: that now it
is impoſſible to get out, I might
have kept my ſelfe when I was
well, but now there is no hope
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19840:43"/>
it is in vaine now to ſtrive, and
ſo the tentation is made a ſnare,
or elſe to find ſome end by ſome
other wicked courſe and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enterpriſe, to breake out of
ſin by ſome other ſin, and this
indeed is all the reaſon that is
for ſinning.</p>
                  <p>Who are ſubject to be tempted.</p>
                  <p>No man free, our <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
ſaith, <hi>[Every man is tempted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawne aſide, and entiſed by his

tempted, and that when
they are at the beſt: Satan was
neither aſhamed nor afraid to
ſet on the LORD IESUS
himſelfe; his malice is mighty
towards the godly, and if hee
can but get one of them downe,
he is made, he hath enough by
the end to weaken the hearts of
weaker Chriſtians, to diſcredit
the Goſpell; and the beſt men
are apt to be lifted up and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away with ſome pangs of
ſpirituall pride, and then they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19840:43"/>
are in a foule way for one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or other, there is as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
thinks ſomething to be had
thence. Theeves rob not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
where there is nothing
but dung or ſtraw, the godly
have in them the riches of the
ſpirit, gold and ſilver, and that
makes the divell to carry an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
eye to them, and he is ever
ſicke to ruine ſuch a Chriſtian;
and God who ſits Moderator in
all our tentations, orders all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his holy wiſdome;
if he ſuffer ſuch to be tempted, it
is for their good, to let them
bloud to purge their choler, to

to ſee how our owne luſt may

they will end there in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

Satan hath no naturall affection
in him, nor luſt (as luſt) hath
none neither: Satan hath no
naturality in him, for he loſt all

in his fall: the law of nature
was not given to him, hee was
not to hold order and termes of
civillity and humanity amongſt
men, and therefore there was
not uſe of any ſuch law to bee

of him, is, that Satan is kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
held in awe by God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by feare within, and
ordered by Gods providence
without; it is awe, not naturall
law that keepes Satan within
bounds. Man hath indeed in
him naturalneſſe, but luſt which

then are called unnaturall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are againſt the law

of a mans unnaturall ſins are
not ſatisfied, but with a mans

what if at firſt nature
doth even ſpit at them? yet if
once they fire and take, they
worke ſtrongly and come with
a greater ſwing of delights than
naturall ſinnes doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would we could learne as
to be humble for our Originall

for keeping us and ours, that
thoſe unnaturall courſes have

not becauſe Originall luſt is not

and therfore as long as the law
of nature is not ſuppreſſed, a
man is not patient about ſuch
luſts: But when our luſt hath
gotten the better of natures law,
then to what ſins are ſuch men
more eager, than to thoſe?
Therefore ſuch luſts are by the

<hi>Paul</hi> that God doth deliver
men into a reprobate ſenſe, and
then they fall into ſuch luſts.
Here a doubt may ariſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch ſins are done onely by
thoſe who are Reprobates, ſith
one would thinke, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate

                  <p>This is I confeſſe out of my
way, yet becauſe I would not
ſtumble any mans conſcience, I
am bold to ſpeak a word to the
point, and the thing I affirme is,
that unnaturall ſinnes are done
ſometimes by ſuch as are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates:
and I thinke there
are many reprobates, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all their lives committed
and acted theſe ſins. It is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eſtate to be caſt by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a reprobate ſenſe; and the
danger is ſo much, that hee is
not himſelfe, who dares to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on ſuch rocks becauſe ſome

onely eſcape. There is no ſin
(except the ſin againſt the holy
Ghoſt) but an elect perſon may
commit, all ſins elſe may ſtand
with the grace of Election, but
this reprobate ſenſe, is not that
ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt what
ever it bee; what ever a man
may repent of may ſtand with
our eſtate in Chriſt. Now to ſay
that this is a condition which
admits not of repentance is
hard, neither can it be proved,
and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Inſtance is given
in one of the worſt of all unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſins, and yet the Apoſtle
ſaith, Such were ſome of you,

hence hee proves that no man
can be juſtified by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe it is in all men to
breake the law of nature, and
that the Apoſtle proves by this,
that all men, except GOD ſtay
them, all run on to a reprobate
minde, by a reprobate minde
then he will have meant a mind,
going againſt the dictates of
conſcience, and the principles
of Nature, out of which eſtate it
pleaſeth GOD to call ſome to
grace: God doth call in ſome
that are caſt farre behind hand
by their ſins; and therefore we
muſt not ſay that there is ſuch a
point of ſinning, that no man
doth ever come backe from it
againe, for no man goes ſo far
but hee might have done worſe
and gone farther; and therefore
when and where can one fix
the meaſure to reſt, that a man
going ſo farre can never come

or that none are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
but ſuch as make up the
extremity of ſinning I deny: for
the conſcience muſt have ſome
where to reſt, and to pitch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſinning, that hee that
comes not to that degree may
repent, and returne: hee that
comes to that degree of ſinning

to be proud of: for when

of themſelves, then there needs
a tentation to pricke the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Swelling in the body is a
dangerous Symptome, tis no

if once wee come to pleaſe our

heart preſently ſwels up into a

is the greateſt enemy to the free
grace of <hi>God,</hi> that is; which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
pride is uſually cured w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

of the Saints in the bleſſed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and we ſhall finde that their
pride of ſpirit hath ever likely
had a fall; it was for the pride
of wit that thoſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. were
given over to paſſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour:<note place="margin">V. 21. 22.</note>
walke humbly with
thy GOD and feare nothing.
What was in <hi>Adam,</hi>

                  <p>2. The next thing wee muſt

precept is, Watch: When

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19840:59"/>
let looſe upon us, to feare us
out of our ſecurity, and chiefly
ſuch luſts as fire the conſcience.
A man in a ſwoone muſt wee
know bee rubbed and chafed,
and ſome ſtaring luſts which
will trouble the ſpirits of a man
and chafe his very ſoule, are a
fit of burning fever to cure this
ſpirituall Lethargie. Security
will ruſt us, undoe us, and eate
out all that good is out of us,
and if the word will not doe it,
nor a croſſe will not worke it;
then comes a ſharpe tentation
to ſee what that will doe, and
if any thing will firſt awake,
and then humble the drowſie
and ſleepy heart of a man, it is
ſome vexing ſin or other.</p>
                  <p>3. Wee muſt not abuſe any
mercy what ever it be, for that
bringes in a tentation: hee that
will not uſe lawfull things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
it is juſt with God that
hee ſhould, and ten to one hee
ſhal fal into the unlawfull act of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19840:60"/>
the thing abuſed. Bee it Wife,
or Name, or Goods, or any
mercy, if wee abuſe it and doe
not uſe it aright: the next is to
bee ſet upon with ſome act of
ſin in the matter it ſelfe. What
ever wee enjoy, if we enjoy it
not holily and thankefully, we
ſhall bee ſore tempted about it,
in one ſinfull veine or other.</p>
                  <p>4. Looke not diſdainefully
on any ſin in another, bee the
ſin what it will, bee the ſinner
who he will, our nature ſtands
not free from the ſame, we are
ſubject to that very malady and
to puniſh us for looking upon
the fals and faults of others
with ſcornes; firſt or laſt wee
are like to bee tempted to and
with the ſame offence, that we
may learne to know our ſelves,
and to bee more mercifull to
others,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> againſt another time. A
common thing for a man out
of paſſion, not compaſſion, to
let flye at anothers ſins to day,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19840:60"/>
and to fall, or bee ready to fall
into the ſelfe ſame ſin to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
We find that we are ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
to a ſinne, that we never
yet from our youth felt any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too till now; to let us ſee,
that we beare about us not only
the rootes of thoſe ſins which
our complexion hath enclined
us unto, but alſo of thoſe ſinnes
wee never thought of, nor
dream'd of, that ſo wee may
learn to conſider others in their
corruptions with meekeneſſe to

take their turne to morrow.</p>
                  <p>5. Keepe off from us, and our
ſelves off from all occaſions of
any ſinne, to ruſh into harmes
way, is to tempt our ſelves, and
to tempt Satan to tempt us. He
that will dare to runne into the
mouth of any ſin, he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that hee is free from that
ſinne, and the next newes hee
heares is, to heare of that very
ſin, that he may know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19840:61"/>
what a creature man is;keepe
and doth not he who ventures
on occaſions of ſin, take himſelf
free from the danger of that ſin?
whereas the very deed is, that
the man who doth dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the occaſion of ſinne,
ſhewes that there was in the
heart an implicite likening of
that ſinne, though hee neither
thinke it nor feele it, but rather
dreame the contrary; for when
the occaſion is once afoot, then
preſently comes in mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
to that ſin, and then
the hidden corruption opens
and manifeſts it ſelfe: it is our
wiſdome as we would ſhun ſin
to avoid all occaſions of all ſins
whatſoever: For if wee will
not keepe our ſelves from the
occaſion, God will not keepe
us from the ſin; and if God do
not keep us, we cannot be kept,
we cannot, we will not chooſe
but fall.</p>
                  <p>6. Keep all our armour about
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19840:61"/>
us, and put ſin and Satan out of
hope: the divell is wiſer, than
uſually to tempt where he hath
no hope to ſpeed. <hi>Iudah</hi> went
about an honeſt buſineſſe:<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> yet
becauſe hee tooke not his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with him in the morning,
he fell ere night: we muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our Antidotes about us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee walke in places that
are infectious; and chiefly we
muſt ſee to our matters in ſins
wee are given unto, if to pride,
then goe not where faſhions
are, without a commiſſion and
weapon; if wee be apt to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
goe without a ſword, and
when we have not our weapon
about us, wee ſhall not bee ſo
tempted to brawle; if to the
luſt of unelcanneſſe, come not
neere the doores of her houſe,
and that will keepe our hearts
free, having our hearts ſtill an
end full of ſerious meditation
of the preſence of <hi>God</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſith our nature is ſo apt to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19840:62"/>
be tempted by our luſt, and we
are ſo ſoone afoot after every
ſin, that like children wee had
rather be in the dirt than in the
cleane: have wee not cauſe to
looke after theſe directions, and
ſuch as theſe are, that we may
not be lead into tentation; that

                  <p>For the uſe to be made of the

that the tentation is ſuffered to

is to ſome fault, as in this caſe
moſt times it is, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our mindes and to the
trouble of our ſoules: God he
knowes that if any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven will humble us, this
will doe it; what elſe will ſo
gaule and cut the heart of a
Chriſtian man? what elſe will
ſo ſet us a praying, a whining, a
watching, a faſting? this hee
ſee, will even vile a man in his
owne eyes, and make him baſe
to himſelfe: this will ſeaſon
and fit us for Gods building,
and the uſe wee are to make of
it, is; to ſee our ſelves what we
are, and to looke up to Chriſt
Ieſus: God ſees and wee muſt
ſee: that wee cannot well come
to heaven without ſuch a purge
and therefore wee muſt joyne

the latter end ſaith the Text:
this is not done in a day; and
therefore we muſt waite Gods
time: It is a plaſter and it muſt
lye on ſome time, if God meane
us any good, the tentation ſhall
not over ſtraight, but hover and
hang about us ſome long time,
ſome good ſpace. GOD doth
drive out one naile with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Pride with a tentation of
Luſt, but this is not done in an
houre, if it be ſomewhat long a
doing, yet it is worth our while.
Let us ſtay and waite upon God
from whom commeth our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation:
the cauſe of a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is pride, the uſe of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is to take away our pride:
there is great diſpute which is,
and which is the way to finde
out our maſter-ſin, but when all
is done, pride is the maſter-ſin
in all. Wee all hold of <hi>Adam</hi>
in <hi>Capite,</hi> pride was the firſt and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19840:63"/>
and great ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo it

Angels; the ſinne of ſins in the
Angels was pride;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> it gave them
their fall;<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſa. 58. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Omnium peccatorum ſuperbia.</note> ſo it was in <hi>Adam,</hi>
it gave him his fall, and ſo it is
in us. There is we ſay in trees a
maſter-roote,<note place="margin">Aug. tract. 25. in Ioan. Evang.</note> and that roote in
Originall ſinne is no other than
pride; indeed there is in moſt
ſome other particular ſtreame
and vaine, which carries, one,
one way, another, another; ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from Complexion, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Condition and other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and occaſions, which often
varies as the temper of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the order of our eſtate
doth change; and this yeere it
is one ſin, ſeven yeere henc (as
every ſeven yeere there is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
change in the humour of
the body) it is another, when
poore it is one, when rich it is
another ſin; but that ſin of all
ſins which goes thorow all the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19840:64"/>
race of man kinde is pride, the
univerſall and general Captaine,
Sin, in all the world: Vnbeleefe
may have that name and be well
called our maſter-ſin, in reſpect
of our Iuſtification, inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
taken, becauſe it hinders
our union with Chriſt: but the
chiefe ſin, which is our greateſt
morall vice, and carries the
greateſt ſtraine and power with
it in reſpect of ſanctification, is
this ſame ſin of Pride, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
pride is the pride of all

of homage to pride, as to their

God may bee ſaid to reſiſt

the ſight of it, and ſo wee ſay
that God doth uſe to give us
up for ſome time, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to ſome baſe tentations, he
lets out ſome vile corruptions
and why? but all to take down
this ſin of pride; it is ſay wee
all little enough to humble us:
affliction without the true ſight
and ſound feeling of ſome of
our corruptions will not doe
it: a man is then humble, when
hee is humbled before his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
ſin, and amonſt all the
bitter fruites of that curſed luſt,
pride is chiefe, and doth play
the <hi>Rex</hi> amongſt the reſt: other
ſins that wee (ſpeaking from
feeling) doe call our maſter-ſin
or ſins, our predominant luſts
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19840:65"/>
are but made uſe of by God to
humble us, and to eate out this
dangerous ſinne of pride; and
therefore it cleares it ſelfe, my
thinkes to ſay, that this ſinne of
pride is in every man his chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
ſin, ſith other beloved ſins
are let to have their ſwing in
men, all to maſter, this Maſter
of ſins, our pride. The uſe then
that wee are to put our tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unto when they come, is:
to humble our hearts, to abaſe
us, to pluck away the feathers
of our pride.</p>
                  <p>2. The next uſe wee are to
make of our tentation, is; that
we ſee a mercy in it whatſoever
it be, if wee feele nothing but
what is common to man, and
others have had and have the
like, we muſt learne to beare it
with a kinde of impatient pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
why ſhould not wee
beare what others beare, what
are wee? is our nature better
than others? here muſt bee a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19840:65"/>
kinde of content, elſe it is like
it will be worſe yet, elſe as yet,
we are neither truly nor ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
humble:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> it muſt teach us
to thinke better of others,<note place="margin">Vere exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſe poſſe in alio quo no bis ſuperior ſit.</note> than
of our ſelves; and wee muſt
learne to render thanks to God,
conſidering what our deſerts
are,<note place="margin">Aug. 83. Quaeſt. q. 71</note> and what our nature is; that
we are no worſe, that wee are
broken out no more.</p>
                  <p>3. The laſt uſe is, that we muſt
conſider a providence in it, in
that we are kept from ſinning,
by being tempted for ſin, God
doth ſuffer us to fall into the
thoughts and affections, that ſo
we might not fall into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
deed and action of ſinne:
better have a motion in the wil,
than the will and the deed too;
the will is taken for the deed
in good things, but not in ſinne,
for that Gods accepting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
our good deeds, comes
out of his grace and favour; it
is a matter of mercy &amp; drawes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19840:66"/>
out of the merits of Chriſt, and
therefore God may, and doth
many times take the hearty
will and deſire for the deed:
but in ſin it is not ſo, for there
the puniſhment is according to
the deſert, and merit of the ſin,
it is more or leſſe, as the deſert
of the ſin is more or leſſe; now
there is more guilt in the act
and will too, than is in the will
alone: evill workes really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
puniſhment, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is never more than
the guilt that is in the ſin, and
therefore the will is not ſo bad
as the deed: There be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of malice and evilneſſe in
the act, than in the purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and therefore of the two,
it is better to have it in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
within, than in the act
without, too chiefly when the
thoughts be ſuch as we cannot
abide, doe not allow, but abhor;
we fall ſooneſt into the outward
act of that ſin, which thruſts in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19840:66"/>
upon us on a ſudden whereof
wee felt not the drawing tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
firſt within: had <hi>David</hi>
bin haunted with peſtilent and
violent ſuggeſtions &amp; motions
to adultery and murther, he had
then felt thoſe corruptions to
have beene ſtrong in his fleſh;
his care then would have been,
to have beene earneſt with God
by prayer, to be pardoned, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and preſerved; and ſo hee
had found ſuch ſtrength, that
hee would not, nor ſhould not
have done thoſe faults: what
if we finde that wee doe loath
ſuch luſts when they begin to
fire? yet we muſt not ſtay there
as though it were impoſſible
that wee ſhould ever fall into
the ſinnes themſelves: <hi>David</hi>
would have taken it in as much
ſcorne as another, had one ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before to him as touching
adultery and murther; our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
the inward motion, is
not thorow enough, except it

bring us on our knees and beg
of God, that it proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Tentari &amp; in Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem non inferri non eſt malum imo etiam bonum eſt, hoc enim eſt probari.</note>
and ſo we ſee by accident,
it is a mercy to be held under
ſome ſuch profitable tentations,
and wee muſt make this mercy
of it: that the tentation drive us
to God, to keepe us from fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

                  <p>The ſecond maine branch, is,
how we ſhould get the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the ſnare, and here we are to
ſhow what wee muſt not doe,
and then what we muſt doe.</p>
                  <p>1. We muſt not diſpute with
ſin nor Satan: Satan when they
came to arguing; was too hard
for our firſt parents in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
when they had wit at
will, and their reaſon, at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and now that wee are as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19840:67"/>
we are, we looſe all if once wee
begin to enter into diſputation
with ſuch an old Sophiſter and
crafty fox as Satan is; and our

deceiver and diſtembler in the

with Satan in his owne Bow,
who thinkes by diſputing and
reaſoning to put off Satan, our
reaſon is corrupt, and on his
ſide, and it will betray us into
his hands.</p>
                  <p>2. Wee muſt not flye away
from Satan, a run-away never

tentations from Idolatry:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 8. 10. 14.</note> and

the place, it is a kind of ſerving
Satan, and a yeelding to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
God is angry with it, and
it is often the way to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
what if by this ſhifting

it leades us ſecurely into the

better dye in the place, than flye
from the place, becauſe it is a

in this ſenſe flyes from Satan for

                  <p>Thus far for what wee muſt

1. The firſt thing is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note>
get faith (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> and
then wee ſhall quench all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery

faith will doe wonders if wee
apply the victory, that Chriſt
hath made over Satan for us;
what if wee bee Cowards,<note place="margin">In Chriſto tu tentabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris—Si in illo nos ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati ſumus, in illo nos Diabolum ſuperamus, Aug. in. Pſa. 60.

Chriſt did not play the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;
His victory <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. was
ours, and for us: Hee ſtood in

much to the divell: what if
Satan beate mee may a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
ſay, yet I paſſe not; ſith my
Chriſt in my ſtead, for my part
hath beaten Satan all to peeces:
In him my head, I have long

hee is then to mee in him (my

take Chriſt Ieſus, and ſet him

Becauſe there is ſcarce any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
wherein Satan is not:

to ſet Chriſt againſt Satan: wee
are not of our ſelves ſo weake
in the hands of Satan, as Satan in
the hands of Chriſt; turne him
then over to CHRIST, and let
Chriſt alone with him; faith
will be ſatisfied with none elſe,
nothing but Chriſt; and faith
is ſaid to be our victory, which
neither hope nor charity are
ſaid to be,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 4.</note> becauſe it doth make

over ſin and Satan both. Faith
is not content with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

and aſſiſtance of an Angell
neither, except the Lord Ieſus
be there himſelfe:<note place="margin">Exo. 33. 2.</note> for God did
promiſe to ſend an Angell with
his people, and to drive out the
Canaanite and the reſt of that
Crue,<note place="margin">ver. 3.</note> but hee himſelfe would
not goe: the people of GOD
were no way content with an

and put on blacks, like a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

of ſending a truſty ſervant along

her but her husband. So when
our faith is ſet on worke, it
makes us but ſicke to tell us of
an Angell, except we may have
Chriſt Ieſus alſo, him or none;
and therefore wee are not ſafe
except we doe and can by faith
lay faſt hold on Chriſt Ieſus, and
ſet up him and his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the gates of hell and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19840:71"/>

yet an Angell brings no merits,

Faith muſt have one to ſide it
with us againſt Satan, who hath
abſolute command over Satan,
and merits to make amends
and payment to God for all our
ſins, (that way) now theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
in none but Chriſt, and ſo
we finde that no ſubſtitute, no
not an Angell will ſerve, but
Chriſt muſt bee ours by faith
and by a living faith wee muſt
take him, and make him our
Buckler and ſword againſt the
Divell and his Angels: If Chriſt
doe but ſay the word, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
himſelfe is ſaid, his tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

our refuge and our ſtrength, no
creature is to be our refuge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
none can be our ſtrength,<note place="margin">Pſa. 46. 1.</note>
but if wee reſt on them, ſay, on

will prove our weakeneſſe; but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19840:72"/>
Chriſt Ieſus the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
he will be ſure to be

no ſooner doe they begin
to reſiſt, but it is rather worſe
with them, than it was before,
theſe conſider not that it will
be thus: for if we will let ſin
and Satan alone, they will let us
alone, ſleepe in ſinne, and ſpare
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19840:75"/>
not, we may have quiet enough,
and come by degrees to be paſt
feeling: but reſiſt wee ſin and
Satan, and the divell will play
his part, to hold his hold: hee
is a ſtrong man, and will not
out except hee be forced; now
poſſeſſion by force, wee know
is with ſome ſtir, ſtruggle; ſin
will, and muſt, when we labour
to caſt the old man off: (it
will) becauſe it is now a dying;
and all dying things, that dye
by peeces, as ſin doth reluct and
ſtruggle, and ſtirre for life (it
muſt,) becauſe elſe a godly man
would not ſo well diſcerne the
going out of ſin: the Candle
blazeth moſt, &amp; ſtinketh worſt
when it burnes in the Socket;
and ſo it fares with ſin, when it
is towards it's laſt.</p>
                  <p>There is a double death of
ſin: one in reſpect of the guilt
of ſinne, which then is killed
when we have our pardon, this
is in Iuſtification; and when we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19840:76"/>
beginne to get our pardon, the
Conſcience is more out of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
greater ſtirs being there, than
when wee ſate ſtill and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that way: But when the
pardon is had once, then the
conſcience is alive, ſin is dead,
and our hearts are at quiet; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtified by faith, wee have
peace with God. The other
death of ſin, is in reſpect of the
power of ſin, and this is in our
ſanctification, and this wee
meane chiefeſt here: when a
godly man ſets about it to kill
up and dry up this running diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
the plucking out of the
weapon, the removing of the
guilt of ſin, is done on a ſudden;
but the healing of the wound,
the mending of the languor, is
done gradualy, now a little, and
then a little: and when a man
is come to abhor his luſts; then
he hath given his ſin it's deaths
wound as touching the power
of it, &amp; ſo on; now ſome, &amp; then
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19840:76"/>
ſome, ſinne doth dye more and
more. Now when a man can
once come to reſiſt ſinne, hee is
dead to ſin both wayes; to the
guilt of it, and to the power of
it: for had hee not the pardon
of it, he could not reſiſt it: had
hee not ſome power againſt it,
hee could not reſiſt it: Now
looke how much power we get
to reſiſt it, ſo much power ſin
loſeth. And now becauſe ſin
will not give ground, and loſe
the Field, without fighting and
ſome oppoſition; hence it is,
that when wee begin to reſiſt,
ſin and Satan make (to feele to)
the greater head,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 2.</note> and wee take
our caſe to bee the worſe,<note place="margin">Delectatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes carnales nobis illici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te multa ſuggerent, quibus non conſentimus ſed tamen non conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendimus, Aug. in Pſa. 64.</note> wee

hands do ake for cold, yet when
wee come firſt to the fire, the
fingers ends ake worſe; which
makes children cry when they
firſt come to the fire; the cauſe
is, becauſe the heat doth draw
out the cold, to the utmoſt parts

make us ake worſe; when firſt

drawne out more, therefore
they vex more; wee doe ſtirre
them more, and therefore they
ſtinke worſe; wee ſee them
more then, and are troubled at
the ſight of them I confeſſe.
But yet, ſo as a man is at the
ſight of many huge enemies,
whom yet hee knowes that
through the helpe of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

and conquer: by reſiſting and

Should we take the word (ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently)
in a legall ſenſe; then
while we breath we neither do,
nor can reſiſt ſin, but it may be,
and it ought to be, more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reſiſted ſtill: but if we take
it in an Evangelicall ſenſe, ſo as
to be ſure that our ſin is dead at
the heart, (as ſome trees be that
yet carry boughs) that we may
bee ſure that wee are in Chriſt:
here I ſay, that a man hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
reſiſted ſin and Satan,
when he doth not allow the ſin,
when he doth no way conſent
to the tentation. Some expreſſe
it by a diſtinction, and ſay, that
if a man doe not allow infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19840:78"/>
and doe not live in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of groſſe ſinnes, then all is
well and there is comfort e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to bee had, to ſtay our
thoughts againſt the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing:
as a little will ſtay the
ſtomacke for a time; ſo will an
aſſurance that wee have broken
the heart of ſinne, binde in our
hearts from deſpaire. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

ſenſe in it: that if we allow not
infirmities. 2. If wee doe not
practiſe groſſe ſins, then there
is ſufficient reſiſting as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the maine: That there is a
difference betwixt infirmities,
and preſumpuous ſins is not to
be denied;<note place="margin">Pſa. 19. 31.</note> it is expreſly in the

the man who doth a mortal ſin,
is not in the ſtate of grace: But

be in Chriſt for all that: I hope
there is no ſuch meaning in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19840:79"/>
of our Divines as to tye up
mens conſciences, to hang on
ſuch a diſtinction of ſins, ſith it
is beyond the wit of man, to
ſet downe a diſtinct point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
mortall and veniall ſins;
now when it is an impoſſible
matter punctually to ſet downe
to the underſtanding of man;
which is, and which is not a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
ſin; they muſt pardon mee
from giving the leaſt way to
ſuch Divinity, as muſt needs
leave the conſcience of man in
a maze and Labyrinth. I finde
that the nature of infirmities
doth ſo depend upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that, that is an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in one man, which is a groſſe
ſin in another; and ſome men
pleade for themſelves, that the
things they doe are but infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
He that will ſin, and when
hee hath done will ſay (not to
comfort his ſoule againſt Satan)
but to flatter himſelfe in his ſin
that it is but an infirmity, for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19840:79"/>
ought I know, he may goe to
hell for his infirmities: Beſides,
if that be good, that a man who
is in grace may doe infirmities,
but not practiſe groſſe ſinnes;
Then I would I could ſee a man
that would undertake to finde
us out ſome Rule out of the
word; by which a ſinner may
finde by his ſin, when hee is in
Chriſt, and when out of Chriſt;
at what degrees of ſinning,
where lies the Mathematicall
point and ſtop, that a man may
ſay, thus far I may goe and yet
bee in grace, but if I ſtep a ſtep
farther, then I am none of
Chriſts. Wee all know that
ſinnes have their latitude: and
for a man to hang his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on ſuch a diſtinction, as
hath no rule to define where
the difference lyes, is not ſafe
Divinity. The conſcience on

over us: it followes, <hi>then ſhall I

whom preſumptuous ſinne or
ſins have no dominion, he is an
upright man. To practiſe a ſin
is one thing, to live in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
is another: how farre a
man being and remaining in
grace, may goe in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19840:81"/>
of great ſinnes, is paſt my
skill to determine: The caſe of
<hi>Salomon</hi> and others, proves that
a man may goe farre; tentations
may hang long, if a day, a week,
if a weeke, a yeere, if a yeere,
many yeeres; and how many?
Who can ſay, a man lives in a
ſin when he loves it, though he
doe not practiſe it at all; as hee
is a Drunkard, who is never

                     </gap>unke, if hee love drinke; and
he Covetous, who loves money,
though he have not a penny in
his purſe. So, ſay a man never
act the ſin, yet if hee love it, if
hee doe not hate it, hee lives in
it. As in the Body, a man is ſaid
to have his health, albeit he hath
uſuall infirmities which make
no let, but that hee eate, drinke,
ſleepe, work; but if a man have
great diſeaſes, which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his ſtomacke and ſtrength,
then we ſay he is ſickly, and in

ſcapes and ordinary infirmities,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19840:82"/>
wee cannot live without, yet
they do not interrupt our peace
nor deſtroy the ſtrength of our

nevertheleſſe. But great ſinnes
doe diſtract, and diſturbe, doe
weaken, &amp; threaten the worſt;
and as it is hard I confeſſe, for a
man to practiſe them, but hee
will bee a lover and an allower
of them, a conſenter to them,
yet when at the worſt; I ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>1. Wee muſt ſet againſt and
reſiſt the motion that comes
from us; and the ſuggeſtion
that comes from Sathan at the
very firſt, ere they meete and
come together, if we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
be it never ſo unlikely and
ſo abſurd, yet we muſt tremble
at it in reſpect of our owne
weakneſſe, ſo as to pray againſt
them, at the very firſt ſight of
the tentation: the affection is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19840:83"/>
ſuffered to come to humble us,
that ſo wee may walke in feare,
uſe the meanes, and not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the action. Doe not ſay it is
unlikely I ſhall never doe it, this
is the way to grow ſecure, and
then farewell. Sometimes wee
are ſet upon with tentations,
likely, that is, ſuch as our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
nature is moſt given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for we are many times ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
overtaken with thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that our humour doth
itch after, and anon againe, wee
are urged to thoſe luſts we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had much minde unto, that
that ſo we may be taken ſecure,
and ere we are aware, and then
we are gone: Sith then our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
never ſleepeth; wee muſt
watch, and wake, and bee in a
readineſſe, to oberre all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our devouring adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
if wee reſiſt at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
the work is halfe downe,
we ſhall finde Satan a coward;
if wee reſiſt not, wee ſhall feele
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19840:84"/>
him as a Lion: wee muſt truſt
neither our ſelves nor Sathan
with any tentation: Wee ſee
the tempter changeth hands, a
man ſo prodigal, that he waſtes
all, when young, when old, quite
another way: his life is in his
riches; aye, one way to day, to
morrow, the winde ſits in a
quite contrary point, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt be provided for
all aſſaies, while the tentation is
greene and young: and what if
we can make no great matter of
it as yet, to our thinking? Wee
muſt hold out ſtill, for all that,
play the man ſtill: God meanes
to make a ſound cure, and it
may be, hee will ſuffer us to bee
held to it ſomewhat with the
longeſt; the venome and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt out from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
wee muſt have patience,
what? Patience at motions to
ſin: yes, ſuch a patience as this
is, to thank God it is no worſe,
and to bee content to wait the

Lords leaſure, dayes, moneths,
yeares, and thanke-yee too, if
we may have it at laſt, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
at the luſt; but yet a patient
and long ſuffering minde, that
we be not tired out. Begin as
ſoone as the tentation begins to
peepe, bee at it to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
every day, and after a time,
the fits will and ſhall breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

if once we conclude, that God

Satan hath us where he would,

for all his ſins, his great ſinnes,
yet hee was Gods ſervant ſtill;
let go this, and though our ſins
were but a few or but ordinary,
yet Satan will ſinke us, with one
tentation or other: but now
keepe wee our ground in this
point, never deny the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that God is our God: and
ſay our corruptions were more,
were worſe than they are, well
may Sathan ſhake his chaine at
us, but we ſtand on a rock, and
the flouds of his tentations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come, ſo much as at our feet:
For we know that our ſins are
but the ſinnes of a creature, his
mercies are the mercies of an
infinite Creator, without either
banke or bottome: keepe wee
the maine chance, that he is our
father, and then, well may our
ſins humble us, but Satan with
all his ſetting on, ſhall never be
able to diſcourage us: we know
that Chriſt died for ſinners, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19840:87"/>
for the chiefe of ſinners: no
man was ever kept out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for his confeſſed badneſſe,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5</note>
but many are for their ſuppoſed
goodneſſe: In a word, this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
point, that hee is our father,
kept up in our conſciences, will
make us fit, and able to daſh, and
blow off, al the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and puſh away all the darts
of the divell; therefore ſith it is
his method to lay all upon this
point, hold this faſt, and wee
hold all faſt: If the Enemy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
one way, and the Garriſon
defend another way, the Towne
is loſt, the Enemy will carry the
ſtrongeſt peece. We muſt not
bee taken up about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and lye open here; here
Satan will try his skill, and doe
his utmoſt to bring us out of
conceit with God, and to make
us think that God hath no love
unto us, no care of us, and then
we are gone. Live and dye then
with this in thy heart, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19840:87"/>
mouth; Hee is my God, and I
am his ſervant, and ſo we ſhall
bee able to lay all the divels in

his love to mee ſo much, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that now I hope I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
call that matter into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againe: And next for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
we muſt frame a new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ere we can with any colour
finde any thing out of Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
us, to prove that hee
doth not love us; of the two,
abundance, and plenty, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, would yeeld mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſay, that God doth not
care for us; and yet it would be
long, ere a Chriſtian will come
to a Miniſter, and ſay, I have
ſuch a deale of wealth, of health,
and ſo many friends, and ſo
much friendſhip, that I feare
mee I am not in the right: but
when afflictions comes and
ſtormes ariſe, then wee come
and make a pitious moane: ſure
God is not my father, I am not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19840:88"/>
his child, and grow we doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hard conceits concerning
God, and heavy thought as
touching our ſelves: now all
this comes out of our fancy
who doe ſo highly prize the
things of this life, that ſure if
God did love us we ſhould not
bee in ſuch and ſuch wants.<note place="margin">Heb 12. 6.</note> A

and God doth never chang

no ſin: for Chriſt was without

make us to diſtruſt our being

God cannot breath ſin

it ought not to be ſaid, that <hi>God</hi>

(then ſay they,) that ſin which
is the puniſhment doth deſerve
more puniſhment, and ſo it
doth: What (ſay they) and
doth that deſerve another? no,
for albeit God may and doth
puniſh ſin with ſin, it followes
not, that the ſecond ſin (muſt)
bee puniſhed with another ſin,

with the ſin meriting: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affront the juſtice and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, when he doth inflict
and lay it on for ſome other
fault: it is out of our element
to take it off, till firſt wee have
removed and done away the
guilt and power of the former
ſin: when ſin doth worke and
produce another ſin by its own
force, then it comes from the
power of ſin: when ſin doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
to have another ſin made
a puniſhment of it, that comes
out of the guilt of ſinne and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God, therefore we muſt
make our peace for the ſinne
which is is the cauſe, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
that ere wee can poſſibly
make any hand with the other
ſin, which is the puniſhment.
That then wee may cleere our

muſt looke &amp; ſee what brought
it, if wee try and try and can
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19840:94"/>
make nothing of it, then wee
may ſee it is for ſome other ſin;
which ſin wee muſt finde out
and then caſt out that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the worke is done: we
finde ſome what to the purpoſe
in <hi>Ionas,</hi> a good old Prophet; he
fled away from God, was found
out, throwen into the Sea, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a Whale, and God in
his goodneſſe did deliver him,
and yet after hee fell into the
like ſin againe: no doubt he did
aske God forgiveneſſe in the
Whale for his firſt ſin, yet hee
after fell into the ſame way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and did chafe, becauſe
<hi>Ninive</hi> was not deſtroyed:
now ſee here the roote of ſinne
was not moared up; he did at
firſt flye out of pride, becauſe
hee would not bee thought to
preach the deſtruction of ſo
famous a place, hee thought
none would be well pleaſed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
ſuch a meſſage, and therefore do
it whoſe would for <hi>Ionas.</hi> This
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19840:95"/>
fact hee was ſorry for, but ſaw
not the cauſe of all, to be pride;
and therefore after, when hee
ſaw that <hi>Ninive</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
what a chafe was hee
in? and was not this horrible
pride too? that ſo many muſt
be deſtroyed, rather than <hi>Ionas</hi>
ſhould bee thought to miſſe in
denouncing a judgment which
ſhould not come: had he found
out the Canker at the firſt and
killed it, he had not fallen this
ſecond fall. Tis certaine, that
as in diſeaſes in the body, if
one diſeaſe bee cauſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is more in the ſpirits
and humours of a man: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
cauſing muſt bee done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
ere the diſeaſe cauſed can
be remitted, it may be eaſed for
a time, but it will returne again,
as long as the ſicke matter is
there to feed it: and therefore
wiſe Phyſitians ſtrike alwayes
at the roote; ſo muſt wee, and
when Satan is upon us with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19840:95"/>
ſome vexing luſt, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with all our power put it
off: Let us ſay, ſure it is for
ſome other ſinne, that muſt bee
killed, ere this will bee cured,
and ſo we muſt caſt out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-luſt:
we muſt not ſay that
we cannot find what it is, what
the ſin is for which we are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with theſe or thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for the Word and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will ſhow it, if wee aske it
at the hands of God, the Lord
will point it out unto us: ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,

<hi>if there be any wicked way in mee,

See if there be any wicked
way in mee, ſee it, and ſhow
it unto me; it being the office
of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 9</note> to convince a man
of his ſins, it followes that the
Spirit (if we ſecke it in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with a deſire to be healed)
will finde out our ſinnes for us,
and ſhew them unto us; and
when by the line of the Word
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19840:96"/>
and Spirit, we have found out
that Neſt, we are to turne our
griefe upon thoſe luſts rather
than upon the preſent tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the matter is, that when
wee are thus haunted and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſuch tentations as are
corrections, ſay, it is rather for
ſome ſins, either:</p>
                  <p>1. Paſt, So ſome when mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are tempted, but not brought
to adultery, becauſe when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
they were uncleane one way
or other, and thought to mend
all by marying without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and ſo when once mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they grow ſecure, and lay all
on the Phyſick,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 11.</note> and not on God;
as <hi>Aſa</hi> did in another caſe: and
then when they feele that ſinne
urgeth, and Satan tempteth; as
much, and perhaps, more after,
than before, becauſe the ſinne is
worſe; men faint and ſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a heavy ſong, and hang up
their ſword, and ſay, as good
not at all, as never the better:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19840:96"/>
Now here the right and ready
way to heale all, is to repent
truly and thorowly of former
uncleanneſſes &amp; luſts, and then
the Coaſts will cleere, firſt doe
that, and then marry; bring not
old ſins to the mariage bed, and
when the knot is knit, tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as many, as ſtrong, perhaps
more, perhaps greater may
come, but they ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
and therefore they muſt
not ſay better, not marry at all
if it be ſo; I ſay he that hath the
gift let him not marry:<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 11</note> but hee
who hath not the gift,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 7.</note> as all
have not,<note place="margin">C. Quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſuiſti. 32. qu. 7.</note> hee were beſt marry,
or he muſt, and will doe worſe:
Reſolve the caſe thus;<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in 16. Luc. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitas illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us crimen tuum.</note> ſuch a
man if hee marry not, uſe what
helpes, naturall, morall, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 37</note>
he can, yet he burnes ſtill,
and the more he oppoſeth, the
more ſtrong his affections
grow; a man maried cannot
ſay, that hee ſhall not bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to defile the bed; but this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19840:97"/>
I ſay, that uſing all GODS
meanes, and calling in for <hi>Gods</hi>
bleſſing on the ordinance, hee
ſhal not fal, his ſoule will heale.
Now in caſe one finde that for
all his care, his luſts grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
and violent; look back
and humble, for what are paſt
before, this is to pluck us by
the eares for what we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were maried, make all
that well, compound with God
for old matters, and then eaſe
and peace will come.</p>
                  <p>2. Preſent, As ſay a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man to bee told and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of his ſin, and yet will not
mend; as wee ſee a man may
ſee a ſin to be a ſin, and yet goe
on in it: witneſſe that young
Gentleman, who went away
like one well beaten, when it
came to ſelling all. Now many
times in ſuch a caſe, God will
have ſuch an one to be tempted
by Satan,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 22.</note> as his Inſtrument,
with ſtrong paſſions to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19840:97"/>
which uſually of all ſins he
could never abide,<note place="margin">Deus utitur Satana, &amp;c.</note> and this goes
to the heart of him: He whines
and wrings his hands,<note place="margin">Vaſq. 1. d 96 c. 10. 11. 64.</note> teares
his haire,<note place="margin">Ibid. D. 99. c. 4. n. 22. &amp;. c. 3. n. 9. Can Loc. l. 2. c. 4. ad Arg. 7.</note> is weary of himſelfe,
knowes not what to doe, and
is even angry with <hi>God,</hi> becauſe
he cannot finde eaſe, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon the point to deſpaire:
here I ſay it will not off, the
tentation will not away till it
hath done its cure; till, I meane,
we finde out, that all that is for
our covetouſneſſe, by which ſin
wee vex and anger God; and
therefore hee doth order Satan
to follow us with wave upon
wave, in that ſinne of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which God ſees will vex
us: Hee would not have us ſit
and reſt quiet in that ſinne of
earthlineſſe, the worſt of the
two, and for that it is, that wee
are terrified with thoſe or ſome
other paſſions of ſhame &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>
                  <p>3. To come (ſo we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19840:98"/>
to ſome ſins, we thought
our hearts till now had no
minde unto: now in this caſe
we muſt know, that it is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and ſo to be taken, to let us
ſee and feele that by tentation,
when we might juſtly be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fall into the action it ſelf,
that we may know, that it was
neither in our worth nor in our
ſtrength, but onely in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
grace of God, that wee
have ſtood cleere all this while,
and that it muſt bee, by the ſame
ſupporting grace of God, that
wee muſt ſtand firme for the
time to come.</p>
                  <p>Looke what is paſt, preſent,
forward, backward, every way
to ſee what it is for, that wee
may remove the cauſe for
which wee are thus tempted,
and then the tentation will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
even of it ſelfe, when that
is once cured: of all wee muſt
beware of Sathans Sophiſtry,
when hee would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19840:98"/>
us to eaſe our ſelves of
the vexation by yeelding once
or twice, or ſo, to the ſinne in
hand, and then no more; now
this is quite againſt Reaſon and
Experience; againſt Reaſon,
for in all morall acts, whether
vertuous and vicious (chiefly
vicious, becauſe our nature is
ſo ſtrong that way) this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
when we once commit
it, it doth leave a wonderfull
proneneſſe to doe it againe:
When then Satan ſaith, doe it
once, and then no more; no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
muſt we ſay, ſhould I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it once, I ſhould be more
earneſt to commit it the ſecond
time than ever I was the firſt.
Againſt Experience, for wee
doe finde, that when wee once
ſin a ſin, the power of grace and
faith doth decay, we have not
that heart to pray againſt it, and
ſo wee are ready to turne that
way againe; as, put fewell to
the fire it burnes the more, ſo
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19840:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth hee, who thinkes to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the motion to a ſinne, by
ſinning the ſin, the onely way
to ſatisfie a luſt, is not to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it.</p>
                  <p>3. The third Generall Rule
is, to make uſe of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to put off the tentation, and
they are chiefly two.</p>
                  <p>1. Prayer:<note place="margin">Mark. 14 68.</note> 
                     <hi>Watch and Pray;</hi>
Watching is but a preparation
to, and a fortification of Prayer:
Prayer is a turning of our ſelves
to God, and ſo a turning of us
from the tentation; ſome turne
to ſome other ſin, as to thinke
of the world when they are
tempted to ſome unpleaſing
Paſſions: ſome to that which
is lawfull in it ſelfe, and here
they finde ſome kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,
but the cure is not done
except we doe by prayer come
to God, and call unto him, for
favour and ſuccour. A man is
never overcome in and by the
tentation, as long as one can
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19840:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pray againſt it; the tentation
prevailes not till it pleaſe,<note place="margin">Ego Adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcens petie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, &amp;c.</note> it
pleaſeth not as long as we can
pray in earneſt againſt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some
for forme doe pray,<note place="margin">Conf. lib. 8. c. 7.</note> as <hi>(Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
ſaith) once hee did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the luſt, but would not
for any thing part with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or pleaſure of them as yet,
this is to ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 25</note> rather than to
pray a prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delight in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and in the Lord, and then
the tentation doth not delight;
wee cannot promiſe that you
ſhall pray away the ſuggeſtion,
but the conſent and delight you
ſhall: But you will ſay, I pray,
and yet I finde ſome delight in
the ſin: what of that? This is
the delight of the fleſh, which
<hi>Paul</hi> inſtancing in himſelfe,
dates call it a ſerving the law of
ſin with his fleſh; but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is, whether we doe take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in that delight, which
way the delight of our inward
man is carried, as long as wee
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19840:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
finde that our delighting in the
luſt, doth grive and trouble us
more, than the luſt it ſelfe doth.
Our caſe is good,<note place="margin">Tentationi carnis nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, &amp;c.</note> and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is of force, and what if for
all that,<note place="margin">Durand. l. 2. D. 21. q. 11. 4.</note> ſinne bee there, yet it
raignes not there? and what if
worſe haunted than when I ſet
my ſelfe againſt it then before?<note place="margin">Rogers Trea. 4. c. 16 Rule. 4.</note>
It is common to bee worſe ſick
when we firſt take our Phyſick;
we thinke of the ſinne and the
circumſtances of it moſt, when
in our prayers we ſet our ſelves
to aggravate it; and out of that
Satan picks matter to delight us
with, and when we oppoſe the
luſt, the luſt then doth moſt
oppoſe, us and Satan will come
upon us then with his greateſt
impreſſions, to ſee if now hee
can allure us with ſome fleſhly
delight, then hee cals upon us
to give over prayer, that ſure
our prayer is naught, that wee
are naught, that God hath no
mind to us, that ſin hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19840:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in us, ſith it ſtirres and
pricks moſt, even then when at
prayer: but wee muſt beleeve
that ſith, we aske according to
his will,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14, 15.</note> hee heareth us, wee
know that we have the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wee deſire of him,<note place="margin">Perk. Caſ. Conſ. l. a. c. 7</note> what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wee feele, ſay our prayers
prove an occaſion to ripen a
diſeaſe, when it muſt ripen ere
it will cure; all is to drive us out
of all ſelfe confidence and then
the malady will heale. Go then
on in praying with perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
all manner of prayer, and
the end will be, that if we doe
not give over to pray, Satan
muſt, and will give over to
tempt. The three maine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
I could wiſh Chriſtians to
ſue for in their prayers are, 1.
Strength to conquer ſatan when
he ſets upon us, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> main force,
and plaine violence, and ſeidge;
I know hee cannot compell us,
for then the ſinne were his,
not ours; but yet forall that he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19840:101"/>
can and doth w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a ſtrong hand

bringeth us to yeeld,<note place="margin">Bonav. l. 2. D. 11. a. 1. q. 1. ad arg. &amp;. D. 25. q. 4.</note> and in that
ſenſe we cannot of our ſelves
ſtand in his hands, when hee
comes againſt us with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
no ſtanding againſt him and
his tentation, except we bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlaid
by the power of God;
he wil wreſt a conſent from us,
and worke us to a delight, doe
we what wee can (for wee can
doe nothing of our ſelves,) it is
out of our hands to bee able to
gaine ſay him, when he comes
with his authority, and frights
us with his power, wee muſt
then pray in the power of God,
and when wee ſee Satan come
roaring like a Lion, cry out and
ſay, helpe, helpe, though it bee

bee forced, Satan muſt by
his ſtrength and terrifying draw
a conſent from us, elſe wee are
free and the ſin cannot be done,
and that he will doe, except we
do beſpeake by prayer the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God: But now ſith that
we have by reaſon of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
the power of God at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
it is in our ſelves, if wee
want his ſtrength in our ſoules,
it is, becauſe wee will not doe
ſo much as aske for it:<note place="margin">Phi. 2. 13.</note> if wee
find that he hath given the Wil,
he will give the Deed,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> though
not ever anſwerable to our wil;
as we ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> to will, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with me, but how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that which is good, I
finde not; that is not anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my deſire, ſimply then he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19840:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth not deny us all perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
nor ſuch as ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
to our comfort, pray
then for ſtrength and Sathan
will prove but weake, either
God will weaken him, or elſe
he will further ſtrengthen us.</p>
                  <p>2. The next thing we muſt
pray for, is Wiſdome, that we
may not bee ignorant of his
wiles, which if we be, he will
coozen and cheate us: Sathan
comes not ever as a Lion, but
rather moſt an end, like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
a Fox, with all his art
and skill that hee may circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
us, and bring his ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
by reaſon of our ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and folly: we muſt up, to
the onely wiſe God by prayer,
that he would enrich us, with
the wiſdome that commeth
from aboue: if any man ſaith
<hi>Iames</hi> want:<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 17.</note> What? Wiſdome,
<hi>Let him aske of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5.</note> but he will
not give me, yes, he giveth to
all: and what if our wants that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19840:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way bee great? why, hee gives
liberally: and ſay we have bin
great ſinners, are as unworthy
as they that are moſt, if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes;
(he upbraideth no man)
hee will not hit us in the teeth
with old matters: all want wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but he that is ſenſible of
his want, let him aske and hee
ſhall have wit enough, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Stratagems of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell:
the Lord God is too wiſe
for Satan; hee will make chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of us, if we ſet to him hand
to hand, our wit to his will
come to nothing: looke how a
crafty pate, may coozen a child
of all that he hath for an apple,
or ſo; In like manner, Satan with
a toy, will deceive us of our
ſoules, and beguile us of our
peace; there is then neither wit
nor grace in it, for a man to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on him without prayer to
God, for the ſpirit of wiſdome,
and in particular, with a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſtraine of ſpirituall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19840:103"/>
to be able to wind out
of the pollicies of the divell.
What with his naturall wit,
Age, Time, Experience; Satan
is full of depths and profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we cannot hold our owne,
if wee have no better skill to
plead with him than our owne;
Prayer will make us wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and helpe us to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the Myſteries
of his iniquity,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15</note> that wee ſhall
ſoone finde him out, and ſave
our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>3. The third thing wee are
to aske for, is Long-ſuffering;
for when Satan cannot have his
will by Violence, by Craft, then
he will ſee what he can doe by
Continuance and meere Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity:
I cannot expreſſe my
ſelfe better, than in the words
of <hi>Martin Luther:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">On Gal.</note> when the
divell (ſaith he) cannot by force
overcome thoſe that he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
then ſeeketh hee to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19840:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for he knoweth that wee
bee earthen veſſels which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
long endure, and hold out
many knockes and violent
ſtrokes; therefore with long-continuance
of tentations, hee
overcommeth many and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
long-ſuffering is needfull
to wait for the end of thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">Pſa. 30. 18</note>
which the divell rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
up againſt us.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> So he, how
long wee ſhall bee put to it to
waite, I know not; the beſt is,
if we dye while we are waiting
we goe to heaven, for ſuch are
happy and bleſſed; but uſually
and commonly, God gives us
an iſſue here, firſt or laſt: wee
muſt then pray that it may bee,
and waite with patience till it
ſhall bee, which will bee, and
ſhall be in Gods time: hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
comes too ſoone, nor never
ſtayes too long: We ſay, <hi>Lord
how long;</hi> but GOD ſaith, in
the appointed time; therefore
waite and pray: and in ſome
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19840:104"/>
caſes where ſingle prayer will
not doe, as in ſome, it will not,
there helpe it with a faſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The next Weapon, is the
word,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 17.</note> Read, Heard, Meditated;
<hi>Paul</hi> cals it, the ſword of the
Spirit; a fit inſtrument for a
man to enter into the Combate
with: for Satan being a Spirit,
our weapons muſt not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4</note>
but ſpirituall, &amp; the Word
of GOD is the ſword of the
Spirit,<note place="margin">Gladius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur ſermo divinus, &amp;c Chryſ. in Mat. Hom. 8.</note> which being had and
uſed, kils up all the luſts of the
fleſh, and hee that kils ſin, doth
in a ſort kill the divell. A man
that is to ride where Theeves
way lay him, will bee ſure to
have his ſword: Wee are to paſſe
up and downe where we ſhall
light upon the divell, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

is ſtill at the hedge corner as we
travell, hee is at home, hee is at
Church, hee miſſeth not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
hee is the god of this
world, under the great GOD
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19840:104"/>
of Heaven and Earth as he ſhall
give way, and there is no place
priviledged from him;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4</note> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

to draw it, and the skill to uſe
it, wee muſt bee able to fence
with this weapon of proofe,
and then the divel will be gone,
this two-edged ſword will
make him run. Wee finde that
Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. being at it with
the divell, did not make uſe
of his authority or power, to
command or to force him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<note place="margin">Ideo Ieſus omnes has tentationes, &amp;c. Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. in Mat. 4. &amp; Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but to ſanctifie the uſe of
this weapon to us, ſtops his
mouth with (thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
Satan doth vow and ſweare
our death, therefore it ſtands us
upon to looke to our heads, and
we muſt not thinke with a few
big words of our own to make

this mighty and crafty foe to
flye the field, it muſt bee done
by the word of God which is
mighty through God;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4</note> Sathan
comes with his Bible too, as
wee ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. but hee doth
corrupt and falſifie the Text;
the word uſed aright ſets him
going, it hath to back it, the
Almighty power of God, and
Satan cannot ſtand before this
breath of the Lords noſtrils: we
deceive o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r ſelves, if we thinke
that Reaſon is of any force, that
Inconveniences will hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Satan; to ſay, ſhame will
follow, danger will come, I ſhall
but create trouble to my ſelfe;
ſhould I kil, or whore, or ſteale,
Satan will come within us, for
all theſe; hee will ſet ſuch a
gloſſe on the matter, that wee
ſhall thinke wee have greater
reaſon to ſin the ſinne, than we
can ſhow to the contrary: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was never appointed or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to this uſe: diſpute but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19840:105"/>
with Satan and hee will ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foole
us, that we ſhall think we
cannot live, no, nor ſcarce goe
to heaven neither, except wee
ſin ſome ſins for a time, or ſo.
Beware then of going that way
to worke, wee have a better
courſe, that is, to runne to the
Word; the Word will doe it,
(it is written) will pack him
away: but what if he come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe with the ſelfe-ſame
tentation, as Satan both
may and doth, why, the ſame
places of the word will doe the
deed againe; Satan is not afraid
of big lookes and words; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and holy water are but
toyes to him, but it is the word
of GOD which makes him
avoid: Chriſt wee ſee, did not
pray; hee could have prai'd, I
hope, none the like; but onely
the word is his defence, being
thus to grapple and enter into
duell with the divell; I ſpeake
not, that prayer is not of great
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19840:106"/>
uſe, I have ſet downe my mind
of that already, but that with
our prayer muſt be joyned; the
word; and the word will doe it,
and of theſe two, if both by
ſtrictnes of time cannot be uſed,
bee we ſure to make uſe of the
Word of God: the words and
experience of <hi>Luther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">On Gal.</note> are juſt
to our purpoſe, when (ſaith he)
the motions of the fleſh doe
rage; the onely remedy is to
take to us the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is, the word of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to fight againſt them,
which if wee doe, let us not
doubt but we ſhall obtaine the
victory, although ſo long as the
battell endureth, wee feele quite
the contrary: but ſet the Word
out of ſight and there is no help
nor counſell remaining; of this
that (I ſay) I my ſelfe have good
experience; I have ſuffered
many great paſſions, and the
ſame alſo very great and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but ſo ſoone as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of any place of Scripture, and
ſtaid my ſelfe upon it, as upon
my chiefe Anchor-hold, ſtrait-wayes
my tentation did vaniſh
away, which without the word
it had beene impoſſible for me
to endure any little ſpace, and
much leſſe to overcome them.
Thus <hi>Luther;</hi> A brave ſpeech,
and fitting the Author of it:
Learne of him, to have our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at command, and Satan dares
not ſtay. I ſpeake not, as though
we were to turne the Text of
Scripture into a charme, as
though to repeate a place by
rote, and in a heartleſſe manner,
would prove a bug-beare to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.<note place="margin">VVier. de praeſtig. Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. l. 5. c. 4</note>

but the Word muſt bee
held out by faith: it was not
ſo much <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> ſword as
his arme that held it, which
gave him ſuch victories; it is
the hand of faith, and of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19840:107"/>
by which the word of God
is held out, which doth the
deed; wherefore we ſee what
reaſon we have, ſith wee have
ſuch an adverſary, who is
(though not ſimply every
where) yet in every place
where we be, hee is, or ſome of
his Angels are: great reaſon I
ſay there is,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13, 14.</note> that we ſhould bee
expert in the word of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
to have places at our
fingers ends ready to draw out
as occaſions ſhall require, that
we may have a fit &amp; a pat place
to meet with the ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſions
of the fleſh, and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the divell: there is
neither ſin or tentation, neither
inward corruption nor outward
motion, but the word hath a
ſoveraigne remedy for it, to be
fitted in a peculiar ſort to the
nature of the diſeaſe;<note place="margin">Omnis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus animae habet in ſcripturis medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuum, Aug. in Pſa. 36.</note> it is not
for nothing, that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> often

and as there is an art in mining

skill to finde out golden pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fit for our preſent purpoſe:
and thus a godly wiſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
ſay hee bee often in the fire,
yet he is like the burning buſh,
never conſumed; and why?
becauſe one place or other of
the word comes in to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
the particulars that wee
are to follow are three.</p>
                  <p>1. We muſt have ready the
precept, and ſtatute of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
the ſinne to which we
are ſolicited, as ſay, it be to Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
breaking, then ſay, it is
written, thou ſhalt keepe holy
the Sabbath day; or to murther
ones ſelfe or ſome other, ſay, it
is written, thou ſhalt not kill;
or to uncleanneſſe, urge the
place, avoid Satan, it is written,
thou ſhalt not commit adultery,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19840:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſo, thou ſhalt not ſteale, and
the like, in the ſpeciall branches
of every Commandement.</p>
                  <p>2. Wee muſt have at hand,
the promiſe too, that in caſe we
conſent and obey not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the divels offer, wee ſhall
have comfort here, and heaven
hereafter. The divell will come
with his hands full of glorious
proffers, but we muſt out of the
Word, ſet againſt him the faire
and certaine, and goodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the Word, as there is
no ſinne but we ſhall finde one
promiſe or other made in plain
termes to us, if we reſiſt it; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the divell and GOD will
draw neere to you: hee offers
the kingdoms of the world, and
the glory of them; God offers
the kingdome of heaven and
the glory of it.</p>
                  <p>3. The threatning, that if we
yeeld, we enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger al, that we do
ſubject our ſelves to the curſe
of God; ſay we doe beleeve the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19840:108"/>
Commandement, yet except
wee doe beleeve the threatning,
and doe ſet the commination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the tentation, wee are not
like, nor ſure to hold; here <hi>Eve</hi>
loſt her ſelfe; in whoſe loſſe we
all loſe our ſelves; the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
ſhee did hold, that ſhee
was not to eate of the for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit; but now for the
threatning, that in the day ſhee
did eate thereof ſhe ſhould dye
the death, there ſhe came ſhort
and ſo yeelded: that ſhee was
quick and ſtrict in the precept,
it is plaine by the words of the
Text;<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> for whereas it is in the
charge of the Lord, of the tree
of knowledge, of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
Thou ſhalt not eate of it;
<hi>Eve</hi> having occaſion to urge
this divine prohibition, doth
not onely ſay, that God ſaid, Ye
ſhall not eate of it, but to ſhew
her pious minde to the mandat
of the Lord, ſhe ſaith more and
addeth,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 3.</note> yee ſhall not touch it;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19840:109"/>
which words wee finde not in
the letter of that law, but when
it came to the commination,<note place="margin">Parae. in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3.</note> ye
ſhall dye the death: Satan was
too hard for her, and put her off
from that, and ſo ſhe fell; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſhe halted in adding to the
Lords words, for IEHOVAH
had forbid them to eate it, but
hee did no where forbid them
to touch it, yet this ſhewes, that
therein ſhe was ſtrict, and more
ſtrict than the words wil beare;
but for the theatning, where
God ſaid, yee ſhall dye, ſhe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and hath it thus, leaſt yee
dye: and for certaine, when
we doe not keep to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
wee ſhall not hold our
ſelves to the commandement:
it goes with us as it did with
our firſt fathers, a want of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the threatning faſt did caſt
them downe; and if we be ſhort
there, and doe not oppoſe the
threatning, wee cannot ſtand:
as ſoone as ever Satan is at us to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19840:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yeeld to our luſt, ſay no, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by God: let it be to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery;
anſwer, it is written,
thou ſhalt not commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note>
then adde to the prohibition
the commination, Adulterers
and Fornicators <hi>God</hi> will judge.
I muſt not, I am forbidden, I
dare not yeeld, if I do, I ſhall dye
the death, I ſhall damne, and ſo
Satan hath his anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The laſt generall Rule wee
propoſe, is to aske helpe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, and the directions
which come in here to bee ſet
downe are theſe. 1. Never to
let any man know what the
matter is, if by any meanes we
can have comfort from GOD,
acquaint no man with it; if we
can get him to doe the cure in
ordinary matters, ſee what the
uſe of ordinary prayer will doe;
in caſes extraordinary, ſtretch
our ſtrength to the moſt, that
our prayers may bee ſtrong and
long, let us wing them with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19840:110"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

faith, and with a faſt, that they
muſt up to the boſome of the
father; to ſay, I have prayed and
can finde no eaſe, and therefore
I will make uſe of a friend is
well enough; but I have prayed,
faſted, and waited too, as long
as ever. I can, and yet it will not
come, then we muſt, but til then
till we have tried the utmoſt, I
could wiſh men to ſecret their
tentations from the world: God
will not take himſelfe to be wel
uſed, for us to goe to others,
when wee may have it for the
comming at his hands, with
comfort and encouragement.
A father loves not a child ſhold
run to neighbours for phyſick,
when hee may have it of him;
beſides, it is ſweeteſt, when we
have it immediately from the
hands of <hi>God</hi> our father: when
a child is ſick, the ſame cordiall
or ſweet meat ſent by a ſervant,
is not ſo accepted when father
or mother brings it and gives it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19840:111"/>
with their owne hands; we ſee
many muſt have mother give it,
elſe they will not take it: ſo it
is with us, it cannot but be beſt
welcome, when God doth give
us our comforts with his owne
hands, and tell us good tydings
of peace and mercy with his
owne mouth; and then againe,
we do not conceive, how it wil
wound out hearts, that we have
let any man know our ſtate and
caſe, when wee are to come to
our ſelves againe; if ſo be then
wee finde and conceive that all
might have beene well, and the
cure done betwixt God and our
ſelves, without the knowledge
of any man, the trouble that way
many times, wounds more than
ever the tentation did, and ſome
have even wiſhed them dead
and fairely buried, to whom in
times of their heavineſſe they
have broken their mindes, and
therefore the counſell I give is,
firſt, to try all meanes, to uſe all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19840:112"/>
patience, to watch, to pray, to
faſt, to waite, and if God at any
time will come in with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
let him doe all, and have all
the praiſe, we hiding our grifes
from all the world, in great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſorrowes wee are too apt
to open our ſelves more than
needs, therefore this counſell
is in ſeaſon. 2. See whether
we can cure our ſelves (as thus)
what would I ſay to, or think of
another, ſhould he come to me
with my ſore complaint, the
ſame, ſay wee to our ſelves, and
ſee what that will do. 3. When
all will not doe, and we finde
that GOD doth look ſtraying
yet; and wee can hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then wee muſt know, that
GOD doth call us to vent and
open our griefe to ſome one
or other; now the griefe muſt
be opened, God doth call us to
a free diſcovery of our ſelves to
another, and without wee doe
breake open the matter, the end
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19840:112"/>
is not like to be good. So <hi>Iames,
Confeſſe your ſinnes one to another,
and pray one for another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 5. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>and there
ſhall bee an healing;</hi> and in this
caſe, without this mutuall and
reciprocall confeſſion, there
ſhall not be an healing; I know
God could make all well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, but he will not: there
is a naturall reaſon, why we find
eaſe by this venting, becauſe
it doth open the ſore, and make
it as it were runne, and ſo there
comes ſome eaſe, but the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
cauſe is it, which carries it,
and it is becauſe God will have
acommunion of Saints amongſt
us; he will not have us ſtraying
one to another, and hee knowes
that by curing another, we cure
our ſelves, &amp; upon that it is, that
the pain of the foule in this caſe
doth not nor ſhall not ſtake, till
we have acquainted one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our caſe; ſo wee ſee,
that tho the party to whom we
confeſſe, ſay no more to us than
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19840:113"/>
wee knew before, yet the very
venting brings ſome eaſe: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
I know cannot abide this,
for few ever open all, but there
is a remedy, and his tentation
is at an end, and therefore hee
urgeth hard upon the point, to
hinder us by all meanes from
telling any body: What (ſaith
he) it will all the Country over;
hee will tell his friend, and that
friend another friend, and out
it will, and thou art either ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or undone for ever. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when God doth not call
us to this, it is dangerous to tell
our verieſt friend; for though
he be our friend, yet commonly
we are not his confident friend,
but he bath ſome other, and hee
muſt know it under <hi>benedicite,</hi>
and then he is ſick, til his friend
knowes it too; who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſome third man, and ſo
there is great danger that it will
abroad; wherefore if wee can
doe up our matters by telling
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19840:113"/>
God alone, let no man know:
but now when wee have tried
and it will not be, then ſay, God
hath called mee to out with it,
and out with it I muſt, and will
live by faith,<note place="margin">The way to have our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets kept, is not to keepe them but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale them.</note> that God will
make them keepe my counſell;
or if they doe not, yet ſhame
mee no ſhames, I will follow
God,<note place="margin">Vid. Hook. on Act. 2. 37 p. 243.</note> and confeſſe I will, what
ever comes of it: and here we
muſt know; that when we find
a great diſpoſition in us, to keep
it from all the world; that then
Satan meanes us ſome great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and therefore hee will fill
our heads, with a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of ſhames and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and all to make us keepe
all cloſe to our owne undoing
and ruine, ſay then, I know by
this, that great hurt comes by
my hiding, and great good is
to be had by my confeſſing, in
that I finde my ſelfe ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to confeſſe it to men, and
therefore becauſe I finde my
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19840:114"/>
ſelfe ſo loth, I will ſure confeſſe,
I ſee, I muſt tell it ſome body,
elſe all will bee naught, there
lies danger, elſe Sathan would
not keepe ſuch adoe at mee to
hide it, and by no meanes to
diſcloſe it to any man living.
I thinke I may ſay it, that never
any who diſcloſed all to ſome
godly friend did ever yet miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry;
but many who, out of
ſome conceits, or of the power
of Satan, cannot be brought to
open the veine, after long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
have made away
themſelves; when then we find
a great unwillingneſſe (after we
have bin with God) to let any
man know our minde, ſay, there
is a miſchiefe meant to mee by
Satan; I know by this, in that, it
is ſo ſore againſt my will to
diſcloſe, and therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the worſt, I will breake
thorow, and out of hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
to ſome friend; and in our
confeſſing, we muſt confeſſe all
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19840:114"/>
that paines our ſoules, in telling
Phyſicians wee muſt leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
materiall as touching our
diſeaſe, that will endanger all;
ſo wee muſt not tell ſome pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
onely, but for the ſubſtance
and circumſtances, all that is to
the purpoſe we muſt diſcover,
elſe a naile, a ſtub left in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
will hold the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
many have undone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by this, in that they have
left ſome maine matter out: by
maine matter I meane, that
which turnes the conſcience
out of its peace: thinke not
that we would have Chriſtians
run up and downe to Preachers
for every thing that moves in
the conſcience: hee makes
worke, who will to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
for every ſtitch and ache;
but when the trouble of minde
is ſuch, that it wounds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(as <hi>Salomons</hi> phraſe is,<note place="margin">Pro. 18. 14.</note>
and every ſore is not a wound
you know) when it doth ſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19840:115"/>
diſtreſſe the heart of man, that
hee cannot enjoy God, cannot
doe his duty as a Chriſtian, nor
enjoy himſelfe, cannot live in
his calling as a Man; then it is
high time, firſt to make up to
God, and if we be kept off there,
then to make out to Man: when
then we finde it ſuch a burthen
to the conſcience that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand under it, <hi>(For a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſpirit who can beare?)</hi> there
diſpute no longer, but away to
ſome one or other; now for the
choice we muſt make.</p>
                  <p>1. Firſt, if all circumſtances
concurre, let it bee ſome godly
&amp; learned Miniſter, for though
that another ſpeake the ſame
words of comfort, yet they will
ſound better out of his mouth,
and it is his office, and he hath
a more particular promiſe that
his words ſhall proſper; every
thing workes much; what as it
is taken, what he ſaith becauſe
he is a Miniſter, will bee better
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19840:115"/>
taken, and diſgeſt better with
our conſciences: ſo wee finde
in <hi>Iob,</hi> that it is principally and
uſually the Meſſenger, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
the one of a thouſand
that doth it.</p>
                  <p>2. If wee ſee that a Miniſter
cannot be had, or not truſted, or
not comfortably uſed, any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chriſtian will ſerve: <hi>Iames</hi>
ſaith to private men; <hi>Confeſſe
your ſins one to another, and pray
one for another:</hi> Writing, and
ſpeaking to private Chriſtians,
hee doth not tye us to any auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
confeſſion to the Prieſt,
for then the Prieſt were alſo by
the place in <hi>Iames,</hi> bound to
confeſſe to private men alſo;
for here is a mutuall confeſſing
one to another, and here they
are to pray one for another,<note place="margin">Scot. Sent. l. 4. D. 17. q. 1. Aug. Conf. l. 10. c. 3. Ambro. Serm. 2. in Pſa. 119. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zom Hiſt. l. 7. c. 16.</note>
which cannot bee to abſolve:
For if to pray were to abſolve,
then their Laity hath as great
authority by that place to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
their Prieſts, as their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19840:116"/>
Prieſts their Laity: but to paſſe
them, wee ſay, that a private
man may ſerve as well, and
ſometimes better, to let us ſee
that all is from God, and from
his grace alone; a ſimple Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian
man or woman ſhall do it
by ſpeaking a few plaine words
out of the Scripture, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Divines have bin uſed,
and can make nothing of it; as
ſomtimes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Chirurgion
gives the cure over; ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
makes the party as whole
as a fiſh: and what if wee our
ſelves, can at other times ſay as
much or more than we can, yet
we muſt uſe Gods way; he is a
ſtander by, and ſees more than
we can, in and by our ſelves, and
no man is ſo fit a Phyſitian of
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Ad ſeipſos adhibent medici; ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groti medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos alios.</note> whether ſoule or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but whether it be Miniſter
or private Chriſtian, who is
uſed, the care muſt bee, that a
wiſe choice bee made,<note place="margin">Ariſt. polpit l. 3. c. 12.</note> and for
our choice, let the party be ſome
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19840:116"/>
godly humble man, and one
who hath bin in the fire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and then hee will (as hee
ſees it to bee his duty) confeſſe
the ſame or the like to us, and
comfort us with the comfort,
hee himſelfe hath beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
by. Take a man of whom
we have the opinion, that hee
is the ſure ſervant of God, and
then when we finde by his free
confeſſion to us, that hee hath
had the ſame or worſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and tentations, then wee
ſhall ſoone joyne hand with
him, that for all this, wee may
be the ſervants of God too, and
that we ſhall ſee day, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
againe; and then wee will
waite with content and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
as the watchman doth for
the light, becauſe he knowes,
that be it ever ſo darke, it will
be day againe: when wee have
an aſſurance for the preſent, that
when we are at the worſt, wee
are the ſervants of God, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19840:117"/>
that wee ſhall in good time bee
as well and as comfortable as
ever we were; as we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in our friend, whom
now wee make our Comforter
and Phyſitian, it is eaſie for us
then, to poſſeſſe our ſoules with
quiet and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Another thing, that wee are
to looke to, is, that he be a man
who can and will keepe our
councell; for if hee bee a blab,
the more wee conjure him all
ſecreſie, the more ſick hee will
bee (like thoſe in the Goſpell)
to out with it all abroad; and it
may be, he would keepe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
better if wee did not binde
him: and by the way I could
wiſh, that whom ſoever wee
make uſe of; that wee bee not
too too ſtrict to binde them to
ſecreſie (except in ſome things
the danger be ſo great that there
may bee need of an oath,) for it
is our nature, the more wee are
kept from a thing, the more
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19840:117"/>
earneſt wee are after it, and
therefore too too ſevere termes
that way, are not ſo fit. Well,
wee muſt then doe what wee
can, to chuſe out a man that can
hold; and herein I thinke wee
ſhall doe wiſely to doe as they
doe, who doe try a new veſſell,
prove it with Water firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they truſt it with Wine;
thus we ſhall do well and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſound them, with ſome
leſſer matters, and if wee finde
them wanting in ſecreſie there,
then truſt them no further;
ſome cautions are delivered
here, as that wee meddle not
with men who are full of
tongue, of a talkative diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 13</note>
for ſuch cannot hold for
their lives, nor ſuch as can keep
nothing from their wives or
husbands (for women may bee
fitter, and in ſome caſes make
uſe of women rather than men)
nor ſuch as bee of an inquiſitive
diſpoſition; a man willing to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19840:118"/>
fiſh out our counſels, is not a
likely man to keepe our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
indeed, if we come to a
man of purpoſe, to reveale our
ſelves, and when wee come to
the Tooth-drawer, our teeth
leave aking for a time: if the
tentation withdraw for the
preſent, or that wee are ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
that wee cannot utter;
in this caſe, the friend ſhall doe
full wiſely to pierce us, to draw
it out of us, to bid us write our
minde, lay it down, and leave it
behind us,<note place="margin">Epiſtola non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one who hath been ſick of
the ſame, or the like himſelfe,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19840:118"/>
an experienced man in himſelfe
and others, a Phyſitian in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and a friend too, a boſome
friend; and if wee have him a
<hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Ionathan,</hi> a ſworne-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a ſtill, grave, ſober ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and humble-minded man,
and then confeſſe to him and
ſpare not, confeſſe to him and
feare nothing; and when wee
have ſo done, let us not diſtruſt
but wee ſhall ſee a good end;
and when we have ſpoken our
minde to one or two, and wee
have our comfort under two or
thee witneſſes, let's not out
with it to any body elſe in the
world; I know ſpirituall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
are apt to vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
when once we beginne,
for when wee finde a little eaſe
by opening the ſore to one, we
thinke that the more wee open
unto, the more eaſe wee ſhall
have, and ſo wee are in danger
to ſhew our caſe to all we meet,
and here Satan hath a Stratagem
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19840:119"/>
that when hee ſees hee cannot
make us ſecret our matters
from a friend, then hee will
urge us to out with it to all, and
after wound us with a ſore and
heavy tentation, that now wee
have ſhamed our ſelves for ever:
and therefore my counſell here
is,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 13</note> that when wee have found
a faithfull friend, that then we
begin and end with him, except
wee call in one or two at the
moſt, to have the matter under
the teſte of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
and before I leave the
particular, I muſt make bold to
call upon ſuch, as are made Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
to the ſoules of their
friend, to make uſe of theſe
things.</p>
                  <p>1. That they bee not over-earneſt
to fiſh out mens ſecrets,
for if wee meane honeſty and
ſecrecy, they are more bound to
us, that wee will heare them
than wee, that they will tell us,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19840:119"/>
for wee are thereby, bound to
one great duty more than wee
were, and that is to keepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</p>
                  <p>2. Wee muſt bee willing to
bee made uſe of by men, as by
women, by poore, as well as by
rich.<note place="margin">Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> For as one ſpeakes, who
was of great experience this
way; there lyes a great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it, when wee finde our
ſelves more ready, to take the
confeſſions of Women, than
of Men, of young women, than
of old, of faire than of foule,
of Gentlemen, and rich men,
than of poore: and which we
muſt ſee that wee humble for
and avoid, and bee rather for
the poore than the rich, for
Men than Women, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. By all meanes wee muſt
keepe councell, except the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtand ſo, that wee ſin in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
cloſe their ſecrets; and
here if wee have cauſe to doubt
any thing; as though his ſecrets
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19840:120"/>
would be pernicious, wee ſhall
doe well to tell him, that if he
aske for counſels ſake, that then
we will heare him; but if that
he have a farther intent and his
plot bee dangerous, aſſure him
we will breake friendſhip with
him; and rather loſe a friend of
him, than keepe his ſinfull ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and loſe a friend of God:
but if it may bee done, then by
all meanes keepe it from all,
and chiefeſt of all, ſome ſecrets
of the wife from the husband,
of the husband from the wife.</p>
                  <p>4. Confeſſe againe to them
when we our ſelves have beene
healed of the like; and ſay I was
ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, and by
taking ſuch or ſuch things, by
uſing my ſelfe to theſe or thoſe
courſes, I was cured, and am as
comfortable as ever I was in all
my life: ye would not beleeve
how this will ſettle the heart of
a poore Chriſtian, who hath a
good opinion of us and our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19840:120"/>
doe not ſtand thinking,
that they will never think well
of us againe, if they doe not,
an happy loſſe, if we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bring them to peace and
comfort; but the truth is, theſe
are but fancies. If a man have
a calling from <hi>God</hi> for the good
of mens ſoules, to open all his
heart, in the ſight of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
men will thinke never the
worſe of him, but the better;
and indeed we can confeſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
one to another, but what
we may in a manner know one
by another before hand, ſith we
have all one and the ſame heart,
cut out of the ſame rock, of the
ſame complexion and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as touching our luſt and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
ſinne, and therefore if
they confeſſe to us, to have
comfort from us, wee may doe
well to tell them our ſinnes and
errours in a mutuall manner,<note place="margin">Cartw. in Iam. 5. v. 16</note> as
they doe their wounds to us.</p>
                  <p>5. We muſt pitty them and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19840:121"/>
pray for them, and helpe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their burdens: wee of our
ſelves can doe nothing,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> but we
muſt commend their ſtate and
caſe to God; as hee is to pray
for himſelfe, ſo we are to pray
to God for him,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16.</note> and <hi>the prayer
of a righteous man availeth much,
and is of force:</hi> where many
may fitly come together in
prayer, the more the better: but
in this caſe of ſecrecy, one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is made acquainted with
the matter, and in this matter,
the prayer of one righteous
man ſhall do the deed; for it is
not the worth or force of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the promiſe of GOD
which is all in all, here we have
a promiſe, and by vertue of that
promiſe the prayer of one will
carry it.</p>
                  <p>The Generall Rules after the
Tentation is over.</p>
                  <p>1. Wee muſt not bee cooze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo as to think the tentation
is reſiſted and conquered, when
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19840:121"/>
it is not, nor yet ſuffer our ſelves
by Satans deceipt, and that of
our owne hearts, to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it is not conquered, when
it is: ſometimes Satan doth
for a time withdraw himſelfe,
hee may, and doth in skill, ceaſe
to ſolicit; and luſt may ſit ſtill
for a ſpace, and all to lull us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe,
as though all were done,
when nothing is done, as though
all were killed, when it is as live
as ever it was. The tempter will
come, and bring ſeven worſe
with him than before; and our
luſt will come againe, and take
us at ſome advantage, and doe
us a ſpoile: in caſe wee thinke
the tentation ended, when there
is a politike giving over to
bite for a ſeaſon onely: What
muſt wee doe, to know when
the ceaſing is, becauſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is conquered, and when
it is onely by withdrawment
for a time? Many things might
here bee ſaid; that which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19840:122"/>
is to affirme, that if wee
have taken paines, uſed Gods
meanes, waited Gods time,
then the worke is done as it
ſhould be; but if meanes, or all
ordinary meanes to bee had
have not beene uſed, wee have
not ſet God and prayer, againſt
the motion: if we find that the
luſt is gone, we know not how
on a ſudden, no ſooner come
almoſt but gone, hereis cauſe of
ſuſpicion, to feare that all is but
a practiſe of our great enemy,
a purpoſe to rock us in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that he may come and take
us in the ſinne or ſome other,
when we leaſt thinke of it, and
and ſtand unprepared. Againe,
if wee finde no good fruits and
effects to follow, no good to
come of it to our heart and life,
that wee are no more humble,
no more (if not leſſe) ſpirituall
than before; here is great doubt
that the tentation is gone the
wrong way; for if we do drive
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19840:122"/>
this Divell away by GODS
meanes, which are ſpirituall, as
prayer, reading, watching; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſeed-corne, will leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, ſome ſpirituall fruit;
prayers, and holy exerciſes uſe
not to bee loſt, they fall not in
the duſt, but mortifie, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
they both muſt and doe,
and therefore if wee finde eaſe,
but not grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11</note> ſome quiet, but
not the quiet fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
for all that I know, as
good the tentation had ſtayed,
as depart thus. But if we finde
that we have not onely a bare
freed once from the ſtirre and
power of the tentation; but
the tentation is over, and good,
is left behind, more modeſt,
humble, fearefull of ſin, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of God; then the worke is
done by God, and we have our
comfort: when a man then doth
finde ſome reſpit by turning his
thoughts over, to thinke of the
world, that this or that is to be
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19840:123"/>
got or ſaved, be ſet or ſold, here
or there is a purchaſe to bee
made; this is not Gods cure,
but if the liberty we now have,
over we had, be made ours by
turning to God and his wayes,
then wee may boldly tell our
ſelves, and bid our conſciences
reſt upon it, that we have gone
the right way to worke, and
that there is no miſtake in the
matter: and as wee muſt not
thinke wee have it, when wee
have it not; ſo wee muſt not
think we have it not, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in truth we have. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
doth play on both ſides, and
his devices to coozen us of our
comfort this way are many:
what ſaith hee, all that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a forbearing of old
and wonted occaſions, and a
wicked man may doe this; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
we muſt not lay the fault
on the occaſion, as the Tipler
doth on drinke, that it is made
ſo ſtrong; and the Glutton on
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19840:123"/>
his fare, it is ſo choice, that who
can chooſe but feed by the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the creatures are no kind
of cauſe. Before the Floud,
when men did (as great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
conceive) drinke water
and feed upon plants;<note place="margin">Chryſ. in Gen 9. hom. 29. Rain. Apol. Theſ. Sect. 33.</note> wee ſee
there was a world of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and therefore we muſt
lay the fault on our luſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
not on the occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
yet this I ſay, that if a man
finde, that by the uſe of prayer
and the word, a man doth in
conſcience and with conſtancy
ſhun all the occaſions of that
ſin, which heretofore hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could nor would; there is
a cure wrought, for a brunt in
ſome fit, an unregenerate man
may; but to doe it ſtill, alwayes,
forever hereafter: thus to doe
is a ſigne of power, of grace;
and after conſtancy we muſt ſee
that wee doe it in conſcience,
that we do not avoid the thing
or perſon, which were to us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19840:124"/>
of ſinning out of hatred,
to the perſon or to the thing,
but to the ſin; that our ſtomack
doth not riſe at them, as they
are ſuch or ſuch things materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
but formally as they are
to us occaſions of offending,
and that by reaſon of coruption,
not in them, but in us: He that
can doe that, that man may ſay
that Sathan lyes when hee tels
him, that a wicked man may
ſurceaſe, by hiding himſelfe
from his old occaſions: for in
this ſenſe, nothing but grace
and the ſpirit, and ſome power
of the Holy Ghoſt, can make a
man ſhake off his old occaſions
a man in his ſins will be ſo far
from refuſing occaſions when
they come in his way, that hee
will look and make after them,
and have them he will,<note place="margin">Pro. 23 35</note> if hee
may have them for love or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
An hungry man, will
thorow ſtone wals for meate;
ſo where the love and raigne of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19840:124"/>
ſin is, there a man will and muſt
breake thorow fire and water
to have his deſires finiſhed; the
occaſions of that ſin, hee muſt
and will follow, what ever
come of it: I ſay it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but grace, can make a
man abſtain from the occaſions
of ſinne when hee is tempted;
when not tempted, the matter
is not ſo much, and ſome men
without the ſtrength of grace
may forbeare, but when the
tentation is up, and the paſſion
is on fire, though a man dye, and
(without Gods mercy) damne
in the place, he cannot poſſibly
forbeare without the force of
the ſpirit: I dare affirme it, that
hee that can, and doth, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and manner I have ſet down
either put the occaſion from
him, or himſelfe from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of a ſin he hath been and
is tempted unto, that man hath
made an acceptable conqueſt of
that luſt: and wee doe wrong
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19840:125"/>
our ſelves I cannot ſay how
much, when we ſuffer Satan to
perſwade us the contrary. The
next thing wee are to looke to,
is, that we doe not coozen and
deceive our ſelves, ſo as to
thinke we have not overcome
the tentation: why? Becauſe
we are not rid of evill thoughts;
it is conqueſt enough, that evill
thoughts are borne as a burthen
and that luſt and Satan for their
hearts are not able to bring it
any further than thoughts. I
know God could if he would,
and would if hee ſaw it good
and fit, take away the ſwarme
of evill thoughts; but for
our good they are ſuffered to
flye up and down in our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
not onely to humble
us, for as the thoughts are, ſo
we ſhould be if we were let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
they ſhow our nature, and
when wee are come to ſome
practiſe and growth, wee are
then apt to heave up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19840:125"/>
of our ſelves above what
is written, to thinke that wee
are not as other men are, and
therefore to prevent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the malady, evill thoughts
are left in us, to remember us
what wee are of our ſelves; as
alſo that by feeling the thoughts
ſtirring within, and praying
againſt them, we may be kept
from acting the ſin in it ſelfe, in
the deed: This muſt be borne,
for wee muſt know that our
inward luſt, ever foameth out a
loathſome fume, (loathſome I
ſay, even to the naturall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a man) and would if it
were poſſible defile (as one
notes) the very regenerate part;<note place="margin">Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>
ſin is to be in us till we dye, and
therefore evill motions, ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
and deluſions of Satan
muſt be borne withall: the help
is, that wee doe delight in the
law of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22</note> as touching the
Inner man; and what if we ſee
them to bee more than they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19840:126"/>
were before, yet it, is becauſe
our light is more, our ſight is
cleerer, our ſpirituall ſenſe
quicker; ſo that if wee have by
prayer wonne then, delight and
conſent away from ſinne, the
more grace we have, the more
ſinnes wee have not; but the
more ſins wee ſee, for that if
God ſhould let us ſee the ſinnes
heretofore, when we had little
or no grace, wee ſee now, wee
then muſt needs have deſpaired
we could not have borne it, it
being a great worke and power
of grace, to be able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſight of our ſins: and
againe wee can diſcerne more
corruption now, than we could
then, becauſe our eyes are now
more open, wee muſt not goe
about, then to conclude againſt
the haire: that ſure the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is not got, becauſe wee ſee,
and feele (perhaps) more evill
thoughts, or our evill thoughts
to ſtir more than before; alas,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19840:126"/>
did we not feele them, and the
burthen of them, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
care to come to God, to
have them done away: and
therefore it is rather an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the conqueſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
made, and that the
Lord doth intend us a good
turne, even to helpe us away
with our luſt, more and more
every day, for that wee finde
that our luſts doe burthen us,
and appeare in their odious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
more and more every day:
make not that then an argument
againſt us, which is rather for
us: &amp; ſay that I find it, and feele
it more and worſe, I hate it
more, I delight in it leſſe, I
conſent not at all; this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for our comfort for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and that man who hath
gone thus far, may well be ſaid
to overcome the tentation.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond thing to bee
conſidered of, after the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, that in caſe we do catch a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19840:127"/>
fall, and the tempter without,
luſt within, doe blow and puſh
us downe, yet wee muſt not
make the matter worſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing,
for to deſpaire is a
greater fall, than the fall it ſelfe;
this were to leape into the fire,
to ſave our ſelves from the
blame: I know a godly man
can never utterly deſpaire, there
is ſtill a ſeed in him,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> and where
faith is, there is ſome hope,
where hope is, there is not a
totall deſpaire; but doubt wee
doe ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> yet not deſpaire,
and ſuch doubtings we have as
do make our life uncomfortable
and ſome degrees of deſpaire
we do admit, and for every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of deſpaire that wee doe
ſuck in, wee doe ſuffer the loſſe
of a degree of comfort: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt hold out againſt
thoughts &amp; propoſitions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to deſpaire, riſe with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
riſe with <hi>Peter,</hi> and grow
better after-than before the
maine puſh is given, becauſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19840:127"/>
we ſin after knowledge, ſo did
theſe two Worthies, and they
are in heaven and dyed for all
that in peace and honour. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
conſcience when hee came
to dye, was troubled about a
leſſer matter, I meane the caſes
of <hi>Shimei</hi> and <hi>Ioab:</hi> as for his
bloud and murther, not a word,
why? Becauſe hee had made a
thorow-peace with God: for
thoſe ſins in his life and health-time,
he had compounded with
his Iudge: let us doe ſo in any
hand, reſiſt, hold out, doe and
ſuffer any thing, rather than ſin:
but if Satan hath gone beyond
us, lye not in ſin, up againe; it
is not death to commit ſin, but
it is, to lye in ſinne; repentance
doth give the ſoule a vomit,<note place="margin">Sicut hi qui habent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſam, &amp;c. Orig. in Pſ. 31. &amp;. Hier. in Eccl. c. 10.</note> up
comes all againe; it ſhowes
great love in God, and great
faith in us, to riſe up againe out
of great fals; and when up once,
then fortifie our ſelves we muſt
againſt relapſes: there is a ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

depth of trouble in minde will
follow, if after our riſing we fall
againe into the ſame or the like
offence, this will coſt deare:
but yet by the way I affirme,
that this may befall the child of
God. In the ſtory of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the Church up and downe
did ſin the ſin of Idolatry; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,<note place="margin">Perk. Eſtate of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sect. 16. Pige at ſane peccare rurſus, &amp;c. Tertull. de poenit. c. 7.</note>
and yet fell, againe and
againe: and this were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
the Church of the
Iewes, to ſay, that Gods people
cannot doe that ſin after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which they did doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And who can thinke, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> did not repent of that
his ſin in the matter of <hi>Sarah?</hi>
yet the next occaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, he ſinned
the very ſinne againe: and was
not that a groſſe ſinne, to tell a
tale as hee did, to lay his
wife open to adultery to ſave
his life? which many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
would rather have loſt
their lives than have endured,
and what? to make a bargain,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19840:128"/>
that not for once or ſo, but
where ever we come,<note place="margin">Ge. 20. 30.</note> doe thou
ſay, thou art my ſiſter. If this
were not in ſubſtance, in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
a groſſe ſin, I know
not what is: they did as it were
conſent unto it: and that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
finding ſo ſtrange a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by God as he did, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not, were ſtraying; and yet
after, he fell into the very ſame
ſinne againe: and one dares ſay,
that <hi>David</hi> committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often, becauſe he took <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi>
and had ſix wives beſides,

murther,<note place="margin">Perk. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan with a ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> deny it who can, that

family, wherein was a
godly and right vertuous wife,
and ſome religious ſervants:
this was a groſſe ſin, and what
if hee did not act the deed?
No thankes to him; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
if ever man were: and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19840:129"/>
yet after hee fell into the foule
murther of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> the Church
in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezre</hi> fell the
ſecond time, after ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
into the groſſe fact of
having many wives: and for
the word, wee have nothing
againſt it, God will forgive us
ſeventy times, that is, infinite
times; a certaine number being
put for an uncertain: me thinks
it is a ſinfull limiting the holy
one of Iſrael in his free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercies; of Chriſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
in his merits, to ſay the
contrary as though GOD did
forgive us, becauſe wee have
done the groſſe ſin, but once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wee are in Chriſt; and for
reaſons I propoſe but theſe. 1.
What ever ſin wee may repent
of, that God may and will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
but the ſinne of falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
after repentance into the
ſelfeſame great offence, is a
fault that a man may repent of,
which I thus prove; becauſe it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19840:129"/>
is not the ſin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, or there is no ſinne, but
that ſinne which doth exclude
repentance: and that every
groſſe ſin done after true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
could not be the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt. I need
not prove, becauſe no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can or
wil affirme it. 2. Tis on al hauds
granted, that a man may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome other groſſe ſinne, but
not (ſay they) into the ſame:
But of this they neither can nor
doe give good reaſon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no place in the word, nor
no ground in the nature of faith
or of repentance; but that a man
may as well fall into the ſame
groſſe ſin as another; as great,
becauſe that another ſinne as
great, is as contrary to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of grace and act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as the ſame. 3. What
may ſtand with the grace of
God, that a godly man may do;
but to ſin the ſame groſſe ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
repentance, is not incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19840:130"/>
with the grace of God as
now it is in us; for what may
ſtand with Chriſt, may ſtand
with grace.<note place="margin">Prin. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. p. 3. 5.</note> It is written, that
one act of ſinne cannot deſtroy
the habit of grace, as though
many might: indeed one act of a
great and foule fault hath done
it; as we ſee, the Angels fell in
heaven; and the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> in
Paradiſe, in whom, one act did
caſt out grace; there grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not the grace of Chriſt, the
grace of juſtification:<note place="margin">Vitia Feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
hold it, in ſome fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vices: but now as the caſe
ſtands with us, to double that
act againe and often, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay how often, cannot of it
ſelfe thruſt a man out of Chriſt:
why? Becauſe wee are kept
in him, and his graces in us, by
the power of God and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt: now for a man to
ſay, to ſin ſuch a ſin wee treat of,
cannot ſtand with grace in us,
ſith that grace is kept in by the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19840:130"/>
power of God and of Chriſt,
is to me uncomfortable divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
4. That Doctrine cannot
hold, which leaves the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of man without a ſtay, and
ſo doth this: when a man ſhall
be ſet on the rack for ever, that
he is not in Chriſt, &amp; why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee doth ſinne the ſame
groſſe ſin after true repentance,
or at leaſt, that his repentance
was not true; and if I were
not a true Chriſtian, I know
not when I ſhall be; and if this
my repentance were not true, I
feare I ſhal never repent aright.
It muſt bee held againſt all true
repentance, or elſe there can be
no ſtate of the queſtion made:
for true repentance hath a
breadth with it, and doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of degrees: and if they ſay,
that when a man hath attained
to a great meaſure of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then it will carry it for
him, that he ſhall never ſin the
ſame groſſe ſin againe. Here the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19840:131"/>
heart of a man can finde no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
becauſe by this their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no man can poſſibly ſet
downe, when a man hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the point and degree of
true repentance, and therefore
they muſt affirme it of any true
repentance; that whoſoever
hath truly in the leaſt degree,
and meaſure repented for a
groſſe ſinne, ſhall never while
hee lives, commit the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
and if hee doe, then as
yet he is not, nor never yet was
in Chriſt: which is a tenet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncomfortable, and no way
agreeable with the ſweet prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the covenant of grace,
and the free and infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, propoſed to us in
the Goſpell. Laſtly, this cannot
ſtand, becauſe no man can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the conſcience of man,
when the ſin he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is, or is not a groſſe ſinne.
They ſay that a man may ſinne
ſmaller ſins of infirmity againe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19840:131"/>
and again after repentance, and
I ſay, that there can be no ſound
reaſon, why a man may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his repentance doe the ſame
groſſe ſin againe, as well as an
infirmity humbled for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of. But to paſſe that, the
thing I urge is, that it paſſeth
the skill I thinke of any man
living, to ſet me downe a limit,
that ſo farre I may goe, and my
ſin is but an infirmity, but if I
goe a point further, that then
it is a groſſe ſin; for if I may
ſtep one degree and point fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet my ſin be an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
ſtill, then I ſay, why not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
degree further? and ſo,
why not another? and ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and who can ſay, when and
where we muſt ſtay. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of a man in perplexity,
muſt have a rock to ſettle upon,
but when it is a groſſe ſin, and
when it is not, cannot be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
defined; circumſtances
after the caſe, and many ſins of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19840:132"/>
the firſt table, are groſſe and
great enough, which yet to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us, are accounted of, as no
ſuch ſins: many determine a
groſſe ſin from the matter,<note place="margin">Forma dat Nomen &amp; eſſe.</note> but
the forme is, it that chiefely
gives name and nature to a ſin,
and the manner is the forme of
a ſin, rather than the matter:
and hence ſomtimes when the
matter is not ſo great, yet the
manner may be ſuch, that it may
well goe for a groſſe ſin: the
only reaſon that ever I heard is,
for that after a man comes to
repent of a foule fault, a mans
ſorrow is ſo great, hee feeles
ſuch ſmart, that hee will never
come there againe, becauſe hee
will drinke of that bitter cup
no more. Tis true that ſuch a
man will goe his wayes, and
doe ſo, no more if hee can doe
withall; but I hope our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
tels us, that what ever our
ſorrowes hath been, how much
ſoever the griefe was; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19840:132"/>
God doe keepe us, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of former compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
cannot preſerve us,
when the winde and Sun, the
occaſion and tentation doe
meet. Now ſhow mee a place
that hath in it a promiſe, that
when our greefe hath beene ſo
great, that then God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
us from ever falling into
the ſame fault: I know GOD
doth ſo tender us, that he uſeth
not to let us come to that paſſe
againe, and he makes our fits of
former ſorrow, a meanes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
his bleſſing for to preſerve
us; but that a godly man ſhall
ever be ſo preſerved, is beſides
the Text <hi>I</hi> thinke. Againe, I
deſire proofe, that ſtill an end
a regenerate man doth, when
ever hee repents of a groſſe
crime, entertaine his heart with
a great deale of ſorrow; ſome I
know doe, and many, and if
you will the moſt; but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is ſo, that we never after
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19840:133"/>
converſion repent truly of a
groſſe ſinne, but our ſorrow is
much and great; I thinke there
is no ſuch thing in the word of
God: many have that initiall
repentance brought about by
the pricking of a pin, without
a Lance; by the ſweet muſicke
of the Goſpell, without any
great noiſe of the law, and ſo I
ſay, there after repentance too,
when they by occaſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
fall into ſome foule fact:
and then againe, how much
this ſorrow muſt bee that
will keepe one from relapſing
and ever doing ſo againe, is paſt
my wit to conceive the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of it; and the conſcience
muſt be able to ſpell it out, and
to ſay, thus much I muſt grieve,
elſe my repentance is not right,
for ſuch a ſin, and I may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>Now where this full point
lyes, that a man may be able to
ſpeake it; thus much I muſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19840:133"/>
and have grieved, and am now
come to the height of ſorrow
that is required; and now I
know I ſhall never fall the
ſame fall againe. Theſe bee
ſtrange riddles, the heart of
man I know muſt come down,
it muſt melt and breake, but yet
a little ſorrow doth it in one,
when a great deale doth but do
it in another: ſome mens hearts
after ſin are like hard wax, great
heate is required to melt it; but
others like ſoft wax, a little
will ſupple it, as we finde that
at mans firſt converſion, ſome
men turne to it without much
adoe, with legall ſorrowes, and
the ſinne before regeneration, I
hope, hardens the heart, more
than the ſinne after, for before,
there is nothing but a ſtone, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſin and fleſh; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
be the ſin committed never
ſo great, yet there is ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ſome grace abiding, and ſo
ſome ſoftneſſe with all. We
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19840:134"/>
Divines doe uſe to teach, that it
is the love of God; and not the
ſorrow for ſinne,<note place="margin">Vid. Can. Relict part. 1.</note> which is the
cauſe to keepe us from relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and that too much ſorrow
doth hurt and drive us from
Chriſt. We all agree, that a man
may goe too far, when there is
ſo much as doth bring us to
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Durand. l. 4. D. 17. q. 4. n. 7.</note> it is ſufficient; and that
ſometimes, a leſſer degree of
humbling and mourning will
doe that: GOD doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to ſee us in our aſhes, no
further than he may heare of us,
and tis not terror of the law, but
the peace of God which doth
garrizon and keepe our hearts,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
and mind, and therfore this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is of no force, it hangs the
conſcience on uncertainty, and
no man can determine, when
his ſorrow is come, to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and ſerve the turne in
this Divinity: beſides who
ſees not that wicked men doe
grieve over and above out of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19840:134"/>
feare or ſhame or both for
ſome ſins and more than godly
men doe, for the ſame or the
like ſinnes, and yet who dares
ſay, that by reaſon of this their
griefe, they could never offend
in the ſame againe. <hi>Iudas</hi> did
grieve and ſob extraordinary,
for killing Chriſt: yet I do not
thinke, but had the caſe come
in his way, hee would have
murthered him againe: no tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
him, who preſently after
killed himſelfe: and we finde
ſome, who for murther fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe flats of ſorrow, that
they doe run upon their owne
deaths, and cauſe themſelves
for very remorſe of conſcience
to dye a dogs death.<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 5</note> Let us then
ſay, that it is a da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous caſe, for
a godly man to ſinne the ſame
great ſin after repentance, what
if it doe not put him out of
Chriſt? what if it do not hang
him? Yet it burnes him in the
hand, whips him up and down
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19840:135"/>
the towne, my meaning is, that
it doth caſt him into a bed of
miſerable ſorrow; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
we muſt ſay, that it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be, that after true &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
repentance for ſuch a fault, a
child of God may chance to fal
into the ſame ſin againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
how often I cannot tel, but
this I can tell, that how often
ſoever hee ſinneth, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and returne, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is ready: They wrong
GOD in his mercy, and men
in their comfort who doe ſay
the contrary.</p>
                  <p>3. The third duty that wee
are to looke to after the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, that in caſe we do not
finiſh the ſin, not act the fault,
but doe drive away this fury:
that then wee bee very thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God, tis his doing only,
tis his grace that moved him to
ſtand for us, when we were in
danger to caſt away our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
it is a great mercy to riſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19840:135"/>
againe, but a greater too, when
God comes and ſtands betwixt
us and the fall. Of the two, it
is better not to ſin the ſin,<note place="margin">Scot. 3. Sent D. 3. q. r.</note> than
to bee recovered after wee are
down,<note place="margin">Sect. Dicitur communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> as it is in it ſelf for a man
to bee preſerved from a diſeaſe,
than to be cured of the diſeaſe.
I confeſſe that wee have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
experimentall taſte, both of
the love and power of GOD,
when wee are recovered, but
yet as touching our peace and
comfort: I hope wee all ſee, it
is better not to ſin the ſin, than
having ſinned to be healed, we
ſave a great deale of inward
paine and bitter ſorrow by the
bargaine, Chriſt I know tels us
moſt Divinely and ſweetly;
that to whom much is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 47.</note>
ſuch doe love much, but
yet we muſt not ſin many ſins,
that ſo much may bee forgiven
us, and wee love much, this
were to turne the grace of God
into wantonneſſe;<note place="margin">Iude v. 4.</note> and that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19840:136"/>
which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath up and
downe in his <hi>Tomes</hi> anſwers
all, that thoſe alſo are to love
much, who have beene preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the providence and
power of God, from doing
ſuch and ſo many tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as ſome others have: for
why, ſaith hee, have we not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe ſins? was the cauſe
in our nature? Is the reaſon in
our will? No, but only in the
goodneſſe of God; wee are
then to thanke him, and love
him for the ſins we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and have had our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for them, and for thoſe
many more which wee ſhould
have done, had not the Lord
beene, all one, as though wee
had done them, and had found
a pardon of them; and one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
more, and that is, that by
reaſon of his meere mercy, we
have beene ſtrongly preſerved
from ſo ſinning againſt our <hi>God,</hi>
from ſo troubling the quiet of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19840:136"/>
our owne hearts and in ſome
particulars, from ſo ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
the Church and people of
GOD.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth duty after the
tentation, is, to make a good
uſe of it, to get ſome good out
of it, wee muſt come to ſome
fruit after wee have beene ſo
handled with ſuch bitter plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The Earth after Winter
becomes fruitfull, ſo muſt wee
be; now the good that comes
by tentation is manifold. 1. A
ſight of ſome corruption wee
ſaw not before; the beginning
of all our comfort ariſeth from
an humble ſight of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and tis fit, that when we
will not ſee them, and abhor
them by what we finde in the
word, we ſhould have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of them in our ſelves;
then we ſay, till now, little did
I thinke, I had beene thus and
thus given to ſuch rebellions,
then wee cry, <hi>ah wretched man
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19840:137"/>
that I am,</hi> what a Beaſt, what a
divell am I? This doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
empty us of our ſelves, and
then we quickly fill with God,
with Chriſt: this is amends
enough for all our toile, that
wee are made to ſee ſomewhat
in our ſelves, which wee never
thought to bee in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond is to ſee that
ther is ſome ſin, not ſufficiently
and thorowly mortified, that as
yet wee have not gone to the
quick of it, and what that ſin
is, and now to take it in hand
againe, and never give over till
wee breake the heart of it, leſt
it lye in the winde and doe us
ſome ſpight againſt another
time. 3. A third is to grow
acquainted with the wiles and
depths of Satan: A godly man
ſhould bee well acquainted
with the divell, ſo as to know
and to finde him out in his ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
and this is done more
by tentation, than by all the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19840:137"/>
reading in the world. 4. To be
acquainted with the goodneſſe
and mercy of God, to bee able
to finde out ſomewhat to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
in the myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
how God doth make ſin
to cure ſin, one theefe, one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
to cut the throat of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
one corruption to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a worſer, fetch heaven out
of hell, to learne to ſpeake it by
experience, and to ſay, I had
ſinned, except I had ſinned, I
had gone to hell, except I had
gone to hell; that the worſt
pride comes out of our graces,
that our beſt grace, the grace of
humility (which makes roome
and way for all the reſt) comes
out of our ſins:<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 6.</note> Now then we
ſhould not finde our ſelves, or
Satan, or the Lord out, were we
not taught it by our tentations.
This made <hi>Fox</hi> to ſay, that his
graces did him moſt hurt, and
his ſins moſt good, a Paradox:
but by our owne tentations we
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19840:138"/>
know his meaning: this made
<hi>Luther</hi> to ſay,<note place="margin">Praefat.</note> that theſe three
things make a good Divine.<note place="margin">Tom. 1.</note> 1,
Prayer.<note place="margin">German.</note> 2. Meditation. 3. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
this good we have by
our tentations, that wee come
to know our ſelves, to know
Satan, and to know GOD; ſuch
is our eſtate, that the furtheſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
is the neereſt way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
we cannot goe to heaven
by Geomitry: we muſt fetch a
compaſſe by the gates of hell,
and ſee what newes with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
ere we can reliſh the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and goodneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
we cannot elſe take God
for Gods ſake, and have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on Gods tearmes; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to God but we muſt
follow Chriſt, and follow
Chriſt we cannot except we
deny our ſelves,<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 34.</note> and deny our
ſelves we will not, were it not,
for the croſſe, and man would
do any thing, rather than take up
his croſſe; were he not buffeted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19840:138"/>
and beaten to it by ſome tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or other,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> and therefore
thanke yee tentation, that ever
we come to heaven: what ever
it is to beare a croſſe, when <hi>God</hi>
doth lay it on, I am ſure it is an
hard and an hard thing, for a
man to take up his Croſſe; and
yet by tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we are brought
to this:<note place="margin">He. 11. 35</note> wherefore wee muſt
do our ſelves this good by our
tentations,<note place="margin">Tortured, not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> when they are gone
and over; that now againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time, we know the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to doe with Satan, that
he ſhall not put ſuch tricks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and coozen us out of our
comfort, and that cheefeſt of
all, by his art and skill. 5. We
muſt learne for ever after to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
others; and out of pitty and
mercy, to do them in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſorrowes, all the helpe
that poſſibly wee can; let us
mourne with them, and have a
feeling of their caſe, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe once or often it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19840:139"/>
hath beene our caſe. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
not ſay to the inceſtuous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
thou art puffed up,
but turnes himſelfe to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15.</note> and ſaith not (hee is)
but (ye) are puffed up, and have
not rather mourned:<note place="margin">Chryſ. de poenit. hom. 10.</note> now the
ſenſe &amp; the freſh remembrance
of this, that but the other day
wee our ſelves were as ſick as
they, and by the meere mercy
of God we got our ſelves out,
ſhould and it will bring us to
ſhew all mercy to them, to
mourne over them, and not to
pride it over them, as though
wee were free from ever ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the like luſt; whereas, by
our owne experience wee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learn to walke humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and man; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
what hath bin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what may be, if wee
our ſelves ſhould bee tempted.
This then is a golden leſſon
which our owne tentations
ought to teach us without
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19840:139"/>
booke, to reſtore ſuch an one

were in the ſame or the like

ſuch will or skill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19840:140"/>
men out of their ſins, men are
ſubject to fret and ſnarle, it is
like wakening one out of ſleep,<note place="margin">Multi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines cum a ſomno, &amp;c. Aug. in Gal. 6.</note>
and then wee ſee how out of
quiet they be, ready to braule at
their beſt friends; ſo here, and
therfore we have need of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and patience which our
owne experience in our owne
aſſaults and tentations will
learne us ſooner than all the
teaching in the world. 6. And
laſtly, by the bitter taſte of our
tentative corruptions, we muſt
now out of our owne ſenſe,
learne to loathe and to abhorre
them, that our corrupt nature
may bee an ugly ſight in our
owne eyes: we ſee in the word,
that grave Chriſtians have bin
the men who have come to
loathe themſelves in duſt and
aſhes; ſo <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo <hi>Iob,</hi>
when old, they did by reaſon
of their ſin abhorre themſelves,
in duſt, and in that which is
worſe than durt, in aſhes, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19840:140"/>
this wee ſhall never come ſo
thorowly to doe, till we come
by reaſon of tentation, to be as
<hi>Paul</hi> was,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> a very crucifix of
mortification. Ah this ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
how it makes us carry a
moneths minde to our luſts, we
have a doting humour after our
corrupt luſts ſtill, and therefore
al is little enough to bring them
out of requeſt with us; they
had need ſting us, and that
home too: ſay we have a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſore in our bodies, which
none elſe can well abide to
come neere; yet ſuch is our
<hi>Philovety</hi> and ſelfelove, that
wee can abide the ſight and
ſmell of it well enough; right
ſo, wee are ſo inward with our
owne ſelfe-affection, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
our luſts are a corrupt matter
and doe ſtinke like any carrion,
and would make one ſick to
ſee them, yet wee can abide
them well enough; our nature
is altogether by <hi>Adams</hi> fall and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19840:141"/>
our fals become filthy (the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
is ſtinking) wee ſtinke
horribly, and yet, becauſe we
have an ill and a ſtinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrill
of our owne,<note place="margin">Habeat ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſanum olfactum animae ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit quomodo puteant pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata. Aug. in Pſa. 38. 5.</note> we can away
with the ſmell well enough.
Now comes a tentation, ſtirres
the wound, makes it ſtinke and
ſmell; wee are ſo peppered
with the ſorrow &amp; woful fruit,
of it that we come to take our
ſins as they are in their kinde,
and at laſt wee are ſo changed
and altered, that what we l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ved
rather than our life, that wee
come to hate as any death: this
uſe we may and muſt make, by
looking both on our ſore and
heavy tentation (which wee
may thanke our luſts for) when
once they are paſt and over.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt duty after
our tentations are ſhut up, is to
prepare for a further battell, for
an other encounter:<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 13.</note> hee went
away from Chriſt but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
therefore ere long hee will
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19840:141"/>
come againe; how long it will
be firſt I cannot ſay, but ere long
it will be, he will ſtay away no
longer than needs muſt, as ſoon
as ever he can get leave he will
come without ſending for:
though I name Sathan, yet I
meane ſuch mixt tentations
wherein luſt and Satan doe tye
together; but becauſe Satan u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to fire the matter, and to
ſet the wheeles going, therfore
it is that wee doe uſe to name
him, as though all were his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The thing I firſt propoſe is,
that we waite in daily expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have ſome other fits, for
wee are too too apt to dreame
of, I know not what, peace and
freedome after tentation is
done away, and then we are in
danger to grow ſecure, which
when our enemy once percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
hee will then come and
make uſe of his advantage. A
boy in the ſchoole, after a ſound
beating is paſt, fals to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19840:142"/>
promiſing to himſelfe that
he ſhall not be had to horſe yet
a while, &amp; is of from his book,
till his maſter comes again and
hath him by the skin: ſo when
we have had a ſcourging with
the ſmart of ſome ſowre tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we thinke now the worſt
is paſt, and that wee ſhall have
no more ſuch reckonings: then
comes the tempter, cals up our
luſts, and finding us ſecure, doth
us a ſhrewd turne; ſo we finde
in the Saints that after a ſtorme
once blowne over, they uſe to
catch their fals; when we have
ſtood free from our uſuall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
a yeere or ſo, wee uſe to
give our ſelves to diſorder in
dyet, as thinking that no ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
can now take hold of us,
and then wee are over head
&amp; eares in ſome diſeaſe ere we
are aware; ſo tis in the ſoule,
we muſt then when we are on
the other ſide of ſome heavy
tentation, doe as Marriners doe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19840:142"/>
in a calme, mend our tacklings,
get our things about us; as not
knowing how ſoone, how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
another, a worſer ſtorme
may fall: take heed then after
wee have put off our fits, of a
ſecret floth; watch ſtill, lye in
our armour, for as ſure as wee
live, if wee live any time, wee
ſhall meet with another bout
ere long: for when wee grow
up in grace and come to ſome
perfection, wee ſhall heare of
more ſorrowes. God hath ever
been upon his Saints with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
tryals, when they come to
ſome age and ſtrength. He will
then build with us when wee
are ſeaſoned, as farre as our
ſtrength will goe we ſhall have
it. And therefore when old,
when <hi>Paul</hi> aged, doe not ſay I
have done;<note place="margin">Philem. 9</note> now our faith is
moſt, our wiſdome moſt, our
graces ſtrongeſt, and therefore
repent and ſay, there is worſe
behind ſtill, we muſt have ſome
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19840:143"/>
intervalle, ſometime betwixt
our fits, ſome good dayes to
breath in,<note place="margin">Ferus. in Iob. 3. Serm 18.</note> elſe we ſhould not be
willing to live, elſe we ſhould
not have ſtrength to hold out
the next fit; and more fits in
their times we muſt have, elſe
wee ſhould not bee willing to
dye. Say then I looke every
day for a fit, and therfore I will
not bee without my medicines
in a readineſſe; and in all our
phyſick be ſure to put the bloud
of Chriſt: Satan is not ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
nor ſuch a coward neither,
but hee dares come againe, hee
will put it to the adventure, he
had little hope to do any thing
againſt Chriſt, never was hee
beaten as he was by him, yet
he came againe, and againe, and
ſo hee will to us: the thing I
commend then to all our care,
is, to ſtand upon our watch and
ſure guard. A queſtion is made
by ſome, whether Satan may
come to the ſame man, with
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19840:143"/>
the ſame tentation after hee is
well beaten and conquered:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. D. 6. q. 4.</note>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> ſaith, he may to others
with the ſame, hee may to the
ſame man w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſome other ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but to come to the ſame
man, with the ſame tentation,
to ſhoot the ſame bitter arrow
at the ſame man who did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
him, he thinks Satan will
not,; his reaſon is, becauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
will not come where hee
hath no hope to be the victor:
but ſaith he, hee hath no hope
of having the victory in the
ſame, and over the ſame man.
As a man who is once beaten in
the field, you cannot get him
into the field, with the ſame
man at the ſame weapons; and
a Cock once made to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
will fight no more. The
anſwer is, that man is uſually
beaten in the field for want of
courage, or ſtrength, or skill;
but Sathan is beaten onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee will not give aſſent
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19840:144"/>
and way unto him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what if we repell Satan, by
reſiſting him in his tentation:
now it may be at another time
wee ſhall not bee found in ſo
good a minde, nor in ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a diſpoſition, to reſiſt and
deny him in his ſuite: what
knowes hee whether we have
loſt of our former ſtrength, or
wit, or will, or grace, or care,
and vigilancy? But above all
Satan wil try, whether that <hi>God,</hi>
who now doth not, at another
time for ſome cauſes, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
us to be led into the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is not our ſtrength, but
Gods that doth it; it lies not
ſimply in our will, but in the
will of God. <hi>Aquinas</hi> I thinke
is in the right; Sathan would
come oftner than hee doth,<note place="margin">Paat. 1. q. 114. art. 5.</note> but
that GOD who knowes our
ſtrength, or rather our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
will not ſuffer him: and
though he loves not to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and deſires not to come
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19840:144"/>
where there is no hope, yet it
muſt bee as God will, and not
as wee and the divels pleaſure
is: if we need it, we ſhall have
another triall; it is the divels
nature, he is a tempter, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
is his formall being, and he
cannot chuſe but come againſt
us, as farre as the Lord ſhall
pleaſe to let out his chaine:
what if he hath no hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
us, yet he knowes he ſhall
moleſt us; Hee is at no quiet
himſelfe, and he would not that
we ſhold have any reſt neither,
as far as he can doe withall: it
doth as it were doe him good,
to goe about to doe us hurt: he
will, becauſe he muſt goe away
for a ſeaſon, and after a ſeaſon,
he both will and muſt come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
and if we grow negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
lye open and naked, as
not once thinking to heare of
him at all, or at leaſt not as yet;
then he is for us, and hath his
blow, his full blow at us: from
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19840:145"/>
hence it is, that often in the
ſame luſt wee beate him now,
becauſe wee are prepared; hee
comes and beates us another
time, becauſe he takes us unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
Againe, Satan is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that when we have had
as much as ever we can doe to
get him off at firſt, we ſhall be
loth to be troubled there again
and that it is a weary hand to
be tired with the ſame anguiſh,
and this moves him to try the
ſecond, the third time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and
ſometimes oftner the ſame
way, to prove what he can doe;
for he is not to learne, that it is
more for want of heart than
ſtrength that wee uſe to yeeld:
theſe may bee the reaſons, why
Satan comes againe many times
with the ſame aſſault; but if we
looke to God, he doth order it,
that we ſhall be tempted in the
ſame veine, becauſe he ſees that
we by uſe and experience have
got more skill there than any
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19840:145"/>
where elſe, and that wee have
our weapons ready to breake
the blowes which come that
way; and thus becauſe our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
father knowes, that now
wee can tell how better to
fight at that weapon and war,
than any other; hee out of his
goodneſſe, will have Sathan
come that way, or not at all.
He intends us the victory, and
now ſith our conqueſt is in the
ſame tentation, in which wee
are tried and skilled, both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and eaſie over it is in any
other, Satan muſt come upon
us with the very ſame trickes
and tentations; thus we ſee that
the ſame tentation doth befall
us more than once or twice.</p>
                  <p>2 Sometimes Satan chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his weapon, and tries us
the cleane contrary way, with
ſuch aſſaults as wee yet never
felt in all our dayes before: he
hopes that there wee have no
defence, that wee doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19840:146"/>
him at that doore, and thus
he thinkes, comming in with
his blaſt at a contrary point, to
blow us downe; and here we
muſt doe as the Pilot doth, have
our compaſſe ready, and ſtand
ready to turne our needle to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
point, knowing, that our
luſt within is for any ſinne, and
Sathan hath skill at any tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
all is in a manner one to
him, hee can tempt us to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
with as much eaſe and
art, as to prodigality; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what ever our tentation
hath bin, and what ever our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
hath done, Sathan can
change hands and ſo muſt wee
expect to finde. The Word
will furniſh us againſt him,
come when hee will, or which
way he will, be it the ſame or
ſome other way; here we muſt
take councell, that ſay he come
with ſome other weapon, it
ought to be to us an argument,
that ſure now he begins to bee
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19840:146"/>
out of hope, ſith he doth ſhift
his weapons thus. 2. That <hi>God</hi>
will have him turn ſome other
way, to purge ſome other
ſtreame; another luſt, muſt
have another purgation. 3.
Change of phyſick is good, for
that the ſame potion alwayes
uſed will not worke ſo well,
the longer wee are uſed to the
ſame tentation, the leſſe it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with us. 4. <hi>God</hi> will have
us learne skill, by experience at
all ſorts of ſpirituall combates,
trials, weapons. The ſumme is,
that ſith when we have gotten
the better of ſome great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
wee are ſubject to bee
drawne into ſpirituall pride or
ſecurity and ſo to caſt away our
armour: we muſt learne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to heare of another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
to weare our armour
about us, to ſtand ready againſt
all aſſaies; <hi>Hezekiah, Aſa, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſophat,</hi>

now for a time or for

done, was by their own ſtrength

their miſtakes and fals, we
muſt learne to ſtand ſtill in a
continuall expectation &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
when one tentation is

come, and that ere we be many

1. We muſt not make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worſe than it is, which in
thoſe tentations, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
commonly with
moſt horror, is dangerous; for
as we are not to leſſen the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo it is neither lawfull nor
ſafe to make the things worſe
than they be; to pore into the
ſore, to breake it up into too
many peeces, in this caſe is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous:
indeed when wee are
apt to grow ſecure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
we are adviſed to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
matters to the moſt; but
when we are downe the wind,
and ſubject to deſpaires and
feares, this is not approved to
be either lawfull or ſafe. 1. It is
not lawfull to make that a ſin
which perhaps is not; or that
which is a ſin, to appeare to us
greater than it is: things muſt
be repreſented unto us in their
true colours; and as wee muſt
not ſet the ſin higher than it is,
ſo not the guilt of it neither,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19840:149"/>
this were to ſing the ſong of
<hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>My ſin is greater than I
can beare:</hi> He did not ſay ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was ſo; but it was ſo,
becauſe he ſaid ſo: we muſt ſee
that wee doe not make ſinnes
where God makes none; leſt
wee come to make that not to
be a ſin which is a ſin; and ſome
men are miſerably tormented,
for things which are onely ſins
in their conceit, and not in
truth. 2. It is unſafe in all, but
moſt of all in theſe kind of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
becauſe man is a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
creature, and when in this
veine, he is apt to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
feare of diſcouragement
makes a man fall, weakens,
a mans purpoſe and reſolution
of reſiſting; as a boy is many
times out in ſaying his leſſon,
onely for feare leſt hee be out,
who could ſay perfect till hee
came to ſay: and a girle being
threatned and terrified, breaks
the glaſſe only for feare of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19840:149"/>

joyned with diſcouragement
Satan hath a great advantage;<note place="margin">Frangere dum met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and thoſe ſinnes amplified and
ſet up, doe mightily faint, and
diſcourage the heart and ſpirits
of men and who can fight with
any heart againſt an enemy, that
hee hath little or no hope to
conquer. Now when we doe
make our ſins worſer than they
are, then it doth ſecretly ſteale
away our hope; and ſo we make
no great haſt to reſiſt, nor have
no great heart to fight: we then
muſt learne, not to make it leſſe,
leſt we be too ſlothful, nor more
leſt we be too fearefull; but juſt
as the matter is, as neere as we
can, that ſo wee may bee fitted
and prepared, to fight the good
fight of faith, with diligence
and watchfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>2. Wee muſt not ſuffer the
thoughts of theſe horrible ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to tarry in our mindes;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 6. 12.</note>
they are Gods and our greateſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19840:150"/>
enemies, and we muſt ſhut the
doore againſt them; what if
we diſlike and diſtaſte them?<note place="margin">Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>
yet as one notes, this rowling
of them up and downe in our
heads, doth ſhow that there is
an inſenſible likening of them
in our hearts; we muſt ſet our
hatred againſt them, and thruſt
them away preſently, and hold
it a dangerous thing to thinke
of them. God cannot take it
well, if wee miſlike a thing in
judgement, and doe not ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, with the meanes God
hath appointed and ſanctified
to that uſe, Satan will coozen
us, as though that our very
miſliking of them were enough
in things foule, and that there
were no feare of danger; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
nature it ſelfe, doth looke
ſadly at theſe tentations, and
the miſlike we feele, may well
come from the influence of the
law and light of nature. I have
learned that we are never the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19840:150"/>
further off from a tentation, for
our miſliking it onely, but the
nearer, except withall in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
we humble for it; as well
as diſtaſte it in our judgments:
what if the diſlike be not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a ſin, but becauſe there
is ſome feare or ſhame? This is
ſelfe-love and pride, and this
will worke in the ſin, if we goe
no further, and that by Gods
juſt judgement: our duty then,
is not to ſuffer the thoughts of
ſuch wounding and terrifying
tentations, to tumble up and
downe in our mindes, though
we have no minde to them; for
either by diſcouraging us or
enticing us, they will get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hold: but wee muſt caſt
them off, ſet the word againſt

to prevent us, or preſerve

in any) but of all in theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
tentations, goes by his
owne wit, or reaſon, or worth,
or ſtrength: Hee is in ſafe
caſe, who can ſay, I deſerve
nothing, I can doe nothing
but hurt my ſelfe, and make

grace of God which is with

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19840:152"/>
ſeverall for every particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
might be many; ſome we
will propoſe, and firſt for thoſe
tentations which are in things
of God, then in things of man;
for God, we are much aſſaulted
to Atheiſme, and Blaſphemy;
to Atheiſme, as the greateſt ſin
that is, in that it ſmites at the
roote of all, for to ſay the truth,
all ſin is from Atheiſme: for
who would ſin, did he then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thinke, that there were a
God that ſaw all, and would
puniſh all; and ſuch a God, God
muſt be, or no God: and to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,
for when we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſinne doth draw towards
Atheiſme, exceedingly wipes
out all notions of a Deity as
much as it can; and when wee
are in ſin, wee muſt bee either
willing to get out of it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or elſe wee ſhall bee
willing to turne Atheiſts; the
beſt of our play then, being to
feed our ſelves with a conceit,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19840:152"/>
that all is but talke to hold men
in awe, and that there is indeed
neither heaven nor hell, no
place of torment; that when
wee dye all is gone, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than with a Beaſt: when
the conſcience will not get qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
by turning to God by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Animus qui multorum ſcelerum ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi conſcius eſt, &amp;c.</note>
then it will ſeeke to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
it ſelfe by unbeliefe, bearing
it ſelfe in hand,<note place="margin">Chryſ. in 1 Cor. 6. Hom 17.</note> that there is no
ſuch thing as hell to torment
men in: conſider withall, that
Sathan doth all he can to make
men Atheiſts, becauſe, when
there is no feare of God before
mens eyes, they will ſinne all
manner of ſinnes that the divell
would have them ſin. So <hi>Pſal.
14. The fooliſh hath ſaid in his
heart there is no God,</hi> what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes?
They are corrupt, they
have done abominable works;
thus then, when once men take
to Atheiſme, they grow moſt
corrupt and doe abominable
workes; there is no hoe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19840:153"/>
then, for what ſhold or can
keep the wit and wil of man in,
when once wee conceit, that
there is no ſuch thing as God:
the divell cannot bee a flat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,
for he beleeves &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
and were it nothing but
the ſence he hath of the wrath
of God, tormenting: why?
That is enough to prove, that
Satan doth fully &amp; undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledge a Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
He is not an Atheiſt, becauſe
he cannot, becauſe he ſhall not,
but yet he beares good will to
Atheiſme, becauſe that ſin doth
much advantage his kingdome
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth prove,<note place="margin">C. 1. v. 13.</note> that
God tempts no man, becauſe
himſelfe cannot bee tempted
with evill: by nature he doth
hate ſin, and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tempt to ſinne: and Satan
could not tempt <hi>Eve</hi> till he had
ſin; nor <hi>Eve Adam,</hi> till ſhee
had ſin her ſelfe: all this proves
not, but that Sathan may and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19840:153"/>
doth tempt us to Atheiſme, a
ſinne which he himſelfe hates
not: for though he cannot ſin
the ſin himſelfe, (as the divell
cannot do the act of many ſins,
as Adultery) yet hee loves the
ſinne; it is not for want of will
that he is not an Atheiſt; for he
would give any thing, he could
turne Atheiſt, and finde ſome
kind of eaſe, by thinking there
were no God at all: and it is a
ſin which is incompatible with
the eſtate of a damned Angell;
but now his deſire being to
damne ſoules, and this being
the moſt damning ſinne that is:
he doth uſe all meanes, to wipe
out of the heart of man, all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the God-head, and
the beſt men that be, have too
many thoughts this way; and
(as I ſhewed) it is the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veine
in our Originall luſt; and
were it not for the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our ſinne and Satan would
make monſtrous flat Atheiſts

would wiſh al Chriſtians to do
theſe things; the firſt is not
to enter into diſpute with his
owne reaſon, for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of man, is too weak, &amp; too
ſhort, to reach the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of a Deity: hee that ſhall
take in his owne thoughts, and
muſe about the nature and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Being of God, ſhall but let
in Satan the more: the counſell
then I am bold to give to the
poore Chriſtian, is, in any hand
not to ſtudy this point, but to
take his minde off, from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19840:155"/>
&amp; diſputing this argument,
leſt he come to ſay in his heart,
I cannot conceive what <hi>God</hi> is,
and therefore I doubt me there
is no ſuch being. Away then
with all reaſoning and ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes
about that ſubject. 2.
Then cleave to the Word &amp; ſay
though my reaſon cannot tell
what to make of it, tho luſt in
me, ſay there is no <hi>God</hi> at al, tho
Satan ſay it that there is no <hi>God,</hi>
and moſt doe live as though
there were no God; yet becauſe
it is in the Word, the Scripture
ſaith it, and I muſt and will and
doe beleeve it; wee muſt ſee
both God and Heaven and all
in the Word.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> Doubts I know,
that have any ground,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1.</note> ought to
bee ſcanned,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5</note> diſputed, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
but Atheiſme is a deniall
of the firſt principle of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;<note place="margin">Mala &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia corſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo, &amp;c.</note>
and therefore the beſt
way is to begin and end with
the Word,<note place="margin">Cie. de Nat. Deor. l. 1.</note> and to know that
ſuch a principall, as is the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and exiſtence of a GOD
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19840:155"/>
ought not to bee ſo much as
queſtioned. It is a meere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the ſafeſt way is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it as ſoone and as often as
it doth come; put it off, as a
thing neither worth nor fit for
conſideration; wee ſhall finde
that by often rejecting ſuch
ſcruples, the conſcience will
be better confirmed and ſetled,
than by going about by reaſon
and arguments to anſwer them.
Hee that ſhall goe about by the
force of his owne wit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his Atheiſme, is in great
danger to fall into ſome degrees
of it; for when he ſees that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot doe it, and find out,
what this God is, he wil come
to queſtion all, and to thinke
that there is no ſuch being. He
then doth beſt, who doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
leaſt, and in the heate of
the tentation, reſts himſelfe
wholy on the Word.</p>
            <p>2. For tentations of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">Iob. 2. 9.</note>
as <hi>Curſe God and dye:</hi> the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19840:156"/>
ſervants of <hi>God</hi> are more afraid
of them than hurt; they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bugbeares than ſuch as uſe
to produce in them any reall
effects: they carry with them
ſuch a deale of horror that they
ſeldome take; for when once
wee confeſſe a true GOD, it
will make our haire ſtare to
thinke of blaſpheming him, and
ſo we fall into pitious moodes
of terrour and horror, which
keepes us from the ſin it ſelfe:
but wee muſt ſet downe what
we conceive may doe us helpe
this way.</p>
            <p>1. We muſt get an aſſurance
that God doth love us, and then
we ſhall love him, and love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
thinks and ſpeakes well;
but if wee once take a thought
and it grow firme in us, that
God doth hate us and wil curſe
us, we will hate him againe and
be ready to curſe him: and this
is incident to us in times of
ſome great afflictions; as in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19840:156"/>
               <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, when God doth han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
us ſore, and worſe than hee
commonly doth others: and
wee finde ſome circumſtances,
that we cannot fetch a preſident
for in the world; never was the
like before, then wee begin to
apprehend ſome hard dealing
in it, and we grow to conclude,
that ſure God doth hate us, and
then we will be even with him
and hate him again. It is natural
and uſuall for hatred to breed
hatred; and when wee abhorre
and hate God, we begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into ſome termes of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy:
we all hate God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but yet there is a further
meaſure of hatred wrought in
us to God, when we conceive,
that out of very malice and
ſpleene towards us, he doth uſe
us as he never did nor doth uſe
any other; and in this caſe our
very ſtomacks will riſe, and our
bloud will ſwell againſt the
LORD GOD Almighty. To
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19840:157"/>
prevent and cure this, wee are
to know, that no afflictions bee
they ever ſo great, uſuall, and
unheard of, are any certaine
ſignes at all of <hi>Gods</hi> anger, much
leſſe of his hatred: <hi>Iob</hi> was the
firſt, who was ever uſed as hee
was, and his wife ſhewed her
ſelfe a weake and a fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
thence to gather the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of God to her and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<hi>Ionas</hi> had a croſſe that
the world never ſaw the like
before, yet it was no fruit of
Gods hatred. <hi>Iacob</hi> had ſore
and heavy afflictions, yet it
went ever for truth,<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>(Iacob have
I loved)</hi> hee loved him, when?
When hee afflicted him. <hi>Eſau</hi>
had more outward matters to
his minde than ever <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw:
and many great Lords were of
his family, and yet, <hi>Eſau have I
hated;)</hi> hold it then, that God
doth love us, and when wee
have this perſwaſion in us; all
the divels in hell, and all the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19840:157"/>
luſts in Originall ſin can never
make us blaſpheme our GOD,
whom we love, and of whom
wee have this minde, that hee
doth love us: ſay then, he loves
me, and I love him, &amp; then, one
cannot be brought to ſin the ſin
of Blaſphemy. 2. We muſt get
the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſins, repent we
of all our iniquities, and then
the Croſſe can never wring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
us words of blaſphemy: when
we are in great ſorrowes Satan
will tempt very ſtrongly that
way, and we feare what we ſhal
doe in times and caſes of great
extremity: I feare me, ſaith the
poore Chriſtian, what I ſhall do
in great afflictions; repent wee
of our ſins and feare nothing:
it is not the greatneſſe of the
Croſſe, but it is the guilt of ſin
working with the ſting of the
Croſſe, which makes men in
their tribulation to blaſpheme.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 11. we read, that the
fifth Angell powred down his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19840:158"/>
viol on the ſeat of the Beaſt; and
it is written, that they gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their tongues for pain,
and blaſphemed the GOD of
heaven, becauſe of their paines
and their ſores, (now marke)
&amp; repented not of their deeds.
Here wee ſee that it was not
for their paine, ſo much as for
that they repented not of their
deeds, that they blaſphemed.
Have we repented, or have we
not? If wee have not, then
though our pain be not ſo much
we are in danger to blaſpheme:
but if we have repented be our
paine ever ſo much, wee need
not feare, wee ſhall not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
            <p>3. Say the worſt, have wee
blaſphemed? Yet we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of our blaſphemy and
hope in God: to deſpaire, is
to put our ſelves out of Gods
mercy and protection: to
deſpaire by reaſon of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
is a worſe ſinne than
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19840:158"/>
Blaſphemy, they are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the goodneſſe of GOD,
but yet deſpaire, is againſt his
goodneſſe, his mercy, and his
truth. I confeſſe it is an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
crime to blaſpheme againſt
God; and ſo much the worſer,
becauſe it is a ſin ſomewhat like
the impardonable blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt: neither
is it in the wil of every man, to
ſay, where the difference lies
betwixt them.<note place="margin">Deus opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Vid. Molin. De Cognit. Dei. p. 25.</note> Beſides, other
ſinnes are againſt God in his
Greatneſſe, Governement, but
this of Blaſphemy, doth ſpeake
againſt the Goodneſſe of God;
and God as he is repreſented to
us, ſtands more on his Goodnes
than his Greatneſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo this ſin of Blaſpeming
hath beene ever held amongſt
the greateſt of ſins: all which
muſt teach us by all meanes to
beware of this ſin, and we may
the eaſier take heed of it, and
ſave our ſelves from it, becauſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19840:159"/>
it being againſt our naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
principle of a Deity: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it ſelfe is afraid of this ſin,
which is a great meanes to ſtay
us from the ſin-it ſelfe. Satan, I
know, is a great blaſphemer, and
he will aſſay hard to it to make
us to blaſpheme; but wee muſt
ſet the Word &amp; Spirit of God
againſt it, and let the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doe all it can againſt it too.
And if at any time we have bin
to blame this way, yet we muſt
know that there is a pardon to
bee had: I was, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note>
and <hi>Paul</hi> is in heaven;
and which is worſe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
men to blaſpheme,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 11</note> yet on
his true repentance, all went
well with <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo it may
and will with us, if we returne
as <hi>Paul</hi> did Chriſt hath it, <hi>Mat.
12.</hi> 31. That blaſphemy againſt
God is a ſin, which may on the
ſame termes, that any the leaſt
ſinne that is, ſhall and muſt bee
forgiven, I meane, on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19840:159"/>
There is a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
which is a ſin unto death, and
there is no repentance for this
ſin, nor no hope; the cauſe is,
becauſe no man can repent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life, except God give him
the grace: and wee have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
that there is a decree
paſſed in heaven, that the Lord
will never afford this ſinner the
grace to repent. Divers other
ſinners never have this favour
done to them as to repent, but
all ſinners of this ſort are paſt
all hope for ever. There is a
difference, betwixt this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
and this blaſphemy againſt <hi>God</hi>
and Chriſt, not onely in the
meaſure, but in the very kinde;
I know Satan would faine put
it upon us, that we have ſinned
againſt the Holy Ghoſt when
it is no ſuch matter: on igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Chriſtians hee layes this,
that when they ſin againſt their
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19840:160"/>
knowledge and conſcience that
then it is the ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, when the Spirit hath
bin at them not to ſin, yet they
ſin and grieve and vex the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God: then Satan makes
his advantage, oh ſaith he, this
is to ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt
that it is a ſin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, I doe not deny; but that
it is the ſinne againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, is falſe: I prove it to be
falſe, becauſe this ſin is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Moreover, we ſpeake of
Blaſphemy againſt the Holy
Ghoſt; now that every ſinne
againſt the Holy Ghoſt muſt
needs be Blaſphemy againſt the
Holy Ghoſt, cannot be proved:
and when we goe ſo farre as to
blaſpheme God, then we make
a cry, now it is too late to
thinke of repenting; this is,
ſaith he, that unrepentable and
unpardonable ſinne againſt the
Holy Ghoſt. Our anſwer muſt
be, by denying this to bee that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19840:160"/>
ſin, our reaſon muſt be, becauſe
we are ſorry for it, and were it
to doe againe, wee would not
doe it for a world: but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is
no whit ſorry for his ſinne, his
heart never akes for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but would have all do it
as well as himſelfe, and is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have hell as full as hee
could: and he doth even wiſh
withall his heart, that wife, that
children, that parents, that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that neighbours, that all
might blaſpheme the Holy
Ghoſt as well as himſelfe. It is
then nothing but a policy of
Satan, to play upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of men, as touching the
nature and effects of this ſinne,
and to beare them in hand, that
when they have blaſphemed
God, they have blaſphemed
the Holy Ghoſt: but wee muſt
hold a maine difference to lye
betwixt this blaſphemy, againſt
God the Father, and the Holy
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19840:161"/>
Ghoſt, that as the perſons dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
ſo doth the ſins againſt the
ſeverall perſons. As long then
as our blaſphemy is againſt the
firſt and not againſt the third,
we may be ſafe; it is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and all is well: they doe
not prize the infinite mercy of
God according to the infinite
worth of it, who thinke their
ſin of blaſphemy againſt God,
too great for him to pardon, as
though it were poſſible for man
to ſinne a ſinne, which Gods
mercy being ſimply infinite,
had not enough in it to forgive
it. This their errour is worſe
than the firſt to thinke ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the rich and high and
boundleſſe mercy of the moſt
Eternall and Infinite GOD: we
muſt now learne better to prize
the mercy of God; and ſay, I
cannot once repent of a ſin, bee
it ever ſo great and maine, but
the mercy of God is ready to
forgive it. Could the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19840:161"/>
againſt the Holy Ghoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
he muſt have his pardon:
conceive wee hope of pardon
and then we will returne to the
Lord by repentance, and the
Lord will take away the guilt
and waſh away the ſtaine of
this great ſin.</p>
            <p>The third tentation is of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury:<note place="margin">Quo in loco a facinore abhorrebit, &amp;c. Ariſt.</note>
Here we muſt take great
heed that we doe not forſweare
our ſelves, chiefly in open
Court; where,<note place="margin">Rhet. l. 1. c. 14.</note> if any where a
man ſhould ſhew himſelfe, a
religious,<note place="margin">Eſta bonus miles, &amp;c.</note> a true, a juſt, and an
honeſt man;<note place="margin">Iuven. Sat. 8</note> a fruit it is, of deep
Atheiſme to perjure ones ſelfe,
and perjured perſons bee hated
of God and man, wherefore the
conſcience will deepely and
bitterly accuſe for this ſinne of
perjury. I could wiſh all men
who love their owne quiet, and
have a deſire to ſleep in a whole
conſcience, that they would
take heed that they do not take
a falſe oath: come what will,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19840:162"/>
rather dye a thouſand deaths,
it is much againſt the light of
nature,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 10.</note> and more againſt the
light of Scripture;<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 12</note> and theſe
two will flye in our faces with
wild fire, and except God bee
mercifull to us, make us weary
of God and of our ſelves. And
me thinkes (by the way) Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may comfort themſelves,
againſt the infirmities and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
which have ever bin affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on their ſex,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> ſince they
were firſt in the tranſgreſſion;
I ſay, that ſex may ſee a mercy
that they are not ſo ſubject to
this ſinne of formall perjury as
men are; they ſerve not in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
grand or petty, they are not
brought in Courts, to take
oathes in Homages and the
like; they ſerve not the office
of Church-wardens, and ſo are
not ſworne and depoſed any
thing ſo often as men, &amp; hence
they have a great freedome
from ſinning this vexing ſinne
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19840:162"/>
over men have, which I would
have them thanke God for, and
amongſt other matters, take this
as a recompence for thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inflictions and revenges,
which God at firſt laid on that
ſex; ſo that in reſpect of this
ſin and ſome other tentations,
that they are free from, over
men bee: they may when they
doe thinke of it, even thanke
God that they were made wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and not men: let not then
Satan bring us into this brake,
it is hard getting out of it.<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2.</note> Feare
an oath, and of all ſuch oathes,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 26.</note>
wherein wee doe wrong and
hurt to men, for though there
be ſometimes ſome corruption
in it, as taſting of ſelfe-love to
our ſelves, yet for certaine, ſins
wherein wee wrong men
whom we ſee doe ſo much the
more torment and racke the
conſcience of man; and many
men have mightily miſcarried
for this offence and ſin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19840:163"/>
wherefore beware; and
now to provide for the worſt,
we muſt tell the man who hath
done this ſin,<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 2.</note> that there is hope
in Iſrael concerning this ſinne
alſo. David himſelfe was not
ſtill as good as his oath, as in
the caſe of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 15, 16.</note> hee fell
ſhort of that oath of the Lord
which hee made to <hi>Ionathans</hi>
houſe and family; and becauſe
inſtances work eaſier on weake
ſpirits than Rules, I would have
ſuch to thinke of <hi>Peter,</hi> who
did forſweare and renounce the
perſon of Chriſt, and when?
But in his troubles; and where?
But in the High Prieſts Hall, and
who? Why <hi>Peter</hi> a chiefe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

Chriſt his maſter; and is not
<hi>Peter</hi> in heaven? Teares of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
will fetch out the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
ſtaine that this ſinne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
can poſſibly make, but it
is the Rule muſt ſettle us at laſt;
and it is, that if wee repent of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19840:163"/>
any ſin bee it never ſo great in

as no ſinne to us.<note place="margin">Pſa. 32. 5.</note>

to doe it, and God forgave
the iniquity (the guilt) of his

ſet downe our ſins
without exception,) GOD is
faithfull and juſt to forgive
them; it ſtands upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his Iuſtneſſe to be as
good as his word, to forgive
all repentant ſinners all their
ſins. S. <hi>Iob 33. 27. If one ſay I
have ſinned, hee will deliver his
ſoule:</hi> ſay <hi>peccavi,</hi> and cry GOD
mercy, and we ſhall (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)</hi>
have mercy; mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
in pardoning of our ſins,
and mercy, now ſome and then
ſome, in healing our iniquities.
Never did any man confeſſe his
ſin to God,<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 13</note> but hee went away
with his pardon; wicked men
may confeſſe to their fellowes,
and to good men they may, as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19840:164"/>
               <hi>Saul</hi> did to <hi>David;</hi> but it is an
harder matter than ſo, for a man
to confeſſe to God, except it be
for company, or for outward
glory: but for a man to take <hi>God</hi>
aſide to confeſſe alone to him,
I thinke a wicked man cannot
doe that. I finde no inſtance in
the Word, that ever any unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man did it. A man
had need have hope of pardon
to confeſſe to the Iudge: <hi>Adam</hi>
did flye from God, fell to ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and ſo wee doe all, while
wee are as hee then was, out
of the ſtate of grace. I meane
not the grace of election; no
man can have hope of pardon
but by faith: and by that I doe
hold, that it is a ſigne of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, to confeſſe all alone to
God; and then I can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that a man will confeſſe
his ſin honeſtly and ingeniouſly
betwixt GOD and his owne
ſoule except he hate that ſinne.
Now how a wicked man can
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19840:164"/>
come to the hatred of his ſinne,
is paſt my skill to underſtand.
To come backe I ſay deſpaire
not, it is worſe than perjury, it
makes GOD a lier, or worſe
than a lier, it accuſeth him of
a kinde of perjury; for a man
to ſay, there is no hope, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to be had, repent we never
ſo much; ſith God hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid it,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> but ſworne it, that he
will not the death of a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
ſinner; repent and bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
            <p>The fourth is breaking of
Vowes: a vow broken doth
crack the comfort of mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
exceedingly. A vow is
defined to bee a religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made to God, I ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
vow is ſuch a promiſe, but
al ſuch promiſes are not vowes,
for a vow properly and ſtrictly
taken, is, when a promiſe is
made to GOD of this or that
within our power, with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of obtaining ſome what at
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19840:165"/>
Gods hands; other promiſes
are ſimply made, and abſolutely
without any ſuch condition of
getting any thing from the
hands of God; and thus Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
is ſoundly and learnedly
denied to bee formally a vow.<note place="margin">Abbots anſ. to Biſhop. c. 1. Sect. 1. p. 995.</note>
The Schooles teach us, that two

from this it is, that breach of a

there is uſe and place for vowes
and great good they doe, but it
is a duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>er for a ſtrong
Chriſtian than for every young
beginner. It is ſtrange to ſee,
how Satan doth puſh on every
boy and girle on any occaſion,
to runne into a corner and there
to make vowes; it ſhowes
that the duty is not ſo ſpiritual,
for a man to tye himſelfe to do
that he ſhould doe, without any
ſuch obligation, in that we find
our ſelves too too forward to
run into vowes, whereas to
comfortable duties we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
enough. God loves a
willing people, and wee ſhould
ſerve him with a free ſpirit,<note place="margin">Pſ. 110. 3.</note> and
vowes,<note place="margin">Pſ. 51. 12.</note> which are as ſhackles,

ſound (as I thinke) who ſaith,
that a worke done with a vow
is more laudable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
than the ſame worke and

vow broken doth puniſh the

man, never once goe about to
thinke, that there is any favour
for thee in heaven. My advice
is then:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that wee bee ſparing in
vowing, ſith we breake many,
and keepe few.<note place="margin">On Gal.</note> Doctor <hi>Stanpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> was wont
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19840:166"/>
to ſay, I have vowed to GOD
above a thouſand times, that I
would become a better man,
but I never performed that
which I vowed: hereafter I wil
make no ſuch vow, for I have
now learned by experience,
that I am not able to performe
it. This is too much, to ſay
one will never vow again, who
can ſay what need one may
have; what good a vow may
doe one? I rather follow him
who wils us to vow,<note place="margin">Greentham on Pſa. 119. v. 106.</note> but for a
time; as a man who hath beene
overtaken with drinke in ſuch
and ſuch places, company, or
ſo, may doe well to tye himſelfe
by a vow, not to come where
they are for a Moneth or ſo, and
then ſee what he can doe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can forbeare without a
vow, and if hee can, that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
beſt at the hands of GOD;
but if we finde ſome relique of
the humor ſtill, then vow for a
Moneth more, and ſo at length
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19840:167"/>
by times, the conqueſt will be
had; to bind our ſelves by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
vowes is not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
becauſe our nature is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
made to break thoſe bonds
that wee doe binde our ſelves
with for continuance,<note place="margin">Quod licet ingratum eſt &amp;c. Ovid Amor. lib. 2.</note> and our
mouthes will water,<note place="margin">Vid. Aquin. 2. 2. q. 35. a. 1 ad 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. Sum. tom. 2. tract. 2. c. 5. q. 5. Sect. 6.</note> our fleſh
will itch the more to breake
them: wherefore I have held it
an high point of wiſdome, firſt,
to vow no oftner than needs
muſt, and then to doe it but for
a ſhort period of time; &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee doe it oftner or ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
for a longer, or a ſhorter
ſpace, to doe all by the grace
of God, and never once thinke
to make or to keepe our vow
ſo made, but by and through
the onely and the ſpeciall hand
of God: his ſtrength muſt doe
it, and therefore a vow made
without prayer is never kept.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but to provide for
the worſt; make the caſe that
we have broken our vowes, yet
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19840:167"/>
wee muſt not ſpend our ſpirits
too much with helliſh melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
ſo we ſhall carry an hell
in our conſciences, our tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our ſelves with extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of legall ſorrowes will doe
us no good, nor God no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
we may hurt our ſelves by
it, and that is all the good w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
comes of puniſhing our ſelves
over and above. The way is to
returne to the Lord with all
ſpeed, and to bring us to God,
wee muſt know, that it is no
ſuch ſinne (as bad as it is) but
that we may be Gods ſervants
for all that; for hardly was
there over a more godly man
than <hi>Iacob;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20, 21, 22.</note> and hee wee know
vowed a vow, and it was to
make that ſtone to be GODS
Chappell, and hee being now
but a poore man doth promiſe,
that in caſe God would give
him but bread to eate, and
cloathes to put on, that God
ſhould bee his God, and have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19840:168"/>
the tenth of all: but wee finde
that God did not onely give
him neceſſaries but abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10</note>
hee came over with his
ſtaffe, but he returned with two
armies, and now being made
rich, we finde no great remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of, nor haſte to performe
his vow. One would thinke,
if ever man were bound to bee
as good as his vow, it was <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi>
yet we find he did nothing
in it for a great time, but lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
as though he had no care
of his promiſe made to God:
for wee read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 13. ſome
twenty yeeres after the making
of that his vow, <hi>God</hi> was faine
by an Angell to pluck him by
the eare, to give him an <hi>Item</hi>
in plaine words, ſaying, <hi>I am
the God of Bethell, where thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointedſt

vowedſt a vow; now ariſe, get thee
out from this land, and returne
unto the land of thy kindred.</hi> One
would thinke here were plaine
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19840:168"/>
Engliſh, and round dealing
enough, and yet for all this
<hi>Iacob</hi> is ſlow and makes no
ſpeed to hie him up to <hi>Bethel.</hi>
View the particulars. 1. I am
the God of <hi>Bethel.</hi> 2. Where
thou annointedſt the Pillar. 3.
Where thou vowedſt a vow
unto me, all are as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
to put him in minde of
his promiſe and vow made to
<hi>God:</hi> that he might now ariſe at
laſt, and be as good as his word
to <hi>God:</hi> yet for all this <hi>Iacob</hi> lies
behinde, delayes the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his vow, which ſloth
and ſin of his,<note place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> did puniſh.
Firſt, by <hi>Eſaus</hi> lying in waite

Thirdly, by the rage and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
committed by his ſonnes;
upon which horrible and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
Maſſacre,<note place="margin">Gen. 34. 30</note> the good

the next would be, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would unite and deſtroy
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:19840:169"/>
him and his houſe. Now the
Lord tooke him, when his heart
was downe with thoſe heavy
tydings and grievous feares;
and juſt in the nick, <hi>God</hi> ſaid
unto him; <hi>Ariſe, goe up to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel
and dwell there,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and make
there an Altar unto God, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto thee, when thou fled'ſt
from the face of Eſau thy brother:</hi>
and then both long and late, yet
at leaſt being drawne to it, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
doth performe his vow. It
is true, he did it though it were
long firſt, yet wee ſee, the Lord
was faine to fire him out of his
negligence, and to force him to
remember himſelfe. His put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off ſo often, his long delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was as great a ſinne, as our
very breaking of our vow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had he ever done it, had he
bin let alone; and yet <hi>Iacob</hi> was
all this while a deare ſervant of
<hi>God,</hi> and he was pardoned his
delaying, his vow, and he is in
heaven: let us not thinke but
our caſe is good, albeit we have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19840:169"/>
made and broken many a vow.
Repentance will come &amp; heale
all againe. The ſumme is, that
we make no more vowes than
needs muſt, ſith Satan is apt to
thruſt us on our vows, knowing
that our nature is ſick to breake
out when it is ſo bound; and
when we have failed, then hee
roares and cries, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left but hell and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for a covenant-breaker
with <hi>God;</hi> and therefore wee
muſt be choice this way, never
to vow, but when we are truly
called unto it, and when we are
called to it, to vow, and feare
nothing, ſith wee vow not on
our owne ſtrength, but only on
the power and grace of <hi>God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non ſitis p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were we to performe the vow
by any force, any wit of our
owne, men ſhould rather vow,
never to vow, than to vow at
all: but ſith we go, by the help,
preſence, and aſſiſtance of <hi>God,</hi>
when wee have a calling to it,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19840:170"/>
vow and ſpare not, and if wee
doe fall ſo farre as to breake our
vowes,<note place="margin">Pſ. 76. 11.</note> yet let us hold our own,
we are not the firſt, others have
done it, and are in heaven; it is
a pardonable ſinne, repentance
will take up the matter betwixt
<hi>God</hi> and us, &amp; make us as good
and perhaps better friends than
ever. The beſt friendſhip is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
after a falling out, and wee
muſt know, that many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
pleaſeth <hi>God</hi> better,
than never to have done the ſin,
becauſe it humbles a man more,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 7.</note>
and drives a man more out of
himſelfe;<note place="margin">Ma. 18. 12.</note> and there is as much
ſaith in it, for a man to beleeve
that <hi>God</hi> on his meere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will forgive him, as there
is in holding out againſt the
tentation, and not breaking the
vow at all: neither is it beſides
the booke, to ſay, that there is
as much grace in it for a man
when hee is downe to repent
and returne, as there is in not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19840:170"/>
falling at all; for by our fall the
powers of the ſoule are weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the force of grace is decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the ſtrength of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
matter is confirmed; and
the conſcience of a man after a
fall is as a diſtempered lock, the
more wee tamper with it, the
worſe; all this ſhowes, that it
is a ſigne of much love, &amp; great
favour of <hi>God</hi> to repent of a
great and foule fault; it is the
vomit of the ſoule, and of all
phyſick none ſo difficult and
hard as it is to vomit, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt comfort our ſelves
and ſay, I confeſſe I did <hi>God</hi>
great wrong in breaking my
promiſe, and did highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him; but I now ſee, that
hee meaneth all good to my
ſoule, in that he hath given mee
the heart and grace to repent of
my ſin, and this is a fruit of an
upright heart to take diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
at ſin. There is I know an
uprightneſſe, and that is of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19840:171"/>
when we ſin but a few
ſins in compariſon: ſo <hi>Ezekiah</hi>
comforted himſelfe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38. 3.</note> in that he
walked uprightly before the
Lord.</p>
            <p>2. Another of repentance,<note place="margin">Reſpicere nihilo faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius eſt, &amp;c. Ariſt. Polit. l. 4. c. 1.</note>
when we catch many ſore fals,
ſin many great &amp; heynous ſins,
but yet we pick up al againe, by
mourning and repentance; &amp;
ſo <hi>David</hi> did, and his heart was
all out as upright as ever <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
was, he was a man after
Gods owne heart, and carries
as large-teſtimonies of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe
and ſincerity,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 11. 4. 15. 3.</note> as the
Old teſtament hath any. Now
this uprightneſſe of repentance
is as ſincere and ſhowes as true
an heart to God, as the other of
obedience; reſt wee then our
comfort on this point, that ſay,
we have not kept our ſelves to
our covenant and our vow: yet
ſaving that it muſt and wil coſt
us ſorrow upon ſorrow, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
of our breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:19840:171"/>
is as pleaſing to God, and
ought to bee as comfortable to
us as our Not ſinning would
have been; and ſith <hi>God</hi> thinks

be more juſt, or more holy than
God, we muſt not thinke ever

            <p>The laſt is unbeleefe and a
kind of Atheiſme, as touching
Chriſt Ieſus. Atheiſme I call it
(with the Apoſtle,) ſith he that
is without Chriſt is without
God:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> and when a man is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

for loſe our hold here and all is

and this is an high and an hard
point of Divinity, here a man
is put upon a totall deniall of
himſelfe, ſenſe, reaſon and all
(but meere pure faith) is againſt
it. A man hath a law of nature,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:19840:172"/>

concerning the Being of God;<note place="margin">So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 15. Paul ſaith, not that the Goſpell, but that the worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a man hath in him (as hee is a

though I cannot finde a reaſon

dye by the booke, the Bible

that there is any ſuch thing as
ſin, but becauſe it is written; I
muſt then paſſe my ſoule upon
it. Firſt, that there is Chriſt.
Secondly, that Ieſus is the
Chriſt. Thirdly, what this
Chriſt is, and what he did and
doth for the ſalvation of the
Church. Fourthly, that hee is,
my Chriſt, my Ieſus, my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
I ſay, I muſt dye upon it,
becauſe theſe things are in and
out of the Word; many ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
break in, but dare any man
ſet it under his hand, that Ieſus
is not the Chriſt, that any elſe
is the Saviour? No. Are wee
not ready when wee are at the

with our hands to this
propoſition, that Ieſus borne of
the Virgin Mary, was and is the
Meſſias, the Saviour of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Why then, downe with
all oppoſitions and dubitations,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:19840:173"/>
daſh them al out of countenance

Chriſt, becauſe it is in the
Word, the eye and hand of

in our mouthes (hee is hee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the word ſaith ſo: and I
do beleeve it the rather, becauſe
Satan and luſt cannot abide to
heare of it. Hold we our ſelves
then to the letter and tenor of
the Goſpell, and the tentation
will blow away: faith workes
ſtrongeſt at laſt, where reaſon
is moſt againſt it, and we finde
dying men doubt leaſt of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Articles of Chriſt, and
the principles of faith; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a received axiome in the
Church of Chriſt, that ſaith
workes beſt and cleareſt, when
it workes alone, and it workes

ſaith yea. Thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the particulars in the firſt
Table; now followes to bee
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19840:174"/>
treated of ſome chiefe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
table. The thing we muſt
begin with is, that the pangs
of conſcience which ariſe out
of ſinnes in the ſecond Table,
were generally greater and
ſtronger than of the firſt; and
it is, becauſe that there is leſſe
of the light and law of nature in
us, of the worſhip of God, than
of the duties of our neighbour;
we have here a double ſting, the
ſpirituall conſcience cries, and
the naturall conſcience cries;
and when two come together
to cry, that cry muſt needs bee
great: it is the better to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
order and diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men; that there is
more of natures law in the
things of men, than of God,
and a greater light to diſcerne
thoſe than theſe. The world
muſt ſtand and hold in ſome
quiet, til the period of it expire,
which could not be, were it not
for this bond and law of nature
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19840:174"/>
and thus wee have it, that in
weaker Chriſtians eſpecially,
greateſt troubles of mind come,
from matters of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And if you aske what the
matters of the ſecond table be,
which doe moſt vex the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

caſes doe not uſe to ſtagger the
conſcience moſt, in moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe
it is not ſo flat againſt
the light of Nature, neither are
they held ſuch heynous faults
amongſt men, and wee uſe to
judge too much of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſouleneſſe of ſins by
cuſtome &amp; the eſtimate of men,
we do account thoſe the worſt
ſins, not ever which the Word
ſaith are the greateſt ſins; but
ſuch as amongſt men in the
time and place where we live,
goe for the mighty ſinnes, and
trouble of conſcience doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from our opinion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
wee have of things,
which by the way muſt teach
us, not altogether to be led by
the wrack of our conſcience;
for conſcience is blind in al un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men, and in the beſt,
it is in part defiled and corrupt
and imperfect, and therefore it
is miſtaken and cannot bee our
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19840:175"/>
rule,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1.</note> and it is our ſin, to ſet our
conſcience in the roome of the
Word of God, when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſpeakes in the Holy Ghoſt
and according to the word,
then it muſt be heard, elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
moſt of ſome things that,
are no ſins at all, as we ſee in the
Phariſie, who was troubled in
minde, if hee ſhould chance to
eate with unwaſhen hands,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 2.</note> and
through miſpriſion and error,<note place="margin">Mar. 7. 2.</note>
they thought they did GOD
good ſervice,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2.</note> to kill Chriſt and
his Apoſtles, and therefore we
muſt not ſet up conſcience too
high; put it not in Gods place
but when it ſpeakes for God
and from God, and hath light
enough to ſee what is what,
then when it ſpeakes out of the
word, the conſcience muſt bee
heard; God is greater than our
heart,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and therefore wee muſt
hold to him and to his Word,
which onely is his Interpreter
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:19840:176"/>
in this world: it concludes not
then ſimply, to ſay, my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tels me it is a ſin, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tels me I am not in <hi>Gods</hi>
favour; but to returne, we muſt
know that thoſe ſins doe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
moſt, which doe moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
the ſociety of men, for
it is the naturall conſcience that
gives the heavieſt blow; there
is moſt light and ſight in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
conſcience of man, in thoſe
matters which concerne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſocieties of men; and ſo
becauſe bloud, luſt and theft do
undermine the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and caſt all into confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
hence it is that theſe ſins
make ſuch a cry as they doe,
and that not ſimply, becauſe
they are the greateſt that bee;
nor for that they are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the nature or will of <hi>God,</hi>
but becauſe they doe moſt hurt
to men, and are moſt againſt the
order and governement of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
before I deſcend to thoſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:19840:176"/>
particulars, I would have men
to aske the queſtion, whether
their trouble bee, becauſe the
tentation is bad, or baſe; or bad
and baſe both.</p>
            <p>1. If we be troubled only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſin is baſe, and brings
with it, or after it, the ſhame of
the world, than it is from ſinne
and pride that we are ſo vexed,
and that is made a matter of
conſcience, which is wholly or
chiefly a matter of ſelf-reſpects;
or if it be within our ſelves and
ſecret, and yet out of a conceit
of our ſelves, wee are much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
that we ſhould be haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to doe, or drawne to act
ſuch and ſuch vile and baſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
or ſome diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paſſions, then this is from
ſpirituall pride, and all this is
no true trouble of conſcience at
all; we may know whether it
be thus or not, if that other ſins
as groſſe and great in Gods
ſight, which have in them or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:19840:177"/>
after them no ſhame, nature
ſhames not at them, the world
doth not cry ſhame of them,
but (rather as many ſinnes of
profit and delight) are in
credit in the world, and doe
bring reſpect amongſt men;
now if wee finde, that ſuch ſins
do paſſe without any ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
the conſcience ſaith as
much as nothing, though wee
be convinced that they are ſins;
if thus, then the caſe is cleare,
that it is a trouble which wee
make, and not which ſinne or
God doth make. It is ſhame
as ſhame, not ſinne as ſin, that
doth cauſe all this cry; it is not
for the ſin, but for the effect of
ſin that we thus complaine.</p>
            <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If bad and not baſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the face of the world or
to the naturall principles which
are in us, then the troubles that
wee feele in the conſcience are
ſpirituall and ſincere, they are
for ſinne as ſinne, becauſe it is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:19840:177"/>
naught, or rather, becauſe it is for
bidden by <hi>God;</hi> for many things
have no morall naughtineſſe in
them, yet are ſins, becauſe they
are forbidden by God; and if
theſe things trouble the minde,
ſuch wounds come the right
way and God will cure them:
as becauſe wee heare not the
Word, receive not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which in the dictates of
nature were no ſinnes, had not
Gods written law bin: In a
word, when we finde that the
blow our conſcience doth give
us, is becauſe the fact is a fault,
a thing forbidden by God: here
the matter doth run right, and
it is very conſcience which
moves in that caſe.</p>
            <p>3. When bad and baſe, both
the terror is great, and it proves
an occaſion of great humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and caſting a man downe;
wee are ſo proud and high in
our owne conceits, that baſe
tentations which produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:19840:178"/>
ſhame to the minde of a
man, and if they come abroad,
outward ſhame and ſcorne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, doe mightily abaſe
a man, and are an excellent cure
for ſpirituall pride. Here wee
ſhall finde a mixt paſſion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
feares in the heart, and
complaints in the conſcience of
a man; for as the ſin is bad, ſo
it doth trouble becauſe it threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the wrath of God, and is
accompanied many times with
a fore-feeling of the wrath to
come. As it is baſe ſo it doth
draw over the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of a man an inward
bluſhing and ſhame; and I may
ſay it, that true internall ſhame,
making the conſcience red a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with bluſhing, teſtifies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
more and rather than
ſorrow. A wicked man may
grieve, but for this ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicall
ſhame, it is not in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men: we muſt note that an
outward ſhame is in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:19840:178"/>
when they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſome ſins which the world
doth point at; this is a ſhame
before man, and there is ſome
inward ſhame alſo, which wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men do feele in themſelves
too, and that is in and for ſuch
ſins as are againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and ſuch conviction as
generall illumination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
graces doe cauſe: here the
heart will bluſh, but in ſuch ſins
as are not knowne to be ſins, but
by the conviction of the ſpirit;
here to ſhame,<note place="margin">Spirituall ſins are not ſo baſe, as carnall ſins:</note> to have an heart

that when, and whilſt they

were not aſhamed of them:
Well then, a wicked man may
grieve for ſin, becauſe of the

both, becauſe there is wrath
hanging over his head by an
haire, becauſe ſins lyes at the
doore;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> and here are ſelfe-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
out of love and care to

but this ſhame is not becauſe
ſin is puniſhable,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Rhet. 2. c. 6. Aqui. 2. 2. q. 144. a. 2.</note> but by reaſon
that it is filthy, it ariſeth from
the turpitude of ſin, and this is
hearty to make a ſtand at ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is filthy and ugly. To be
aſhamed of ſome effects of ſin,
as <hi>Adam</hi> in his fall, I meane at
his nakedneſſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7.</note> is in wicked
men: but to have this inward

of ſin; this is not in the

wicked, nor in their trouble of

when I ſay, there is not onely
griefe for ſin as bad, as puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
as bad, reſpecting God, as

            <p>1. To begin with Theft, wee
muſt beware that wee doe not
filch the worth of a penny fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any man, that which in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notation is called theft, is
more baſe than the great ſin of

ſuch as it is: but in theft is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a baſe minde; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the law is ſo ſtrict and flat
againſt theeving; the name of
a theefe is odious, and it doth
pay our hearts home, and there
is very much trouble of minde,<note place="margin">Furem odio habet &amp; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantam quiſ<expan>

becauſe men doe uſe to ſpit at
this ſin, and the reaſon is, rather
becauſe it is a wrong to man,
than for that it is a ſinne againſt
God: and ſure wee muſt ſee
that wee doe keepe cleane fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that by no kinde of unjuſt
alienation, wee either take or
keepe any thing from any body
which in right is his; wee all
love to be truly and juſtly dealt
with, and therefore nature it
ſelfe, if it may bee heard ſpeake,
will cry fye and ſhame upon a
falſe finger. Becauſe then it
maks a breach into the <hi>meum &amp;
tuum</hi> of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, which we ſee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than for that it doth make
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19840:180"/>
a breach in the law of GOD
which wee ſee not; this ſinne
doth clogge the conſciences of
men what ever the ful cauſe be,
we finde that it doth peſter the
minde of man; and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
held and hampered with
a clogge, is like a diſtempered
lock which no key will open:
we muſt therefore, to keep our
conſcience as free as may bee,
beware that wee doe not touch
that which is anothers: but if
wee have, doe, or ſhall, what
then? We muſt free our mindes
againe by confeſſion to God,
and reſtitution to men. Here
wee ſee that a great cauſe why
theſe ſame ſins of theft do urge
the conſcience ſo much, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the wrong done to men
(whom we ſee) in that as ſoone
as ever we have made reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the minde begins to ſettle,
and the heart to quiet it ſelfe
preſently. I know if wee have
meanes ſo to doe, we muſt give
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19840:181"/>
as a work of charity, to expreſſe
our thankefulneſſe to God, a
largeſſe to the poore too, as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chous</hi>
did:<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 8.</note> but the maine thing
which quiets the conſcience, is
to reſtore, which is a worke of
Iuſtice, the other of Charity:
this worke of making reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the party wronged, or to
the poore in caſe of defect, that
the party cannot be knowne or
had, will ſtill the Allarum
which the cry of unjuſtice ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in the conſcience of men.
And by the way we may note,
that the very cauſe why the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinnes of murther and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes
are more dangerous to
the peace of our conſciences, is,
becauſe that in them there is no
poſſible place left for reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(for who can reſtore to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their life or chaſtity?) But
here, in theevery there is, and
therefore there lies a faire way
to huſh all in this ſinne which
doth not in thoſe. The ſumme
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19840:181"/>
is, take nothing from no man;
it ſaves a great deale of horror,
if wee have, then let him that
ſtole, repent of the ſin, reſtore
the dammage,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> and ſteale no
more.</p>
            <p>2 The next ſhall be murther,
a ſinne that makes a foule and
helliſh noiſe in the conſcience,
in that it deprives a man of his
life, his beſt peece: I meane
not to ſpeak of murthering our
enemies, or plaine killing any,
as <hi>David</hi> did, to avoid ſhame
or ſo. Tentations to this ſinne,
are amongſt the people of <hi>God,
David</hi> for one, did it for once,
and it did ſo caſt him behinde
hand, that he came not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

then too, by the particular ſtrok
of <hi>Nathans</hi> miniſtry; hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
was a Prophet and a rare
Saint of God,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 17</note> yet he loſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for a great time; and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
being ſent from God, was
faine to goe about the buſh, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:19840:182"/>
at laſt to cloſe with him; and
to take him as it were by the
throat, and ſay, thou art the man;
<hi>David</hi> had his fits of minde in
all this ſpace betwixt,<note place="margin">2 Sa. 12. 7.</note> hee roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
hee cried, by reaſon of the
quietneſſe of his heart;<note place="margin">Pſ. 32, 4, 5.</note> his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
was dried within him, he
was like a chip or hearth, and
therefore this ſin by all meanes
muſt be avoided, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and cauſes of it: it ſprings

affections,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 18</note> and we are ſafe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:19840:182"/>
from the ſin: but the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to murther, which follow
many of the people of God are
to murther ones ſelfe, or ones
neareſt friends, as parents, wife,
children; the cauſe of this is
diverſe in ſelfe-murther, that
which makes way for this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
motion is diſcontent, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for ſome ſin, or from ſome
heavy croſſe; and when we are
in this caſe, then becauſe wee
have not faith to beleeve that it
will ever be better; and are ſo
full of pride, that becauſe wee
cannot be as we would be, we
begin to thinke it is beſt not to
be at all: wee muſt then labour
for faith, to beleeve that one day
it will mend; if a ſin, God will
forgive it, if a croſſe, God will
remove it, and to be content to
be any thing, tis no matter what,
as long as we be out of hell, and
then this tentation will away:
and of all, ſee that wee diſpaire
not; for he that is once out of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:19840:183"/>
hope, wil deſire to ſee the worſt
as ſoon as may be, &amp; ſo leape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own death. Hold out, be
patient, waite, ſtand ſtill, <hi>and fee
the ſalvation of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. 14. 13</note> Satan will
tempt the Lord Ieſus to breake
his neck;<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> and are we better than
our maſter? And when <hi>Moſes,
Eliah, Ionas,</hi> and others of the
beſt ſort of Saints, were in a fit
of diſcontent, and grew weary
of their lives, wiſhing for death
I doubt not but Sathan gave a
puſh at them, to diſpatch and
eaſe themſelves of the preſent,
by cutting off their own dayes.
Far be it from us then, to thinke
that wee are none of the Lords,
becauſe wee are tempted or
followed with ſuch hideous
tentations; or that ſure we ſhall
at laſt doe it, ſith we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it long and often: No,
no, thouſands of Saints have
gone thorow this tentation;
and have happily cloſed their
eyes in peace: our lives are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:19840:183"/>
not our owne, the Lord gave
them and it lies not in us, to
take away our owne lives from
our ſelves; our lives I ſay, are
not our owne, and wee neither
ought nor can without GODS
permiſſion take our lives away.
Man in his life being ſo neere
himſelfe as his life is, and the
conſequent being of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
wee muſt truſt and hope
that the Lord will hold our
ſelves in life: I meane not to
give any way to any in this
ſin; for though I ſee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have beene weary of their
lives; yet in all the Word wee
read not of any godly man or
woman that ever did it: few
ſcape the tentation that live out
their time; they are to follow
Chriſt in that as in other tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan; but in all the
word, we read not of any of the
generation of the juſt that ever
did it: that God who kept
them, will, if wee looke up to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:19840:184"/>
him doe as much for us. A mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
matter it is, ſerving
much to humble us, that men
who dares not thinke of taking
away the life of another, ſhould
be ſo peſtered with impulſions
to ſtop their owne breath; but
to ſettle the point, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
falſe meanes of eaſe, and
ſet downe the true way to peace
in this malady.</p>
            <p>1. A falſe meanes is for a man
to yeeld to much to feares, ſo as
to thinke to avoid the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by declining, and not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting;
as ſome dare not carry
a knife about them, or when
their knife is out, caſt it from
them, this is to yeeld too much
to Satan: neither doth it helpe
the matter, but rather keepe the
tentation in. I will not ſay what
may bee fit, when a man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and held downe by Satan,
herein weakens may diſpence;
but while a man is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
this is not the way: indeed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19840:184"/>
if a man have his knife about
idle occaſions, perhaps it may
doe well to put it up, to put it
out of ſight, and ſo out of mind;
but if a man have it in his hand,
about his meales, or any other
good uſe, then to put the knife
up ere one hath done, out of
theſe feares, is to faint and come
in too much to the devill; and
though one doe finde ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
eaſe for the inſtant; yet it
is but like drinking cold Beere
in the ſhakeing of an Ague, the
diſeaſe will grow the worſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Right ſo, Satan will hold on
his tentations with the greater
violence: the way to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our tentation, is to keepe
our knives about us; and when
out about ſome good and uſefull

and wee ſhall have peace: ſo
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:19840:185"/>
others dare not come, or not
abide in ſuch or ſuch a place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſe
there they uſe to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſelfe-murther, but this is
not the way: have we buſineſſe
there, or have we not? If none,
What make we there? Chiefly
in the night or darke; if wee
have, then go thither, ſtay there
out our time; the tentation wil
more fright us than hurt us, and
it will ere long ſettle us,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 62</note> that we

the night are aſſaulted, they riſe,
and think that the way; if they
riſe to fit themſelves the better
to pray, I ſay nothing to that,
I rather commend it; but if we
riſe and avoid the bed &amp; cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for very feare, I like it not:
it never helpes, the more wee
riſe, the more we may, we ſhall
never have done, rather wee
ſhall grow worſe, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will grow upon us: what
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:19840:185"/>
then? Lye ſtill, looke to God,
to his Word; in any hand yeeld
not to the divell; to flye the
roome, the bed, to call for can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
it is to flye from the divell;
wee muſt abide by it, fight it
out by faith, and Satan will flye
from us. God would have us
ſtand, and it is beſt to beate the
divell in the ſelfe ſame place
where Sathan thinkes to foile
us:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 13, 14.</note> I am at prayer by my ſelfe,
or meditating in a ſecret place,
within or without doores; I
am filled w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a feareful thought
that ſure Satan is behind mee;
what now? Doe not flye the
place, goe on, make an end, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
cannot hurt: ſay, we quake
every joint of us, yet hold on,
quake and pray, quake and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
and we ſhall make Satan
quake and flye: neither is it
good to bee looking behinde
one, for it is a ſervice and kind
of obeying the divell; a man
ſhall never have done; but ſtand
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:19840:186"/>
our ground, out-looke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
ſay I am about a lawfull
worke in my right place, I will
not turne my feet or face aſide
for all the divels in hell. Satan
is the Lords enemy, and God
cannot take it well, that wee
ſhould doe any thing for feare
of him. Againe, I never goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuch or ſuch a bridge, but I
am tempted to caſt my ſelfe in,
and therefore I go round about;
or if I goe over the bridge, I run
over, to bee on the other ſide
quickly for very feare: alas the
day, what a miſerable life this
is, we muſt not thus yeeld, but
goe over, and not about; and
goe over, as we uſe to go on the
plaine ground, and as others
uſe to go over the ſame bridge;
doe thus with a conſtant heart,
and after a time or two, we ſhall
bee free from ſuch horrors and
feares, elſe we ſhall hang in this
miſery perhaps while we live,
as not to dare to go over ſuch a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19840:186"/>
bridge, but wee muſt runne. O
Cowards! Theſe be you think
but toies; beleeve it, there is
more in it than you are aware
of; it helpes againſt the divell,
it frees the heart of a man from
a world of vexing and diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
feares: ſo for our neareſt
and deareſt friends, Satan doth
ſometimes puſh at the people
of God, to lay violent hands on
their wives, their children, and
that in the night; now the way
to helpe all, is not to doe as
ſome doe, to riſe, to avoide the
bed, the chamber, this is a kind
of baſe fearing and yeelding to
the divell; lye ſtill, ſtirre not a
foote, Satan is ſooneſt vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and our hearts beſt eaſed
by reſiſting: ſo for children,
when wee are aſſaulted with
ſuch hideous tentations, many
thinke to mend the matter by
putting the children out of the
roome, out of the houſe, out of
ſight; this is but to ſhift, their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:19840:187"/>
their place is to be in the houſe
and roome where we are; it is
our duty to have them much in
our ſight; it doth but skin over
the matter for a time to put
them away: the beſt way is to
ſtand to it, and beat off Satan in
thoſe tentations, our children
ſtanding by. Now here wee
muſt beware that wee doe not
entertaine a tempting conceit,
as though we did not love our
wives, we did not care for our
children, and were with out na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection, becauſe we are
haunted with ſuch monſtrous
motions: This proves indeed
that Satans tentations are unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and would produce much
unnaturall effects; this proves
that Satan cannot abide, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
(the ground-worke of
all communion amongſt men
in Townes, and States,) ſhould
accord and be in any peace, this
proves, that if Satan might have
his way, he would have us all
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19840:187"/>
to be as he is, but ſo many piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
murtherers. Firſt, of our
beſt friends, and then of our
ſelves: it proves not that wee
love not our friends, becauſe of
theſe motions; for a man may
bee often aſſaulted to doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
harme, and yet for all that
he doth love himſelfe, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his owne good too for all
that: and therefore a man may
well bee a tender husband to a
wife, and parent to a childe, for
all theſe Satanicall ſuggeſtions:
for let any other touch the leaſt
haire of our heads, and offer the
leaſt hurt, to the worſt and leaſt
member we have, we doe ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
at it; and ſhould any other
perſon or thing come with any
violence towards our children,
we will ſtep betwixt them and
the blow, and even venter our
owne lives to bee a meanes to
ſave theirs: and wee finde that
ſuch as are vexed with ſuch
ſudden motions towards their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19840:188"/>
children, are yet ſo tender over
them, that they will ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the winde to blow upon
them; and ſick with them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they are ſick, reckon of no pain,
no care for them, when in any
danger, which ſhowes naturall
affection to abound. A man is
not to judge of the affections
by the feeling motion of them,
nor by the ſtirring of them in
his bowels; nor at all by what
he feeles himſelfe to bee in the
tentation, but by the effects:
if there bee ſuch fruits which
nothing produceth but love
and affection, it is paſt all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that there is no ſuch totall
want and generall defect that
way. We cannot abide to heare
God evill ſpoken of, which
ſhowes that our heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, albeit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
wee feele not our hearts
and affections to move towards
him, our affections are uſually
moſt deepe, when they run on
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19840:188"/>
without any noiſe; wherefore
what ever Satan puts upon us,
we muſt hold our owne; that
for all him and his tentations,
and thoſe impulſions of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſin, we doe love our ſelves
and love our ſecond ſelves full
dearely, and would be full loth
to ſuffer any wrong to bee done
to them.</p>
            <p>2 The true and right meanes
of helpe in theſe bloudy tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are, Firſt, to labour to bee
contented with our ſelves, the
peace wee have, the comfort
wee have, the health wee have,
the meanes we have, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what we doe deſerve; to
bleſſe God that it is no worſe
with us. A cheerefull heart is
not ſubject to ſuch malicious
motions of the divell; he uſeth
to worke on man whom hee
takes to bee diſcontented.
We are alone thinking on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by ſome Well-ſide, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us alone, taking us to bee
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19840:189"/>
there, in ſome diſcontented
moode, thruſts at us with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to caſt our ſelves into the
water: here runne not away,
walke on ſtill, proceed in good
meditations, thruſt away theſe
thoughts that are put in by the
divell; and know that our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
ſin is the receiver worſe
than the theefe. 2. Humble for
that wee carry about with us,
ſuch a corrupt heart, as will on
ſuch occaſions take thought of
diſcontent; it is our proud fleſh
that will not ſit downe under
ſome heavey croſſe; and becauſe
we have not al we would have,
and cannot bee that wee would
be, we care not to be at all: we
muſt have as others have, elſe
wee fall a powting preſently;
we muſt learne to be thankfull
for any life; downe with the
proud humour, bee not high
minded, theſe thunders and
lightnings of tentations are to
fright us, and by ſuch feare to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19840:189"/>
bring us to walke humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord. 3. See what ſin
wee live in, if in any, that is a
true cauſe of deepe diſcontent:
repent of that; doe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty; ſin is the proper cauſe,
not to the croſſe which makes
us weary of our lives; Satan ſets
our eyes onely on the croſſe, for
he knowes, it is out of our reach
to remove that; but indeed it is
ſome ſinne that doth pinch us,
and put a ſting into the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we have it in our hands
by repentance to remove the
ſin, and the croſſe will remove
it ſelfe: Goe to God to finde
out the ſinne for us, and away
with that, if there bee any, and
(as when the tooth is once
drawne) we ſhall finde eaſe and
peace preſently; if we bee not
weary of ſinne, it is but fit, wee
ſhould be made to be weary of
our ſelves: if no ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then know,
it is to humble us, and to fit us
for ſome great peece of ſervice
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:19840:190"/>
that the Lord meanes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
us in. Waite and joyne
with the tentation, to rend the
heart, to bring the minde low,
and then it will be gone. 4. See
whether we do not abuſe God
and our ſelves in our wives and
children; perhaps, we dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, make ſo many Gods
of them; and if ſo, then it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they ſhold by this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be made bitter unto us;
that wee may have wives and
children,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29</note> as though wee had
none at all; or if otherwiſe we
ſinne againſt God in them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for them, let this goe for the
cauſe, why Satan is ſet on, and
let on us, with ſuch killing ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
that we may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the very thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee have offended. 5. That
which muſt hit it on the head
and doe the deed it ſelfe, is to
get it off by prayer, by a faſt,
if need bee, and by the Word.
There are ſome which will not
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19840:190"/>
off but by prayer, and faſting;
but there are none ſo terrible,
ſo ſtrong, but prayer and faſting
will give us eaſe and comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: but the matter
muſt bee ſanctified to us by
the Word; wee muſt bring
Scripture, not reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To tell Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
or our ſelves of the ſhame,
of the danger to us, to ours, will
not doe the deed: that which
will worke the worke, is to ſet
the word of commandement,
of promiſe, of the threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the powers of Sathan, I
ſhall ſin if I doe, I ſhall offend
God: It is written, thou ſhalt
not kill; if not an enemy, then
not a friend, if not a friend, then
much leſſe my ſelfe. Love to
mine enemy, is the reaſon, why
I muſt not murther him; love
doth begin at home, and it runs
warmeſt in mine owne veines,
in mine owne boſome, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will not lay hands on my
ſelfe, I ſhall dye the death if I
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19840:191"/>
doe. The word and prayer will
fright him away; ſin and Satan
care for nothing, feare nothing
but the word: they are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
and the power of <hi>God,</hi>
and by his might, do extinguiſh
all the fiery darts of the divell.
6. Never thinke of making any
mends or ſatisfaction, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
ones ſelfe for any ſin:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16</note>
perhaps <hi>Iudas</hi> thought by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
himſelfe to make ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for his horrible murther
committed againſt the perſon
and life of Chriſt Ieſus: Satan
never doth a man more hurt,
than when hee comes preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſets upon us with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends; that becauſe we have
done this or that grand offence
and abuſe to God; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are to pacifie him or
to ſatisfie him, by ſacrifiſing of
our ſelves. This corrupt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
growes in our fleſh, as we
ſee by thoſe, who fetch their
penniworth as they thinke out
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:19840:191"/>
of themſelves, by whipping
themſelves:<note place="margin">1 King. 18 28.</note> a mad part it is for
a man to thinke that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
murther, the greateſt
of all murthers upon himſelfe,
to make any an ends for their
ſinfull life; and yet ſo fooliſh
doth the divell make ſom men.
Beware of this deceit, fire is
not put out with fire; no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
can poſſibly bee made
but by the bloud of the Lambe,
that holy Lambe Chriſt Ieſus:
and I would have men beware
how they plead for ſuch as
draw their owne bloud, becauſe
thereby they doe make way for
Satan, to puſh hard on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of weake Chriſtians,
by bearing them in hand, that
they may eaſe themſelves of
ſome preſent horrors by killing
themſelves, and yet be ſaved in
heaven for all that: ſuch caſes
perhaps may poſſibly be; but
for man to pleade for ſuch, to
exempt them out of the rule,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19840:192"/>
may make foule worke for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
to play upon the weakneſſe
of many poore Chriſtians ſouls
I know no medicine (next to
the Word and prayer) of better
uſe to hold ſuch mens hands
from their own lives, than feare
of being damned in hell: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
plea it is, for any to ſpeak
for ſuch, and full of danger;<note place="margin">Givitas eum qui ſe ipſum necaverit mulctat. &amp;c.</note>
ſome think thereby to eaſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
conſciences, but it is the
ready way to perplex the
hearts,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Eth. l. 5. c. 11.</note> and engulſie the ſoules
of feeble Chriſtians; they doe
not know, what hurt they doe
to men, under this tentation to
vent ſuch unſavory Doctrine;
that a man do well for the main,
for all this, that this may bee a
way to heaven. As I love not,
ſo I meane not to judge; the
way of charity,<note place="margin">Inter pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem miſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> is to leave <hi>Gods</hi>
ſecrets to himſelfe; but I urge
this, that men would hold their
tongues and pens as much as
may be, leaſt in thinking to doe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:19840:192"/>
good, they doe hurt; and by
going thus about the buſh, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thereby to eaſe the hearts
of men, doe mightily plague
and diſquiet them: for what
will Satan ſay, diſpatch man,
thou maiſt be ſaved for all this;
ſuch a learned man hath ſo
written, hath ſo ſaid. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wee muſt all worke it out
with feare and trembling, and
know that wee have no ſafety,
no not from our ſelves; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhadow of the Lord,
wee are alwayes to ſtand as in
his hands, and keepe our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
acquaintance with, and
dependance on God; know
that without him, we are poore
weake creatures, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beare our ſelves; that the
greateſt earthly bleſſing under
heaven, (life it ſelfe) is quickly
made a mans greateſt burthen:
that no man can ſtand before a
wounded conſcience, before an
Angell we may ſtand, but wee
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:19840:193"/>
cannot ſtand before him when
he is angry; that man hath no
ſpirit, no courage in him, if
God leave him to himſelfe:
keepe in with God and pray
him to defend us from our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>The laſt, is the luſt of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which doe preſſe upon
the conſcience as much, if not
more than any, becauſe they are
very ſenſuall and of a beaſtiall

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:19840:194"/>
becauſe when we are in

of guilt they carry with them,
in that they flie in the face of
both ſpirituall and naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
at once: they bring men
to great terrors and inward
horrors making men beleeve
that there is no hope of ſuch,
and from thence, men run upon
the rocks of ſelfe-murthering
tentations; and more, I think,
have made themſelves away
out of inward feares ariſing
from ſome uncleane prankes,
than for any one thing elſe: and
the cauſe hereof, is becauſe that
theſe luſts bring great ſhame

as wee ſee in thoſe actions of
this nature where they are
without ſin, yet there is a kind
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19840:195"/>
of naturall ſhame. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

counſell to all, to beware of the
luſts of uncleanneſſe; the ſin is
great, the conſequence greater.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it too; that we doe grow
into troubles of minde for ſin,
according as we do apprehend
them in the greatneſſe of them;
and we doe conceive much of
the greatneſſe of ſin, according
as the opinion and judgement
of the world goes. Theſe are
not in our apprehenſion; ever
the greateſt ſinnes, which the
world ſaith are: but which are
moſt out of requeſt with the
world. Now this luſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
is a great eye-ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men; it is ſo rated at by
many men, as though God had
made but onely the ſeventh
Commandement; whereas co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
and pride far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſinnes in themſelves (take
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:19840:196"/>
them preciſely,) are not ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
amongſt men, no nor
amongſt common Chriſtians.
A man may goe for a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
and yet be extreame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
as we ſee in <hi>Iudas:</hi> but
if he be a man given to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it is a ſin ſo out of all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that a man knowne to be
infected with it, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men in their opinion
goe for a profeſſor, as ſome
tearme themſelves; and now
becauſe the world doth hoote
at this ſin, wee are apt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind
exceedingly in our conſciences;
when we are overtaken in this
uncleane paſſion; and to grow
towards a bloudy concluſion, as
though the ſinne had in it that
greatneſſe, that there were now
no hope of us. And this may
well go for another uſefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
to move us by all
meanes to keepe from the luſt
of uncleanneſſe.<note place="margin">Pro. 5. 11. 7. 26. 31. 3</note> And laſtly, the
ſinne many times weakens the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19840:196"/>
body, and pines away that, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
ones ſemes, ſhortens ones
life, and then comes in a huge
cry, that wee have rotted away
our life: are guilty of haſtning
our own death, and much adoe
there is to quiet the ſtorme
which comes in this way:
<hi>Wherfore for this cauſe alſo abſtain

the diſhonour and blot of this

there is a degree of uncleannes
in this ſin, over there is in any
elſe; which fouleneſſe, the
heart of man doth riſe againſt:
and this cannot but touch us
with ſome degrees of terrour
alſo; and that this ſinne doth
carry ſome ſpeciall ſtaine of
diſhonour with it,<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 33.</note> read it in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon.
A wound &amp; diſhonour ſhall

cals chaſtity a mans honour?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 3.</note> Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe grounds and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
it was that Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11</note> 
               <hi>That fleſhly luſts doe warre
againſt the ſoule.</hi> Theſe are the
devils Captaines, and doe (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to kill us) ſmite at the
head, war againſt the ſoule: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
luſts doe war againſt the
ſoule too; but there is ſome
ſpeciall matter in it, that theſe
fleſhly luſts are ſaid to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſoule: ſhall I ſay, that
it is, becauſe that the other luſts
doe warre as much againſt the
graces of the ſoule: yet there is
not any that doe war more, no,
nor in ſome reſpects ſo much
againſt the peace of the ſoule;
and therefore in <hi>Peters</hi> words
we are to be beſeeched (of all
luſts) to abſtaine from fleſhly
luſts.</p>
            <p>Wee will now enter into a
particular diſcovery of ſuch
ſpeciall branches as may make
the matter the plainer. Luſt of

ſelfe-murther is worſe than the

of it ſelfe, this ſin is worſe than
of another. For the rule is, that
the ſin that doth breake the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
of love, is the worſt, love
being the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:<note place="margin">So Paul, 1 Cor. 6. 18.</note>
I muſt not defile

a foule ſinne much againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore the worſe,
for the more unnaturall the ſin
is, the greater the guilt is ſtill
in that reſpect: and whereas it
is thought that there is not that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:19840:198"/>

urge, that there is moſt wrong

doe rot and weaken

nature; ſay, let the worſt come
that can, for outward things, it
is better to beg than burne in

and if they, then why not ſome

that they were ſo before their

that there is no one ſinne that a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19840:204"/>
man may commit before his
calling; but ſhould God leave
that man to himſelfe, to his luſt,
to Satan, he might, and would,
and ſhould, commit the ſame
ſin after: neither lies there any
reaſon, why on our repentance,
a ſin done before is pardoned;
and the ſame ſin if wee repent
after, muſt ſtand unpardonable:
or that a man may repent, of a
ſin done before ones converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not repent of the ſame
ſin after: adde but this, that
the ſin committed before, is in
it ſelfe greater, than the ſame
ſin committed after; for before
it is done with a full ſwing, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that perhaps, the law of
nature and in-bred modeſty,
doth at the firſt make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coile;
but after calling, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome ſeeds at leaſt of grace
in the wil, there is ſome inward
oppoſition made; it is not done
without ſome ſaying,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23</note> nay, in
the law of their minde, and ſo
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:19840:205"/>
the ſin is the leſſer. Now if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
could doe it at firſt,
when the ſin was greater; can
wee queſtion, whether repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
doth fetch it off, when the

no healing, no not of

repent, all our Divinity lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that ſuch ſhall bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and that God hath not
peremptorily bound himſelfe,
to deny repentance unto life to
any ſinner, except the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
againſt the Holy Ghoſt; is
point agreed on, in our Schooles

are in this foule fault doe finde,
that it workes a ſtupifying, that
it ſeares, takes away, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
power of diſcerning
things, that are not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
deadens our taſt; if ſuch
finde that their inward touch-ſtone
hath now loſt its vertue,
the danger is a great deale the
greater; becauſe ſuch having
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:19840:205"/>
little or no feeling of their eſtate
are not as yet in the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:

then there is the more
hope, that true humiliation and

a faculty in them, which will
worke out of their feares a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

ſight of the promiſes, they
conceive hope of mercy, they
are in a faire way to repent of
their wickedneſſe: and that
God who hath made tender of
his mercy to worſe than Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 10.</note>

to doe ſo no more, for the time

            <p>And here I will leave this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
argument, wiſhing
all who meane not (ſay they do
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:19840:206"/>
ſcape hell) to carry the ſmoke
of this ſinne to their graves, to
flye from it. Now becauſe I
ſaid, that when in committing
a ſinne the conſcience is againſt
it, the ſin is the leſſe; I will not
conceale, what a late Divine
ſaith; that the ſin is the greater
when it is done, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth ſay no: for ſaith
he, if this were any ſigne of a
mans having grace, that in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſin, he feeles a moving
within, againſt thoſe ſinnes he
doth doe: it would follow, that
great ſinners, aye, all ſinners
might perſwade themſelves,
that their eſtate were good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is a con-flicting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vices, out of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of natures light; which
are in the breſts more or leſſe of
all men living; that in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
man, ſins againſt the
naturall conſcience are the
worſe even in that reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he doth them againſt his
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:19840:206"/>
conſcience is moſt true: We muſt then
ſay, that when the ſin is done againſt
the voice of the conſcience, ſometimes
it makes the ſinne the leſſe, ſometimes
the worſe: If we, take part with the
ſinne againſt the conſcience, are angry
that our conſcience would not let us
take that fill of Delight, and content in
committing the ſinne, and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that conſcience ſhould ſay any
thing unto us when we have done, here
the ſin is much the worſe, becauſe it
was done againſt conſcience:<note place="margin">Iſay 30. 21</note> but now
if we take part with the voice within,
and are heartily ſorry that the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and our paſſion meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doe beare downe the power of
our conſcience, and doe what wee
can, to take part with the reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Vnderſtand all this of a conſcience ſanctified.</note>
while it, is a doing; and when
it is done, nothing in the world trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
us ſo much, as that wee did not
give way to the act of conſcience,
and keepe from the ſinne; and doe
joyne with our conſcience againſt our

into the power of grace and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

when wee take part with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

the ſinne the leſſer, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

bound up &amp; not healed, ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
worſe than if it were open:
which made the Apoſtle to call
that Doctrine (which forbids

the Doctrine of devils; ſith it
puts a man upon a neceſſity of

All that is ſaid is, that theſe
widdowes may mend it &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
if they will; but it is hard for
women to turne themſelves out
of houſe and all, rather than ſin:
and if they have nothing, who
will have them as things goe
now. Indeed amongſt the
Iewes, where they gave money
for their wives, this exception
would bee of ſome force; but
now amongſt us, where mony
makes the match, they may ſit
and fry long enough, ere any
will make ſuite unto them to
marry them, when they muſt on
their mariage bee outed of all.
What ever they thinke they
may bee able to doe while the
husband is alive; yet when the
man is dead, the widdow is in
danger to ſing another ſong:
we care not much for that wee
may and muſt have, but when it
is denied us, and wee are tied
from it; then as in the Goſpell,
they told it abroad the rather,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:19840:211"/>
becauſe Chriſt bid them tell no
body; ſo the paſſions of women
will rage the more, becauſe
now they muſt not marry; and
a young widdow will bee leſſe
able to containe and bee chaſt
then when ſhee was a Virgin.
They urge that it is covenient,
they ſo remaine, to bring up
their children; but a curſe is
like to follow that condition,
wherein is a needs-muſt ſin, and
all to breed up children: that
eſtate of life is fitteſt for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to live in to breed up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wherein ſhe is moſt free
to ſerve God, and is moſt of all
preſerved from ſin. And we ſee
widdowes that have children
and ſtand free, will tell you that
they marry, to have one to helpe
them to bring up their children
and the ſons will ſtand in more
awe of their father-inlaw than
of a woman their mother; and
we doe ſee, that men doe uſe to
take as great care for their
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:19840:212"/>
wives former children, as tho
they were their owne: and
when two have a joint care, it
is better than if one only; and
a womans care and power is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the leſſe when ſhe hath one
in commiſſion with her to help
her. A little matter in the taker
wold help al to turn a widdows
eſtate into a life; and it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the ſetter to ſuffer ſuch
as they ſee have or are like to
have need to marry. Pleaſe God
and pleaſe all; I know now and
then, a booty comes in to ſuffer
ſuch to marry; but of all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
ſinne is the worſt,
there lies the miſchiefe. Many
do ſin for want of the medicine,
and he doth beſt, who frees his
manner moſt from ſin; neither
will they live ever the longer,
becauſe they doe marry: the
times of men and women are
defined by the Lord, longer
they cannot live, ſooner they
ſhall not dye: I will not deny,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:19840:212"/>
but want this way, may and
doth in ſome bodies breed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
as both Phyſitians and
Philoſophers teaco: but I hope
no man hath this in his head, to
bar widdowes from their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
liberty to marry when
they will in the Lord, a purpoſe
to kill them up with diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or to caſt them into any
diſeaſes. I would I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
men to conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and make their caſe their
owne; and then ſay, whether
ſetting aſide all opinion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and ſupererogation, the caſe
of a Nun bee not eaſier, who is
cloiſtered up from having to be
amongſt men, than of a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in a widdowes eſtate:
whoſe life is to be up and down
in the world, and have much
ſociety where men are; and yet
muſt not bee maried, except
ſome one will come and have
her with nothing. Examples
of any that have ſo done are ſo
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:19840:213"/>
rare, that in my experience I
never knew any.</p>
            <p>2. Next when we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our ſelves and ours into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
we muſt ſee to the chiefe
and the principall end, which is
(as the ſtate of man is ſince the
fall) to keep a man chaſt: he that
maks mariage to be the meanes
in his intention to make him
rich, maries in the fleſh, and
not in the Lord, hee cannot
with any face invite the Lord
to the wedding; Mammon, not
the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 11.</note> doth lead the Bride
to Church; the Apoſtle ſaith, it
is not good for a man to touch
a woman, but yet ſaith he, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
fornication: he ſaith not,
to pay debts, to get money, to
make one rich; let every man
have his owne wife:<note place="margin">v. 2.</note> but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
fornication, Matrimony
then was ordained, to make
men and keepe men chaſt, and
not to make men rich. And we
doe finde, that many of thoſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:19840:213"/>
who marry to bee rich,<note place="margin">Si qui im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediti ſunt ex nuptiis. &amp;c. Chryſ. in Hebr. Hom. 7.</note> which
is their end, and have rich wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
too; after mariage, doe
attaine neither their owne end,
nor Gods: marry, and after are
neither rich nor chaſt; and then
they fall upon mariage, with
many heavy complaints and
cries, and that if there bee any

who are afraid to marry, but

the body in making it an

in making it the member
of an harlot, which no other ſin
but the ſin of uncleanneſſe doth
and this will preſſe hard on the
conſcience, when time ſhall

is, that the mariage-bed muſt

here is the difference, that (as I

The chiefe and neceſſary meanes

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:19840:216"/>
it is not the having, but the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

ſtrong Tower, againſt all theſe
baſe and uncleane luſts. To the
Word, there muſt be Prayer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
elſe wee rely too much
on the Phyſick, and it is not like
to doe; and if Phyſicke workes
not right, it makes one worſe;
and ſo here, as we finde none ſo

God muſt then be ſent for;
to bleſſe the phyſick to the ſoule:
other things we know, as eating

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:19840:218"/>
by prayer, prayer is then rather
and more to bee uſed here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the paſſion is ſo ſtrong and
reaſon ſo weake: where reaſon
is in a manner put beſides its
preſent uſe, there I hope prayer
hath greateſt place; eating is to
take away the naturall paſſion of
hunger, and drinke, of thirſt; yet
we are to pray over our meales;
but here the ordinance is to
cure ſin, to worke on the ſoule,
to heale a ſtrong corruption,
which cannot uſually bee done
without the influence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and thence it followes,
that wee have cauſe to pray
more in this caſe, than in eating
and drinking: praying, I ſay,
there ought to bee, ſay by way
of ſuppoſition, that prayer at
meat ſhould take away ones
minde to ones meate, why then
wee would counſell one to pray
for a bleſſing before-hand: ſo
here, to pray will bring in the
bleſſing of God, which is all in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:19840:219"/>
all in ſpirituall medicines, as
this is, being, as I ſaid, to cure
the ſin of the ſoule; prayer will
keepe men that they ſhall not

prayer will make a man keepe
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> from all baſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and abuſive dalliances; it
will make and keepe the bed
undefiled, and encreaſe love and
mutuall affection. Love hath a
ſure foundation, when it is built
not on beauty or wealth, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prayer and grace. Satan can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to ſee men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

wiſh then old people to keepe

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:19840:223"/>
on their age: yea, ſay that a man
hath paſſed over his youth, with
ſome freedome this way, and
it may be, hath not felt himſelfe

he were beſt ſee that he hang not

               </gap>his? Like enough, becauſe men
being young feare themſelves,
when old, they thinke the worſt
is paſt, truſt too much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the body, lye not in
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:19840:223"/>
their armour, have not their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
ready, and then Satan is too
hard for them. 2. When old,
then men are ſubject to much
ſpirituall pride, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
becauſe they ſtood ſo free
from this ſinne, as though they
had beene ſomewhat in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and now to cure that
ſpirituall ſickneſſe, this baſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is ſuffered to moleſt
them. 3. If they had beene thus
ſet upon, when hot and young
and full of ſap, with ſuch ſtrong
motions this way, like enough
they ſhould and would have
ſunke and yeelded: and GOD
will have ſuch know by their
owne feeling, what theſe luſts
meane; wherefore that they
may not receive that hurt by the
temptation and impulſion, they
have their hands full of them
when old and cold, who did
ſcape them, when greene and
young. However, I wiſh both
young and old, by all meanes to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:19840:224"/>
beware of this Snake.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether they be, or
bee not given to this ſinne, yet
care muſt be uſed, to be as much
as we can out of the way, when
the tentation doth come; ſuch
as are much given to this ſinne
have cauſe to looke round about
them, becauſe Satan hath ſuch a
potent friend in their boſome,
hee holds a ſide and a faction in
the hearts of ſuch. This ſinne is
a ſinne which is much drawne
out by the temper of the bodie,
it holds more of the body than
any; as we ſee it ſhewes not it
ſelfe, till the body comes to ſuch
an age: it may rather than any
be called a bodily ſinne; if then
wee finde that by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and graine of the body, as
alſo by ſiniſter education, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the minde and heart
runne much or more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
this way: ſuch muſt be at it
day and night, to keepe the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
away all they can; to keep
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:19840:224"/>
themſelves away, not to bee
within (as it were) when Satan
comes, to call in for all the
helpe they can, to put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Gods hands, to weaken
the corruption, to breake the
blow of the tentation, or elſe
mightily to ſtrengthen us; as
knowing that ſuch walke in the
midſt of dangers, and by care
and feare and other meanes, it
is brought to paſſe, that ſuch as
have moſt inclination to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
prove the chaſteſt of
all. That is not properly chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when a man hath no minde
at all, but frigidity.</p>
            <p>If but a little by reaſon of his
temper, he may thanke his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but when a man feeles ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
luſts, and yet by reſiſting,
by chaſtiſing his body, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
faſting, by following God
in the uſe of his remedies, by
begging chaſtity from heaven,
gets power and ſtrength that
is the chaſt man. There is no
luſt ſo hotte and violent, but
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:19840:225"/>
Gods medicines being rightly
applied will coole and heale.
And now, for ſuch as are not
very violent that way, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of education, being ever
kept under the wing, or of
complexion, or becauſe as yet
by the providence of God have
not beene much tempted; ſuch
are apt to fall, becauſe they
doe not ſuſpect themſelves, care
not to goe armed becauſe they
dreame of little or no danger:
now here Satan hath great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
for bee the inclination
this way with the leaſt; yet if
wee beare our ſelves bold, and
Satan bee let to have his way, he
will make a mountaine of a
mole-hill, and bring men to a
miſerable paſſe with ſcalding
affections, let him (the Devill)
have leave to blow the fire, and
then (in reſpect of this ſin) the
moſt naturally chaſt men in the
world, ſhall have cauſe enough
to crie out, O wretched man
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:19840:225"/>
that I am. Such then as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no
great matter this way, muſt yet
be wiſe, and keepe watch and
ward, not thruſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Devils dangers, leaſt they
ſmart for it.</p>
            <p>4 Both old and young, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and married, more or leſſe
addicted to theſe paſſions. All
I ſay, all are to ſee that they take
theſe caveats.</p>
            <p>1 Religious people muſt
take heed one of another. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
when they meet thinke no
hurt when they come nigh one
another, but are the worſe one
for another ere they part: it is
no hard matter for Sathan to
turne religious affections into
carnall: we ſee in the Elements
that are Symbolicall and agree
in one quality the tranſmutation
is eaſie, as of water into aire,
becauſe both agree in moiſture,
ſo here becauſe ſome men and
ſome women beare a deere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and love one to another;
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:19840:226"/>
there lyes danger, leſt Satan
cauſe it to degenerate into fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
luſt. This caveat is in <hi>Paul,
Rebuke the younger women as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
with all purity, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 2.
So that a mortified <hi>Timothy</hi> had
need ſee to it, that when hee is
to rebuke young godly women,
he doe it, not with ſome onely,
but with all purity and chaſtity,
for feare of the worſt. 2. Care
muſt be had of ſuch as are our
kindred in the fleſh; the ſin is
inceſt, and being great: our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
ſin, when once the vaile
of modeſtie is downe, and the
wall that nature makes broken,
then, I ſay, our corrupt fleſh
growes even mad after this ſin,
as in <hi>Amnon</hi> with <hi>Thamar.</hi> The
change is eaſie, from naturall
love to carnall. Againe, ſuch as
are neere in bloud, thinke they
may make bold one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and many times feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
till they are caught, ere
they once dreame of it; and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:19840:226"/>
then the world takes no notice
to ſee men and women who are
of alliance (any thing neere) to
toy and ſport one with another,
to bee together and alone too,
which proves but a cloake for
moſt abhominable inceſt: I
could therefore deſire ſuch to
ſee to themſelvs, and beware of
the leaſt motions and occaſions
of this foule vice. The like for
affinity, I propoſe it to men, not
to come to neere the daughters
of their wives by a former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
nor the ſiſters of their
wives, nor women to be too
bold with the ſons of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
by a former wife, nor
with the brothers of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
leaſt too much of the
affection hee beares to his wife
fals on his wives ſiſter. Satan
can turne hands here ere wee
thinke of it, and make carnall
luſt out of that love, which we
beare to our wives kindred. Ad
but this, that the daughter or
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:19840:227"/>
ſiſter of the wife carries many
times the proportion of the
wife, and out of that, the divell
can ſuck much poyſon; to draw
the man to dote on the ſiſter or
daughter of his wife; as on his
wives picture, till it goe ſo far
that all is too little for the ſiſter,
nothing but bitterneſſe left for
the wife; and what tentations
of uxoricide and the like, Satan
can deſtill out of theſe baſe and
monſtrous births, I leave it to
others to judge.</p>
            <p>3. Great heed is to be taken
of ſuch as are under our power,
as of man-ſervants and maid-ſervants,
and the rather if they
be comely, they are in our way
every day, come neere our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and Satan uſeth to tempt
on both ſides the hedge if hee
can. See this in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Miſtris,
hee was a ſervant in the houſe,
gave her no occaſion, onely ſhe
let her eyes fix on his perſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 6.</note> he
being a very proper young man
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:19840:227"/>
and a little and a little, ſhe was
overtaken and went ſo far, that
no bonds of modeſty could
hold her in; and when <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
had got off from her, the Text
ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 10w</note> 
               <hi>he came no more where ſhee
was.</hi> The occaſion muſt be put a
way in al theſe tentations what
ever we doe. Many think they
muſt get the conqueſt, and yet
keepe the occaſions by them
ſtill: No, <hi>Ioſephs</hi> miſtris was to
put away <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> had he beene a
better man, a better ſervant than
he was: Satan coozens us out
of all cry in this, when he beares
us in hand that it is no conqueſt
except we do beat away the ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation,
and yet keep the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by us:<note place="margin">To venture on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhewes there is in the heart an implicite conſent to the ſin, tho for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we ſeem to feele the contrary.</note> for he knowes that
ordinarily, we neither can nor
ſhall get the victory, except we
do put away the occaſions from
us, when it is ſuch a thing, or
ſuch a perſon, as may lawfully
be removed: God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the tentation, except we
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:19840:228"/>
doe remove the occaſion; to
pray that it may away, and yet
keepe <hi>(Ioſeph)</hi> with us, is all
one, as though we ſhould hold
our finger in the fire, and pray
to God it ſhould not burne. It
is not enough to ſay, that the
fault is not in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> hee doth
not entice; for if Satan and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
entice the miſtris to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
by the eye, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> muſt bee
put out of ſight, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> if
poſſibly and lawfully hee may,
muſt remove himſelfe too, elſe
in ordinary courſe the cure will
not be done; and when we have
another, and the fire take there
too, that perſon muſt bee done
away alſo, and ſo on till at laſt
the conflict will ceaſe, and the
victory will come: it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
when once caught, to
turne the eye away: but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the eye muſt bee out of
ſight, that it may be out of mind
and then when another comes,
be before hand, prevent the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:19840:228"/>
of Sathan by keeping the
eye off. <hi>Iob</hi> as honeſt and as chaſt
a man as lived, yet <hi>he did make a
covenant with his eyes, that hee
would not thinke on a maid;</hi> by
the courſe of the letter he ſhold

with his eyes, that hee ſhould
not looke on a maid;</hi> but in ſtead
of ſaying <hi>looke,</hi> hee ſaith <hi>thinke,</hi>
becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ooking uſually brings
thinking,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 1.</note> and thinking, worſe.
A maid hath an inclination in it
in one ſenſe, and a cut loafe a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
cup carries ſtrong poyſon
in it in another ſenſe; whether
maid or maried, hee doth beſt
who binds his eyes from ſuch
looking, that he be not overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and when the fire is once
in, he doth next beſt, who puts
the object out of ſight and out
of mind. Some cry out on their
eyes, and doth even wiſh their
eyes out, and in this ſenſe they
may as well wiſh their hands
off, their feet off, their eares off,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:19840:229"/>
and member after member til al
were off, this is but to complain
of <hi>God</hi> who made us theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and ſenſes: this is not the
way, it doth not pleaſe God, and
were it as we wiſh, it would not
pleaſe us; for were we blinde,
all would bee one as long as the
fire is unquenched within, and
our paſſions are ſuffered to bee
up. Wee know what Chriſt
ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt
take them out of this world, but
that thou wouldſt ſanctifie them
through thy truth:</hi> ſo we are not
to wiſh our eyes out, but our ſin
out; and to pray him to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our hearts and eyes by his
truth; and then away out of
doores with that which wee
(being led by our luſt) have
made the object and occaſion,
and it will mend and grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It is true, that if the object
be removed, the tentation for
the time may ceaſe, and no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
as keepe a Sow from
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:19840:229"/>
mire in a Meddow, and the Sow
wallowes not, take away the
Load-ſtone, and the Iron moves
not: here is no reall change, the
intention of the minde is not
changed, nor the affection of
the heart neither. Such have a
minde and a deſire to the old
luſt ſtill; but if a man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the occaſion of his owne
proper motion, not another take
it away, but hee himſelfe put it
away; not be kept from it, but
keepe ones ſelfe of ones owne
will from it; this is from grace
and here is a victory.</p>
            <p>Vſe theſe and the like means
and hold on for a competent
time in uſing of them, and wee
ſhal conquer, the tentation muſt
and will away: Diſ-may not,
though the conqueſt come not
preſently: what? Give over
becauſe the phyſick doth not
heale at once taking? Be out of
heart becauſe all is not done in
a day? It is not ſo eaſie to untie
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:19840:230"/>
a knot in a ſilken thread; the
conſcience is of a fine ſpinning,
and knots knit there, and ſuch
as have bin long a knitting too,
will not bee undone on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
have patience, give it time
and now ſome and then ſome,
Gods medicines will heale; and
when wee finde the cure done,
and wee get ſome ſtrength of
grace, by all meanes remember
to be thankefull, leſt the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
come againe, and bring ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
worſe than its ſelfe. But
what if the eaſe I finde, be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe ſin and Satan in skill
doe ceaſe to tempt: if ſo, then
our danger remaines, we keepe
our weapon about us, wee may
know, if it be onely a ceaſing to
tempt, and the luſt is onely for
a time aſleepe. Firſt, if it bee
done without uſing GODS
meanes in Gods feare. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if we finde that the luſt is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left not hated, but if the ſinne
be hated, then it is more than
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:19840:230"/>
a bare ceaſing from the ſinne: for
Satan forbearing; and ſinne ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
cannot bring us to an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of the ſinne: I ſpeake not
onely of a diſapproving of the
ſin, for ſo a civill man may doe;
and becauſe it did moleſt us, we
may thence be brought to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of it; but if wee finde that
we can hate it, this proves that
there is grace in us, a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is contrary to that
luſt: and that chaſtity is now in
the place of the tentation, and
this cannot come onely from
Satans ceaſing and forbearing.
To ceaſe is but a negative thing,
but chaſtitie is a poſitive quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
which meere negative cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and giving over to ſolicite
and tempt, can never worke in
us. Thus when our chaſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are had out of the fire, and
we have attained this power by
ſpirituall meanes uſed, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon God for the ſucceſſe.
Diſpute nor, ſay, I have gotten
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:19840:231"/>
the victory, and the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hath eaſed mee of the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
given mee a chaſt minde
to my content and my comfort:
with body and ſoule both, wee
muſt exceedingly rejoyce in
this vertue.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 4.</note> It is a grace which
doth not onely ſanctifie, but
grace and beautifie us: all the

ſuch a ſhining verniſh on the

doth.</p>
            <p>Thus much to ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
way, how to prevent the
tentation of luſt and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The laſt of all, is in a word
to helpe us out, in caſe wee doe
goe too far, we muſt take heed
of both the extreames. 1. That
we doe not run upon the Rocks
of Deſpaire; there is nothing
got by diſcouragement, during
the time of huge and mightie
terrors: it may bee wee ſhall
have no minde nor heart to
tamper with thoſe luſts againe,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:19840:231"/>
but yet for other ſinnes, every
way worſe, worſe to God, and
worſe to us; we lye all open to
them, when we are in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
as Diſcontent, Diſtruſt,
a ſecret riſing againſt God, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe,
A finding fault
with all that God either ſaith
or doth, No care of the Word,
to reckon no other of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than of our very Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and a world of miſchiefes
more, which are the greateſt
ſinnes: indeed in theſe occaſions
wee are very apt to fall off from
Gods mercie, to frie in helliſh
ſorrow: no ſins doe ſo fire the
conſcience of a man, as theſe
luſts of uncleanneſſe doe; they
ſtare in our faces, looke upon
our conſciences, as it were,
with the eyes of ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:
and in this reſpect wee
muſt take great heed that wee
be not quite out of heart; when

great danger is at hand;
and therefore when frights doe
come, and ſuch doe finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too to apt to joyne with
the motion to deſpaire; looke
upon Gods love, beare up in an
apprehenſion and application
of his mercie. Looke upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in the Word, of better
men than wee are, who in the
ſame or the like have ſeene a
good end of all, and are now
with the Lord. 2. The other
extreame is to grow ſenſeleſſe,
to be paſt feeling; wee are apt
in theſe caſes to feele too much
or too little; for if our terrours
overcome us, wee deſpaire, if
wee overcome them by faith,
wee take comfort, if wee put
them off by the fleſh; we grow
ſecure, and it is common out of
great feares to runne into great
want of feeling, and ſo we finde
it in the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> that laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
breeds in us a ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:19840:232"/>
it feares up the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ſuch come to be paſt
feeling. To open this, there is
a partiall want of feeling, when
wee commit ſinnes and aile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in ſome particulars. Thus
wee finde that otherwiſe good
people, breake out into exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in buying and ſelling, doe
they care not what in matters
of profit and feele nothing; the
conſcience ſees all, ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or as good as nothing:
one would wonder how men
can ſell day, (I ſpeake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
giving day, but ſelling of
it,) let out their money to uſe,
hoard up corne, directly againſt
the Word of God in the very
letter,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 36</note> make up ſome peeces of
workes on the Lords day, are
told of it in the miniſtry, and
yet nothing come of it; why?
Becauſe cuſtome in them and
in others hath taken away their
feeling: covetouſneſſe hath
made them in moſt matters of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:19840:233"/>
commodity to bee paſt feeling,
yet this is but partiall; we meane
not to ſay that thoſe allow thoſe
ſins, for the point is, that though
the Word be plaine, yet cuſtome
doth ſo dazle their eyes, that
they cannot in the particulars
ſee the right: ſo <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
did multiply wives againſt
that Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 17. The like
did the Patriarches for Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
And the beleeving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſaw not ſingle fornication
to be more than a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<hi>Act. 15. 20. 21, 25. Rev. 2.
15.</hi> 20. Yet this fornication is
forbidden in the Word. So
great is the force of cuſtome:
But ſhould theſe men meddle
halfe ſo much in forbidden luſts
of uncleanneſſe: oh what pangs
riſe in their conſcience, they
feele it with a witneſſe: But
now the paſſions of laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when once men have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thorow the terrours of it,
which uſually come firſt; then
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19840:233"/>
they bring a man to a total ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe
to be paſt feeling, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in theſe and the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but in all univerſally to
make conſcience of nothing, to
commit any ſinnes that comes
to hand with all greedineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
any thing, like ſome ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes,
and be never troubled
with it: it is ſo ſenſuall a ſinne
and gives ſuch a blow to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
conſcience too, that like a
ſound knocke on the head, it
takes away all ſenſe and feeling;
let Satan propoſe what he will,
nothing comes amiſſe; for this
ſinne of uncleanneſſe fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
both light of nature and
grace, and if the naturall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſpeake and wee will not
heare, and the ſpirituall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
crie, and we will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
the conſcience will grow
ſpeechleſſe, and ſpeake no more:
and hence it is that ſuch as come
to a cuſtome in ſome covetous
practiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are paſt feeling in
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:19840:234"/>
ſome things for ſome time, but
ſuch as come to a cuſtome in the
luſt of uncleanneſſe are ſoone
made to be paſt feeling ſimply
and totally, ſcruple at nothing
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Sith then the danger is as
great as a ſeared conſcience
comes to, ſuch as have broken
the peace with God, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
and make all haſte to<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 21.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
the crie is ſo great
and the ſight of it is ſo odious,
and the ſenſe of it is ſo grievous
at firſt, and ſo palpable, that we
may with the more eaſe come
to repent. It is a ſinne that doth
convince it ſelfe to bee a ſinne,
(till a man hath loſt his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and his ſpirituall taſte,)
while it is a doing, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cries ſhame, and there is
little to doe, becauſe our worke
lyes in a manner onely with our
affection, whereas many paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of anger, and pride, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
are ſuch, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19840:234"/>
is long ere hee can bee
brought to ſee the thing to be
a ſin, the fact to be a fault. But
in pollutions of uncleanneſſe
they are ſo direct againſt the
principles of reaſon, and ſo flat
againſt al ſhew of Religion, that
they carry their conviction in
their mouthes, which makes
the heart the more ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
the work of repentance
unto life. <hi>Iudah</hi> repented, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
repented, <hi>Lot</hi> repented, and
ſo did <hi>Thamar,</hi> and ſo did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and they were taken into
ſpeciall favour and honour, as
we ſee them upon record in the
firſt of <hi>Matthew.</hi> Thoſe ſinnes
which much humble, doe much
honour; none humble more
than ſuch baſe luſts: <hi>David</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in honour, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
is in great honourin the Church
of God; Chriſt to comfort and
honour her,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 9.</note> appeared firſt and
foremoſt to her, what ever
heales the ſoule heales the name.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:19840:235"/>
repentance doth both. The
truth of our repentance wil beſt
appeare; if wee goe away as
<hi>Iudah</hi> did and doe ſo no more,<note place="margin">Gen. 38. 26</note>
come not neere the garment
ſpotted with the fleſh;<note place="margin">Iud. v. 13</note> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of another nature are more
apt to bring a relapſe than theſe
paſſions, they leave ſuch a ſting
and ſent behind them, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(but with a ſmart,) have
ſuch a taſt, and are ſuch a baſe
ſight that few relapſe; ſuch as
are by Gods mercy cured of
theſe diſeaſes, are commonly
ever after very chaſt, Become
as children in all purity and
chaſtity: when wee fetch out
a great ſtaine, the cloth is after
whiter than ordinary, and ſo
after this ſtaining ſin is waſhed
away: ſuch muſt be very holy,
paſſing chaſt; beware of the
leaſt ſparke of ſin: this is the
meaning of that of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptiſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Bring forth fruits meet
or worthy of repentance:</hi> how
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:19840:235"/>
worthy of repentance? It is
that when a man hath beene at
it in the worke of repentance;
his workes and deeds muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be better than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
hee muſt looke like a true
penitent,<note place="margin">Opus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perf. in c. 3. Mat. Hom. 3.</note> that as a Phyſitian can
judge by the colour of the face
that his patient is recovered, ſo
muſt our workes ſhine and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuch a luſtre and colour with
them, that one of skill may read
it as written in our faces, that
there is amendment of life, that
now all is well and ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>And ſay by intemperate
courſes, one have bin the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of haſtning our owne end
before the time. I grant that
there is juſt cauſe (as <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſpeakes) to mourne at the laſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 5.</note>
when the fleſh and the body
are conſumed, and we are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
guilty of haſtening
our owne death, before the
time of Natures Period, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:19840:236"/>
before the time of Gods
councell: mourne here &amp; ſpare
not, but yet not as men without
hope, repentance will mend
this alſo. Firſt, hardly one man
in a thouſand, but one way or
other, more or leſſe, cuts off
ſome of his dayes. Had it not
bin for one thing or other, hee
might have lived a day, a yeere
longer; as I thinke is plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in <hi>David,</hi> who was bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
at or about the age his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
begat him; either nature
would have laſted, or might
have laſted longer in almoſt all,
were it not for ſome defect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
or default in our ſelves:
and therefore this accuſation
lies againſt almoſt all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this is beſides a mans inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to give his yeeres to the
cruell.<note place="margin">Pro. 5. 9.</note> The <hi>Libidinous</hi> intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to ſatisfie this ſin in the

withall a waſte of the radicall
moyſture, and thereby a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:19840:236"/>
off of his dayes; this is by
accident only, and a conſequent
of the thing done, not a thing
meant by the door. Thirdly,
ſith repentance heales the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
intended by the offender,
it is againſt Religion &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
both, to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will heale the

and evill dealings; (beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The laſt thing is, that Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

take a vomit and up comes all:
We uſe to Saint the man, who
doth but give over this golden
trade of uſury, but the truth is,
that ſuch come but halfe way:
our repentance is not thorow,
our ſorrow comes not home, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
(as it is here) we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore.
When we leave the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

leave the ſin (as ſin) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
wee reſtore and turne the
ſtolne dog home againe: when
we have not wherwithall, there
neceſſity hath no law. The
King of heaven muſt and will
loſe &amp; will part with his right,
where nothing is to be had, and
there the will doth ſtand for
the deed; but where there is no
ſuch anſwer (that wee cannot)
but we ſee that we ought, wee
have wherewithall and (will

            <p>Now as this act of reſtitution
ſecures our hearts, ſo that the

manner it makes much for the

ſets a marke upon our goods,
and they are ſafe thereby under

like fellons goods, endanger all;

hee that hath been or is an

as hee meanes good to his
ſoule, as he intends ſafety to his
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:19840:241"/>
eſtate; and it is his happineſſe
that his ſin lies in ſuch a thing,
wherein he may make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and lick the parties wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
whole againe: this makes
the conſcience quiet, helpes us
to peace, when as in murders,
adulteries, in ſuch and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like ſins, where there
is no place left for reſtitution;
an hard matter it is, to ſet ſuch
in comfort, when once the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
fals a complaining: but
here, let the conſcience accuſe
at the worſt, yet as it is a ſinne,
godly ſorrow makes all well,
and as it is a wrong, repaire is
made by reſtoring; repenting
takes up the matter as it is to
God, reſtoring helpes &amp; heales
all, as it is to men. The moſt
that can be ſaid is, that the Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-taker
paies the uſe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and where a man parts with
his money willingly, reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not of force. <hi>Iudas</hi> might
have retained the money, with
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:19840:241"/>
the good content of the Prieſt,
who gave it willingly, yet hee
did reſtore it and was bound to
doe it: and were this good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
then a great deale of that
which comes in by bribery, and
dicery may bee lawfully and
comfortably kept.<note place="margin">If I have received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bribe, I will reſtore it, 1 Sam. 12. 3.</note> Then I
ſay, that though it bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the will of the borrower
that the Vſurer keepe the uſe,
yet it ſhould bee: what if hee
thinke that to take uſe be no ſin
in the Vſurer? What if he bee
not convinced, that the fact of
the Vſurer herein is a fault; in
this caſe, he may be willing, he
ſhould keepe it for want of true
light and ſound judgement:
wheras were he aware of what
is truth, that the Vſurer had no
right to take it, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thinke, that the Vſurer hath
no reaſon to keepe it; and this
kinde of willingneſſe is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative
unwillingnes. And
laſtly, I ſay, that he ſeemes many
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:19840:242"/>
times to be willing, becauſe hee
cannot tell how to helpe it: the
Travellor gives his purſe to the
theefe, becauſe hee cannot doe
otherwiſe, or at leaſt dares not;
and there is a morall neceſſity
which is of force, to cauſe a man
to pay uſe, and to ſhew a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe,
that the Vſurer
ſhould hold it when he hath it,
becauſe of great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
in that he elſe cannot have
money to ſerve his need againſt
another time; this is a mixt act
of willingneſſe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
to be naturally, done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
but willingly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally.
All this is grounded
on the law of God,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Eth. l. 3. c. 1.</note> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes
uſury a ſin, and a ſinne againſt
juſtice too. <hi>Zacheus</hi> did offer
to reſtore that which hee did
fetch in by forged cavillation,
he might like enough have kept
it, and no man have thought
much of it; it was gotten by ſin
and reſtore he would; and what
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:19840:242"/>
the Vſurer takes is his by ſinne,
and reſtore he muſt. The Law,
I know, permitted it to the
Iewes, to the ſtranger, what of
that? It followes the rather
that it is of it ſelfe a ſin, becauſe
permiſſion is of ſins, not of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but the thing I ſay is, there
was a law to kill the <hi>Canaanite,</hi>
and yet I hope, that killing was
not murther; no more was that
uſury to them a ſin. The Law
doth urge it moſt, that it be not
done to the poore: was it not
becauſe the Iewes were then
too noble and generous to goe a
borrowing, except it were the
poorer ſort? What, ſhould the
Law then forbid that to bee
done by rich men, which moſt
rich men never did?<note place="margin">Neither is there any one place giving leave to a Iew, to hire his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out to a rich foe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to (the Stranger.)</note> but after

neceſſity cannot make an others

lawes are in the ſubſtance of
them, the very lawes of nature:
and by the Decalogue, there is
in all caſes of neceſſity ſtill a
propriety of goods; the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Melancthon</hi> is firme.
The eight Commandement is a
naturall law,<note place="margin">Quaeſt. a Paulo Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro propoſ. Georgio Mullero an 1552.</note> it ſtands <hi>Iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino;</hi>

that propriety of things is
not by law poſitive, but by law
Divine and naturall. Moreover
if that community of things
were a law of nature, it had bin
immutable, and al things ſhold
and ought to be common in all
times and caſes. Neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man ſhew, why the eighth
Commandement being a law of
nature, ſhould be ſubject to be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:19840:246"/>

takes but his owne, ſay they. I
am ſorry then, that any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

            </p>
            <p>The onely objection worth

being an hungred, did
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:19840:247"/>

               </gap>rne, and that therefore (they
doing well in it) it is a lawfull
thing to take that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, that this was
not done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on this ground,
becauſe neceſsity tooke away
propriety, but becauſe it was
their owne, they tooke by the
gift of God, who is the right
&amp; chiefe owner of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the World. In <hi>Deut.
23.</hi> 25. God had given them a
warrant ſo to doe in the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that things were
not then made common by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
it is plaine, by the words
which follow in that very text,
<hi>(But thou ſhalt not move a ſickle
unto thy neighbours ſtanding corn;</hi>
which might have been done
without offence to GOD, or
wrong to man; if this were true,
which Ieſuites teach; that in
point of neceſsity, not onely in
reſpect of one perſon, but alſo
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:19840:247"/>
in reſpect of ones condition,
nothing is any mans, but all
things are every mans: for the
caſe may bee, that a man and
his family may be caſt upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
need, that a ſickle put in
his neighbours corne, will not
ſupply the hunger of him and
his, ſo much as the plucking
the eares of corne did ſtay the
ſtomacks and the hunger of the
Diſciples; and yet I think that
it was never held but as a thing
forbidden to the Iewes by that
law, for a man in never ſo great
neceſſity to put his ſickle in his
neighbours corne, and that a
Iew was rather to famiſh than
ſo to doe: which ſhewes the
little truth that is in that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that neceſſity maks things
common amongſt men. The
Diſciples did it, becauſe they
had warrant and leave from
God, who was the owner of
that corne, and the law of God
was on their ſide. And for our
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:19840:248"/>
times, I doubt not but it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for one to pluck an apple,
or to take an eare or ſo, of corne
and eate it, not only for ones ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
need, but for ones delight
and content. The equity of that
judiciall law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith
ſomewhat, but my ground is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a man in ſuch caſes hath
an implicite and tacite conſent;
the owner ſometimes is by
when we pluck plums and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or ſo, and wee never aske
him leave though he looke on,
and in this caſe, hee that ſaith
not no, ſaith yea: and ſay he be
abſent, and we know not who
is the owner neither: yet I
thinke this lawfull, becauſe we
have an interpretative conſent;
wee have a morall perſwaſion,
that were the owner by, hee
would give us leave to pluck
an eare, to catch a peare, with
heart and good will; which
motion being in the heart of
man, doth free him from any
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:19840:248"/>
theft; and alſo wee ſee it a
(common) matter: which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarineſſe
of the thing helpes
to make this good, that there
is in all men a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and leave, vertually given
to all paſſengers; and the like to
pluck an eare, an apple, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
a plum, a peare, or ſo: and
this is warrant enough if it bee
not abuſed, to ſave the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a man harmeleſſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that law of God: Thou
ſhalt not ſteale; here is no ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
becauſe here is a kinde of
conſent of the owner, though
not actuall, yet vertuall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite:
and ſuch a tacite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is enough, whether the
fact be done before the owners
face, or behind his back.</p>
            <p>Againe, if need did make
things ſo far forth common as
might ſatisfie our need; then
where no need is, we ſin if we
pluck a peare or ſo: but wee
may lawfully doe it onely for

delight, ſo alſo were this new
Divinity right: in caſe of need,
wee might ſatisfie our ſoule e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt the conſent of the
owner, he flatly forbidding us;
for in their ſenſe (who thus
teach) wee take but our owne,
all which is falſe; wherefore
we muſt rather ſpeake with the
truth, and ſay, that not only for
need, but for our very delight
in the owners abſence (in caſe
he directly forbid us not) wee
may (I ſay) lawfully pluck an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are of corne or ſo, by vertue of
a common ſuppoſed conſent
(intimated in the equity of
that law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> which in
ſuch caſes doth run thorow the
veines of all mankinde.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I conceive this matter
to bee put paſt al peradventure,
by the very law of God once in
force amongſt the Iewes: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the theefe ſtealing
for very need, to make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the forth and fifth, and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:19840:250"/>
in a caſe to the ſeventh degree;<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 1.</note>
and if,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 126.</note> ſelling all to his very ſhirt
would not make up the ſumme,<note place="margin">Pr. 6. 30, 31. Deodate</note>
then by law hee was to bee
ſold and loſe his liberty,<note place="margin">Annotat. on Pro. 6. 30, 31.</note> to
make reſtitution for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
(not for the over-plus)
of his theft.<note place="margin">Ainſw. on Exod. 22. 3.</note> Now this Law
of God had gone againſt ſenſe:
if need did diſpence with
propriety, and give a right
and title to ſo much of ones
neighbours ſubſtance as would
ſerve to ſatisfie ones want: for
I hope, reaſon it ſelfe is flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, that a man ſhould be
thus bound to make reſtitution
for taking that which (by their
Doctrine) is his owne; Aye,
common underſtanding it ſelfe
at the firſt ſight is againſt it,
that a man, can be ſaid to ſteale
his owne, can ſtand bound by
Gods law, thus to reſtore his
owne: and therefore to returne
home again, I conclude and ſay,
that our main point doth ſtand
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:19840:251"/>
free and firme, <hi>viz.</hi> That albeit
in caſe of need (as of ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans)
a man take uſe, yet hee
is to make reſtitution: ſith uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the law of God &amp; of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
carries a falſe finger:
need is no ſalve, it onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth
<hi>á Tanto,</hi> neither can
the Ieſuits or any elſe
make any ſound
