            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOUR to the READER.</head>
            <p>FRiend, because it is a dangerous thing to be walking towards the place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and anguish: and again, because it is (notwithstanding) the Journey that most of the poor Souls in the World are taking, and that with delight and gladness, as if there was the onely happiness to be found; I have therefore thought it my duty (being made sensible of the danger that will befall those that walk therein) for the preventing of thee, (O thou poor Man or Woman) to tell thee, by opening this Parable, what sad success those Souls have had, and are also like to have, that have been, or shall be, found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing therein.</p>
            <p>We use to count him a friend that will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
<pb facs="tcp:66363:3"/>
 his Neighbour of the danger, when he knoweth thereof, and doth also see, that the way his Neighbour is walking in, doth lead right thereto; especially when we think that our neighbour may be either ignorant, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of his way. Why Friend, it may be, nay twenty to one but thou hast been, ever since thou didst come into the World, with thy back towards Heaven, and thy face towards Hell; and thou, either through ignorance, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness (which is as bad, if not worse) hast been running full hastily that way ever since. Why? I beseech thee put a little stop to thy earnest race, and take a view of what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment thou art like to have, if thou do indeed and in truth persist in this thy course. Thy way <hi>leads down to death, and thy steps take hold on hell,</hi> Prov. 5. 5. It may be the path indeed is pleasant to the flesh, but the end thereof will be bitter to thy Soul. Hark, dost thou not hear the bitter Cryes of them that are but newly gone before? saying, Let him dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, that is so tormented in this flame: <hi>Luke 16.</hi> Dost thou not hear them
<pb facs="tcp:66363:3"/>
say, Send one from the dead to prevent my father, my brother, and my fathers house from coming into this place of torment? Shall not then these mournfull groans pierce thy flinty heart? Wilt thou stop thine ears, and shut thy eyes? and wilt thou not regard? Take warning, and stop thy journey before it be too late. Wilt thou be like the silly flie, that is not quiet, unless she be either intangled in the spiders web, or burned in the Candle? Wilt thou be like the Bird that hasteth to the snare of the Fowler? Wilt thou be like that simple one named in the 7. of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That will be drawn to the slaughter by the cord of a silly lust? O sinner, sinner, there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than Hell to be had, and at a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rate by the thousand part than that! (O there is no comparison) there is Heaven, there is God, there is Christ, there is Communion with an innumerable company of Saints and Angels: Hearthe Message then that God doth send, that Christ doth send, that Saints do bring; nay, that the Dead do send unto thee; <hi>I pray thee therefore that thou wouldst send him to my fathers house, if one went</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66363:4"/>
               <hi>to them from the dead, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. How long ye simple ones, will you love simplicity? and ye scorners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in scorning, and ye fools hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg?

<pb facs="tcp:66363:4"/>
Communion with all happiness, (that is so indeed.)</p>
            <p>But it may be thou wilt say, All that hath been spoken to in this discourse, is but a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and Parables are no realities.</p>
            <p>I could put thee off with this Answer, That though it be a Parable, yet it is a truth, and not a lie, and thou shalt find it so too, to thy cost, if thou shalt be found a slighter of God, Christ, and the salvation of thy own Soul.</p>
            <p>But secondly, know for certain, That the things signified by Parables, are wonderfull realities. O what a glorious reality was there signified by that Parable! <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is like to a net that is cast into the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying, that sinners of all sorts, of all Nations, should be brought into Gods Kingdom, by the net of the Gospel. And O how real a thing shall the other part thereof be, when it's fulfilled! which saith, <hi>And when it was full, they drew it to shore, and put the good into vessels, but threw the bad away,</hi> Matth. 13. 47, 48. signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mansions of glory that the Saints should have, and also the rejection that God
<pb facs="tcp:66363:5"/>
will give to the ungodly, and to sinners. And also that Parable, what a glorious reality is there in it! which saith, <hi>Except a corn of wheat fall to the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it doth bring forth much fruit,</hi> Joh. 12. 24. To signifie, That unless Jesus Christ did indeed spill his blood, and die the cursed death, he should abide alone; that is, have never a Soul into glory with him; but if he died, he should bring forth much fruit, that is, save many sinners. And also how real a truth there was in that Parable, concerning the Jews putting Christ to death! which the poor dispersed Jews can best experience to their cost; for they have been almost ever since a banished people, and such as have had Gods sore displeasure wonderfully manifested against them, according to the truth of the Parable, <hi>Matth. 21. v. 33. to 41.</hi> O therefore, for Jesus Christ's s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke, do not slight the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is discovered in a Parable; for by this argument thou mayest also, nay thou wilt slight almost all the things that our Lord Jesus Christ did speak; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> spake them for
<pb facs="tcp:66363:5"/>
the most part (if not all) in Parable. Why should it be said of thee, as it is said of some, <hi>These things are spoken to them that are without in Parables, that seeing they might not see, and that hearing they might not understand,</hi> Luke 8. 10. I say, take heed of being a quarreller against Christ's Parables, lest Christ also objecteth against the salvation of thy Soul at the Judgment Day.</p>
            <p>Friend, I have no more to say to thee now, if thou dost love me, pray for me, that my God would not forsake me, nor take his holy Spirit from me; and that God would fit me to do and suffer, what shall be from the World or Devil inflicted upon me. I must tell thee, the World rages, they stamp and shake their heads, and fain they would be doing: the Lord help me to take all they shall do with patience, and when they smite the one cheek, to turn the other to them, that I may do as Christ hath bidden me; for then the Spirit of God, and of glory shall rest upon me. Farewell.</p>

               <p>THis Scripture was not spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ, to shew you the state of two single persons onely, (as some through their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the drift of Christ in his Parables, do dream) but to shew you the state of the godly and ungodly to the Worlds end; as is clear to him that is of an understanding heart. For he spake them to the end, that after Generations should take notice thereof, and fear, lest they also fell into the same condition.</p>
               <p>Now, in my discourse upon these words, I shall not be tedious, but as briefly as I may, I shall pass through the several Verses, and lay you down some of the several truths contained therein: and the Lord grant that they may be profitable, and of great advantage to those that read them, or hear them read.</p>

every day, but the beggar must be glad of a bit when he can get it. Oh! who would not be in the rich mans state? A wealthy man, sorts of new Suits, and dainty dishes every day: enough to make one, who minds nothing but his belly, and his back, and his lusts, to say, Oh that I were in that mans condition! Oh that I had about me, as that man had! Then I should live a life indeed; then should I have hearts ease good store; then I should live pleasantly, and might say to my soul, Soul, be of good chear, <hi>eat, drink and be merry, Luke</hi> 12. 19. thou hast every thing plenty, and art in a most blessed condition.</p>
               <p>I say this might be, I, and is the conclusion with them that judge according to outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But if the whole Parable be well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, you will see, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. <hi>That that which is had in high estimation with men, is an abomination in the sight of God.</hi> And again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 21, 22. <hi>that condition that is the saddest condition, according to outward appearance, is oft times the most excellent;</hi> for the beggar had ten thousand degrees the best of it, though to outward appearance, his state was the saddest; from whence we shall observe thus much.</p>
               <p>1. That those who judge according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, do for the most part judge amiss. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 24.</p>

That they who look upon their outward enjoyments to be tokens of Gods special grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, are also deceived, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. For as it is here in the Parable, a man of wealth, and a child of the Devil may make but one person; or a man may have abundance of outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>and yet be carryed by the devils into eternal burnings,</hi> Luke 12. 20. But this is the trap in which the Devil hath caught many thousands of poor souls, namely, by getting them to judg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to outward appearance, or according to Gods outward blessings.</p>
               <p>Do but ask a poor carnal covetous wretch, how we should know a man to be in a happy estate; and he will answer, Those that God blesseth, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth abundance of this world unto; when for the most part they are they that are the cursed men. Alas, poor men! they are so ignorant, as to think, that because a man is increased in outward things, and that by a small stock, therefore God doth love that man with a special love, or else he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do so much for him, never bless him so, and prosper the work of his hands.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66363:9"/>
but it is because they judg according to outward appearance; they look upon themselves to be the only blessed men, when the Lord knows, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality are left out of that blessed condition. <hi>Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26.

               <p>I might here enlarge very much, but I shall not; only thus much I shall say to you that have much of this World; Have a care that you have not your portion in this world; take heed that it be not said to you hereafter, when you would very willingly have heaven. Remember in your life time you had your good things, in your life time you had your portion, <hi>Psalm</hi> 17. 14.</p>
               <p>And Friend, thou that seekest after this world, and desirest riches, let me ask this question, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou be content that God should put thee off with a portion in this life? Wouldest thou be glad to be kept out of heaven with a back well cloathed, and a belly well filled with the dainties of this world? Wouldest thou be glad to have all thy good things in thy life time, to have thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to last no longer then while thou dost live in this world? Wouldest thou be willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of eternal happiness and felicity? If you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66363:10"/>
say no, then have a care of the world and thy sins; have a care of desiring to be a rich man, <hi>lest thy Table be made a snare unto thee,</hi> Psal. 69. 22. lest the wealth in this world do bar thee out of glory. For as the Apostle saith, <hi>They that will be rich do fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtfull lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9. Thus much in general, but now more particularly.</p>
               <p>These two men here spoken of (as I said) do hold forth to us the state of the godly and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the beggar holdeth forth the godly, and the rich man the ungodly. <hi>There was a certain rich man, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why are the ungodly held forth under the notion of a rich man?</p>
               <p>1. Because Christ would not have them look too high, as I said before, but that those who have riches should have a care, that they be not all their portion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>2. Because rich men are mostly able to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils temptations; are most ready to be puft up with pride, stoutness, cares of this world, in which things they spend most of their time, in lusts, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, wantonness, idleness, together with the other works of the flesh, <hi>For which things sake, the wrath of God commeth upon the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Col. 3. 6.</p>
               <p>3. Because he would comfort the hearts of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66363:10"/>
own, which are most commonly of the poorer sort, <hi>But God hath chosen the poor, despised and base things of this world,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. Should God have set the rich man in the blessed state, his children would have concluded, being poor, that they had no share in the life to come.</p>
               <p>And again, had not God given such a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the sad condition of those that are for the most part rich men; we should have had men conclude absolutely, that the rich are the blessed men. Nay, albeit the Lord himself doth so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare, that the rich ones of the world are for the most part in the saddest condition, yet they through unbelief, or else presumption, do harden themselves, and seek for the glory of this world, as though the Lord Jesus Christ did not means as he said: or else that he will say more than shall assuredly come to pass: but let them know, that the Lord hath a time to fulfill that he had a time to declare, for the Scripture cannot be broken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 35.</p>
               <p>But again, the Lord by this word doth not mean those are ungodly, who are rich in the world, and no other, for then must all those that are poor, yet graceless and vain men be saved, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eternal vengeance; which would be contrary to the word of God, which saith, That together with <hi>the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66363:11"/>
                  <hi>there are bondmen or servants, and slaves, that cry out at the appearance of the Almighty God, and his Son Jesus Christ to Judgment,</hi> Rev. 6. 15.</p>
               <p>So that though Christ doth say, <hi>There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rich man,</hi> yet you must understand he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the ungodly, rich or poor. Nay, if you will not understand it so now, you shall be made to understand it to be so meant at the day of Christs second comming, when all that are ungodly shall stand at the left hand of Christ with pale faces, and guilty Consciences, with the vials of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties wrath ready to be powred out upon them. Thus much in brief touching the 19th verse. I might have observed other things from it, but now I forbear, having other things to speak of at this time.</p>

Whereas it is said, <hi>He was laid at his gate full of sores.</hi> Mark, <hi>He was laid at his gate,</hi> not in his house, that was thought too good for him, <hi>But he was laid at his gate full of sores.</hi> From whence observe, That the ungodly world do not desire to entertain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the poor Saints of God into their houses. If they must needs be somewhere near unto them, yet they shall not come into their houses: shut them out of doors, if they will needs be near us, let them be at the gate. <hi>And he was laid at the gate full of sores.</hi> 2.

               </epigraph>
               <p>BY these words our Lord Jesus doth shew us the frame of a Christians heart, and also the heart and carriage of worldly men towards the Saints of the Lord: The Christians heart is held forth by this, that any thing will content him while he is on this side glory. <hi>And he desired to be fed with the Crumbs,</hi> the Dogs meat, any thing. I say, a Christian will be content with any thing, if he have but to keep Life and Soul together, (as we use to say.) He is content, he is satisfied, he hath learned, if he hath learned to be a Christian, to be content with any thing, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</hi> He learns in all conditions to study to love God, to walk with God, to give up himself to God; and if the Crumbs that fall from a Rich-man's Table will but satisfie Nature, and give him bodily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66363:12"/>
strength, that thereby he may be the more able to walk in the way of God; he is contented. <hi>And he desired to be fed with the Crumbs that fell from the rich man's Table.</hi> But mark, he had them not, you do not find that he had so much as a Crumb or a Scrap allowed unto him. No, then the Dogs will be beguil'd, that must be preserved for the Dogs. From whence observe, that the ungodly World do love their Dogs better then the Children of God. You will say that's strange. It is so indeed, yet it is true, as will be clearly manifested; as for instance. How many pounds do some men spend in a year on their Dogs, when, in the mean while, the poor Saints of God may starve for hunger. They will build Houses for their Dogs, when the Saints must be glad to wander, and lodge in Dens, and Caves of the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. And if they be in any of their houses for the hire thereof, they will warn them out, or eject them, or pull down the house over their heads, rather then not rid themselves of such Tenants. Again, some men cannot go half a mile from home, but they must have Dogs at their heels; but they can very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go half a score miles, without the society of a Christian. Nay, if when they are busie with their Dogs, they should chance to meet a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, they would willingly shift him if they could. They will go on the other s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e of the hedge or the way, rather than they will have any society
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66363:13"/>
with him; and if at any time a Child of GOD should come into an house where there are but two or three ungodly Wretches, they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wish either themselves, or the Saint, out of doors; and why so? Because they cannot down with the society of a Christian: Though if there come in at the same time a Dog, or a drunken swearing Wretch, which is worse than a Dog, they will make him welcome, he shall sit down with them, and partake of their dainties. And now tell me, you that love your sins and your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; had you not rather keep company with a Drunkard, a Swearer, a Strumpet, a Thief; nay, a Dog, than with an honest-hearted Christian? If you say, No: What means your sowr carriage to the People of God? Why do you look on them, as if you would eat them up? Yet at the very same time, if you can but meet your Dog, or a drunken Companion, you can fawn upon them, take acquaintance with them, to the Tavern or Ale-house with them, if it be two or three times in a Week: But if the Saints of God meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pray together, and labour to edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you will stay till <hi>Dooms-Day,</hi> before you will look into the house where they are. Ah Friends, when all comes to all, you will be found to love Drunkards, Strumpets, Dogs, any thing; nay, to serve the Devil, rather than to have loving and friendly society with the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66363:13"/>Moreover, <hi>The Dogs came and licked his Sores.</hi>] Here again you may see, not onely the afflicted state of the Saints of God in this World, but also, that even Dogs themselves, according to their kind, are more favourable to the Saints, than the sinful World; though the ungodly will have no mercy on the Saints, yet it is ordered so that these Creatures, Dogs, Lions, &amp;c. will. Though the rich man would not entertain him into his house, yet his Dogs will come, and do him the best good they can, even to lick his running Sores. It was thus with <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the World was mad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and would have him thrown to the Lions to be devoured, the Lions shut their mouths at him, (or rather the Lord did shut them up) so that there was not that hurt befel to him, as was desired by the Adversaries, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And this I am persuaded of, that would the Creatures do as some men would have them, the Saints of God should not walk so quietly up and down the streets, and other places, as they do. And as I said before, so I say again, I am persuaded, that at the Day of Judgment many mens Conditions and Carriages will be so laid open, that it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, they have been very merciless, and mad against the Children of God; insomuch, that when the Providence of God did fall out so, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe former Verses do briefly hold forth the carriage of the ungodly in this Life toward the Saints. Now this Verse doth hold forth the departure both of the godly and the ungodly out of this Life.</p>
               <p>Where he saith, <hi>And it came to pass, that the Beggar died, and was carryed into</hi> Abraham's <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rich man died also.</hi>] The Beggar dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that represents the godly: and the rich man died, that represents the ungodly: From whence observe; Neither godly nor ungodly must live
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66363:14"/>
always without a change either by Death or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the good man died, and the bad man died; That Scripture doth also back this Truth, that good and bad must die, marvellous well, where it is said, <hi>And it is appointed to men once to die, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27.</p>
               <p>Mark, he doth not say it is so, that men by chance may die, which might beget in the hearts of the ungodly, especially some hope to scape the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it: But he saith, It is a thing most certain, it is <hi>appointed.</hi> Mark, it is <hi>appointed for men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> God hath decreed it, that since men have fallen from that happy estate that God at the first did set them in, <hi>they shall die,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Now when it is said the Beggar died, and the rich man died; part of the meaning is, they ceased to be any more in this World; I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly the meaning, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Though it be altogether the meaning when some of the Creatures die, yet it is but in part the meaning, when it is said, that Men, Women, or Children die; for there is to them something else to be said more than barely a going out of the World: For if when unregenerate men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men die, there were an end of them, not onely in this World, but also in the World to come, they would be happy over they will be now; for when ungodly men &amp; women die, there is that to come after death, that will be very terrible to them;

namely, to be carried by the Angels of Darkness from their Death-beds to Hell, there to be reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Judgment of the Great Day, when both Body and Soul shall meet, and be united together again, and made capable to undergo the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Vengeance of the Almighty to all Eternity. This is that I say, which doth follow a man (that is not born again) after Death; as is clear from that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19. Where before speaking of Christ, being raised again by the power of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit, he saith <hi>By which,</hi> that is, by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>he went and preached to the Spirits in Prison:</hi> But what is the meaning of this? Why thus much; that those Souls who were once alive in the World, in the time, or days in which <hi>Noah</hi> lived, being disobedient in their Times to the Calls of God, by his Spirit in <hi>Noah,</hi> for so I understand it, was according to that which was foretold by that Preacher deprived of Life, and overcome by the Flou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mark, he preached to the Spirits <hi>in Prison;</hi> he doth not say, who were in Prison, but to them (<hi>in</hi>) that is, now in Prison, under Chains of Darkness, reserved, or kept there, in that Prison, in which now they are, (ready, like Villains in the Jayl, to be brought before the Judgment Seat of Christ at the Great Day): But of this I shall speak further by and by. Now if this one Truth, that men must die and depart this World, and either enter into Joy, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66363:15"/>
else into Prison, to be reserved to the Day of Judgment, were believed, we should not have so many Wantons walk up and down the streets as there do; at least it would put a mighty check to their filthy Carriages, so that they would not, could not walk so basely and sinfully as they do. <hi>Belshazzer,</hi> notwithstanding he was so far from the fear of God as he was, yet when be did but see that God was offended, and threatned him for his wickedness, <hi>it made him hang down his head, and knock his knees together,</hi> Dan. 5. 5, 6. If you read the verses before, you will find he was careless, and satisfying his Lusts in Drinking, and playing the wanton with his Concubines. But so soon as he did perceive the finger of an Hand, writing, <hi>then</hi> (saith the Scripture) <hi>the King's Countenance was changed and his Thoughts troubled him; so that the Joynts of his Loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Felix</hi> of Righteousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come, <hi>it made him tremble.</hi> And let me tell thee (Soul) whosoever thou art, that if thou didst but verily believe that thou must die, and come into the Judgment, it would make thee turn over a new leaf. But this is the misery, the Devil doth labour by all means, as to keep out other Things that are good, so to keep out of the heart as much as in him lies, the Thoughts of passing from this Life into another World; for he knows, if he can
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66363:16"/>
but keep them from the serious Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> he shall the more easily keep them in their sins, and so from closing with Jesus Christ, as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the Rod of God upon them.</hi> Which makes them say to God, <hi>Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledg of thy ways,</hi> vers. 14. Because there is no fear of Death, and Judgment to come, therefore they do put off God and his ways, and spend their days in their sins; and in a moment, that is, before they are aware, go down to the Grave, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And thus it fared also with the man spoken of in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 20. the man, instead of thinking of Death, he thought how he might make his Barns bigger: But in the midst of his business in the World, he lost his Soul before he was aware: supposing that Death had been many Years off. But God said unto him, <hi>Thou Fool,</hi> thou troublest thy self about Things of this Life, thou puttest off the Thoughts of departing this World, <hi>when this Night thy Soul shall be taken from thee.</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, this Night, they, that is, <hi>the Devil will fetch away thy Soul from thee.</hi> And here it comes to pass, mens not being exercised with the Thoughts of departing this Life, that they are so unexpected to themselves and their Neighbours, taken away from the pleasures and profits; yea, all the Enjoyments they busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves withall while they live in this World. And hence it is again, that you have some in your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66363:16"/>
Towns and Cities, that are so suddainly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, some from haunting the Ale-house, others from haunting the Where-houses, others from playing and gaming, others from the cares and covetous desires after this World, unlooked for as by themselves, or their Companions. Hence it is also, that men do so wonder at such Tidings as this, <hi>There is such an one dead,</hi> such an one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; it is because they do so little consider, both the transitoriness of themselves and their Neighbours: for had they but their Thoughts well exercised about the shortness of this Life, and the danger that will befal such as do miss of the Lord Jesus Christ, it would make them more wary and sober, and spend more time in the service of God, and be more delighted and diligent in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the Lord Jesus, <hi>who is the Deliverer from wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. For, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is evident, that they who live after the flesh in the Lusts thereof, do not really and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously think on Death, and the Judgment that doth follow after, neither do they indeed endeavour so to do; for did they, it would make them say with Holy <hi>Job, All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my Change come,</hi> Job 14. 14. And, as I said before, that not onely the Wicked, but also the Godly have their time to depart this Life. <hi>And the Beggar died.</hi> The Saints of the Lord, they must be deprived of this Life also, they must yield
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66363:17"/>
up the Ghost into the hands of the Lord their God; they must also be separated from their Wives, Children, Husbands, Friends, Goods, and all that they have in the World. For God hath decreed it: It is appointed, namely, by the Lord, for men once to die, and <hi>we must appear before the Judgement Seat of Christ.</hi> As it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, if the godly do die as well as the wicked, and if the Saints must appear before the Judgment Seat as well as the sinners; then what advantage have the godly more then the ungodly, and how can the Saints be in a better condition then the wicked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Read the 22th Verse over again, and you shall find a marvellous difference between them, as much as is between Heaven and Hell, everlasting joy, and everlasting torment; for you find, that when the beggar died, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the godly, <hi>He was carried by the Angels into Abrahams Bosom,</hi> or into everlasting joy; <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. <hi>but the ungodly are not so,</hi> but are hurried by the Devils into the bottomless pit, drawn away in their wickedness: <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. for he saith, <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> When the ungodly do die, their misery beginneth; for then appear the Devils, like so many Lions, waiting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the Soul depart from the Body. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are very visible to the dying party, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66363:17"/>
sometimes more invisible; but always this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they never miss of the Soul, if it do die out of the Lord Jesus Christ, but do hale it away to the prison, as I said before, there to be tormented, and reserved until that great and general day of Judgment, at which day they must Body and Soul, receive a finall sentence from the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, and from that time be shut out from the presence of God, into everlasting woe and distress. But the godly, when the time of their departure is at hand, then also are the Angels of the Lord at hand; yea, they are ready waiting upon the Soul to conduct it safely into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom. I do not say, but the Devils are oft times very busie doubtless, and attending the Saints in their sickness; I, and no question but they would willingly deprive the Soul of Glory. But here is the comfort, as the Devils come from Hell to devour the Soul, (if it be possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at its departure) so the Angels of the Lord come from Heaven, to watch over and conduct the Soul (in spite of the Devil) safe into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> had the comfort of this, and speaks it forth for the comfort of his Brethren. <hi>Psal</hi> 34. 7. saying, <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> Mark, the Angel of the Lord encampeth round about his Children, to deliver them. From what? From
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66363:18"/>
their enemies, of which the Devil is not the least. This is an excellent comfort at any time, to have the holy Angels of God to attend a poor man, or woman; but especially, it is comfortable in the time of distress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the time of death, when the Devils beset the Soul with all the power that Hell can afford them. But now it may be, that the glorious Angels of God do not appear at the first, to the view of the Soul; nay, rather Hell stands before it, and the Devils ready, as if they would carry it thither. But this is the comfort, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consider, here is an ungodly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his death-bed, and he hath none to speak for him, none to speak comfort unto him; but it is not so with the Children of God, for they have the Spirit to comfort them. Here is the ungodly, and they have no Christ to pray for their safe conduct to glory, but the Saints have an Intercessor. <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. Here is the World, when they die, they have none of the Angels of God to attend upon them; but the Saints have their company. In a word, the unconverted person when he dieth, he sinks into the bottomless pit. But the Saints, when they die, do ascend with, and by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom, or into unto unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able glory. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43.</p>
               <p>Again, it is said, that the rich man when he died,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66363:18"/>
was buried, or put into the Earth; but when the beggar died, he was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosome. The one is a very excellent stile, where he saith, he was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosome; it denotes he excellent condition of the Saints of God, as I said before; and not onely so, <hi>but also the preciousness of the death of the Saints in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 116. 15. that after, Generations may see how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of the Lord, the death of his Saints is, when he saith, they are carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom.</p>
               <p>Thus many times, the Lord adorneth the death and departure of his Saints, to hold forth unto after Generations, how excellent they are in his eyes. It is said of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that God took him; of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he died in a good old age; of <hi>Moses,</hi> that the Lord buried him; of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he was taken up into Heaven; that the Saints sleep in Jesus; that they die in the Lord; that they rest from their labour; that their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; that they are under the Altar; that they are with Christ; that they are in light; that they are to come with the Lord Jesus, to judge the World. All which sayings signifie thus much, That to die a Saint, is very great Honour and Dignity. But the ungodly are not so. The rich or ungodly die, and are buried, he is carried from his dwelling to the Grave,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66363:19"/>
and there he is buried, hid in the dust; and his Body doth not so fast molder and come to nought there, but his name doth stink as fast in the World: as saith the holy Scripture, <hi>The name of the wicked shall rot.</hi> And indeed, the names of the godly are not in so much honour after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, but the wicked and their names, do as much rot. What a dishonour to Posterity, was the death of <hi>Balaam, Agag, Achitophel, Haman, Judas, Herod,</hi> with the rest of their companions.</p>
               <p>Thus the wicked have their names written in the Earth, and they do perish and rot, and the name of the Saints do cast forth a dainty savour to following Generations: and that the Lord Jesus doth signifie where he saith, <hi>The godly are carried by the Angels into Abrahams Bosom.</hi> And that the wicked are nothing worth; where he saith, The ungodly die and are buried.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66363:19"/>
where he saith, <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>] That is, the ungodly after they depart this life, do lift up their eyes in Hell. From these words, may be observed these things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there is an Hell for Souls to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in, when this life is ended. Mark, after he was dead and buried. <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That all that are ungodly, and do live and die in their sins, so soon as ever they die, they go into Hell: he died, and was buried. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That some are so fast asleep, and secure in their sins, that they scarce know well where they are, till they come into Hell, and that I gather from these words, <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> He was asleep before, but Hell makes him lift up his eyes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As I said before, it is evident, that there is an Hell for Souls; yea, and Bodies too, to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in after they depart this life, as is clear. First, because the Lord Jesus Christ that cannot lie, did say, that after the sinner was dead and buried, <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be objected, that Hell is here meant the Grave, that I plainly deny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66363:20"/>First, Because there the Body is not sensible of torment or ease; but in that Hell, into which the spirits of the damned depart, they are sensible of torment, and would be very willingly freed from it, to enjoy ease, which they are sensible of the want of; as is clearly discovered in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not meant the Grave, but some other place, because the Bodies, so long as they lie there, are not capable of lifting up their eyes, to see the glorious condition of the Children of God, as the souls of the damned do. <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It cannot be the Grave, for then it must follow, that the Soul was buried there with the Body, which cannot stand with such a dead state as is here mentioned; for he saith, <hi>The rich man died;</hi> that is, his soul was separated from his body. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be again objected, that there is no Hell but in this life, that I do also deny, as I said before; after he was dead and buried, <hi>In Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> And let me tell thee, O soul, whoever thou art, that if thou close not in savingly with the Lord Jesus Christ, and lay hold on what he hath done, and is doing in his own person for sinners, thou wilt find such an hell after this life is ended, that thou wilt not get out of again for ever and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66363:20"/>
ever. And thou that art wanton, and dost make but a mock at the Servants of the Lord, when they tell thee of the torments of hell, thou wilt find, that when thou departest out of this life, that Hell, even the hell which is after this life, will meet thee in thy Journey thither, and will with its hellish crew give thee such a sad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, that thou wilt not forget it to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when that Scripture comes to be fulfilled on thy soul, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it hath raised from their Thrones all the Kings of the Nations. All they,</hi> that is, that are in hell shall say, <hi>Art thou become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?</hi> O sometimes when I have had but thoughts of going to hell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the everlastingness of their ruine that fall in thither; it hath stirred me up rather to seek to the Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver me from thence, than to slight it, and make a mock at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>] The second thing I told you, was this, That all the ungodly that live and die in their sins, so soon as ever they depart this life, do descend into <hi>Hell.</hi> This is also verified by the words in this Parable, where Christ saith, He died and was buried, <hi>and in hell he lift up his eyes. As the Tree falls, so it shall lie,</hi>

O miserable Comforters! O miserable Society! here comes death and hell unto thee. Death goeth into thy body, and separates body and soul asunder; hell stands without (as I may say) to embrace, or rather to crush thy soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its everlasting grinders. Then thy mirth, thy joy, thy sinful delights will be eased when this comes to pass; so, it will come. Blessed are all those, that through Christ Jesus his merits, by saith, do escape these soul-murthering compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing you know that we did observe from these words, was this, <hi>That some are so fast asleep, and secure in their sins, that they scarce know where they are, untill they come into hell.</hi> And that I told you I gather by these words, <hi>In hell he life</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66363:22"/>
                  <hi>up his eyes.</hi> Mark, it was in hell that he lift up his eyes. Now some do understand by these words, that he came to himself, or began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to think with himself in what an estate he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what he was deprived of; which is still a confirmation of the thing laid down by me. There it is that they come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that is, there they are sensible where they are indeed; Thus it fares with some men, that they scarce know where they are, till they lift up their eyes in hell. It is with these people, as with those that fall down in a swoun; you know if a man do fall down in a swoun in one room though you take him up, and carry him into another, yet he is not sensible where he is, till he cometh unto himself, and lifteth up his eyes.</p>
               <p>Truly thus it is to be feared, it is with many poor souls, they are so sensless, so hard, <hi>so feared in their Conscience,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. that they are very ignorant of their state; and when death comes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of this sort are they spoken of in <hi>Psalm</hi> 73. where he saith. <hi>There are no bonds in their death but their strength is firm. They are not troubled as other folk neither are they plagued like other men.</hi> And

               <p>Indeed this is too much known by woful and daily experience, sometimes when we go to visit them that are sick in the Towns and places where we live, Oh how sensless, how feared in their Consciences are they? they are neither sensible of heaven, not of hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of sin, nor a Saviour: speak to them of their condition, and the state of their souls, and you shall find them as ignorant as if they had no souls to regard. Others, though they lye ready to dye, yet they are busying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about their outward affairs, as though they should certainly live here, even to live and enjoy the same for ever. Again, come to others, speak to them about the state of their souls, though they have no more experience of the new birth then a beast, yet will they speak as confidently of their eternal state, and the welfare of their souls, as if they had the most excellent experience of any man or woman in the world, saying, I shall have Peace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. When as I said even now, the Lord knows they are as ignorant of the new birth, of the nature and operation of Faith, of the witness of the Spirit: as if there were no new birth, no faith, no witness of the Spirit of Christ in any of the Saints in the world. Nay, thus many of them are, even an hour or less before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                  <bibl>Verse 23.</bibl>
                  <q>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus in his bosome.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Something in brief I have observed from the first part of this verse, namely from these words, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> And indeed I have observed but something, for they are very full of matter, and many things might be taken notice of in them. There is one thing more that I might touch upon, as touched in this saying, and that is this, Methink the Lord Jesus Christ doth hereby signify, that men are naturally unwilling to see or take notice of their sad state, I say by nature; but though now they are willingly ignorant, yet in hell they shall lift up their eyes. That is, in hell they shall see and understand their miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and therefore to these words, <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes,</hi> he added, <hi>being in torment.</hi> As if he had said, Though once they shut their eyes, though once they were 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. willingly ignorant, yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66363:24"/>
when they depart into hell, they shall be so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably handled and tormented, that they shall be forced to lift up their eyes. While men live in this world, and are in a natural state, they will have a good conceit of themselves, and of their condition; they will conclude that they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is their father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 7, 8. and their state to be as good as the best; they will conclude they have faith, the Spirit, good hope, and an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ: but then, when they drop into hell, and lift up their eyes there, and behold, first their soul to be in extream torments; their dwelling to be the bottomless pit; their company thousands of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned souls; also the innumerable company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and the hot scalding vengeance of God, not only to drop, but to fall very violently upon them; then they will begin to be awakened, who all their life time were in a dead sleep. I say, when this comes to pass, Lo it will, then in hell they shall lift up their eyes, in the midst of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they shall lift up their eyes.</p>
               <p>Again, you may observe from these words, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment.</hi> That the time of the ungodly mens smarting for their sins, will be in the torments of hell. Now here I am put to a stand, when I consider the torments of hell, into which the damned do fall. O unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments! O endless torments! Now that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66363:24"/>
thy soul might be made to slee from these intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torments, into which the damned do go. I shall shew you briefly what are the torments of hell. First, by the names of it. Secondly, by the sad state thou wilt be in, if thou commest there. First, the names: It is called <hi>a never dying worm,</hi> Mark 9. It is called <hi>an oven, fire hot,</hi> Malach. 4. 1. It is called <hi>a furnace, a fiery furnace,</hi> Mat. 13. It is called <hi>the bottomless pit, the unquenchable fire, fire and brimstone, hell fire, the lake of fire, devouring fire, everlasting fire, eternal fire, a stream of fire.</hi> Rev. 21.</p>
               <p>First, one part of thy torments will be this, thou shalt have a full fight of all thy ill spent life from first to last, though here thou canst sin to day, and forget it by to morrow; yet there thou shalt be made to remember how thou didst sin against God at such a time, and in such a place, for such a thing, and with such an one, which will be an hell unto thee. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>God will set them in order before thine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Thou shalt have the guilt of them all lye heavy on thy soul, not only the guilt of one or two, but the guilt of them altogether, and there they shall lye in thy soul, as if thy belly were full of pitch, and set on a light fire. Here men can sometimes think on their sins with delight, but there with unspeakable torment; for that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand to be the fire that Christ speaketh of,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66363:25"/>
which shall never be quenched, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 43, 44, 45, 46. While men live here, O how doth the guilt of one sin sometimes crush the soul, it makes a man in such plight, that he is weary of his life, so that he can neither rest at home nor abroad, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up nor in bed. Nay, I do know, that they have been so tormented with the guilt of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thought, that they have been even at their wits end, and have hanged themselves. But now when thou comest into hell, and hast not only one or two, or an hundred sins with the guilt of them all on thy soul and body; but all the sins that ever thou didst commit since thou camest into the world, altogether clapt on thy conscience at one time, as one should clap a red hot iron to thy breasts, and there to continue to all eternity, this is miserable.</p>
               <p>3. Again, then thou shalt have brought into thy remembrance, the slighting of the Gospel of Christ; here thou shalt consider how willing Christ was to come into the world to save sinners, and for what a trifle thou didst reject him. This is plainly held forth in <hi>Esay</hi> 28. where speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, the foundation of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ver. 16. he saith of them that reject the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that when the overflowing scourge doth pass through the earth, (which I understand to be at the end of the world) then saith he, <hi>It shall take you morning by morning, by day and by night shall it</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:66363:25"/>
                  <hi>pass over you;</hi> that is, continually without any intermission. <hi>And it shall be a vexation only to hear the report.</hi> A vexation, that is, a torment, or a great part of hell only to understand the report, to understand the good tydings that came into the world by Christs death for poor sinners, and you will find this to be verily the mind of the Spirit, if you compare it with Chap. 53. of <hi>Esay</hi> verse 1. where he speaks of mens turning their backs upon the tenders of Gods grace in the Gospel, he saith, <hi>Who hath believed our report,</hi> or the Gospel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by us? Now this will be a mighty torment to the ungodly, when they shall understand the goodness of God was so great, that he even sent his Son out of his bosome to dye for sinners, and yet that they should be so foolish, as to put him off from one time to another; that they should be so foolish, as to lose heaven, and Christ, and eternal life in glory, for the society of a company of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards; that they should lose their souls for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle sport, for this world, for a strumpet, for that which is lighter then vanity and nothing. I say, this will be a very great torment unto thee.</p>
               <p>4. Another part of thy torment will be this, Thou shalt see thy friends, thy acquaintance, thy neighbours; nay, it may be thy Father, thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thy wife, thy husband, thy children, thy brother, thy sister, with others, in the Kingdome of heaven, and thy self thrust out. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66363:26"/>
                  <hi>There shall be weeping, &amp;c. when you shall see A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> (your father) <hi>and Isaac, and Jacob,</hi> (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your brethren) <hi>the Prophets in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and your selves thrust out.</hi> Nay, saith he, <hi>There shall come from the East, and from the West,</hi> that is, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment!</p>
               <p>5. Again, thou shalt have none but a company of damned souls, with an innumerable company of devils to keep company with thee. While thou art in this World, the very thoughts of the devils appearing to thee makes thy flesh to tremble, and thine hair ready to stand upright on thy head. But O what wilt thou do, when not only the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the devils appearing, but the real society of all the devils in hell be with thee howling and roaring, screeching and roaring in such a hideous manner, that thou wilt be even at thy wits end, and be ready to run stark mad again for anguish and torment.</p>
               <p>6. Again, that thou mightest be tormented to purpose, the mighty God of heaven will lay as great wrath and vengeance upon thee, as ever he can, by the might of his glorious power. As I said before, Thou shalt have his wrath, not by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66363:26"/>
drops, but by whole showres shall it come thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thunder upon thy body and soul so fast, and so thick, that thou shalt be tormented out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And so saith the Scripture, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. speaking of the wicked, <hi>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when the Saints shall be admiring his goodness and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, this thou shalt have, as I said before, without any intermission, thou shalt not have any ease so long as while a man may turn himself round: thou shalt have it alwayes every hour, day and night: for their worth never dyes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gnaws, and their fire is never quenched. As it is written in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>7. Again, in this condition thou must be for ever, and that is as sad as all the rest. For if a man were to have all his sins laid to his charge, and communion with the devils, and as much wrath as the great God of heaven can inflict upon them. I say, if it were but for a time, even ten thousand years, and so end, there would be ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and hopes of deliverance; but here is thy misery, this is thy state for ever, here thou must be for ever: when thou lookest about thee, and seest what an innumerable company of howling devils thou art amongst, thou shalt think this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this is my portion for ever. When thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66363:27"/>
stars in the firmament, or drops in the Sea, or sands on the sea-shore, yet thou hast to lye there for ever. O this one word <hi>ever,</hi> how will it tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Friends, I have only given a very short touch of the torments of Hell. O! I am set, I am set, and am not able to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet this let me say to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accept of Gods mercy through our Lord Jesus Christ, lest thou feel that with thy Conscience, which I cannot express with my Tongue, and say, I am sorely tormented in this flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And seeth</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Bosome</hi>]</p>
               <p>When the damned are in this pittiful state, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with fears, with terrours, with torment and vengeance; one thing they shall have, which is this, they shall see the happy and blessed state of Gods Children: he seeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Bosom, which as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is the happy state of the Saints, when this life is ended. This now shall be so far from being an ease unto them, that it shall most wonderfully aggravate or heighten their torment, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There shall be weeping, or cause of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when they shall see <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thrust out.</p>
               <p>2. Observe, those that die in their sins, are far
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66363:27"/>
from going to Heaven; He seeth <hi>Abraham</hi> a far off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Bosom. And indeed, it is just with God, to deal with them that die in their sins, according to what they have done; and to make them who are far from Righteousness now, to stand far from Heaven to all Eternity. <hi>Hearken to this ye stout-hearted, that are far from Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and that are resolved to go on in your sins; when you die, you will be far from Heaven; you will see <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but it will be afar off. Again, <hi>he seeth</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are some of the things that the damned do behold, so soon as they come into torment. Mark, <hi>And he seeth</hi> Lazarus <hi>in Abrahams Bosome. Lazarus,</hi> Who was he? Why, even he that was so slighted, so disregarded, so undervalued by this ungodly one, while he was in the World; he seeth <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Bosome.</p>
               <p>From whence observe, That those who live and die the enemies of the Saints of God; let them be never so great or stout; let them bear never so much sway while they are in the World; let them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rag and boast never so much while they are here, they shall in spight of their teeths see the Saints, yea, the poor Saints, even the <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, or the ragged ones that belong to Jesus, to be in a better condition then themselves. O who do you think, was in the best condition, or who do you think,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66363:28"/>
saw themselves in the best condition, he that was in Hell, or he that was in Heaven? He that was in darkness, or he that was in light? He that was in everlasting joy, or he that was in everlasting torments? The one with God, Christ, Saints, Angels: the other in tormenting flames, under the curse of Gods eternal hatred, with the Devils and their Angels, together with an innumerable company of howling, roaring, cursing, ever burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reprobates. Certainly, this observation will be easily proved to be true here in this World, by him that looks upon it with an understanding heart, and will clear it self to be true in the World to come, by such as shall go either to Heaven or to Hell.</p>
               <p>2. The second Observation from these words. <hi>And seeth</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Bosom,</hi> is this, They that are the persecutors of the Saints of the Lord now in this World, shall see the Lords persecuted ones, to be they that are so highly esteemed by the Lord, as to sit, or to be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom (in everlasting glory) though the enemies to the Children of God, did so lightly esteem them, that they scorn to let them gather up the Dogs meat that falls under their Table: this is also verified, and held forth plainly by this Parable. And therefore be not grieved, O you that are the tempted, persecuted, afflicted, sighing, praying Saints of the Lord, though your adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66363:28"/>
look upon you now with a disdainful, surly, rugged, proud, and haughty countenance, yet the time shall come, when they shall spie you in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Bosom.</p>
               <p>I might enlarge upon these things, but shall leave them to the Spirit of the Lord, which can better by ten thousand degrees, enlarge them on thy heart and conscience, then I can upon a piece of paper. Therefore leaving these to the blessing of the Lord, I shall come to the next Verse, and shall be brief in speaking to that also, and so passe to the rest.</p>

Verse, is a discovery of the proper places, both of the godly, and the ungodly after death; one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom, or in glory, the other in Hell. Now this 24 Verse, is a discovery of part of the too late repentance of the ungodly, when

they are dropt down into Hell. <hi>And he cryed, and said, Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have mercy upon me.</hi>]</p>
               <p>From these words, <hi>And he cryed,</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, first, What a change the ungodly will have, when they come into Hell. He cried; it is like he was laughing, jesting, jearing, drinking, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, swearing, cursing, prating, pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Consider, you must have a change, either here or in Hell. If you be not new creatures, regenerate persons, new-born Babes in this World before you go hence, your note will be changed, your conditions will be changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if you come into Hell, you must <hi>cry.</hi> O did but the singing drunkards, when they are making merrie on the Ale-bench, think on this, it would make them change their note, and <hi>cry,</hi> What shall I do? whither shall I go when I die? But as I said before, the Devil, as he labours to get poor souls to follow their sins, so he labours also to keep the thoughts of eternal damnation out of their mindes; and indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these two things are so nearly linked together, that the Devil cannot well get the Soul to go on in sin with delight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66363:29"/>
he can keep the Thoughts of that terrible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-clap out of their minds.</p>
               <p>But let them know, that it shall not always be thus with them; for if when they depart, they drop down into Eternal Destruction, they shall have such a sence of their sins, and the punishment due to the same, that it shall make them to <hi>cry. And he cryed.</hi> O what an alteration will there be among the ungodly, when they go out of this World! it may be a Fortnight or a Moneth before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they were light, stour, surly, drinking themselves drunk, slighting God's People, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at goodness, and delighting in sin; following the World, seeking after Riches, faring delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, keeping company with the bravest; but now they are dropt down into Hell, <hi>they cry.</hi> A little while ago they were painting their Faces, feeding their Lusts, following their Whores, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their Neighbours, telling of Lies, following of Plays, and Sports, to pass away the time; but now they are in Hell, they do <hi>cry.</hi> It may be last Year they heard some good Sermons, was invited to receive Heaven, was told their sins should be pardoned, if they closed in with Jesus; but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his profers, and slighting the Grace that was once tendered, they are now in Hell, and do <hi>cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before they had so much time (they thought) that they could not tell how to spend it, unless it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66363:30"/>
were in Hunting, and Whoring, in dancing and playing, and spending whole hours; yea, days, nay weeks, in the Lusts of the Flesh, but when they depart into another place, and begin to lift up their Eyes in Hell, and consider their miserable, and irrecoverable condition, <hi>they will cry.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Here then before we go any further, you may see, that it is not without good ground, that these words are here spoken by our Lord, That when any of the ungodly do depart into Hell, <hi>they will cry.</hi> Cry, why so?</p>

                  </gap>ery, that by their sins they have plunged themselves into. I say, these words do hold forth a desire that the Damned have, to be delivered from those Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they now are in: <hi>O Father</hi> Abraham, saith he, <hi>have mercy upon me, and send</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my Tongue, for I am tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66363:31"/>
to be meant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those; or him that ctieth out here, to be the Jews. Or it may be some may understand it to be GOD, or Jesus Christ his Son, which I rather suppose it may be, that is here cried out unto, because you find the same Cry to him, as it were uttered by the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other places of the Scripture; as in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. vers. 25, 26. <hi>Then shall they say, Lord, Lord, we have eat and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</hi> Nay more, <hi>In thy Name have we cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works.</hi> This was just at their rejection. And again in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 11. They cry again to him, even to Jesus, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> And he there again gives them a Repulse, as also in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But however, or whosoever <hi>Abraham</hi> is, yet these Truths may be observed from the words.</p>
               <p>1. That the Damned, when in an irrecoverable estate, will seek for, or desire deliverance from the Wrath that they are, and shall be in for Eternity, Surely, in the Floud of great Waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
               <p>2. That they will pray (if I may so call it) earnestly for deliverance from their miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. These two Things are clear from the words. For mark, He not onely said, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have mercy upon me.</hi> But he cried, and said, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham <hi>have mercy on me.</hi> From whence, take a third observation, and that is, There is a time
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66363:32"/>
coming, wherein though men shall both cry and pray, yet they are like to have no mercy at the Hands of God; for so was this man served, as I shall further shew by and by when I come to it.</p>
               <p>Some People are so deluded by the Devil, as to think that God is so merciful, as to own or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any thing for prayer; They think any thing will go for currant and good satisfaction, while they are here in this World, through ignorance of the true nature of the Mercy of GOD, and the knowledge in what way God is satisfied for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Now I say, through ignorance they think, that if they do but mutter over some form of prayers, though they know not what they say, not what they request, yet God is satisfied, yea, very well satisfied with their doings; when alas! there is nothing less.

when he may cry and pray for mercy, and yet go without it.

               <p>Again, this should admonish us to take time while it is proffered, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t we repent us of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and Rebellion, when we are deprived of it. Ah Friends! Time is precious, an hours time to hear a Sermon is precious: I have sometimes thought thus with my self, <hi>Set the case the Lord should send two or three of his Servants, the Ministers of the Gospel, to Hell among the Damned with this Commission; Go ye to Hell, and preach my Grace to those that are there: Let your Sermon be an hour long, and hold forth the Merits of my Sons Birth, Righteousness Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and Intercession with all my Love in him, and proffer it to them; telling them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that now once more, and but once, do I proffer the means of Reconciliation to them.</hi> They who are now roaring, being past hope, would then leap at the least proffer of Mercy: Oh they that could spend whole Days, Weeks, nay Years, in rejecting the Son of God, would now be glad of one Tender of that Mercy. <hi>Father,</hi> saith he, <hi>have mercy on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:66363:33"/>Again, from these words you may observe, that Mercy will be welcome, when Souls are under Judgment: Now his Soul is in the fire, now he is under the Wrath of God, now he is in Hell, there to be tormented; now he is with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned Spirits, now he feels the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God: Now, oh now, <hi>have mercy on me.</hi> Here you may see, that <hi>Mercy</hi> is prized by them that are in Hell, they would be glad if they could have it. <hi>Father have Mercy on me; For my poor Souls sake send me a little Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And send</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words do not onely hold forth, that the ungodly have a desire of Mercy, but what those Mercies are, that these poor Creatures would be glad of.</p>
               <p>As first, To have the company of a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> granted to them, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham <hi>have mercy upon me, and send</hi> Lazarus. Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> was he that was beloved of God, and also he that was hated of them. Therefore,</p>
               <p>2. Observe, That those Saints that the World in their Life-time could not in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure, now they are departed, they would be glad to have society with them. O now send <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though the time was when I cared not for him, yet now let me have some Society with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:66363:33"/>Though the world disregard the society of Gods children now, yet there is a time coming in which they would be glad to have the least company with them. Nay, do but observe, those of the Saints that are now most rejected by them, even from them shall they be glad of comfort, if it might be. <hi>Send Lazarus;</hi> he that I slighted more than my dogs, he that I could not endure should come into my house, but must lye at my gate, send him: Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> shall be welcome to me, now do I desire some comfort from him; but he shall go without it.</p>
               <p>From whence again observe, That there is a time coming, O ye surly dogged persecutors of the Saints, that they shall slight you as much as ever you slighted them. You have given them many an hard word, told many a lie of them, given them many a blow: And now in your greatest need and extremity they shall not pity you. The Righteous shall rather rejoyce when he seeth the vengeance of God upon thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 10.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Send Lazarus.</hi> From whence observe, <hi>That any of the Saints shall then be owned by you to be Saints.</hi> Now ye look upon them to be of the Sect with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> but then you shall see them to be the <hi>Lazarus's</hi> of God, even Gods dear Children. Though now the Saints of the Lord will not be owned by you, because they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66363:34"/>
are beggerly, poor, low, contemptible among you, yet the day is coming that you shall own them, desire their company, and wish for the least cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Send</hi> Lazarus <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus shall the souls that abide in their sins, cry out in the bitterness of their spirits, with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anguish and torment of conscience, without intermission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue.</hi> That he, namely, the man who before I scorned should eat with the dogs of my flock, that before I slighted and had no regard of, that I shut out of door, send him, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these words, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, &amp;c.</hi> do hold forth the least friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or favour; As if he should have said, Now I would be glad of the least mercy, now I would be glad of the least comfort, though it be but one drop of cold water on the tip of his finger. One would have thought that this had been a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, a small courtesie, one drop of water, what is that? Take a pail full of it, if that will do thee any good. But mark, he is not permitted to have so much as one drop, not so much as a man may hold upon the tip of his finger. This signifies,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66363:34"/>
That they that fall short of Christ, shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented even as long as eternity lasteth, and shall not have so much as the least ease, no not so long as while a man may turn himself round, not so much leave as to swallow his spittle, <hi>not a drop of cold water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that these things did take place in your hearts, how would it make you to seek after rest for your souls before it be too late, before the Sun of the Gospel be set upon you.</p>
               <p>Consider, I say, the misery of the ungodly that they shall be in, and avoid their vices by closing in with the tenders of mercy, lest you partake of the same portion with them, and cry out in the bitterness of your souls, <hi>One drop of cool water and cool my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I am tormented in this flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the reason why the poor world do not so earnestly desire for mercy is, partly because they do not so seriously consider the torment that they must certainly fall into if they die out of Christ. For let me tell you, did but poor souls indeed consider that wrath that doth by right fall to their shares because of their sins against God, they would make more haste to God through Christ for mercy then they do. Then we should have them say, it is good closing with Christ to day before we fall into such distress.</p>

                  <q> But Abraham said, Son, remember, that thou in thy life-time hadst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evill things, now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THese words are the answer to the request of the damned. The Verse before (as I told you) is a discovery of the desires they have after they depart this world. Here is the answer, <hi>Son, Remember,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The answer signifies thus much, That instead of having any relief or ease, they are hereby the more tormented, and that by fresh recollections, or by bringing afresh their former ill-spent life, while in the world, into their remembrance: <hi>Son, Remember,</hi> thou hadst good things in thy life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; As much as if he had said, Thou art now sensible what it is to lose thy Soul, thou art now sensible what it is to put off repentance; thou art now sensible that thou hast befooled thy self in that thou didst spend that time in seeking after outward, momentary, earthly things, which thou shouldest have spent in seeking to make Jesus Christ sure to thy soul; and now through thy anguish of spirit, in the pains of hell thou wouldst enjoy that which in former time thou didst make light of; but alas, thou art here beguiled and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together disappointed, thy crying will now
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66363:37"/>
avail thee nothing at all, <hi>This is not the acceptable time.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. This is not a time to answer the desires of damned Reprobates; If thou hadst cryed out in good earnest while grace was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much might have been, but then thou wert careless, and didst turn the forbearance and goodness of God into wantonness: wert thou not told, that these who would not hear the Lord when he did call, should not be heard (if they turned away from him) when they did call, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>to</hi> 28. <hi>But contrariwise he would lough at their calamity, and mock when their fear did come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore instead of expecting the least drop of mercy and favour, call into thy mind how thou didst spend those days which God did permit thee to live; I say, remember, that in thy life-time thou didst behave thy self rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously against the Lord, in that thou wert care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of his Word and Ordinances, yea, and of the welfare of thine own soul also: therefore, now I say, instead of expecting or hoping for any relief, thou must be forced to call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thy filthy waies, and feed upon them to thine everlasting astonishment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>From these words therefore which say, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life time hadst thy good things.</hi> There are these things to be taken notice of.</p>

They that by putting off repentance, and living in their sins, lose their souls, shall instead of having the least measure of comfort, when they come into hell, have their ill-spent life alwayes very fresh in their remembrance. While they live here, they can sin and forget it, but when they depart they shall have it before them, they shall have a remembrance, or their memory notably enlightened, and a clearer, and a continual sight of all their wicked practices, that they wrought and did while they were in the World. <hi>Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> saith he, then you will be made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. 1. How you were born in sin, and brought up in the same.</p>

               <p>3. Remember that out of love to thy sins and lusts, thou didst turn thy back on the tenders of the same Gospel of good tidings and peace.</p>
               <p>4. Remember that the reason why thou didst lose thy Soul was, because thou didst not close in with free grace, and the tenders of a loving and freehearted Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Remember how near thou wast to turning at such and such a time, only thou wast willing to give way to thy lusts when they wrought, to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards when they called, to pleasures when they proffered themselves, to the cares and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>7. Remember how thou, when thou wert ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to turn, didst put off turning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>9. Remember that while others were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the fear of the Lord to seek him, thou wast met with a company of vain companions to sin against him; while the Saints were a praying, thou were a cursing; while they were speaking good of the name of God, thou wert speaking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the Saints of God. O then thou shalt have a <hi>scalding hot remembrance</hi> of all thy sinful thoughts words and actions, from the very first to the last of them that ever thou didst commit in all thy life time: Then thou wilt find that Scripture to be a truth, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 65, 66, 67.) <hi>The Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind. And thy life shall hang in doubt</hi>

In the morning, thou shalt say, would God it were even: and at even thou shalt say, would God it were morning; for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</hi> Nay, thou wilt find worse things to thy wo then this Scripture doth manifest. For indeed there is no tongue able to express the horrour, terrour, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eternal misery, that those poor souls shall undergo, without the least mitigation or ease and a very great part of it shall come from that quick, full, and continual remembrance of their sins that they shall have. And therefore there is much weight in these words, <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life time hadst thy good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these words you see this is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ungodly shall remember, or have in remembrance the mispending their lives, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things.</hi> You may take these words <hi>good things</hi> either sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, for the things of this world, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are called, and may be called <hi>good things,</hi> or else with these words, namely, (the things <hi>of this life</hi>) all the pleasures, delights, profits, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which the ignorant people of the world do count their good things, and do very much cheer themselves therewith. <hi>Soul, soul, eat, drink and be merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for thou hast much goods laid up for many</hi>

Now I say, God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his glorious Power and Wisdome, will make poor Creatures have alwayes in their minds a fresh and clear remembrance of their ill-spent life; he will say unto them, <hi>Remember, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in thy life-time, it was thus and thus with thee, and in thy life-time thy carriage was so and so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Sinners might have their choice, they would not have their sins and transgressions so much in remembrance; as is evident by their carriages here in this Would: for they will not endure to entertain a serious thought of their filthy life, they <hi>put far away the evil day, Amos</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 27. but will labour by all means to put the thought of it out of their mind: but there they shall be made to remember to purpose, and to think continually of their ungodly deeds.

They will not willingly take notice of them now: But then they shall hereafter in spite of their teeth.

               <p>The great God, instead of giving the ungodly any ease will even aggravate their Torments, first, by slighting their perplexities, and by telling of them what they must be thinking of: <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>O ye lost Souls, that you had your joy in your life-time, your peace in your life-time, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, delights, ease, wealth health, your Heaven, your Happiness, and your Portion in your life-time.</hi>

               <p>There is a time coming, that the ungodly would be glad of a better portion, when they shall see the vanity of this; <hi>that is,</hi> when they shall see what a poor thing it is, for a man to have his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this World.

But then they will see there is another thing that is better, and of more value then Ten Thousand Worlds.

                  <hi>Remember, that thou hadst thy good things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words do not onely hold forth the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Wicked in this Life, but also great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation to the Saints, where he saith, <hi>And</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>evil things;</hi> That is, <hi>Lazarus</hi> had his Evil Things in his Life-time, or when he was in the World.</p>
               <p>From whence observe,</p>
               <p>1. That the Life of the Saints, so long as they are in this World, is attended with many Evils or Afflictions, which may be discovered to be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Natures, as saith the Scripture. <hi>Many are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Take notice, that the Afflictions or Evils, that accompany the Saints, may continue with them their Life-time, so long as they live in this Vale of Tears; Yea, and they may be <hi>divers,</hi> that is, of several sorts; some <hi>outward,</hi> some <hi>inward,</hi> and that as long as they shall continue here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as hath been the Experience of all Saints in all Ages; and this might be proved at large, but I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66363:41"/>
onely hint in these Things, although I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large much upon them.</p>
               <p>3. The Evils that do accompany the Saints will continue with them no longer than their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: and here indeed lies the comfort of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, the Saints, they must have all their bitter Cup wrung out to them in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: Here must be all their Trouble, here must be all their Grief. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith Christ <hi>the World shall rejoyce, but you shall lament; but your mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall,</hi> mark, <hi>it shall be turned into joy,</hi> Joh. 16. 2. You shall lament, you shall be sorrowful, you shall weep in your Life-time, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy, and your joy no man (let him be what he will, no man) shall take away from you. Now if you think, when I say the Saints have all their Evil Things in their Life-time, that, I mean, they have nothing else but Trouble in this their Life-time, this is your mistake: For let me test you, That though the Saints have all their Evil Things in their Life-time, yet even in their Life-time they have also <hi>joy unspeakable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, while they look not at the things that are seen, but at the things which are not seen.</hi> The joy that the Saints have sometimes in their hearts, by a believing consideration of the good Things to come when this Life is ended, doth fill them fuller of joy, than all the Crosses, Troubles, Temptations, and Evils,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66363:42"/>
that accompany them in this Life, can fill them with grief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>But some Saint may say, <hi>My troubles are such as are ready to overcome me. Answ.</hi> Yet be of good comfort, they shall last no longer than thy <hi>Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my Trouble is, I am perplexed with an heart full of corruption and sin, so that I am much hindred in walking with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis like so, but thou shalt have these Troubles no longer than thy Life-time. But I have a cross Husband, and that's a great grief to me.</p>
               <p>Well, but thou shalt be troubled with him no longer than thy Life-time, and therefore be not dismaid, be not discomforted, thou shalt have no Trouble longer than this Life-time.</p>
               <p>Art thou troubled with cross Children, cross Relations, cross Neighbours? They shall trouble thee no longer than this Life-time.</p>
               <p>Art thou troubled with a cunning Devil, with unbelief; yea, let it be what it will, thou shalt take thy farewel of them all (if thou be a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) after thy Life-time is ended. O excellent! Then God shall wipe away all Tears from your Eyes; There shall be no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain; for the former Things are passed away.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:66363:42"/>But now, on the contrary, if thou be not a right and sound Believer; Then though thou should'st live a Thousand Years in this World, and meet with sore Afflictions every day; Yet these Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, be they never so great and grievous, they are nothing to that Torment that will come upon thee, both in Soul and in Body, after this Life is ended.</p>

But the Thing to be lamented is, For all this is so sad a condition to be fallen into, yet poor Souls are for the most part sensless of it; yea, so sensless (at sometimes) as though there was no such misery to come hereafter. Because the Lord doth no immediately strike with his Sword, but doth bear long with his Creature, waiting that he might be gracious: <hi>Therefore, I say, the Hearts of some of the Sons of Men, are wholly set upon it to do mischief,</hi> Eccles. 8. 11.

               <p>As if he should say, Now hath God recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both <hi>Lazarus</hi> and you, according to what you sought after, while you were in this World: As for your part, you did neglect the precious Mercy and goodness of God, you did turn your Back on the Son of God, that came into the World to save sinners: You made a Mock of preaching the Gospel; You was admonished over and over, to close in with the loving kindness of the Lord in his Son Jesus Christ. The Lord let you live 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, Years; all which time, you, instead of spending it, to <hi>make your Calling and Election sure,</hi> Job 21. 29, 30. did spend it in making of Eternal Damnation sure to thy Soul. And also <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he in his Life-time did make it his business to accept of my Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lord Jesus Christ. When thou wast in the Alehouse, he frequented the Word preached; when thou wert jearing at goodness, <hi>he was sighing for the sins of the times,</hi> Eccles. 9. 4. While thou wert swearing, he was praying: In a word, while

thou wert making sure of Eternal Ruine, he, by Faith in the Bloud of the Lord Jesus Christ, was making sure of Eternal Salvation. Therefore, <hi>Now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi>

And O, methinks the words at the first view, if rightly considered, are enough to make any hard-hearted sinner in the World to fall down dead. The verse I last spake to was, and is a very terrible one, and aggravates the Torments of poor sinners wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Where he saith, <hi>Remember, that thou in thy life time hadst thy good things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>his Evill things,</hi> &amp;c. I say, these words are very terrible to those poor Souls that die out of Christ. But these latter words do much more hold out their sorrow. They were spoken, as to the present condition then upon the sinner: These do not onely back the former, but do yet further aggravate their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, holding forth that which will be more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: The former Verse is enough to smite any sinner into a swound, but this to make him fall down dead. Where he saith, <hi>And besides all this:</hi> There is still something to aggravate thy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66363:44"/>
misery yet far more abundantly; I shall briefly speak to the words, as they have relation to the Terrour spoken of in the verses before. As if he had said, Thou thinkest thy present state unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, it makes thee sob and sigh, it makes thee to rue the time that ever thou wert born: Now thou findest the want of Mercy; now thou wouldst leap at the least dram of it; now thou feelest what it is to slight the Tenders of the Grace of God; now it makes thee to sob, sigh, and roar exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for the anguish that thou art in. <hi>But besides all this,</hi> I have other Things to tell thee of, that will break thine heart indeed. Thou art now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a Being in the World; Thou art depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of hearing the Gospel, the Devil hath been too hard for thee, and hath made thee miss of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Thou art now in <hi>Hell</hi> among an innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Company of Devils, and all thy sins beset thee round; Thou art all over wrapped in flames, and canst not have one drop of water to give thee any ease; Thou cryest in vain, for nothing will be granted; Thou seest the Saints in Heaven, which is no small trouble to thy Damned Soul; Thou seest, that neither God nor Christ takes any care to ease thee, or to speak any comfort unto thee. <hi>But besides all this,</hi> There thou art, and there thou art like to lie, never think of any ease, never look for any comfort; Repentance now will do thee no good, the Time is past, and can never be called
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66363:45"/>
again; look what thou hast now, thou must have for ever.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I speak enough before to break thine heart asunder, <hi>But besides all this,</hi> there lye and swim in flame for ever: these words, <hi>Besides all this,</hi> are terrible words indeed. I will give you the scope of them in a similitude. Set case you should take a man, and tye him to a stake, and with red hot pincers, pinch off his flesh by little pieces for two or three years together, and at last, when the poor man cryes out for ease and help, the tormentors answer, Nay, <hi>but besides all this,</hi> you must be handled worse.</p>
               <p>We will serve you thus these 20. years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after that we will fill your mangled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy full of scalding lead, or run you through with a red hot spit, would not this be lamentable? yet this is but a <hi>flea-biting</hi> to the sorrows of these that go to hell; for if a man were served so, there would ere it were long be an end of him. But he that goes to Hell shall suffer ten thousand times worse torments then these, and yet shall never be quite dead under them. There they shall be ever whining, pining, weeping, mourning, ever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented without ease, and yet never dissolved into nothing; if the biggest devil in hell might pull thee all to peices, and rend thee small as dust, and dissolve thee into nothing, thou wouldest count this a mercy. But here thou mayest lye and fry,

For ever, that is a long while, and yet it must be so long. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>into everlasting fire,</hi> into the fire that burns for ever, <hi>prepared for the devils and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. Oh, thou that wert loath to foul thy foot if it were but dirty, or did but rain; thou that wert loath to come out of the Chimney corner if the wind did but blow a little cold; and wert loath to go half a mile, yea, half a furlong to hear the Word of God, if it were but a little dark; thou that wert loath to leave a few vain companions to edify thy Soul; thou shalt have fire enough, thou shalt have night enough, and evil company enough, thy belly full if thou miss of Jesus Christ; and <hi>besides all this,</hi> thou shalt have them for ever and for ever.</p>

               <p>But 2dly, If thou wouldest needs know, if thou do fall short of heaven, thou wilt find it this: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The everlasting Decree of God;</hi> that is, There is a Decree gone forth from God, That those who fall short of heaven in this world, God is resolved they shall never enjoy it in the world to come. And thou wilt find this gulf so deep, that thou shalt never be able to wade through it as long as eternity lasts. As Christ saith, <hi>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest he hale thee to the Judg, and the Judg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into Prison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I tell thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence</hi> (there

is the gulf) <hi>the Decree; thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing,</hi> or very <hi>last mite,</hi> Luke 12. 58, 59. These words therefore, <hi>there is a great gulf fixed,</hi> I do understand to be the everlasting Decree of God: God hath De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That those who go to Heaven, shall never go from thence again into a worse place; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so those that go to hell, and would come out, they shall not come out thence again. And friend, this is such a <hi>gulf,</hi> so fixed by him that cannot lye, that thou wilt find it so which way soever thou goest, whether it be to Heaven or Hell. Here therefore thou seest how secure God will make those who dye in the Faith; God will keep them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but those that dye in their sins, God will throw them to Hell, and keep them there; so that they that would go from Heaven to Hell, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither can they come from Hell, that would go to Heaven. Mark, he doth not say, they would not; for oh how fain would these who have lost their souls for a lust, for two pence, for a jug of Ale, for a Strumpet, for this World; come out of that hot scolding fiery Furnace of Gods eternal vengeance, if they might; but here is their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they that would come from you to us, that is, from Hell to Heaven, cannot. They must not, they shall not, they cannot, God hath Decreed it, and is resolved the contrary, here therefore lyes the misery not so much that they are in Hell, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66363:47"/>
there they must lye for ever and ever. Therefore if thy heart would at any time tempt thee to fin against God, cry out, no, for then I must go to Hell, and lye there for ever. If the Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars, and Hypocrites did but take this Doctrine soundly down, it would make them tremble when they think of sinning. But poor Souls, <hi>Now they will make a mock at sin,</hi> Prov. 14. 9. and play with it as a child doth play with a rattle; but the time is comming, that these rattles that now they play with, will make such a noise in their ears and Consciences, that they shall find, that if all the Devils in Hell were yelling at their heels, the noise would not be comparable to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Send him to my Fathers house, for I have five bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> &amp;c. Though while they lived among them in the world, they were not so sensible of their ruine, yet now they are passed out of the world, and do partake of that which before they were warned of, they can <hi>I</hi> say, then cry out, now <hi>I</hi> find that to be true indeed, which was once and again told, and declared to me, that it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I have five brethren</hi>] Here you may see, that there may be, and are, whole housholds in a damnable state and condition, as our Lord Jesus doth by this signifie. <hi>Send him to my Fathers house,</hi> for they are all in one state, I left all my brethren in a pittiful case. People while they live here, cannot indure to hear that they should be all in a miserable condition; but when they are under the wrath of God, they see it, they know it, and are very sure of it; for they themselves, when they were in the world, lived as they do, but they fell short of Heaven, and therefore if they go on, so shall they. <hi>Oh therefore send him quickly to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, for all the house is in an undone condition, and must be damned if they continue so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thing observable is this, namely, that those that are in hell, do not desire that their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should come thither; nay, rather saith he, send him to my Fathers house, and let him testifie to them that are therein, <hi>lest they also come,</hi> &amp;c</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But some may say, what should be the reason, that the damned should desire not to have their companions come into the same condition that they are fallen into, but rather, that they might be kept from it, and escape that dreadful state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I do believe there is scarce so much love in any of the damned in hell, as really to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the salvation of any. But in that there is any desire in them that are damned, that their friends and relations should not come into that place of torment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It appears to me, to be rather for their own ease, then for their neighbours good; for let me tell you, this <hi>I</hi> do believe, that it will aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the grief and horrour of them, to see their ungodly neighbours in the like destruction with them: For where the ungodlie do live, and die, and descend into the pit together, the one is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a vexation to the other, than any thing else. And it must needs be so, because there are no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie people, that do live ungodlie together; but they do learn ill examples one of another, as thus. If there live one in the Town that is verie expert and cunning for the World, why now the rest that are of the same mind with him, they will labour to imitate and follow his steps: this is commonlie seen.</p>
               <p>Again, If there be one given to drunkenness, others of the Town through his means, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

more into that sin with him, and do accustom themselves the more unto it, because of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, and also by setting such an ill example before them. And so if there be any addicted to pride, and must needs be in all the newest fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how do their example provoke others to love and follow the same vanitie; spending that upon their lusts, which should relieve their own and others wants. Also if there be any given to jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, scoffing, lying, whoring, backbiting, junket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wantonness, or any other sin; they that are most expert in these things, do oft-times intangle others, that peradventure would not have been so vile as now they are, had they not had such an example, and hence they are <hi>called</hi> corruptors. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>Now these will by their doings, exceedingly aggravate the condemnation of one another. He that did set his Neighbour an <hi>ill example,</hi> and thereby caused him to walk in sin: He will be found one cause of his friends destruction, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he will have to answer for his own sins, and for a great part of his Neighbours too, which will still add to his destruction: as that Scripture in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> sheweth, where speaking of the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that should give the people warning, if he did not, though the man did die in his sins, <hi>yet his blood should be required at the Watchmans hand, Ezek</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66363:53"/>So here let me tell thee, that if thou shouldest be such an one, as by thy conversation and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, shalt be a trap and a stumbling-block, to cause thy neighbour to <hi>fall</hi> into eternal ruine, though he be damned for his own sin; yet God may, nay, he will charge thee, as being guiltie of his blood, in that thou didst not content thy self to keep from Heaven thy self, but didst also by thy filthy conversation, keep away others, and cause them to fall with thee. O therefore, will not this aggravate thy torment? Yea, if thou shouldest die, and go to <hi>Hell</hi> before thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or companions, besides the guilt of thine own sins, thou wouldest be so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I left him living in foul and hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: But <hi>I</hi> was one of the first instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring him to them.

For I do believe, that the very looks of those that have been beguiled by their Fellows, I say, their very looks will be a Torment to them: For thereby will the Remembrance of their own sins be kept (if possible) the fresher on their Consciences, which they committed with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66363:54"/>
them; and also they will wonderfully have the guilt of the others sins upon them, in that they were partly the cause of his committing them, being Instruments in the Hands of the Devil to draw them into. And therefore, lest this come to pass, <hi>I pray thee send him to my Fathers house.</hi> For if they might not come hither, peradventure my Torment might have some mitigation; <hi>that is,</hi> If they might be saved, then their sins will be pardoned, and not so heavily charged on my Soul. But if they do fall into the same place where I am, the sins that I have caused them to commit will lie so heavy, not onely on their Souls, but also on mine, that they will sink me into Eternal Misery, deeper and deeper. <hi>O therefore send him to my Fathers house, to my five Brethren, and let him testifie to them, lest they come into this place of torment.</hi>

               <p>These words being thus understood: What a condition doth it shew them to be in then, that now so much delight in being the very Ring-Leaders of their Companions, into sinnes of all sorts whatsoever.</p>

               <p>But Friend, when thou hast lost this life, and dost begin to lift up thine Eyes in <hi>Hell,</hi> and seest what thy sins have brought thee to; and not onely so, but that thou by thy filthy sinnes did'st cause others, (Devil-like) to fall into the same condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with thee: And that one of the Reasons of their Damnation was this, that thou didst lead them to the Commission of those wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this World, and the Lusts thereof. Then, Oh! that some body would stop them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lest they also come into this place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be damned as I am: How will it tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me? <hi>Balaam</hi> could not be contented to be damned himself, but also he must by his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cause others to stumble and fall. The Scribes and Pharisees could not be content to keep out of Heaven themselves, but they must labour to keep out others too. Therefore, theirs is the greater Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Deceived cannot be content to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself, but he must labour to deceive others also. The Drunkard cannot be content to go to <hi>Hell</hi> for his own sins, but he must labour to cause others to fall into the same Furnace with him. But look to your selves, for here will be Damnation upon Damnation, damned for thy own sins, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66363:55"/>
damned for thy being a partaker with others in their sins; and damned for being guilty of the damnation of others. O how will the Drunkard cry, for leading their Neighbours into drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? How will the covetous person howl for setting his Neighbour, his Friend, his Brother; his Children and Relations, so wicked an Example; by which he hath not onely wronged his own soul, but also the souls of others. The Liar, by lying, learned others to lie; The Swearer learned others to swear; The Whore-Monger learned others to whore.</p>
               <p>Now all these, with others of the like sort, will be guilty, not onely of their own damnation, but also of the damnation of others. I tell you, that some men have so much been the Authors of the damnation of others, that I am ready to think, that the damnation of them will trouble them, as much as their own damnation. Some Men (it is to be feared) at the Day of Judgment, will be found to be the Authour of destroying whole Nations. How many Souls do you think <hi>Balaam,</hi> with his deceit, will have to answer for? How many, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet?</hi> How many, the <hi>Pharisees, That hired the Souldiers to say the Disciples stole away Jesus?</hi> Mat. 28. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. And by that means stumbled their Brethren to this day; and was one means of hindring them from believing the Things of God

And why so? Because they tell them, That if they live in their sins, that will damn them, yet if they turn and live a righteous life, according to the holy and just, and good Law of God, that will not save them. Yea, because we tell them plainly, that unless they leave their sins and righteousness too, and close in with a naked Jesus Christ, his bloud and merits, and what he hath done, and is now doing for sinners, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved; and unless they do eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Bloud, they have no life abiding in them: they gravel presently,

And tell them again, their living honestly according to the Law, their paying every one their own, their living quietly with their neighbours, their giving to the poor, their notion of the Gospel, and saying, they do believe in Christ, will do them no good at the general day of Judgment. Ha friends! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you are there at this very day, that have been told once and again of your lost undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, because you want the right, real, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of God upon your souls?

Therefore for Gods sake, if you love your souls, consider, and beg of God for Jesus Christs sake, that he would work such a work of Grace in your hearts, and give you such a Faith in his Son

Jesus Christ, that you may not only have rest here, as you think, not only think your state safe while you live here; but that you may be safe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not only here, but also when you are gone, lest you do cry in the anguish and perplexity of your Souls, Send one to my companions that have been beguiled by Satan, as I have been; and so by going on, come into this place of torment, as I have done.</p>
               <p>Again, one thing more is to be observed from these words, <hi>Let him testify to them, lest they come into this place of torment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, lest they come in, as if he had said, or else they will come into this place of torment, as sure as I am here. From whence observe, That though some Souls for sin do fall into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pit of Hell before their fellows, because they depart this World before them; yet the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the same course, are as sure to go to the same place as if they were there already. How so? Because they are all condemned together, they have all fallen under the same Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have all offended the same Justice; and must for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if they dye in that condition, drink as deep, if not deeper, of the same destruction. Mark, I pray you what the Scriptures say, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> John 3. 18.</p>
               <p>He is condemned as well as they, having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the same Law with them: if so, then what

hinders, but they will partake of the same destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them? only the one hath not the Law yet so executed upon them, because they are here; the other have had the Law executed upon them, they are gone to drink that which they have been brewing, and thou art brewing that in this life, which thou must certainly drink. The same Law, I say, is in force against you both, only he is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and thou art not. Just as if there were a company of Prisoners at the Bar, and all condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to dye; what, because they are not all execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one day, therefore shall they not be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at all? Yes, the same Law that executed its severity upon the parties now deceased, will for certain be executed on them that are alive, in its appointed time. Even so it is here, we are all condemned by nature, if we close not in with the Grace of God by Jesus Christ, we must and shall be destroyed with the same destruction; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, send him</hi> (saith he) <hi>lest,</hi> Mark, lest they come into this place of torment.</p>

Observe again, That <hi>there is a possibility of obtaining mercy, if now, I say, now in this day of Grace we turn from our sins</hi>

And therefore for thy incouragement, do thou know for certain, that if thou shalt in this thy day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of mercy upon Gods own Terms, and close with him effectually, God hath promised, yea, made many Promises, that thy Soul shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted safe to glory, and shall for certain escape all the evils that I have told thee of; I, and many more then I can imagine. Do but search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and see how full of consolation they are to a poor Soul that is minded to close in with Jesus Christ. <hi>He that cometh to me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Though he be an old sinner, <hi>I will in no wise cast him out.</hi> Mark, <hi>in no wise,</hi> though he be a great sinner, <hi>I will in no wise cast him out,</hi> if he come to me. Though he have slighted me never so many times, and not regarded the welfare of his own Soul, yet let him now come to me, and notwithstanding this, <hi>I will in no wise cast him out,</hi> nor throw away his Soul, <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. Again, saith the Apostle. <hi>Now</hi> (Mark now) <hi>is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> Now here is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy good store, now Gods heart is open to sinners; now he will make you welcome; now he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any body if they do but come to Christ. He that comes to me (saith Christ) <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi> And why? <hi>Because now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2, 3. As if the Apostle had said, If you will have mercy,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66363:61"/>
have it now, receive it now, close in with it now.</p>
               <p>God hath a certain day to hold out his grace to sinners; Now is the time, now is the day. 'Tis true, there is a day of damnation, but this is a day of Salvation. There is a day coming, wherein sinners <hi>must cry to the Mountains to fall on them, to the Hills to cover them from the wrath of God;</hi> but now, now, is the day in which he doth hold out his grace. There is a day a coming, in which you will not be admitted to have the priviledge of one <hi>drop</hi> of water to cool your tongue; if now, I say, if now you slight his grace and goodness which he holds out to you. Ah friends, consider there is now hopes of mercy, but then there will not; now Christ holds forth mercy unto you, but then he will not. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23. Now there are his Servants that do beseech you to accept of his grace; but if thou lose the opportunity that is put into thine hand, thou thy self mayst beseech here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and no mercy be given thee. <hi>And he cryed and said, Father</hi> Abraham <hi>have mercy on me, and send</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.</hi> And there was none given. Therefore, let it never be said of thee, as it will be said of some; <hi>Why is there a price put into the hand of a fool, seeing he hath no heart to it:</hi> Seeing he hath no heart to make a good use of it, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 16.) consider therefore with thy self,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66363:61"/>
and say, <hi>It is better going to Heaven then Hell; it is better to be saved than damned; it is better to be with Saints, than with damned souls; and to go to God, is better than to go to the Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</hi> Isa. 55. 6. Lest in thy trouble he leave thee to thy self, and say unto thee plainly, <hi>Where I am, thither ye cannot come.</hi> Joh. 8. 21.</p>
               <p>O if they that are in <hi>Hell</hi> might but now again have one such invitation as this, how would they leap for joy. I have thought sometimes, should God send but one of his Ministers to the damned in <hi>Hell,</hi> and give him Commission to preach the free love of God in Christ extended to them, and held out to them, if now while it is profered to them they will accept of his kindness; O how welcome would they make this news, and close in with it on any tearms!</p>
               <p>Certainly they would say, we will accept of grace on any tearms in the World, and thank you too, though it cost life and limbs to boot, we will spare no cost, nor charge, if mercy may be had. But poor souls, while they live here they will not part from sin, with hell-bred, devilish sin: No, they will rather lose their souls, then lose their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy sins.</p>

               <p>Think thus with thy self; What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall I lose a long Heaven for short pleasure? shall I buy the pleasures of this world at so dear a rate, as to lose my soul for the obtaining of that?

               <p>6. Consider, that the profits, pleasures, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this world, will not last ever, but the time is coming, yea just at the doors, when they will give thee the slip, and leave thee in the suds, and in the brambles of all that thou hast done.</p>

Nay, this would not be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reports that the law (for the breach thereof) will give against thy <hi>soul:</hi> For those can but <hi>kill</hi> the body; but these <hi>will kill</hi> both body

               <p>Mark, it is for ever, for ever. It is into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting damnation, <hi>eternal</hi> destruction, <hi>eternal</hi> wrath and displeasure from God, <hi>eternal</hi> gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of conscience, <hi>eternal</hi> continuance with <hi>devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O consider, it may be the thought of seeing the <hi>devil</hi> doth now make thine hair to stand right up on thy head. O but this to be damned, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the <hi>devils,</hi> and that not only for a time, as I said before, but for ever to <hi>all eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is <hi>wonderfully miserable, ever miserable;</hi> that no tongue of man, no nor of <hi>Angels,</hi> is able to express it.</p>
               <p>5. Consider much with thy <hi>self,</hi> not onely my sins against the <hi>law</hi> will be laid to my charge; but <hi>also</hi> the sins I have committed in slighting the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>glorious Gospel:</hi> these <hi>also</hi> must come with a voyce against me. As thus, Nay, he is worthy to be damned, for he rejected the Gospel, he slighted the free grace of God tendered in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> How many times wast thou (damned wretch) invited, intreated, beseeched to come to Christ, to accept of mercy, that thou mightest have Heaven, thy sins pardoned, thy <hi>soul</hi> saved, and <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul glorified,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> this for nothing but the acceptance, and through faith forsaking

those imps of Satan, which by their embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have drawn thee downward toward the <hi>gulf</hi> of Gods <hi>eternal displeasure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How often didst thou read the promises, yea, the free promises of the common <hi>salvation?</hi> How oft didst thou read the sweet <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to accept of the grace of God? but thou wouldst not, thou regardest it not, thou didst slight <hi>all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As I would have thee to consider the sad and woful state of those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As first, Consider, thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st still the thread of thy life lengthned, which for thy sins, might seven years ago, or more, have been cut asunder, and thou have dropped down among the flames.</p>
               <p>2. Consider, the tearms of reconciliation by faith in Christ, is <hi>still</hi> profered unto thee, and thou invited, yea intreated to accept of it.</p>
               <p>3. Consider, the tearms of reconciliation are but (bear with me though I say but) onely to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in Jesus Christ, with that faith that purifies the heart, and enables thy <hi>soul</hi> to feed on him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and be saved from this sad state.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:66363:65"/>4. Consider, the time of thy departure is at hand, and the time is uncertain, and also that for ought thou knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, the day of grace may be past to thee before thou diest, not lasting so long as thy uncertain life in this world. And if so, then know for certain, that thou art as sure to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as if thou wert in <hi>hell</hi> already, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert not in the mean while.</p>
               <p>5. Consider, it may be some of thy friends are giving <hi>all diligence</hi> to make their <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> sure, being resolved for Heaven, and thou <hi>thy self</hi> endeavourest as fast to make sure of <hi>hell,</hi> as if resolved to have it: and together with this, consider how it will grieve thee, that while thou wert making sure of <hi>hell,</hi> thy friends were making sure of Heaven; but more of this by and by.</p>
               <p>6. Consider, what a sad reflection this will have on thy <hi>soul,</hi> to see thy friends in Heaven, and thy <hi>self</hi> in <hi>hell;</hi> thy Father in Heaven, and thou in <hi>hell;</hi> thy Mother in Heaven, and thou in <hi>hell;</hi> thy Brother, thy Sister, thy Children in Heaven, and thou in <hi>hell.</hi> As Christ said to the Jews of their relations, according to the flesh, so may I say to thee concerning thy friends, <hi>There shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,</hi> when ye shall see your Fathers and Mothers, Brethren and Sisters, Husbands and Wives, Children and Kinsfolk, with your friends and neighbours, in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66363:65"/>
the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>and thou thy self thrust out,</hi> Luk. 13. 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>But again, because I would not onely tell thee of the damnable state of those that die out of Christ, but also perswade thee to take hold of Life, and go to Heaven, take notice of these following Things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Consider, that whatever thou canst do, as to thy acceptance with God, is not worth the dirt of thy shoes, but is <hi>all as menstruous Rags,</hi> Isa. 64. 6.</item>
                  <item>2. Consider, that all the Conditions of the New Covenant (as to Salvation) are and have bin compleatly fulfilled by the Lord Jesus Christ, and that for sinners.</item>
                  <item>3. Consider, That the Lord calls to thee, for to receive whatsoever Christ hath done, and that on free-cost, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.</item>
                  <item>4. Consider, That thou canst not honour God, more than to close in with his proffers of Grace, Mercy, and Pardon of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Again, That which will adde to all the rest, Thou shalt have the very Mercy of GOD, the Bloud of Christ, the Preachers of the Word, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with every Sermon; all the Promises, Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exhortations, and all the Counsels and Threatnings of the Blessed Word of God: Thou shalt have all thy Thoughts, Words, and Actions, together with all thy Food, thy Rayment, thy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66363:66"/>
sleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy Goods, and also all hours, days, weeks, Months, and Years, together with whatsoever else God hath given thee; I say, thy abuse of all these shall come up in Judgment against thy Soul. For God will reckon with thee <hi>for every thing, whether it be good or bad,</hi> Eccles. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>5. Nay farther, it is so unreasonable a thing for a sinner to refuse the Gospel, that the very Devils themselves will come in against thee, as well as <hi>Sodom</hi> that Damned Crue: May not they, I say, come in against thee, and say, O thou simple man! O vile Wretch! that had not so much care of thy Soul, thy precious Soul, as the Beast hath of his Young, or the Dog of the very Bone that lyeth before him. Was thy Soul worth so much, and didst thou so little regard it? Were the Thunder-Claps of the Law so terrible, and didst thou so slight them? Besides, was the Gospel so freely, so frequently, so fully tendered to thee, and yet hast thou rejected all these Things?</p>
               <p>Hast thou valued sin at a higher rate than thy soul? than God, Christ, Angels, Saints, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them in Eternal Blessedness and Glory? Wast thou not told of Hell-fire, those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable flames? Didst thou never hear of the intollerable Roarings of the Damned Ones that are therein? Didst thou never hear or read that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oleful saying in the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> how the sinful man cries out among the flames, <hi>One drop of water</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:66363:66"/>
                  <hi>to cool my tongue.</hi> Thus I say may the very Devils, being ready to go with thee into the Burning Furnace of Fire and Brimstone, though not for sins of so high a nature as thine, trembling say, Oh that Christ had died for Devils, as he died for Man! And, Oh that the Gospel had bin preached to us, as it hath bin to thee! How would we have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to have closed in with it? But woe be to us, for we might never have it proffered: no, nor in the least, though we would have been glad of it. But you, you have had it proffered, preached, and proclaimed unto you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 4. Besides, you have been intreated, and beseeched to accept of it, but you would not. O simple Fools! that might have escaped Wrath, Vengeance, Hell-fire, and that to all Eternity, and had no heart at all to do it.</p>
               <p>6. May not the Messengers of Jesus Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so come in with a shrill and terrible Note against thy Soul, when thou standest at the Bar of God's Justice, saying, Nay, Thou ungodly one, how often hast thou been forewarned of this day? Did we not found an Alarum in thine Ears, by the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of God's Word day after day? How often didst thou hear us tell thee of these Things? Did we not tell thee sin would damn thy Soul? Did we not tell thee, that without Conversion, there was no Salvation? Did we not tell thee, that they who loved their sinnes, should be damned at this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66363:67"/>
dark and gloomy day, (as thou art like to be.) Yet did we not tell thee, that God, out of his love to sinners, sent Christ to die for them, that they might (by coming to him) be saved? Did we not tell thee of these Things? Did we not run, ride, labour, and strive abundantly (if it might have been) for the good of thy Soul, (though now a damned Soul? Did we not venture our Goods, our Names, our Lives? Yea, did we not even kill our selves, with our earnest intreatings of thee to consider of thine Estate, and by Christ to escape this dreadful day? O sad doom! when thou shalt be forced full sore against thy will, to fall under the Truth of this Judgment, saying, <hi>O how have I hated Instruction, and how hath my heart despised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof?</hi> (for indeed) <hi>I have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine Ear to them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed me,</hi> Prov 5. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>7. May not thy Father, thy Mother, thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thy Sister, thy Friend. &amp;c. appear with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against thee at the terrible day? Saying, Oh thou silly Wretch! How rightly hath God met with thee? O how righteously doth his Sentence pass upon thee? Remember, thou would'st not be ruled, nor perswaded in thy Life-time: As thou didst not care for us, and our Admonitions then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so neither do we care for thy Ruine, Terror, and Damnation now. No, but we will stand on God's side in sentencing of thee to that portion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66363:67"/>
which the Devils must be partakers of. <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall rejoyce when he seeth the Vengeance, he shal wash his foot in the bloud of the wicked,</hi> Psal. 58. 10. O sad! it is enough to make Mountains tremble, and the Rocks to rend in pieces, to hear this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sound. Consider these Things, and if thou would'st be loth to be in this condition, then have a care of living in sin now. How loth wilt thou be, to be thrust away from the Gates of Heaven, and how loth wilt thou be to be deprived of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God?</p>
               <p>How willingly wilt thou set foot forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lake of Fire? Never did Malefactor so unwillingly turn off the Ladder, when the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was about his Neck, as thou wilt turn from God to the Devil, from Heaven to Hell, when the Sentence is passed upon thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Oh how wilt thou sigh and groan! How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would'st thou hide thy self, and run away from Justice: But alas! as it is with them that are on the Ladder ready to be executed, so it will be with thee: They would fain run away, but there are many Halberd-men to stay them: And so the Angels of God will beset thee round, I say, round on every side; so that thou may'st indeed look, but run thou canst not: <hi>Thou mayst wish thy self under some great Rock or Mountain,</hi> Rev. 6. 15, 16. but how to get under, thou know'st not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:66363:68"/>Oh how unwilling wilt thou be, to let thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go to Heaven without thee, thy Mother or Friends, &amp;c. go to Heaven without thee? How willingly would'st thou hang on them, and not let them go? O Father, cannot you help me? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot you do me some good? O how loath am I to burn and fry in Hell, while you are singing in Heaven! But alas, the Father, Mother, or Friends reject them, slights them, and turn their Backs upon them, saying, <hi>You would have none of Heaven in your life-time, therefore you shall have none of it now: You slighted our Counsels then, and we slight your tears, cries, and condition now.</hi> What sayest thou sinner, will not this perswade thine heart, nor make thee bethink thy self? This is now before thou fall into that dreadful place, that fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. But O consider how dreadful the place it self, the Devils themselves, the fire it self will be. And this at the end of all, here thou must lie for ever, here thou must fry for ever, and for ever. This will be more to thee, than any man with Tongue can express, or with Pen can write: There is none that can, I say, by the Ten Thousand part discover the state and condition of such a Soul.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this then with a few Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Incouragement.</p>
               <p>1. Consider, (for I would fain have thee come in sinner) that there is way made by Jesus Christ for them that are under the Curse of God, to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66363:68"/>
come to this comfortable and blessed state of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> I was speaking of. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>2. Consider, what pains Christ Jesus took for the Ransoming of thy Soul from all the Curses, Thunder-claps, and Tempests of the Law; from all the intollerable flames of Hell; from that Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinking appearance of thy person (on the left hand) before the Judgment-Seat of Christ Jesus, from everlasting fellowship, with innumerable Companies of yelling, and Soul-amazing Devils. I say, consider what pains the Lord Jesus Christ took, in bringing in Redemption for sinners, from these Things.</p>
               <p>1. In that, <hi>Though he were rich, yet he became poor, that thou, through his poverty, might be made rich,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. He laid aside his glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>and became a servant,</hi> Phil. 2. He left the company of Angels, and incountred with the Devil, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. He left Heavens ease for a time, to lie upon hard Mountains, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. In a word, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poorer, than they that go with flail and rake; yea, then the very Birds or Foxes, and all to do thee good. Besides, consider a little of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable and intollerable slightings, and rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the manifold abuses that came from Man upon him. How he was falsly accused, being a sweet, harmless, and undefiled Lamb. How he was undervalued, so that a Murtherer was counted less worthy of condemnation than he. Besides, how they mocked him, spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m. Insomuch, that there was another fain to carry his Cross.</p>
               <p>Again, not only this, but lay to heart a little what he receiv'd from GOD his dear Father, though he were his dear and tender Son. First, in that he did reckon him the greatest Sinner and Rebel in the World: For he laid the sins of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and Ten Thousands, and Thousands of Thousands of Sinners to his charge, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. And caused him to drink the terrible Cup that was due to them all: and not onely so, but did delight in so doing; <hi>For it pleased the Lord to bruise him.</hi> God dealt indeed with his Son, as <hi>Abraham</hi> would have dealt with <hi>Isaac,</hi> I, and more terribly by Ten Thousand parts: For he did not only tear his Body like a Lion, but made his Soul an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin. And this was not done fainedly, but really (for Justice call'd for it, he standing in the room of Sinners) witness that horrible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Agony that fell on him suddainly in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66363:69"/>
Garden, as if all the Vials of God's unspeakable scalding Vengeance had been cast upon him all at once, and all the Devils in Hell had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken loose from thence at once to destroy him, and that for ever; insomuch, that the very pangs of Death seized upon him in the same hour. For, saith he, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowful and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, even unto death,</hi> Mark 14. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>Witness also that strange kind of sweat, that trickled down his most blessed F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce, where it is said. <hi>And he sweat, as it were, great drops or clodders of blood trickling down to the ground.</hi> O Lord Jesus, what a Load didst thou carry? What a Burthen didst thou bear of the sins of the World, and the Wrath of God! O thou didst not onely bleed at Nose and Mouth, with the pressure that lay upon thee, but thou wast so pressed, so loaden, that the pure bloud gushed through the flesh and skin, and so ran trickling down to the ground. <hi>And his sweat was as it were, great drops of bloud, trickling or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground,</hi> Luk. 22. 44. Canst thou read this, O thou wicked sinner, and yet go in sin? Canst thou think of this, and defer Repentance one hour longer? O heart of flint! yea, harder.

               </list>
               <p>And fourthly, To get thee to continue herein. For that is the way, he knows, to get thee to be a partaker with him of the flaming Hell-fire, even the same that he himself is fallen into; together with the rest of the wicked World by reason of sin. Look to it therefore.</p>
               <p>But now, in the next place, a word of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to you that are the Saints of the Lord.</p>
               <p>1. Consider, what an happy state thou art in, that hast gotten the Faith of the Lord Jesus into thy Soul. (But be sure thou have it) I say, how safe, how sure, how happy art thou. For when others go to Hell, thou must go to Heaven; when others go to the Devil, thou must go to God; when as others go to Prison, thou must be set at Liberty, at
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66363:71"/>
Ease, and at Freedom; when others must roar for sorrow of heart, then thou shalt also sing for the joy of heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, consider thou must have all thy well spent Life to follow thee, instead of all thy sins: and the glorious blessings of the Gospel, instead of the dreadful Curses and Condemnations of the Law. The blessing of the Father, instead of a fiery Sentence from the Judge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let dissolution come when it will, it can do thee no harm; for it will be but onely a passage out of a Prison, into a Palace; out of a Sea of Troubles, into an Haven of Rest; out of a Croud of Enemies, to an innumerable Company of true, loving, and faithful Friends; out of shame, Reproach, and Contempt, into exceeding great and Eternal Glory. For Death shall not hurt thee with his sting, nor bite thee with his Soul-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Teeth, but shall be a welcome Guest to thee, even to thy Soul, in that it is sent to free thee from thy Troubles which thou art in whiles here, in this World, dwelling in the Tabernacle of Clay.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider, however it goes with Friends and Relations, yet it will go well with thee, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p>However it goes with the Wicked, yet I know, Mark, yet I know (saith he) that it shall go well
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66363:71"/>
with them that fear the Lord, that fear before him.</p>
               <p>And therefore let this, in the first place, cause thee chearfully to exercise thy patience, under all the Calamities, Crosses, Troubles, and Afflictions, that may come upon thee: and by patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well-doing, to commit both thy self, and thine Affairs, and Actions, into the Hands of God, through Jesus Christ, as to a faithful Creator, who is true in his Word, and loveth to give unto thee, whatsoever he hath promised to thee.</p>
               <p>And therefore to incourage thee, while thou art here with comfort, to hold on for all thy Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in this thy Journey, be much in considering the place that thou must go into, so soon as disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution comes.</p>
               <p>It must be into Heaven, to God the Judge of all, to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the Spirits of just men made perfect, to the General Assembly, and Church of the first-born, whose Names are written in Heaven, and to Jesus (too the Redeemer) who is the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Bloud of sprinkling that speaks better Things for thee, than <hi>Abels</hi> did for <hi>Cain,</hi> Heb. 12, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:66363:72"/>3. Consider, That when the time of the dead that they shall be raised is come, then shall thy body be raised out of the grave, and be glorified, and be made like to Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. O excellent condition.</p>
               <p>4. When Jesus Christ shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit with him, even when he shall sit on the throne of his glory. O will not this be glorious, that when thousands, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of thousands shall be arraigned before the Judgment-seat of Christ, then for them to sit with him upon the throne, together with him to pass the sentence upon the ungodly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. 3. Will it not be glorious to enjoy those things that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
               <p>Will it not be glorious to have this sentence, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you before the Foundation of the World.</hi> Will it not be glorious to enter then with the Angels and Saints into that glorious Kingdome? Will it not be glorious for thee to be in glory with them, while others are in unu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>terable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? O then! how will it comfort thee to sea thou hast not lost that glory; to think that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath not got thy soul, that thy soul should be saved, and that not from a little, but from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding danger; not with a little, but a great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. O therefore let the Saints be joyful in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66363:72"/>
glory, let them triumph over all their enemies. Let them begin to sing heaven upon earth, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph before they come to glory, salvation, even when they are in the midst of their Enemies; <hi>For this honour shall all his Saints have,</hi> Psal. 149. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>

               <p>IN the Verses foregoing, you see there is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the lamentable state of the poor soul that dyes out of Christ, and the special favour of God. And also how little the glorious God of Heaven doth regard and take notice of their most miserable condition.</p>
               <p>Now in this verse, he doth magnify the word which was spoken to the People by the Prophets and Apostles, <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> As if he should say, thou as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest me that I should send <hi>Lazarus</hi> back again into the World, to Preach to them that live there, that they might escape that doleful place that thou art in: what needs that? have they not <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets? have they not had my Ministers and Servants sent unto them, and coming as from me?

They have <hi>Moses, and the Prophets, Let them hear them;</hi> let them receive their word, close in with the Doctrine declared by them. I shall not at this time speak any thing to that word (<hi>Abraham</hi>) having touched upon it already; but shall tell you what is to be understood by these words, <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> The things that I shall observe from hence, are these, 1. That the Scriptures spoken by the Holy Men of God, are a sufficient rule to instruct to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, them that do assuredly believe and close in with what they hold forth. <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> That is, if they would escape that doleful place, and be saved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the intollerable pains of Hell fire, as they desire, they have that which is sufficient to counsel them, <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets,</hi> let them be instructed by them, <hi>Let them hear them,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. <hi>For all Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in Righteousness;</hi>

why, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished to every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do but mark the words, <hi>All Scripture is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: All,</hi> take it where you will, and in what place you will; <hi>All is profitable,</hi> for what? <hi>That the man of God,</hi> or he that is bound for Heaven, and would instruct others in their progress thither.</p>
               <p>It is profitable to <hi>instruct him,</hi> in case he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; <hi>to reprove him,</hi> in case he transgress; <hi>to correct him,</hi> if he hath need of it; <hi>to confirm him,</hi> if he be wavering. It is profitable for doctrine, and all this in a very righteous way, that the poor soul may not only be helped, but <hi>throughly furnished,</hi> nor only to some, but to all <hi>good works.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> would counsel <hi>Timothy,</hi> to stick close to the things that are sound and sure, presently he puts him upon the Scriptures, saving, <hi>Thou hast from a Child known the Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ Jesus.</hi> The Scripture holds forth Gods mind and will of his love and mercy towards man, and also the creatures carriage towards him from first to last: so if thou wouldest know the love of God in Christ to sinners, <hi>Then search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for they are they that testify of him.</hi>

               <p>THe Verse before, you know, as I told you, it was part of an answer to such as lose their <hi>souls,</hi> so it is a vindication of the Scriptures of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Verse is an answer to what was said in the former, and such an one as hath in it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the former answer. <hi>Nay Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Nay saith he, do not say so, do not put them off with this; <hi>send one from the dead,</hi> and then there will be some hopes. 'Tis true, thou speakest of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets and sayest, <hi>let them hear them;</hi> but these things are not so well as I could wish, I had rather thou woulest send one from the dead. In these words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Nay, Father Abraham,</hi> there is a repulse given. Nay, let it not be so. Nay, <hi>I</hi> do not like of that answer; Hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets?</hi> nay.

               <p>Now observe, I pray you, the reason why he sayes nay, is, because God doth put over all those that will be saved, to observe and receive the truth contained in Scripture, and believe that. To have a high esteem of them, and to love and search them, as Christ saith, <hi>Search the Scriptures,—for they are they which testify of me,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. But the damned say, <hi>Nay;</hi> as if he had said, This is the thing to be short, my brethren are unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and do not regard the Word of God, I know it by my self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when I was in the World, it was so with me; Many a good Sermon did I hear, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time was I admonished, desired, intreated, beseeched, threatned, forewarned of what I now suffer: But alas, I was ignorant, self-conceited, surly, obstinate, and rebellious. Many a time the Preacher told me, hell would be my portion, the devil would wreck his malice on me, God would pour on me his sore displeasure, but he had as good have preached to the stock, to the post, to the stones I trod on; his words rang in mine ears, but I kept them from my heart. I remember he alledged many a Scripture, but those I valued not; the Scriptures, thought I, what are they? a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as it was with me then, so it is with my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren now; we were all of one spirit, loved all the same sins slighted all the same counsels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, incouragements, and threatnings of the Scriptures; and they are still as I left them, still in unbelief, still provoking God, and rejecting good counsel, so hardned in their wayes, so bent to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sin, that let the Scriptures be shewed to them daily, let the Messengers of Christ preach till their hearts ake, till they fall down dead with prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they will rather trample it under-foot, and swine-like rent them, than close in with those gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and blessed proffers of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one should rise from the dead, they would repent. Though they have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the Prophets,</hi> (the Scriptures) they will not repent and close in with Jesus Christ, though the Scriptures do witness against them. If therefore there be any good done to them, they must have it another way. I think, saith he, it would work much on them, <hi>if one should rise from the dead.</hi> And this truth indeed is so evident, that ungodly ones have a light esteem of the Scriptures, that it needs not many strong Arguments to prove it, being so evidently manifested by their every dayes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, both in words and actions, almost in all

See the words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his 9th Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who though the Lord afforded them mercy upon mercy, as it is from ver. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ver. 25. yet ver. 26. saith he, <hi>Nevertheless they were disobedient for all thy goodness towards them, and rebelled against thee,</hi> (but how?) <hi>and cast thy Law behind their back: Slew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which testified against them, to turn them to thee; and they wrought great provocations.</hi> Observe, 1. They sinned against mercy. And then 2. They slighted the Law, or Word of God. 3. They slew the Prophets that declared it unto them. 4. The Lord coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s it a great provocation. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. from ver. 10. ver. 19. And see <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 11, 12. <hi>But they refused to hearken,</hi> (saith he there of the Wicked) <hi>and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear the Law. Yea, they made their hearts hard as an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant stone, lest they should hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts sent unto them by his Spirit in the former Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Mark I pray you, her is also, First, a refusing to hearken to the word of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>2. That they might so do, they stopped their ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:66363:82"/>3. If any thing was to be done, they pulled away their shoulder.</p>
               <p>4. To effect this, they labour to make their hearts hard as an Adamant stone.</p>
               <p>5. And all this, lest they should hear and close in with Jesus and live, and be delivered from the wrath to come, all which things do hold out an unwillingness to submit to, and embrace the words of God; and so Jesus Christ which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of by them. Many other Scripture I might bring in for confirmation of the thing, as that in <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 12, 13. also 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 24, 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 15, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. and that 16. 12. Read also seriously that saying, in 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15. where he saith, <hi>And the Lord God of their Fathers sent unto them by his Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gersrising up betimes because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place.</hi> And did they make them welcome? No, <hi>But mocked the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of God, and despised his words: And was that all?</hi> No, <hi>they misused his Prophets.</hi> How long? <hi>untill the wrath of the Lord arose against them: Till there was no remedy.</hi> See also <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 19. chap. 25. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 49.</p>
               <p>And besides the Conversation of almost all men doth bear witness to the same, both Religious, and profane persons; in that they daily neglect, reject, and turn their backs upon the plain testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:66363:82"/>As, 1. Take the threatnings laid down in holy Writ, and how are they disregarded; there are but a few places in the Bible, but there are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings against one sinner or other; against drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, swearers, lyars, proud persons, strumpets, whoremongers, covetous railers, extortioners, thieves, lazy persons; In a word, all manner of sins are reproved, and without Faith in the Lord Jesus, there is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore punishment to be executed on the committers of them; and all this made mention of in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But for all this, how thick, and by heaps, do these wretches walk up and down our streets? Do but go into the Ale-houses, and you shall see almost every room besprinkled with them, so fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out their own shame, that it is enough to make the heart of a Saint to tremble, insomuch that they would not be bound to have society with them any long while for all the world. For as the wayes of the godly are not liked of by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even <hi>so the wayes of the wicked are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the just,</hi> Prov. 29. 27. Psal. 120. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures say, <hi>Cursed is the man that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, that maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord,</hi> Jer. 17. 5.</p>
               <p>And yet how many poor souls are there in the world, that stand in so much aw, and dread of men, and do so highly esteem their favour, that they will rather venture their souls in the hands

                  </gap>y to Jesus Christ for the salvation of their soul. Nay, though they be convinced in their souls, that the way is the way of God; yet how do they labour to stifle convictions, and turn their ears away from the truth, and all because they will not lose the favour of an opposite neighbour. Oh! I dare not for my Master, my Brother, my Landlord, I shall lose his favour, his house of work, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay my calling. O saith another, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go in this way, but for my Father, he chides and tells me, he will not stand my friend when I come to want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall never enjoy a penyworth of his goods, he will disinherit me; And I dare not, saith another, for my Husband, for he will be a railing, and tells me, he will turn me out of doors, he will beat me, and cut off my legs. But I tell you, if any of these, or any other things be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. Again, the Scripture saith, <hi>He that being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reproved, hardneth his neck, shall suddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and that without remedy,</hi> Prov. 29. 1. Yet many are so far from turning, though they have been convinced of their wretched state an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>3. Again, thou hast heard say, <hi>Unless a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Joh. 3. 3, 5, 7. And yet thou goest on in a natural state; an unregenerate condition, nay, thou dost resolve never to turn not be changed, though hell be appointed on purpose to swallow up such, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Again, the Scripture saith plainly, That <hi>he that loveth and maketh a lye, shall have his part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21. 8, 27. And yet thou art so far from dreading it, that it is thy delight to jest and jeer, and lye for a penny or two pence, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if thou hearest a lye from, or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou wilt tell it, and swear to the truth of it. O miserable!</p>
               <p>5. Thou hast heard and read, That <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not, shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 16. And <hi>that all men have not Faith,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. 2. and yet thou

               <p>I my self sent the Prophets, they did not run of their own heads; I gave them Commission; I thrust them our, and told them what they should say.

               <p>From these words therefore take notice of this Truth; namely, that those who reject, and believe not <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, are a very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people, that will not be perswaded, though one rise from the Dead.</p>
               <p>They that regard not the Holy Scriptures, to turn to God, finding them to restifie of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mercy, there is but little hopes of their Salvation; <hi>For they will not,</hi> mark, <hi>they will not be perswaded, though one should rise from the Dead.</hi> This Truth is confirmed by Jesus Christ himself: If you read <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. where the Lord is speaking of himself, that he is the very Christ; he brings in four or five Witnesses to back what he said. First, <hi>John Baptist.</hi> 2. The Works that his Father gave him to do. 3. His Father speaking from Heaven. 4.

needs be in great danger of losing his Soul, if he abide in this condition; because he that slights the Testimony, doth also slight the Thing testified of, let him say the contrary never so often. For as Jesus Christ hath here laid down the Reason of Mens not receiving him; so the Apostle, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, lays down the Reason again with an high and mighty aggravation. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. saying, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a Liar; because he believeth not the</hi> Record, Mark, <hi>the Record that God gave of his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That is, God sending his Holy Spirit into the hearts of his Servants the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, He, by his Spirit in them, did bear Witness or Record, to the Truth of Salvation by his Sonne Jesus, both before, and after his coming. And thus is that place also to be understood, which saith; <hi>There are three that bear Record in Earth, the Spirit and the Water, and the Bloud.</hi> That is, the Spirit in the Apostle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Apostle speaking of Jesus Christ, and obedience to God through him, saith thus: <hi>Now he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth, despiseth not us, but God:</hi> But it is you that speak.

                  <hi>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not Man, but God, who also hath given us of his Holy Spirit.</hi> This is therefore a mighty confirmation of this Truth, that he that slights the Record or Testimony that God by his Spirit, in his Prophets and Apostles, hath testified unto us, slights the Testimony of the Spirit, who moved them to speak these Things; and if so, then I would fain know, how any man can be saved by Jesus Christ, that slights the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony concerning Christ; yea, the Testimony of his own Spirit, concerning his own Self. 'Tis true, men may pretend to have the Testimony of the Spirit, and from that Conceit, set a low Esteem on the Holy Scriptures: But that Spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them, and reacheth them so to do, it is no better than the Spirit of Satan, though it calls it self by the Name of the Spirit of Christ. <hi>To the Law therefore, and to the Testimony</hi> Try them by that: <hi>If they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no Light in them.</hi>

               <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he speaks of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Voice that he had from the Excellent Majesty, saying of Christ, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him,</hi> saith thus to him whom he wrote unto; <hi>You have also a more sure Word of Prophecie,</hi> (or of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for so you may read it) <hi>unto which you do well that you take heed.</hi> That is, Though we tell you that we had his excellent Testimony from his own Mouth, evidently, yet you have the Prophets:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66363:96"/>
We tell you this, and you need not doubt of the Truth of it; but if you should, yet you may not, must not, ought not, to question them: Search therefore unto them, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your hearts. That is, until by the same Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, you find the Truth confirmed to your Souls, which you have recorded in the Scriptures. That this Word of Prophecy, or of the Prophets, is the Scriptures, read on. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>knowing this first, that no Prophecy of the Scriptures, is of any private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20. But you will say, What needs all this ado, and why is all this time and pains spent in speaking to this, that is surely believed already? This is a Thing received by all, that they believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, that sure Word of Prophecy, and therefore you need not spend your time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these Things, and the Truth of them, seeing we grant and confess the Truth of it, before you begin to speak your judgment of them.</p>

'Tis true, there is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and historical Assent in the Head, I say, <hi>In the Head</hi> of many, or most, to the Truth contain'd in Scripture: But try them, I say, and you shall find but a little, if any, of the Faith of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in the hearts of poor men, to believe the Scriptures, and Things contained in them.

                  <hi>Letter</hi> strikes men dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. and this <hi>Paul</hi> witnessed, and found, before he could say, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the Prophets have spoken.</hi> Where he saith, <hi>I was alive without the Law once;</hi> That is, in my natural state, before the Law was set on my heart with power: <hi>But when the Commandement came, sinne revived and I died,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. <hi>And that Law that was ordained to life, I found to be unto death: For sinne taking occasion by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deceived me, and thereby slew me,</hi> ver. 10. Now that which is called the <hi>Letter</hi> in <hi>Cor.</hi> is called the Law in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. which by its power and operation, as it is wielded by the Spirit of God, doth in the first place kill and slay all those that are inabled to believe the Scriptures. I kill, saith God; That is, with my Law. I pierce, I wound, I prick men into the very heart, by shewing them their sins against my Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36, 37. And he that is ignorant of this, is also ignorant of, and doth not really and effectually believe the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But you will say, How doth the Law kill and strike dead the poor Creature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, The <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> do kill thus: It is set home upon the Soul, and discovers to the Soul its Transgressions against the Law; and shews the Soul also, that it cannot compleatly satisfie the Justice of GOD, for the breach of his Law, therefore it is condemned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. Mark, <hi>He that believes not is condemned already;</hi> To wit, by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66363:97"/>
the Law, that is, the Law doth condemn him; yea, it hath condemned him already for his sins against it, as it is written, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Now all men, as they come into the World, are in this condition, <hi>that is,</hi> condemned by the Law. Yet not believing their Condemnation by the Law really, they do not also believe really and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Law that doth condemn them. For as men have but a notion of the one, <hi>that is,</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, because of sins against the Law; so they have but a notion of the condemning, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and destroying power of the Law; for as the one is, so in these Things, always is the other: There is no man that doth really believe the Law or Gospel further, than they do feel the power and authority of them in their hearts: <hi>Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Now this <hi>Letter,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> is not to be taken in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sense, but is strictly to be tyed to the Ten Commandments, whose proper Work is onely by shewing the Soul its sins against this Law, to kill, and there leaves him stark dead, not giving him the least life, or support, or comfort, but leaves the Soul in an helpless and hopeless condition, as from it self, or any other mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:66363:98"/>'Tis true, the Law hath laid all men for dead, as they come into the World; but all men do not see themselves dead, until they see that Law that struck them dead, sticking in their Souls, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving struck them that fatal blow: As a man that is fast asleep in an house, and that on fire about his Ears, and he not knowing of it, because he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; even so, because poor Souls are asleep in sinne, though the Wrath of God, the Curse of his Law, and the flames of Hell, have beset them round about, yet they do not believe it, because they are asleep in sin. Now, as he that is awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and sees this, sees, that through this he is a dead man: Even so they that do see their state by nature, being such a sad condition, do also see themselves by that Law to be dead men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>But now, when didst thou feel the power of this first part of the Scripture, the Law, so mighty as to strike thee dead? If not, thou dost not so much as verily believe that part of Scripture that doth contain the Law in it, to be the truth of God. Yet if thou shouldest have felt something, I say something of the killing power of the Law of God in thine heart, this is not an Argument to prove, that thou believest all the Things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture; for there is Gospel as well as Law, and therefore I shall speak to that also; <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:66363:98"/>
is, whether thou hast felt the power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as well as something of the power of the Law.</p>
               <p>2. Then, thou hast found the power of the Gospel, and so believed it; thou hast found it thus with thy soul.</p>
               <p>1. Thou hast been shewed by the word or truth of the Gospel, in the light of the Spirit of Christ, that by nature thou were without the true faith of the Son of God in thy soul: For when <hi>He, the Spirit is come, he shall shew men that they believe not in me,</hi> saith Christ. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. Mark, though thou hast, as I said before, felt somewhat of the power of the Law, Letter, or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, yet if thou hast not been brought to this, to see by the spirit in the Gospel, that thou art without faith by nature, thou hast not yet tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much less believed any part of the Gospel. For the Gospel and the Law are two distinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. And they that are under the Law, may be convinced by it, and so believe the Law or first Covenant, and yet in the mean time, to be a stranger to the Covenant of promise; that is, the Gospel, and so have no hope in them, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.) There is not any promise that can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly believed, until the soul be by the Gospel converted to Jesus Christ. For though men do think never so much that they believe the things, or the word of the Gospel of our salvation, yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

thee from Heaven, except thou wert converted, thou wouldest not regard, not really believe him. But if thou dost believe the Scriptures, thou seest that they are the truth, as really believe him. But if thou dost believe the Scriptures, thou seest that they are the truth, as really as if God should speak to thee from Heaven through the Clouds, and therefore never flatter thy self, foolishly thinking, that if it were so, and so, then thou couldest believe.

Nay, this I say, thou mayst have, though thou do not believe them all. My meaning is, that if thou believe none but the ten Commandements, thy life may be according to them, a legal holy life; and if thou do believe the Gospel too, then thy life will be the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ; that is, either thou wilt live in the blessed and holy enjoyment of what is testified in the Scripture concerning the glorious things of the Lord Jesus Christ, or else, thou wilt be exceedingly panting after them. For the Scriptures carry such a blessed beauty in them to that soul that hath faith in the things contained in them, that they do take the

they have, be of that nature, and wrought by that spirit and power, that the Scripture speaketh of. I speak this of an effectual believing, without which all other is nothing unto salvation. Now then, because I would not be too tedious, I shall at this time lay down no more discoveries of such an one as doth savingly believe the Scriptures, and the things contained in them, but shall speak a few words of examination containing the things already mentioned. As,</p>
               <p>1. Thou sayest thou dost indeed and in truth effectually believe the Scriptures: I ask therefore, wast thou ever killed stark dead by the Law of works contained in the Scriptures? killed by the Law or letter, and made to see thy sins against it, and left in an helpless condition by that Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as I said, the proper work of the Law is to slay the Soul, and to leave it dead in a helpless state. For it doth neither give the Soul any comfort it self when it comes, nor doth it shew the soul where comfort is to be had; and therefore it is called <hi>the ministration of condemnation,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>the ministration of death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. For though men may have a notion of the blessed Word of God as the children had, yet before they be converted, it may truly be said of to them, <hi>Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> Mark 12. 24.</p>

in this state, we may conclude without fear, that these portions of holy Scripture belong unto them, and shall for certain be fulfilled upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Depart, Depart from me, for I will not save you. Depart, for my bloud shall not at all wash you. Depart, for you shall not set one foot into the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Depart ye cursed, ye are cursed of God, cursed of his Law, cursed of me, cursed by the Saints, and cursed by the Angels, cursed all over, nothing but cursed, and therefore depart from me; and whither?

                  </gap>ined in Scriptures.</p>
               <p>As first, Dost thou delight to sin against plain commands? <hi>thou art gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Dost thou slight and scorn the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels contained in Scriptures, and continue in so doing? <hi>then thou art gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly Dost thou continually neglect to come to Christ, and usest arguments in thine own heart to satisfy thy soul with so doing, then thou art gone. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17, 18. compared with verse 24. and <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. 3. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</hi> How shall we escape, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> there is no way to escape.</p>
               <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because God hath said we shall not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth</hi> (that was <hi>Moses</hi>), <hi>much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because he hath not only said, they shall not, but also hath bound it with an oath, saying, <hi>So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest,</hi> Heb. 3. 11. To whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest? Answer, To them that believed not, <hi>So we see, they could not enter in, because of unbelief,</hi> verse 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this will teach us what to think and conclude of such, who though they do not so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66363:105"/>
discover their folly by open and gross sins against the Law, yet will give more heed to their own spirits, and the movings thereof, though they be neither commanded, nor commended for the same in Scripture; nay, though the Scripture command and commend the contrary, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 20. then they will to the holy and revealed will of God. I say, such men are in as bad a state as the other to the full, being disobedient to Gods will revealed in his Word, as well as they, though in a different manner; the one openly transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against the plain and well known truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in it; the other, though more close and hidden, yet secretly rejecting and slighting them, giving more heed to their own spirits, and the motion thereof, although not warranted by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>A few words more, and so I shall conclude.</p>
               <p>And first, take heed that you content not your self with a bare notion of the Scriptures in your heads, by which you may go far, even so far, as to be able to dispute for the truth, to Preach the Gospel, and labour to vindicate it in opposition to gain-sayers, and yet be found at the left hand of Christ at the Judgment-day, forasmuch as thou didst content thy self with a notion or a traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledg of them.</p>
               <p>2. Have a care, that thou own the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not own one part, and neglect another,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66363:106"/>
or slight it, is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>: To own the Law, and slight the Gospel; or to think that thou must be saved by thy good doing and works, for that is all one, as if thou diddest thrust Christ away from thee, or else so to own the Gospel, as if by it thou wert ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all obedience to the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conformity to the Law in life and conversation; for in so doing, thou wilt for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain make sure of eternal vengeance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, have a care that thou put not wrong names on the things contained in the Scriptures, as to call the Law, Christ, and Christ, the Law. For some having done so (in my knowledg), have so darkned to themselves the glorious truths of the Gospel, that in a very little time they have been resolved to thwart and oppose them, and so have made room in their own souls for the devil to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, and obtained a place in hell for their own souls, to be tormented for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Against this danger therefore in reading and receiving the testimony of Scripture, learn to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between the Law and the Gospel, and to keep them clear asunder, as to the salvation of thy soul, and that thou mayest so do: In the first place, beg of God, that he would shew thee the nature of the Gospel, and set it home effectually with life and power upon thy soul by Faith. Which is this, That God would shew thee, that as thou being man, hast sinned against God; so
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66363:106"/>
Christ being God Man, hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ought thee again, and with his most pretious bloud set thee free from the bondage thou wast fallen into by thy sins; and that not upon condition, that thou wilt do thus and thus, this and the other good work; but rather, that thou being first justified freely by meer grace, through the bloud of Jesus, shouldest also receive thy strength from him who hath bought thee, to walk before him in all well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, being inabled thereto by vertue of his Spirit, which hath revealed to thy soul, that thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered already from wrath to come, by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not of thee, but of another man, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then if the Law thou readest of, tell thee in thy Conscience, thou must do this and the other good work of the Law, if ever thou wilt be saved. Answer plainly, that for thy part thou art resolved now not to work for life, but to believe in the vertue of that bloud shed upon the Cross, upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> for the remission of sins; and yet, because Christ hath justified thee freely by his Grace, thou wilt se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve him in Holiness and Righteousness all the dayes of thy life, yet not in a legal Spirit, or in a Covenant of Works, but mine obedience (say thou) I will endeavour to have it free, and chearful, out of love to my Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:66363:107"/>Thirdly, Have a care thou receive not this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the notion only, lest thou bring a just damnation upon thy soul, by professing thy self to be freed by Christs bloud from the guilt of sin, while thou remainest still a servant to the filth of sin. For I must tell you, that unless you have the true and saving work of the Faith and Grace of the Gospel in your hearts, you will either go on in a legal Holiness, according to the tenour of the Law; or else through a notion of the Gospel (the Devil bewitching, and beguiling thy understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will, and affections) thou wilt Ranter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like, turn the Grace of God into wantonness, and bring upon thy soul, double, if not treble damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that thou couldest not be contented to be damned for thy sins against the Law, but also to make ruine sure to thy soul; thou wouldest disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Gospel, and turn the Grace of God held forth, and discovered to man by that, into licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusness.</p>
               <p>But that thou mightest be sure to escape these dangerous looks on the right hand, and on the left, see that thy faith be such, as spoken of in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a faith wrought by the mighty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, revealing Christ to, and in thee, as having wholly freed thee from thy sins by his most pretious bloud. Which Faith, if thou attain

unto, will so work in thy heart, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> first thou wilt see the nature of the Law, and also the nature of the Gospel, and delight in the glory of it; and also thou wilt find an ingaging of thy heart and soul to Jesus Christ, even to the giving up of thy whole man unto him, to be ruled and governed by him to his glory, and thy comfort, by the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Lord Jesus.</p>
