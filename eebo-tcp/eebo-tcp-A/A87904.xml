         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Touching the King of Spain's Deſign to Propagate the Romiſh <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>Religion;—<hi>we're the ſecurer for that very deſigu, if wee</hi> unite upon the Baſis of the Engliſh Law: <hi>The meer</hi> Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis preferves us: <hi>whereas, If we</hi> compell that Perſon, <hi>who by</hi> divine Aſſignment, <hi>and</hi> Civil Right, <hi>is our</hi> undoubted So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; to employ Foreign Succours to recover his Dominions; <hi>It may be feared, (and 'tis but Reaſon)</hi> that Spain will Article for ſome conceſſions, in Favour of the Catholiques, <hi>more than otherwiſe would, poſſibly, be granted to them: where the</hi> Fault <hi>lies, in caſe of this extremity, let the</hi> People Judge.—</p>
            <p>'Bleſſe us,—what a Fit of <hi>Piety</hi> has taken our <hi>Friend,</hi> now of a <hi>ſodain! he calls in the Miniſters, for his Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and deſires them to declare—what Government.</hi>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note>(hee'l feed <hi>their Flocks</hi> in the mean while.) Indeed, theſe <hi>Pulpit-Politiques</hi> are not amiſſe. <hi>The Prieſts ſhall tell us what Government fits their Reformation.</hi> Pray Sir, let me help you out;—<hi>a Cloſs upon the Covenant,</hi> does your Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119547:9"/>
'tis but to tell the <hi>people,</hi> that in the <hi>Holy Tongue,</hi> KING, ſignifies COMMONWEALTH, and the work is done.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, begins now to <hi>Rumble,</hi> and <hi>Talke Idle;</hi> and, in effect, <hi>he's drawing home.</hi> But firſt he recommends <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</note>the <hi>Nurcery</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> of his <hi>Brat-project, even unto any Kinde and Powerful hand</hi> that will promote it. From <note place="margin">Ibid. Pag. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note>hence he paſſes into a Quaint <hi>Reſemblance</hi> of the ſtate of the <hi>Nation, to a man in a Feavour, and the People in Groſſe, to a Reſtive Horſe with a Galled Back:</hi> and ſo <hi>commiting the iſſue to the Lord;</hi> the man <hi>Departs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His</hi> thoughts, and <hi>mine</hi> do not <hi>agree;</hi> what ere the matter is. His <hi>Conceit</hi> is this, <hi>The Nation's mad; and Prompted by falſe appetite, covets things Miſchievous;</hi> (that is, <hi>Monarchy)</hi> the <hi>Wiſe and Charitable Phyſitian,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Commonwealths-man,) hee forces upon it what he knows to be more proper for the Cure,</hi> (and this is a <hi>Free-State)</hi>—Now <hi>here's our difference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'm of opinion, that the <hi>Phyſitians are mad;</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> ſober, we've <hi>try'd</hi> their <hi>Phyſick, for ſome dozen years together; and every day we're worſe then other upon it;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we finde upon <hi>Experiment,</hi> that they preſcribe us <hi>Poiſon,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Remedies,</hi> and that they are but <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks;</hi> they <hi>Live</hi> by <hi>Killing us.</hi> Our <hi>Former Diet agreed much better with our Conſtitution,</hi> we have no way left, but to fall to That again.</p>
            <p>But to conclude;—<hi>his conceit of</hi> a Jadiſh People, with a Gall'd Back, <hi>That's his</hi> Maſter-piece. <hi>He tells us,</hi> it will neither ſuffer a Rider, nor a Dreſſing, till it be overcome by force, and then a Child may up, and Ride it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſomewhat broad ſignes. <hi>Now by your favour, Sir, the</hi> Faults <hi>not in the</hi> Horſe; <hi>but rather in the</hi> Rider, <hi>and the</hi> Saddle; the Nation ha's been Ridden theſe <hi>12.</hi> years together, at Switch and Spur, and in a Commonwealth-Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; That must needs pinch the Back of a Monarchical people.—<hi>Nor will it be yet ſo</hi> Tame, <hi>as you</hi> imagine, <hi>Change</hi> but the <hi>SADDLE, and the RIDER,</hi> and you ſhall ſee the Nation will do well, without a Horſleech.</p>
