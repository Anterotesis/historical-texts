            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF A <hi>Church-PAPIST.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Church-Papiſt divides his Religion between his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and his Pocket, he approacheth not to the Church that he may ſerve God, but obey the Law, and it is only the frightful Face of the Law makes him put on the defenſive Maſque of the Goſpel, which he makes not uſe of as a means for the Salvation of his Soul, but for the preſervation of his Purſe. To Popery he doth indeed ſtand well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet too narrow a Soul to be willing to loſe by it: and though the roaring Bulls, Excommunications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may ſomewhat affrighten him; yet their remoteneſs leſſens their formidableneſs, inſomuch that the Apparitour ſeems more amazing: To keep him off, he preſents his Carcaſe at Church as ſeldom as poſſible, and when he doth, it is only his Body, to ſave his Bayl: When he is there, though he joyns with the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their moſt ſolemn Services, (yet with no more than his Body,) in the mean while, by himſelf, he mumbles over ſome <hi>Pater-Noſter, Ave-Marias,</hi> bleſſing himſelf from ever coming among them with a good will, rather begging of God to forgive him that he e're ſhould come there. If for ſhames ſake he cannot go out of Church before the Sermon is ended, it is a Yoke too weighty for his Popiſh gall'd Shoulder and Back; he ſpends the tedious time in curſing the Preacher for giving him ſo much; but when he is delivered out of his Priſon, he ſoon gets into his Element: having arrived home, he will be ſure to abuſe the Preacher and his Doctrine, the Preacher for holding him ſo long in Goal, and the Doctrine becauſe it too much netled him; it may be it was too Puritanical, forſooth, for ſo Vile, and Licentious a Hypocritick Monſter as he is: But when <hi>Eaſter</hi> comes, then muſt his wits to work, in plotting of ſome ſhift or other to omit the Communion; here lies the greateſt Block in his way, and therefore for certain will not be unfurniſhed with excuſes;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98612:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it's likely he is not in Charity, very true! neither can he for his Heart be with the Sacrament, for a Martyr there is not a worſer man in the World, for the main ſtreſs of his Religion hangs on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; as to Religion, were occaſion offered, he would move as faſt from one to the other as a Wind-Mill; in a Word, he has none, but to ſave Charges. But for a Traveller, there cannot be found a better in the whole World, for his Conſcience is ſo wide, as that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it's Longitude or Latitude could hitherto be found out, ſo that he may wander in it as far as he pleaſes, and nevertheleſs not reach it's Confines.</p>
            <p>He is one that ſpoils an Houſe; his Wife is a zealous Dame in Pride, Coſtlineſs and Scorn, good for nothing but a ſhow in a Fair, a meer painted Sepulcher, the very mirrour of Impudence and Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; his Children are a ſpawn of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Brood, nurtured by him, that they may be uſeful Tools in the Service of the Antichriſtian Beaſt, but withal to exerciſe Popiſh Roguery with Proteſtant Maſques.</p>
            <p>He is a man profeſſing much Loyalty to the King, but a more Treacherous one there cannot be; he will prate ſtiffly for Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but he means the Popes Supremacy; he will if forced ſpeak a gentle word againſt his dear Friends the Papiſts, but rather chuſes to ſpeak a thouſand againſt Proteſtants, eſpecially if finding any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nick name wherewith to aſperſe them.</p>
            <p>And thus let us leave him a diſſembling Hypocrite, as (if he remains impenitent) in due time his own Maſter will find him.</p>
