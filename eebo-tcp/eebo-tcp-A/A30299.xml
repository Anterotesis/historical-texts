            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know you do much deſire to hear from your friends eſpecialy having left them in this diſtracted Kingdom; yet it hath pleaſed God to bleſſe your friends with health, and your Uncle <hi>mac Shane,</hi> and your Coufen <hi>Dermot.</hi> The 13 day of this Month the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards <hi>Munſter</hi> with an Army of 7000. men, which when Sir <hi>Phelim Oneal</hi> had intelligence, marched towards him with an Army of 14000. men, ſome ten miles beyond <hi>Limbrick,</hi> where they had as famous a pitchs Battle as hath been ſince theſe troubleſome times begun; theſe Rebels and their forces continued for the ſpace of two dayes, untill Sir <hi>Patrick Weams,</hi> and ſome other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Commanders, with two pieces of Ordnance, made an aſſault upon them the 16 day of this Month, about two of the clock in the morning (they not expecting any ſuch thing) which being ſo ſuddenly performed, did ſo diſtract the Rebells, that they all ſeemed to be men without life, and ſpeedily provided every one for himſelf by flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet for all this their haſte, there were ſlain and wounded on the Rebells part to the number of 2000 men, we loſing but 40 or 50 at the moſt. Thus we daily ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65800:2"/>
how mightily God doth fight for us; To whom be praiſe and glory for evermore. After the flight of theſe miſerable people, the whole ſpoil of the Camp was taken, and a great part of it divided amongſt the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to encourage them, and the reſt is kept for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of our men. The Rebells have ſince aſſembled, which when Sir <hi>Patrick Weams</hi> heard of, did march towards them, but could not cauſe them to ſtay, nor durſt they fight, the fear which the laſt skirmiſh had ſtricken them into being ſtill in them, and the want of Arms and Powder, which if they had, they would ſoon be with us. We want men and money extraordinarily; for had not God bleſſed us with this little pillage to relieve our men, we had been in a miſerable condition, but we hope, and daily expect both from <hi>England:</hi> which if a ſpeedy courſe be not taken, it will much endanger the loſſe of this Kingdom, and the lives of many poor diſtreſſed Proteſtants: for there is ſcarce an Iriſh Gentleman, but is turned to the Rebells; for they call themſelves the holy Catholique Camp, and do daily expect Supplies from ſome forraigne enemies.</p>
            <p>Your friends hope to ſee you ſhortly: your wife and children are all well, and remember you daily in their prayers. So, till I ſee you, and ever, I ſhall remain your aſſured loving friend,</p>
