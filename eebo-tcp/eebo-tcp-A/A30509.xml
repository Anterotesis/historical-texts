         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Guardian; And of <hi>Charles Allanſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>John Evans</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> Gentlemen: Lately Referred to the Committee of Privileges and Elections of the Honourable Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>SIr <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi> Petitioned the Honourable Houſe of Commons, complaining of ſeveral forcible Entries, Riots, and other exorbitant Proceedings of <hi>Arthur Owen</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and about 50 other Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Servants and Dependants, praying, That he might be admitted to take his Remedy at Law and in Equity againſt the ſaid Member, Mr. <hi>Arthur Owen,</hi> to have the Benefit of a Recovery had at Law againſt him in the Interval of the Sitting of Parliament, for the Houſe and Demeſne of <hi>Vaynol,</hi> lately forcibly wreſted from him, and other Matters mentioned in the Petition: And that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Privilege, as a Member of the ſaid Honourable Houſe, may be waved as to him, and all Perſons concerned with and for him, in the Matters complained of by the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>Since the exhibiting of the Petition above-mentioned, there hath been another Petition preſented to the ſaid Honourable Houſe by Dame <hi>Jane Salusbury,</hi> by which ſhe ſuggeſts, that ſhe is a Coparcener, and entitled to <hi>Vaynol</hi> and Demeſne thereof, (being the Lands in Controverſy) by the ſame Title as the Member Mr. <hi>Arthur Owen,</hi> and prays, That ſhe may not be prejudiced in her Poſſeſſion and Right by any Proceeding upon the Petition above-mentioned againſt Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and prayed, that ſhe might be be heard in the Premiſſes as to the Matter in her Petition; and at the very Day that the latter Petition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, a Complaint was made to the ſaid Honourable Houſe againſt the ſaid <hi>Charles Allanſon,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans</hi>; and againſt <hi>Cadwallader Wynne,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bulkeley</hi> Eſquires, (againſt which two laſt-mentioned Perſons the ſaid Member hath let fall his Proſecutions) for a Breach of the Privilege of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Challenging and Menacing the Member, proceeding againſt him at Law, entring upon his Poſſeſſion, diſtreining his Tenants, reſcuing Diſtreſſes by force, and aſſaulting and wounding his Servants. All which Matters of the ſeveral Petitions and Complaints were referred to the Committee above-mentioned to Examine and Report the ſame; and accordingly the Committee have examined the Matters, and are to report the ſame upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Matter of Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Petition was proved before the Committee, and the Committee came to theſe Reſolutions, as followeth.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> deceaſed, who died at <hi>London,</hi> gave it in Charge to Mr. <hi>Allanſon</hi> and <hi>John Evans,</hi> his Executors, to bury him from his Houſe at <hi>Vaynal,</hi> in his Pariſh-Church of <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi>; and <hi>John Evans,</hi> who was his Steward, made Proviſion of Meat, Drink, and Neceſſaries, at <hi>Vaynol-Hall</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the Fifth Day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, 1696. Mr. <hi>Arthur Owen,</hi> the Member, accompanied with about 50 other Perſons, his Domeſtick Servants, Tenants, and Dependants, forcibly and riotouſly entred into and upon <hi>Vaynol-Hall</hi> and Demeſne, and afterwards turned out all the late Servants of Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> deceaſed, (and then of Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s) then in Poſſeſſion, by force out of the Poſſeſſion, and all the Cattel late of Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> deceaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into the Highway, when the Ground was covered with a very deep Snow, without allowing any Neceſſary Proviſion for the Men or Beaſts, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Death one or more of the ſaid Cattel, and refuſed the Corps of Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> deceaſed admiſſion there, by reaſon whereof he was buried out of <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, and his Retinue, did break open the Doors of and within <hi>Vaynol</hi> Houſe and Outhouſes, and did eat and drink all the Proviſions of Meat and Drink (of great Value) made for the Deceaſed's Burial, and broke open many Scrutores, Cabinets, Cheſts and Trunks at <hi>Vaynol,</hi> and in another Houſe of the ſaid Deceaſed at <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> and carried away Writings and other things found therein, and eat up and conſumed the Fodder of Hay and Straw, and the Corn at <hi>Vaynol</hi>; and uſed and imbezzeled Linnen, Bedding, Plate, and other part of the Deceaſed's Houſhold-Goods at <hi>Vaynol,</hi> and conveyed away Fire-Arms to the value of 250 <hi>l.</hi> a large Cedar Table, and other part of the Deceaſed's Perſonal Eſtate from <hi>Vaynol-Hall,</hi> and the Deceaſed's Houſe at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvon,</hi> againſt the Conſent of Mr. <hi>John Evans,</hi> the Executor.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, and his Servants and Attendants, did ſpoil and waſte <hi>Vaynol-Houſe</hi> and Demeſne, by eradicating many Walnut, Lime, and other young Trees planted as Ornaments to the ſaid Houſe, and the Roots and Plants in the beſt Garden; and did fall many Timber and other Trees upon <hi>Vaynol</hi> Demeſne, and worked and diſpoſed of many of them; and pulled down two Bays of the Loft over one of the Stables at <hi>Vaynol,</hi> and all the Boards and Joyces thereof; and drained three Fiſh-Ponds well ſtored with Carp and other Fiſh upon <hi>Vaynol</hi> Demeſne, and carried away the Fiſh thereof to <hi>Bodeon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member's Habitation in <hi>Angleſey,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>William Wynne</hi> one other of the Rioter's Houſe, and to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Friends elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, with the ſaid <hi>William Wynne</hi> and many other his Adherents, did forcibly enter upon the Farms of ſeveral of the Tenants of the Decedant Sir <hi>William Williams,</hi> even thoſe by ancient Leaſes for long Terms in being, made for Valuable Conſiderations, and by Force and the Menaces of the Breach of the Privilege of Parliament, in caſe they Reſiſted, turned the Tenants, Families and Cattle, out of their Poſſeſſions, and particularly forcibly broke and enter'd into the ſeveral Farms of the ſaid <hi>John Evans</hi> and <hi>Ellin Evans</hi> his Mother, being Tenants for long Terms yet to come, made for valuable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and turned their Goods and Cattle out of Poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſed them thereof, and by Menaces, and by ſuch Unwarrantable Practices forced ſome of the Tenants to Attorn Tenants to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> in tears againſt their Will.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, in the Interval of the Sitting of the Parliament, Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi> by his Leſſee brought his Ejectment in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>William Wynne</hi> (Tenants in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Vaynol</hi> and Demeſne) and after ſeveral motions and other regular Proceedings at Law the 17th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt, before the Sitting of the Parliament, that Cauſe came to be tryed at the Exchequer-Bar by a <hi>Shropſhire</hi> Jury, but Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, (though Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> the Lawyer and others of his Council were then preſent) made no Defence therein, but menaced that Court with the Privilege of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi> by his Leſſe had Judgment at a very great Expence, upon which Judgment, Poſſeſſion was delivered to Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Leſſee the Firſt day of <hi>December</hi> laſt, and after that he had been forced to Gratifie the Sheriff with Twenty Guinea's, and to give him a Bond of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to Indemnifie him againſt the Privilege of Parliament, he by his Servants had and continued the Poſſeſſion thereof till about Five of the Clock in the Morning of the Laſt Day of the ſame Month of <hi>December,</hi> when Nine of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Dmeſticks, accompanied with about 30 or 40 other Perſons forcibly Enter'd <hi>Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol</hi> Houſe, and Aſſaulted and Beat Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Servants, and turned them out of Poſſeſſion, alledging that they did ſo, and took Poſſeſſion for Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Owen</hi> the Member, and by Authority of Parliament, which was a far Better Authority than the Sheriff had, when he gave Poſſeſſion thereof, and ever ſince continued in Poſſeſſion in an Hoſtile manner, and Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Cattle have ever ſince Grazed upon the Demeſne: All which was proved before the Committee by the Petitioner, Sir <hi>Bouchier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, produced as Witneſſes, <hi>William Wynne</hi> and <hi>Thomas Davies,</hi> who were concerned in moſt of the Riots above-mentioned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt by Information, and Indictments found for the ſame: Wherefore (being two of the Criminals) their Evidence was rejected, and then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee came to a Reſolution that it was their Opinion, That the Servants of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, were Guilty of the Forcible Entry on the 31ſt of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt, and that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member, in the matter of forcible Entry and Detainer, ought to have no Privilege of Parliament.</p>
            <p>As to the Lady <hi>Salusbury</hi>'s Petition, no Council or Witneſſes attended for her to make good her Allegation when called in, though the Reſpondent's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel attended, and therefore, and upon reading the ſaid Petition, the Committee were of Opinion, That there was no matter of Privilege in her Petition.</p>
            <p>As to the Complaint concerning Mr. <hi>Allanſon, John Evans</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> The Perſons produced againſt them were <hi>Hugh Morgan, Richard Owen,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>William Wynne,</hi> all concerned in the Riots above-mentioned, and <hi>Hugh Morgan,</hi> after having prevaricated with the Committee, by refuſing to Anſwer in Engliſh, averring he could ſpeak none, till after that it was proved upon him, that he could ſpeak Engliſh, Declared that the ſald <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> (one of Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Tenants and Agents) after that ſeveral of his Neighbours had been haraſſed and diſturbed in their Poſſeſſions, uttered ſome Menaces of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> the Members, in Caſe they invaded his Poſſeſſion, and that upon the laſt Riot at <hi>Vaynol,</hi> he did at a diſtance aſſault one of the Rioters, who was a Tenant, and a Day-Labourer to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>William Wynne</hi> Depoſed, that Mr. <hi>Allanſon</hi> had menaced him in the Interval of the Sitting of the Parliament, being Mr. <hi>Owen's</hi> Attorney at Law; and it appearing that Mr. <hi>Allanſon</hi> and <hi>John Evans</hi> were the Deceaſed's Executors, and Mr. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> Sir <hi>Bouchier Wray's</hi> Agents and Tenants, and all concerned to Vindicate his and their Rights and his Poſſeſſion, and the Witneſſes produced, being Criminals, upon theſe and other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Committee have reſolved, That they are of Opinion, Mr. <hi>Allanſon, John Evans</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> are not Guilty of any breach of Priviledge.</p>
            <p>The Matters of Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Petition, and the Complaints againſt Mr. <hi>Allanſon,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> have been ſolemnly examined, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Salusbury</hi>'s Petition, not ſupported by any Proof, and we conceive the ſame impracticable; For if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member ſhall have no Priviledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we hope that he ſhall have none to protect her, who ought to pay Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi>'s Coſts; and Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey</hi> having been at a very great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, hath ſent his Witneſſes home.</p>
            <p>If Sir <hi>Bouchier Wrey,</hi> the Infant, after all his Expenſive and Juſt Proſecution ſhall only be admitted to proceed Criminally for the ſaid forcibly Entry and Detainer, then he reaps no Benefit by theſe Proceedings: It is therefore humbly Hoped that he may be admitted to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Member and his Adherents, by Civil Actions at Law and in Equity, for all the Matters complained of in his Petition.</p>
