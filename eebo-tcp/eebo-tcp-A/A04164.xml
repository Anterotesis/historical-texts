            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, as wiſe mariners, though wind and weather be never ſo faire and calme, provide for a ſtorme; ſo I wiſh you provide your tacklings; for I aſſure you, we ſhall have a great ſtorme: but feare neither wind nor ſea, rock nor ſand; for Chriſt is our pilot; and every paſſenger, though much weather-beaten, yet ſhall in the end arrive ſafely at the wiſhed haven: only, as <hi>Paul</hi> before he tooke ſhip, kneeled downe and<note place="margin">Acts 20. 36.</note> praied; be not wanting in your private praiers, that God would ſend us a proſperous journey.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe you, I will firſt parallel this ſtorie with ſome other both poſitive &amp; exemplary Scriptures: the former is in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> where the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that go downe to the ſea in ſhips, &amp; occupie their buſineſſe in great waters, theſe ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and raiſeth the ſtormie wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof; they mount up to the heaven, and goe downe againe to the depths; their ſoule melteth,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:7859:8"/>
                  <hi>becauſe of the trouble; they reele to and fro, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end; then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their diſtreſſes; he maketh the ſtorme a calme, ſo that the waves thereof are ſtill; then are they glad becauſe they be quiet, ſo he bringeth them to their deſired haven: Oh that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works to the children of men</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 107. 23. 5.</note>. Oh what an excellent Comment is that, on this ſtorie! Other ſuch examples the Scriptures afford; as a like ſtorie we have in <hi>Ionah,</hi> when he flying to <hi>Tharſis</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, the Lord raiſed a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſtorme and tempeſt, the ſea wrought and was troublous, the ſhip like to be broken, ſo as the mariners were afraid, and cried to their gods, and caſt forth their wares into the ſea; but the ſea would not be calme, till <hi>Ionah</hi> was caſt into it <note n="b" place="margin">Ionah. 1. 4.</note>. A like we have, in the New Teſtament, in <hi>Pauls</hi> dangerous voyage towards <hi>Rome,</hi> there riſing ſo great a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, that all hope to be ſaved was taken away, and though they caſt out the very tacklings and all, yet upon boards, &amp; broken peeces of the ſhip, all came ſafe to land <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 27. 14.</note>. The letters of which ſtorie afford many excellent and uſefull inſtructions, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſea-men; yea and to be laid up for future uſe of us all; for howſoeuer we have beene borne, and lived long upon the land, yet it may be, we have beene, or we know not how we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, and toſſed upon ſea, before we die. But ſpecially the myſterie doth greatly concerne us all: for preparation whereunto, be pleaſed to note, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7859:8"/>
there are many hiſtories in the word, which either are Allegoricall in ſignification, or may be Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically compared and reſembled; we haue good warrant from the Scriptures for it. It is a plaine ſtorie, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſons, the one by a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, <hi>Sarai;</hi> the other by a bond-maid, <hi>Hagar</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 16. penult. &amp; 21. 2.</note>: yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>theſe things are an Allegorie, and ſignifie the two Teſtaments</hi>

the performing thereof. In the procurement of deliverance, three things are to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, to whom in this diſtreſſe they ſeek for deliverance, <hi>(his Diſciples came to Him:)</hi> ſecondly, what they doe being come to him, <hi>(they awaken him:)</hi> thirdly, what they ſay unto him; wherin obſerve, 1. a great Suit <hi>(Lord ſave us.)</hi> 2. A weightie Reaſon <hi>(wee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.)</hi> In the performance of deliverance thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, note a double Reprehenſion: 1. Of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: and he reproveth them for two things, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, exceſſe of feare, <hi>(why are yee fearefull?)</hi> 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith <hi>(O yee of little faith.)</hi> In the ſecond, we are to note two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Preparation, <hi>(he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe)</hi> 2. Reprehenſion, <hi>(he rebuked the winds and ſeas.)</hi> The effect of this deliverance is two-fold, firſt in winds and ſeas, <hi>(there was agreat calme:)</hi> ſecondly, in diſciples and beholders; &amp; that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt admiration, <hi>(the men marvelled)</hi> and ſecondly, proclamation <hi>(who is this, that even the winds and ſeas doe obey him?)</hi> Thus I have made readie the ground, laid the foundation, propoſed a modell, laid in a readineſſe the materials; the halfe of my work is now over, but the whole profit therof to you remains. Of theſe parts therfore now orderly for our further inſtruction and edification.

Now if wee compare this with the other Euangeliſts, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that Chriſt had taught the people many things in parables <note n="*" place="margin">Marke 4. 34. Luke 8. 22.</note>, and therefore went purpoſely to the ſea, that he might by miracle there (as it were) ſeale the truth of that doctrine which he had taught, and delivered; for as our Saviour asked <hi>Philip, Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat? did it onely to prove him, for he himſelfe knew what he would doe</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Iohn 6. 6.</note>: So our Saviour knew what he would doe on the ſea, and for what worke he purpoſely went thither at this time.</p>

                  <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 22. 1.</note>: not that God was ignorant what was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Chriſt ignorant, what was in his Apoſtles; but they were ignorant what was in themſelves, and preſumed they had more faith, than they had: wherefore it pleaſed our Saviour Chriſt, by bringing them into this danger on the ſea, to let them ſee the weakneſſe of their faith, and by doing ſuch a miracle ſtrengthen it, and make them in all future dangers, to reſt more ſtedfaſtly on his Almightie power, and not feare any evill, by water or land.</p>

               <p>Oh, if the graces of God, as Knowledge, Faith,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> Patience, Humilitie, Zeale, doe appeare in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meaſure, as they did in <hi>Abraham, Iob, David,</hi> and others, ſpecially the holy Martyrs; how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it for Gods honour, and their true comfort

               <p>Secondly, and more ſtrictly they were called his<note place="margin">2</note> Diſciples, that not only learned and profeſſed the Goſpell, but were alſo called and appointed of him to preach the Goſpell to others.

Thus we have ſhipped the paſſengers. Now, as friends at parting have commonly ſome loving Charge or other; ſuffer me, before they launch forth, to give to them, and in them, to you and us all, a double warning; <hi>viz.</hi> Beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from, and of diviſion among; I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of departure, and diviſion; goe not out, fall not out.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, howſoever <hi>Iudas</hi> the covetous<note place="margin">1. <hi>Departure.</hi> Departure upon two pretences, 1. Doctrine: 2.

I doe not deny, but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects it may be warrantable for a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from one viſible Church, to become a member of another; yea, for a time to dwel where no viſible
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7859:20"/>
Church is; but to depart, becauſe of ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpecially in diſcipline, or manners, is the dangerous departure, condemned by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ancient Fathers, in <hi>Donatiſts, Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Cathariſts,</hi> and ſuch like Separatiſts; of all whom <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhipped the paſſengers: I have given<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> them their charge. Looking upon the ſea, I ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhips, when I come to handle the veſſel wherein they paſſe. It is a needfull queſtion for theſe daies, which is that ſhip wherein Chriſt and his diſciples paſſe, and how may it be infallibly knowne from all other? When I come to that, I hope to make it cleare to all (whoſe eies the god of this world hath not blinded) that all the pinnaces of Heretikes and Schiſmatikes, and ſpecially that great Romiſh ſhip, though painted and gilded faire, and hath large ſailes, with top and top gallant, tacklings and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is indeed no better than an hot man of war, a ſhip of Pyrates.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7859:23"/>
doe uſe all their skill to ſtop this leake; yet ſhall they not be able: it ſhall one day ſinke, and make ſhipwrack. In the meane time, know, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a glorious viſible Church, a faire ſhip, wherein Chriſt and his diſciples are, and therefore (for this time) I diſcharge you, with renewing of the former charge; Take heed you depart not from her; take heed you cauſe not diviſion in her; but every man ſeeke her welfare, follow faith to the conſervation of the ſoule, and keepe the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace: beware of Hereſie, beware of Schiſme: God, for his Chriſt ſake, helpe us to keepe faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the end, and in the end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>It is generally agreed, by the ancient Fathers,<note place="margin">Mysticall ſenſe.</note> and later Divines, both orthodoxall and heretical, that the Ship is a moſt excellent Embleme and Hieroglyphick, wherein is moſt lively (almoſt in all things, as may be gathered from the Scriptures, and writings of learned Divines) repreſented, the ſtate and condition of a true viſible Church in this world; The Ship (I ſay) reſembleth the Church; the Sea, the world; the ſtorme, perſecutions; Chriſt his ſleepe, his patience; the Haven, is Heaven; the Pilot is Chriſt; the Mariners, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Miniſters; the Paſſengers, Chriſtians; divers roomes, divers orders and offices; the maine Maſt, Chriſts Croſſe; the Sailes, profeſſion of godlineſſe; the wind, the Spirit of God; the contrarie winds, the counterblaſts of Satan, by falſe Doctrine; the Card and Compaſſe whereby they ſaile, Gods Word; the <hi>pixis nautica,</hi> which only eieth the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed North Pole, Faith; the Cable and cordage,

If I ſhould now inſiſt vpon theſe things, and ſhew you both by what authoritie, from Scriptures, or Fathers, or both, I frame this Allegorie; and how fit this reſemblance is, in all the paſſages thereof, in many a Lecture, I could not diſpatch it.

To ſearch<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> all the Ships, Pinneſſes, and Cock-boats, which are or have beene upon the Sea, were an endleſſe labour, (there are or have beene ſo many Iewes, Turks, Arrians, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts,) yea and fruitleſſe; for many of them which formerly have failed faire, and troubled the eies of beholders, have ſuffered Ship-wrack, and are long ſince ſunck: only ſome few peeces of their broken Ships, doe float here and there; and others have received great leakes, and will ſinke of themſelues; which ſhew, that Chriſt is not in them.

I will only ſelect one or twaine: and firſt be it knowne vnto you, that whereas there are only two infallible marks &amp; notes, of a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, viz. the ſincere preaching of the word; and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments: theſe are none of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> notes, he doth with all his learning oppoſe them as no true notes: I muſt therefore ioyne in ſome others of his owne coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, granting ſuch to be, as indeed are not, that yet it may appeare, even thoſe doe more concerne our Church, than theirs: which though it might be made good, in examination of them all, yet I will only chuſe two, becauſe I will not confound the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7859:37"/>
memories of the weake; and ſuch two, as are moſt viſible, that ſo the common people may ſee which is the true Church indeed.</p>
               <p>The former of theſe (but the eighth in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> number) is holines of doctrine <note n="*" place="margin">Sanctitas doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae. Bell.

I would to God <hi>Bellarmine</hi> meant as he ſaith, that by this note of holy doctrine, it might be, without partialitie, tryed which is the true Church: for the Scriptures containing the moſt holy doctrine, it would follow, that what Church doth preach and profeſſe that doctrine purely, by this note muſt needs be the true Church of God. But I doe wonder, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould dare to offer ſuch a note; whereas they teach for doctrine their owne Traditions &amp; Ceremonies, give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Pope to diſpenſe with the Law of God; yea robbe Chriſt of all his offices, (as might be ſhewed by induction of particulars) give men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to finne, by their Auricular Confeſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and Pardons, and eaſie deliverance out of Purgatory.

In a word, the Romiſh doctrine, is a moſt prophane, carnall, and obſcene doctrine, and moſt pleaſing to carnall, wicked, and unregenerate men, a maine cauſe why it hath ſo many profeſſors; all the holineſſe of it, is but in Apiſh and mimicall geſtures, bowing of knee, lifting vp of eyes, and hands, abſtaining from ſome meats, weeping, knocking, croſſing, whipping, which are preſcribed? So that as a worthy Diuine amongſt us hath truly ſaid, a great part of Popery is very Magicke <note n="†" place="margin">Perkins T. 1. pag. 40.

To conclude, ſeeing the doctrine of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, is a renuing and reviving of all ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; a doctrine of liberty, and all licentious living; teaching and allowing moſt filthy poſitions, and practiſes; the Romiſh Church, is not the true Church of God, or ſhip, wherein Chriſt and his diſciples paſſe; becauſe they have not holy doctrine.

Theſe helpes, that I may range them in order, and yet but touch them, are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> either from ſuch as did ſpeak, or from ſuch as did write the word. The Prophets, Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, in preaching to the people, how have they called on men to heare, harken, and conſider what they ſaid unto them! Helpes from writing (and ſpecially ſome of theſe, to ſuch as are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7859:42"/>
able to reade the originall copies, wherein ſome of them only continue) are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> in words, or in forme: words are principally two, the one initiall, or in the beginning, which is the word in my Text, [<hi>Behold;</hi>] or finall, and at the end, which is the word [<hi>Selah</hi>] at the end of many ſentences, in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk</hi> onely, and retained in tranſlations. About which word, learned men have much diſputed, and laid downe ſeverall opinions, with rehearſall whereof, I will not now trouble you. I take it to be derived from ſuch a word as ſignifieth to lift up <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Selah. Sic Lorin. in Pſal. 3. 3. pag. 56. coll.</hi> 2.</note>; and the <hi>Septuagint, Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> interpret it, <hi>Diapſalma,</hi> the change of the tune or ſong; for by changing the tune, &amp; extraordinarily lifting up the voice, in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſtreine, they did ſignifie ſuch were moſt remarkable ſentences. I told you, that alſo there are helpes of attention, from the forme of writing, I meane in the Hebrew copies, (for Interpreters take no notice hereof) but are moſt obſervable of all ſuch as are learned, and they are three-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of letters, prickes, or blankes. Letters are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> either in regard of location, or of proportion. In regard of location; a very ſtrange &amp; remarkable (if not myſticall) thing it is, that <hi>mem clauſum,</hi> which is ever finall, ſhould onely in one word in all the Bible be found ſo written, in the midſt <note n="†" place="margin">

Secondly, for proportion; whereas the Hebrewes were moſt curious in their Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie; yet in ſome places, ſome letters are of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſize, and hold no proportion with the reſt of the word or ſentence. As where <hi>Iacob</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7859:42"/>
his ſonnes, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> for their cruell murthering of the <hi>Sichemites;</hi> they anſwered him with bigge words, <hi>Should he deale with our ſiſter, as with an Harlot</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 34. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note>? And in the word <hi>Zonah,</hi> the firſt letter is of an extraordinary proportion: and where it is ſaid, That <hi>Abraham mourned for Sarah his wife</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 23. 2.</note>. <hi>Caph</hi> in [<hi>Bachah</hi>] is of a very little ſize: and as in letters, ſo alſo in prickes, (whereof I lately gave ſome inſtance in this place) ſome words ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch prickes as are neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grammatical, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall, nor Muſicall; and ſometimes in blanckes, breaking off, and making a pawſe in the midſt of a ſentence, and a great ſpace left emptie, and onely an <hi>o</hi> in it, as where it is ſaid, <hi>Cain talked with his brother</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 4. 8. 35. 22. Deut. 2. 8.</note>; and theſe things are preſerved in all their copies, and therefore could be no error in the Printer. But the moſt common word of attention and regard, thorowout the whole Scriptures, of old and new Teſtament, is this initiall word, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe of demonſtration, [<hi>Behold</hi>] which is ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in three caſes. Firſt, when ſome ſtrange thing<note place="margin">1</note> is preſented to the eye; as when <hi>Ieſus came forth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple roabe, Pilat ſaid to the people, Behold the man</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 19. 5.</note>: the ſtrangeſt thing that ever was preſented to the eye of man, never the like before nor ſince, the Sonne of God, who weareth the crowne of eternall glory, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is uſed, when both ſome thing is to<note place="margin">2</note> be ſeene with the bodily eye, and the minde is to contemplate, and conſider ſomething repreſented, by that viſible ſpectacle, as when Chriſt rode into
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7859:43"/>
the Citie of Ieruſalem, the Prophet calleth, <hi>Behold thy King commeth mecke, and ſitting on an Aſſe</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 21. 5. Zach. 9. 9.</note>. Oh ſee him ride with thine eyes, oh conſider his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with thy minde!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when men are bid (<hi>Behold</hi>) when yet<note place="margin">3.</note> nothing can be ſeene with bodily eye, and then it ſignifieth, regard and conſider. So the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and beare a ſonne</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Eſay 7. 14.</note>, that was many yeeres after fulfilled according to the letter, therfore the people in thoſe dayes could but conſider it. So here, we are bid, <hi>Behold, there aroſe a tempest,</hi> that tempeſt is many hundred yeers agoe calmed, we cannot ſee it with our bodily eyes, but whereſoever this ſtorie is preached, the people ſhall be called upon to muſe, and meditate, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and conſider the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Vſe of all that hath beene ſaid, is to move<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> us with conſideration of our dulneſſe, who need ſo many, and ſuch great helps, to provoke us to the conſideration of heavenly things, Gods word, and works. Oh, for earthly things, as dignitie, wealth,<note place="margin">Aggravation</note> honour, preferment, our profits, or pleaſures, wee are watchful, and carefull enough, as quick-ſighted as Eagles to ſee things a farre off, and exceeding at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to whomſoever ſhall talke of theſe things. Yea, many doe even weare away themſelues with continuall care, thought, and meditation; or if at any time we fall into a ſlumber about theſe matters, yet the leaſt whiſpering will make us to ſtart up, ſtand upon both legs, looke round about us, and over every bodies head, yea ride, and runne, and what not? but for the greateſt works of God, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7859:43"/>
myſteries of godlineſſe, wee have no eyes in our heads, to ſee them, no eares to heare them, no mindes to conſider them, but pleaſe our ſelves in our ſpirituall ſluggiſhneſſe, and drowſineſſe, like the ſluggard in the Proverbs, folding our armes, and ſaying, <hi>Yet a little more ſleepe, a little more ſlumber,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt (in love of our ſalvation) doth call upon us, and ſtir us up to attend, <hi>Behold, behold.</hi> So much for the note of attention.</p>

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 69. 1, 2.</note>: And againe, <hi>The flouds of ungodly men made me afraid</hi>

Diſciples came upon it; but then, behold a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. Good Lord, what ſtirres were there upon Chriſt his preachings? Some ſaid <hi>he was a good man,</hi> and ſome ſaid <hi>no,</hi> but <hi>he deceived the people</hi>

Good Lord, the tumults and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores, that grew in <hi>Athens, Corinth, Epheſus, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, Lyſtra, Iconium,</hi> and other Cities, where the Apoſtles came, and preached the Goſpell! But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God raiſed up his ſervant <hi>Luther,</hi> to preach the Goſpell; oh what thundring and lightning from <hi>Rome!</hi> How did the Popes Bulls roare, and his Excommunications flie? What a tempeſt in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, France, England,</hi> and almoſt in the whole Chriſtian world? What eager Diſputations in Univerſities? What part-takings, ſome of the Princes with him, ſome againſt him. It is ſo ſtill: in every Kingdome, Citie, Towne, or Pariſh, where the Goſpell is ſincerely preached and profeſſed, there will be diviſions, and ſtirres, and troubles; ſome zealous followers, others malicious oppoſers; labouring to ſtop the paſſage of the Goſpell, and to <hi>pervert the ſtraight wayes of the Lord</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Acts 13. 10.</note>: and ſome neither <hi>cold, nor hot</hi>

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note>: and Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Thinke not that I am come to ſend peace on earth, I came not to ſend peace but a ſword; I am come to ſet a man at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance againſt his father, and the daughter againſt her mother</hi>

to <hi>fire,</hi> the world is compared to <hi>water:</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Similies.</note> is quiet; but if fire come, what a contention is there? He hath againe compared the Goſpell to a fanne: the heape lieth quietly till the fanne come; but then doth the chaffe flie. The world is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaked lime, but now and then a ſmall cracke; but if the water of the word be powred upon it, then it heateth, and ſmoketh, and ſparkleth, and flieth, as if it would ſet all on fire. The word is like <hi>light,</hi> and Chriſt compared to the <hi>Sunne:</hi> in the darkneſſe, though things differ never ſo much in colour, yet they ſeeme all alike; but when light commeth, then the varietie of colours is ſoone deſcried. In the time of ignorance, men may thinke they accord in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Iudgement and Affection; but when the light of the word commeth, the thoughts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts are opened, and then the diverſitie of humours, and varietie of affections and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appeareth.</p>
               <p>The very wicked doe ſee this truth, and abuſe it<note place="margin">Prevention.</note> to a wrong end laying all the blame on the Goſpel, and the preaching of it. What more common in theſe daies, than to heare men ſay, whilſt all were obedient to the Pope and Church of Rome, what great peace? what warres but againſt the Turke the common enemy? But ſince the preaching of the Goſpell, what ſects, warres, tumults, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, what killing, murthering, maſſacring, and burning of one another, giving advantage to the common enemy, to incroach, and in the end to prevaile greatly? What more common than to heare country people complaine, So long as we had

nothing but Service, or Reading, we lived very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, peaceably, and neighbourly, every man medling but with his owne buſineſſe; but ſince we have had ſo much preaching, there is nothing but ſiding and partaking, all good fellowſhip is loſt; nothing but ſtrife and contention, and quarrelling of neighbour againſt neighbour, yea many times diviſion in the ſame houſe, and father and ſonne, yea huſband and wife divided, and varying in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? It is like enough that the moſt of this is true; but, what is properly the cauſe, is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Is it Chriſt, and his Goſpell, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? So too many conceive, and are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay, and wiſh they had leſſe of it, and they thinke they ſhould have peaceable and golden times; and then take occaſion to open their blacke mouthes, and raile upon it, and the Preachers, and profeſſors of it, accuſing them for factious, humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, turbulent, ſeditious: as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Eliah, It was he that troubled all Iſrael, 1 King.</hi> 18. 17. and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> accuſed <hi>Paul</hi> for a peſtilent fellow and mover of ſedition, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 5.

There cannot be a greater argument, that a man or woman are altogether carnall, and unregenerate, and earthly, than that they have no experience of this ſpirituall warfare &amp; conflict, but rather glorie, that they never doubted of Gods love, remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſalvation, but were ever aſſured of thoſe things, not doubting but if any be ſaved, they ſhall. Oh, it is moſt wonderfull, to heare the vild and ſtrange preſumption of men and women, who yet are moſt ſinfull, and wicked in their lives and converſations; and thereby proclaime, that there is no true knowledge, feare, nor love of God in them. Oh, this is a fearefull condition indeed, &amp; a flat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a reprobate ſenſe, of a benummed, yea a ſeared, and cauterized Conſcience: therefore tremble to thinke of this, but reioice in the other.</p>

               <p>Secondly, note, that in this ſtorme ſome one doth<note place="margin">2.</note> not goe of himſelfe, neither doe they make one or two, as <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> their Deputies, or Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to goe and awaken Chriſt, and to pray him ſave them; but the Text ſaith [<hi>the Diſciples went to him.</hi>] So the ſecond way of comfort which God hath appointed, that ſinners ſinke not into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, is confeſſion of our caſe and condition, and to crave the helpe and comfort of others praiers and good counſels, and above all the comfort of the Miniſters abſolution, in the name of Chriſt, pronouncing remiſſion to everie true penitent.

againſt us as enemies to praying, faſting, virginitie, good workes, confeſſion, yea that the people in our Church are deprived of a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that though their Soules be never ſo oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and diſquieted through ſinne, they have none to goe and confeſſe unto, that hath the ſeale of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie: We give all the world to underſtand, that we neither write or ſpeake againſt any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer workes of pietie and godlineſſe, but againſt their corruptions; not againſt praier, but perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it in a ſtrange Tongue; for cuſtome, not of conſcience; according to the number of Beads, not ſenſe of want.

As we begin our publike Service with confeſſion of our ſinnes, and have remiſſion of ſinnes by Gods Miniſter pronounced to all ſuch as truly repent, and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7859:57"/>
beleeve the Goſpell. So if any be troubled in Soule, and cannot rightly apply the meanes of comfort, on death-bead, or at other times, our Church in the ſecond exhortation before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, exhorteth ſuch to repaire to ſome godly and diſcreet Miniſter, from whoſe praier, counſell, and advice, they may receive comfort, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be quieted; hath preſcribed a forme of abſolution; and in the Canons of our Church <note n="“" place="margin">Canon 113.</note>, are enjoined, upon paine of irregularitie, all lawfull ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie. And this is a ſingular meanes which God and our Church hath preſcribed, for the quieting and calming of ſtormie and tempeſtuous Soules; and which cannot be godly uſed, without much comfort.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt way for calming of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">3</note> tempeſts in the minds of Gods Children, is the voice and ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>he rebuked the winds and Seas;</hi> and ſo ſtill doth ſpeake to the troubled Soule. Yea whatſoever benefits, or friends, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, or pleaſures, any man have, yet none, nor all theſe, can ſoundly comfort the diſtreſſed Soule, but the word of Chriſt. Therefore ſaith <hi>Ieremie, Thy Word is the joy and rejoicing of mine heart</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ierem. 25. 16.</note>. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart</hi>

               <p>But me thinketh I heare ſome object againſt this,<note place="margin">1 Obiect.</note> and ſay: Oh I was never troubled till I began to hearken to the Word, till I got a Bible and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reading, and tooke delight to heare Sermons: I thinke it was the hearing of the Word, raiſed the Tempeſt.</p>

Never any ſought conſtantly comfort from Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in the end found it.

For to ſay nothing, whether <hi>Peter</hi> was ever Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or not; or who ſucceeded him, whether <hi>Clement</hi> or <hi>Linus,</hi> which is diſputed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; it is moſt cleare, that there have ſtood three Popes at once; and did the Succeſſion hold, when Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> ſtept into the Papall Chaire, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the affaires of the Church?

into the Church, till in the end, the ſhip came to be covered with waves of hereſies &amp; perſecutions; that the Church was not ſo glorious, eminent, viſible, &amp; conſpicuous as before. Then came the darke time of Antichriſt for many hundred yeeres: yet even then were the <hi>Waldenſes, Bohemians,</hi> and others, who agreed with vs in the ſubſtance of Religion; and ſpake and wrote againſt the corruptions of thoſe times: but when it pleaſed God, to ſtirre vp <hi>Iohn Huſſe, Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prage, Martine Luther,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his worthy ſervants, to open the skupperholes, the waves which ſo oppreſſed the Church, ran out; the ſhip came aloft againe; and that Faith which had ſo long beene oppreſſed, began publikely to be profeſſed, and a faire viſible Church in one place or other hath ever ſince continued, and I truſt ſhall now to the end of the world, and ſhall never be univerſally covered againe.</p>
               <p>Neither let any Papiſt ſuppoſe it a forfeiture of<note place="margin">Prevention.</note> the cauſe, if wee cannot ſhew a preciſe and exact Catalogue, of the perſons, places, and times, by whom, where, and when, our faith was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>

are hid from us, and ſpecially the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doing her beſt to deface the memory of any thing, that might witneſſe for us and our Religion. If in theſe daies they will not ſpare man living, but wipe names out of bookes, give commandement, that none ſhall name them, but with contempt, and charge the Proteſtants with ſuch horrible opinions as wee hold not <note n="*" place="margin">And are <hi>antiqua &amp; convicta convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>

Yea, as Chriſt his ſleepe did moſt trouble the Diſciples, (they had never been ſo fearefull in the ſtorme, nor ſo earneſtly called upon him, if he had been awake) ſo there is nothing ſo troubleth Gods people, in their generall and particular diſtreſſes, as that God ſeemeth not to regard them: this, oh this, hath more diſquieted them, than any thing elſe, and

               <p>For the letter, it is probable, that they awakened<note place="margin">Lit.

Howſoever then, at other times, the Diſciples car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves in words, deeds, and geſture, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, dutifully, courteouſly, yet feare of death now made them forget themſelves, and offer violence with tongue and hand, they cried with their tongues, and at leaſt jogged him with their hands, never ceaſing till they had awakened and raiſed him. But I leave the letter. The word being fully opened, in myſterie, affordeth us two ſingular and uſefull inſtructions, and ſpecially for theſe times: the former from the Diſciples awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the latter from the Maſter awakened: in them importunitie, in him opportunitie. They
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7859:87"/>
awaken him ſuddenly; hee awakeneth ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: they awaken him violently; hee awakeneth voluntarily.</p>
               <p>For the firſt:</p>
               <p>From this Example of the Apoſtles wee learne<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The ſecond, is fervent Praier, which (as it were)<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The firſt, is the glaſſe of Nature; the ſecond, of Fortune; the third, of the Law; and the fourth, of the Goſpell. In the three firſt, Death appeareth fearefull; only in the fourth, comfortable: Yea fearefull in the glaſſe of Nature; more fearefull in the glaſſe of Fortune; and moſt fearefull in the glaſſe of the Law. God would have all the wicked to behold Death in the three firſt, that through feare of Death, they may repent of their ſinnes, and flie to Chriſt, who ſaveth from it: and hee would have the godly to behold Death in the glaſſe of the Goſpell, that having found grace to beleeve, and repent, they may die comfortably. But Satan (who ſeeketh mans deſtruction) well knowing how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable the ſickneſſe and deaths of men are, and what deepe impreſſions the laſt ends of the dead make in the minds of the living, laboureth to invert this order. And whereas God would have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7859:104"/>
his children to behold death in the glaſſe of the Goſpell; he (as much as he can) hideth that from their ſight, and ſhuffleth in the other before them, that he may terrifie them with the dread and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death, and (if it be poſſible) draw them into impatience, and to ſpeake unadviſedly; which the wicked hearing and ſeeing, are thereby animated in their evill courſes, ſaying, You ſee ſuch and ſuch an one, great profeſſors and holy men; yet you ſee how impatient in ſickneſſe, how fearefull to die. And on the other ſide, when the wicked are ſick &amp; readie to die (ſo much as he can) he hideth the three firſt glaſſes, and only preſenteth the fourth; and if in the time of health, they have heard any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſentences, he will helpe their memories to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them, to the end they may lie patiently, and die reſolutely and cheerefully: then doe ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners boaſt, Loe, ſuch a man, though in his health a good-fellow, a drunkard, a whore-maſter, gameſter, ſwearer, &amp;c. yet he died like a lambe, wagged nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand nor foot; I deſire to make no better end, which I hope I ſhall doe, though I walke in his waies. Oh ſee the juggling of Satan, where God doth not over-maſter him! Be wiſe yee that feare God; Doe yee ſee a moſt wicked and prophane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to die quietly and well? condemne him not; ſometimes a good death may follow a bad life: but it is to be feared, Satan hath abuſed him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a wrong glaſſe before him; therefore ſay, I will not hazard mine eſtate upon ſo deſperate a point; I will not walke in his waies; I will live well, and then I ſhall die well: and doe you ſee ſuch an

But let not theſe things trouble thee. That of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is moſt ſure, <hi>Non poteſt malè mori, qui bene vixerit;</hi> He cannot die ill, that liveth well. Yea, Thou art thy ſelfe ſick, and in danger of death, and thou art much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to thinke how ſoule and bodie muſt part; friends and all be left; thy body, which thou haſt kept ſo delicately, clothed and fed ſo deliciouſly, muſt be laid in a place of darkneſſe and cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meat for wormes, and ſee corruption: but thou art more troubled, to thinke how thou muſt leave thine houſes, lands, offices, wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, thou knoweſt not to whom, (it may be to enemies) leave a deſolate widow, and fatherleſſe children, to the mercy of the world, thy ſelfe being cut off in the midſt of thine age, and deprived of all thine hopes: but thou art moſt troubled to thinke how Death came into the world, that it is the wage of ſinne, the ſeale of Gods anger, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Law, and portall of hell; thy minde can thinke of nothing elſe: ſo as now thou art even diſtracted with feare, and wouldſt give all that ever thou haſt for life.

               <p>CHriſt being awakened by the importunitie of his Diſciples, preſently applieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to deliver them out of danger. And their deliverance conſiſteth in a double reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or increpation: for our Saviour ſaw there was a double ſtorme; the one in the Sea, the other in the minds of his Diſciples. As the Sea did rage and endanger the deſtruction of their bodies; ſo<note place="margin">Order of hiſtory.</note> their minds did rage, and there was a ſtrange ſtorme in their affections; which threatned no leſſe the deſtruction of their ſoules. Yea, the outward ſtorme had beene a calme, if they had had a calme within: wherfore he ſtilleth them both; but which in the firſt place, is a queſtion. Our Euangeliſt is plaine, he firſt rebuked his Diſciples. <hi>S. Marke</hi> and <hi>S. Luke</hi> are as plaine, <hi>That hee firſt aroſe and rebuked the winds and the ſeas.</hi> It muſt not trouble us, that ſuch differences appeare in the Euangeliſts. It may be, he rebuked his Diſciples twice <note n="*" place="margin">Poteſt reſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, bis eſſe reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos diſcipulos.

And this anſwereth fully,

how one ſaith, It was before; and two, That it was after; for indeed it was both: and one Euangeliſt hath that which another omitteth; a thing ſo uſuall as needeth no proofe. But I rather incline to that of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> That firſt he rebuked his Diſciples, and then the winds and ſeas; and that the other two Euangeliſts did not preciſely obſerve the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Hiſtory <note n="*" place="margin">Non ſervaſſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem temporis.

not only furniſh every Chriſtian ſouldier, from top to toe, with compleat harneſſe, but alſo deſcribeth their enemies; <hi>We wreſtle not with fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities and powers, againſt worldly governours, the princes of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 6. 12.</note>. You ſee what enemies we have, and how exceedingly furniſhed, with ſtrength in their hands, and malice in their hearts, having all gainfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, both from nature; they ſpirits, and we fleſh; and from place; they being above, we below, and far beneath them. In which combat of our ſoules, faith is our principall armour, both of offence and defence; and therefore the Apoſtle bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us, <hi>Reſiſt Satan, being ſtedfaſt in the faith</hi>

No marvell, though they ſigh, and mourne, and complaine, and be brought very low, as if they had no faith at all; but their hearts were full of unbeleefe, doubtings, feares.</p>
               <p>Oh let ſuch know, to their comfort, that the very<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> beſt of Gods children have had, and have, and ſhall have experience hereof, and ſhall grone under the burthen of the remainders of corruption, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſinfull infirmities which cleave unto them, and cry out of feare, doubting, and unbeleefe: yea know (becauſe Regeneration is imperfect in this life) where there is no doubting at all, no feare at all, no ſtriving againſt unbeleefe, there is no true comfort, no true faith, but a proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>For the illuſtration of this point, know firſt, That<note place="margin">1.

But theſe motions, theſe actions, they are not his, they ſhall never be laid to his charge.

much evill in me, I might then indeed juſtly doubt and feare, I were all fleſh; but I doe diſlike and deteſt them, and lay them to the fleſhes charge; and even hereby I know that I have received the Spirit, becauſe it ſheweth me the weakneſſe of my faith, and ſtirreth up holy grones, ſighes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to Heaven, for the increaſe of it.</p>

Learned Divines ſay, it is a ſerious and conſtant deſire (ariſing from an humbled and broken ſpirit) to be reconciled unto God, and to have ſinnes forgiven. Some ſeeme to hold, that full aſſurance is eſſentiall to every true faith; and therefore deſcribe it, To be a full perſwaſion of the heart, grounded upon the promiſes of God, that whatſoever Chriſt hath done for others, he hath done for me. But alas, how far was that true beleeving father from this, who prayed, <hi>Lord helpe mine unbeleefe</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Mar. 9. 14.</note>. And many thouſands of Gods children, who in the inſtant of their converſion, or by their negligence, in the uſe of good meanes, or by falling into ſome great ſinne, have ſo farre abated the power and efficacie of their Faith, that they cannot ſay, Chriſt died for them, that their ſinnes are forgiven, and God their Father in Ieſus Chriſt. Oh ſuch full aſſurance is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7859:127"/>
only eſſentiall to a ſtrong faith. It may be a true faith, which hath not that aſſurance, but is rather in great combat with diſtruſt, and deſpaire. Marke then your deſcription of the leaſt meaſure of faith; It is but a deſire, yet a true and conſtant deſire; and a deſire ariſing from an humbled and contrite ſpirit; ſuch a ſpirit as is caſt downe, and even bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, with ſight of ſinne, ſenſe of Gods anger, and feare of puniſhment. And the object of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, is not ſo much life, and ſalvation, (which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> and every meere naturall man deſireth) as Remiſſion of ſinnes, and Reconciliation unto God, which no unbeleever careth for.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Aſſertion is, becauſe the true<note place="margin">Ground.</note> deſire of any Grace, is as the bud of that Grace, and (in Gods eſteeme) the Grace it ſelfe. So then, the deſire of pardon, and reconciliation with God, is as the bud of faith. For as the bud includeth the bloſſome and fruit; and as in the Spring time, with the warmth and nouriſhment of Sunne &amp; ground, the bud doth grow, bloſſome, knit, and hold fruit: ſo this true deſire, how little ſoever it ſeeme to be to him that hath it, or others, yet being nouriſhed with Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, it will grow ſtronger and ſtronger, like the graine of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed.</p>
               <p>But let us (I pray you) ſee, how the Scriptures wil<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation.</note> warrant this comfortable deſcription of a true faith, by the leaſt meaſure of it. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the poore</hi>

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I ſubſcribe, as unto the undoubted truth of God, and Tenet of our Church, which hath taught us thus to pray, <hi>O God, mercifull Father, that deſpiſeſt not the ſighing of a contrite heart, nor the deſire of ſuch as be ſorrowfull.</hi> Whereupon I inferre this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for the refreſhing of any wearied ſoule.

Be of good comfort, here is the bud and ſeed of faith, and in Gods acceptation, true faith, and thou ſhalt have thy deſire. And for confirmation hereof, marke theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the true deſire of Grace, (as Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance)<note place="margin">Two Arguments proving a godly deſire of Grace, to be true Grace.</note> is a ſanctified deſire, a ſanctified affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <note n="z" place="margin">Iohn 3. 6.</note>; and being from the Spirit, it is an infallible argument, that Chriſt dwelleth in us, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that Chriſt dwelleth in us, even by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which he hath given us</hi>

               <p>The Reaſon hereof is, becauſe faith doth not<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> juſtifie in reſpect of it ſelfe, as it is a gift, or action, or vertue, inherent in us; for then, as it is more or leſſe, ſtronger or weaker, ſo ſhould we be more or leſſe juſtified; but faith doth juſtifie, as it is the inſtrument, whereby we apprehend and receive the object. The object or matter of our juſtice is Chriſt, and Chriſt is not received more or leſſe, according to the meaſure or degree of faith; but Chriſt is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly received, or refuſed: and he that hath whole Chriſt, hath his righteouſneſſe; which is ſo perfect, (<hi>being the righteouſneſſe of God</hi>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7859:158"/>
though the Apoſtles be troubled, and feare, yet Chriſt awaketh, <hi>rebuketh the winds and ſea;</hi> Chriſt is glorified, and the Diſciples faith confirmed. When Chriſt his houre was come, how did Satan beſtirre himſelfe, to have him put to death? How did hee tempt <hi>Iudas</hi> to <hi>betray him</hi>

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note>; turned the croſſe into a chariot of triumph, ſpoiled Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, and openly triumphed over them upon the croſſe <note n="n" place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 5.</note>.

When Chriſt was buried, then Satan no leſſe beſtirred himſelfe to keepe him there, provoking the chiefe Prieſts and Phariſies to move <hi>Pilate,</hi> to make the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre ſure: and ſo it was; for beſides the great ſtone which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> rolled to the doore of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, it was alſo ſealed, and a watch ſet to keepe it <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 27. <hi>ult.</hi>

               <p>Our ſecond leſſon, from myſterie, is, That the<note place="margin">2.

The Lord hath made all things for himſelfe</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe-man <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 16. 4.</note>.) And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall exerciſe of the glorified Saints in heaven, is, day and night to praiſe Chriſt for the great worke of Redemption: <hi>Thou wast ſlaine, and hast redeemed us unto God by thy bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and made us Kings and Priests unto God</hi>

                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:7859:179"/>Here then is an infallible touch-ſtone, whereby<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> to trie all Doctrines: and I would to God, with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ſobrietie, all the matters in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Papiſts and us, were, with meekeneſſe, brought to this touch-ſtone. Thoſe Doctrines are ever ſoundeſt, which doe give glory to Chriſt, and provoke men to admire &amp; praiſe him, <hi>What manner of man is he!</hi> But whatſoever Doctrine, how plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſoever, (yea ſuch Doctrines are moſt pleaſing to our corrupt nature) which doth ſooth up man in his owne free-will, workes, and righteouſneſſe, to make him ſtrout it, and pride himſelfe, and ſay, What manner of man am I, that have this power, and have done theſe &amp; theſe workes! it is earthly, carnall, &amp; ſenſuall. Heareſt thou then any doctrine delivered, which thou art not able fully to examine for the truth of it, nor to unty the knots of intricate queſtions? Yet aske, Doth this Doctrine advance the glory of Chriſt? It is good then. Doth it make man proud and haughty in himſelfe? It is naught then. And I need not any other Argument to make me reject it. As the moſt points of Popery doe: as their doctrine of Free-will, workes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe meritorious, of congruitie, or condignitie, obedience to Councels, Auricular Confeſſion, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and workes of ſatisfaction, the Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Maſſe, mediation of Angels and Saints, Popes Pardons, and Indulgencies, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, &amp;c. all draw from Chriſt, to admire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the Pope. This rule our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath given, <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelfe, ſeeketh his owne glory; but he that ſeeketh the glory of him that ſent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteouſneſſe in</hi>

                  <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 7. 18.</note>. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> examined his doctrine by this touch-ſtone, and found it currant. Doe I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men or God? Doe I ſeeke to pleaſe men? Then I were not the ſervant of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confidently pronounced, <hi>If an Angell from heaven ſhall preach otherwiſe, let him be accurſed</hi>
