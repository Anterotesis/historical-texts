         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

QUAKERS
SHAKEN.</head>
            <p>THe mind of man deſtitute of Gods Grace,
doth (like untilled ground) luxuriate into
wickedneſſe and vanity, being very prone
to cloſe with the ſuggeſtions of the grand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
of his ſoul; yea, though he hath had
ſome taſt of the things that are excellent, yet ſuch is his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
that he will be ſeeking after the novelties. Old truths
(like the <hi>Manna</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after a conſtant and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
falling of it) become nauſeous: the truth hereof hath been
found in all ages by lamentable experience, but eſpecially
in theſe our daies, which have been as fruitfull in new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in matters of Religion, as <hi>Africa</hi> it ſelf, of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>Some (though few in compariſon) God is pleaſed to recall,
who have gone aſtray in this kind, and to bring them to a
clear ſight of their folly; of which number, I (by Gods Grace
towards me) am one; I deſire to acknowledge him in it, and to
give him the praiſe of it, and think my ſelf bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as a teſtimony of my thankfulneſs to God for my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to declare it to the world, that others may hear and
fear, and take warning by my example. They who have been
lately in the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be ignorant
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118825:3"/>
how prevalent the impoſture of quaking hath been for theſe 9 or
ten Moneths laſt paſt, in which ſnare I my ſelf (among many
poor deluded ſoules) was taken in <hi>May</hi> laſt 1653. though by
Gods goodneſſe towards me the ſnare is broken, and I am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped;
a true account whereof take as followeth.</p>
            <p>I being deſirous to aſſociate my ſelf with this Faction at their
Meeting, and to hear ſome of them ſpeak (to uſe their own
expreſſion) acquainted one of their own with it, <hi>viz. George
Bayley</hi> of <hi>Kendall,</hi> who gave me great encouragement herein
from his own experience of much advantage received by him
in that way: Whereupon I went ſoon after to their Meeting
at <hi>Richard Newby's</hi> houſe, where I ſtaid about two houres (<hi>viz.</hi>
from eight till ten at night) where <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> was
Speaker, whoſe drift was to deny all Miniſteriall teaching and
Ordinances, together with all notionall knowledge formerly
gained by uſe of ſuch meanes, to become as though wee had
never learned any thing thereby ſavingly, and to lay a new
ground-work, <hi>viz.</hi> to be taught of God within our ſelves by
waiting upon an inward light, which (as they aſſert) lies low
hidden under the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the old man, which is of the earth,
earthy. Hereupon I reſolved to cloſe with them, after which
time I was afraid to read any good Books, or hear any preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miniſter, or call to remembrance any thing which I had
formerly learned out of Gods Word, concerning God or Chriſt,
or mine own eſtate, or any other ſubject contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for I was perſwaded by their teaching, that whaſoever I
had learned out of Gods Word, by hearing, reading, catechizing,
&amp;c. was but notionall, carnall, and hanging upon the tree of
Knowledge; in which condition whilſt I abode, they affirmed
me to be under the Curſe, applying this expreſſion, though very
impertinently, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, going a ſecond time to one of their Meetings at
<hi>Edmond Newby's,</hi> I had ſome conference by the way with ſome
of themſelves which went with me; amongſt other blaſphemies,
one <hi>Robert Colliſon</hi> affirmed, that Chriſt was as man, had his
failings, for he diſtruſted God (quoth he) upon the Croſſe, when
he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> to whom
I anſwered, that then he ſuffered as an evill doer, and ſo could
not purchaſe redemption for us; after this comming home, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118825:3"/>
who then was Speaker, urged us to take up the Croſſe daily,
and to abide under it; ſaying, <hi>Carry the Croſſe all day, and it will
keep thee at night;</hi> that this would keep us low and humble, and
kill, and make alive: further, he endeavoured to perſwade his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
to harken to a voice within them, teaching, that Gods
voice was a ſtill voice; after which I reſolved in my thoughts
to wait for the manifeſtation of theſe things within my ſelf.</p>
            <p>After a while, going a third time to their meeting, as I went
I was ſomewhat troubled in my thoughts at the remembrance
of that hideous blaſphemy uttered by the party before named,
whereupon I ſpake publickly to them at their meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it; telling them, that I would not any further joyn with
them if they were all of that mind, to which ſome of them (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much whiſpering) anſwered negatively, wiſhing me not to
let it trouble me; for he which ſpake ſo to me was not rightly
called; with which anſwer I was at preſent ſatisfied, and did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to my former reſolution. Not long after I went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meeting upon a Lords day at <hi>Robert Colliſons</hi> houſe in <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi>
where the aforeſaid <hi>Atkinſon</hi> was Speaker, who beginning
about 9 a clock in the forenoon, continued til three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
in which time he ſpake much (according to his uſuall
manner) of the great experience which he had of God from the
light within him, which light I not finding to be in my ſelf,
was very much troubled, apprehending my condition to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad, finding nothing but blindneſſe and hardneſſe, yet I ſtill
expected the appearance of that light within me, and earneſtly
deſired that I might fall into quaking and trembling, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
that I ſhould thereby attain to the immediate diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of God unto me. Upon my departure from thence, I peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a Pamphlet ſet forth by ſome of the ſame Faction, being in
<hi>York</hi> Caſtle, the main ſcop of it was againſt the Miniſtry; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after walking in my Bed-chamber, I began (as I have
formerly deſired) to tremble &amp; quake ſo extremely, that I could
not ſtand upon my feet, but was conſtrained to fall down upon
my Bed, where I howled and cried (as it is uſual with them)
in a terrible and hideous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment of
my Family: Nevertheleſſe I my ſelf was not at all affected with
fear, becauſe it was ſatisfaction to my former deſires, and I
looked upon it as the beginning of the pangs of the new birth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118825:4"/>
&amp; expected that the iſſue of it would be good; when I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about half an houre in that condition, I ceaſed from
howling and crying gradually; after which I roſe up again,
beginning to rejoice, thinking with my ſelf that now I could
bear witneſſe againſt the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> as falſe Prophets
and Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe I never found ſuch effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon me by ſo long continuance under their Miniſtry.
After this, going to bed, I was much troubled all that night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in my ſleep, with dreams concerning my condition, &amp;
had a diſcovery of my ſins in particular, eſpecially of my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
the Devill working ſtrongly upon my imagination; I
apprehended that all ſin was about to be hewed down, &amp; root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in me, and (to my apprehenſion) the ſin of covetouſneſs
had great long roots which did viſibly appear to me when it
was rooted up: Afterwards lying awake, and thinking upon
the dreams and viſions I had formerly been troubled with, I
ſencibly perceived ſomething (as I imagined) lighting upon
my neck, giving me a great ſtroak, which cauſed much pain to
me, and after that another which was leſſe then the firſt, and
ſo a third and fourth, each ſtroak being leſſe then the former,
&amp; each ſtroak deſcending lower down, till it came to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of my back, and then I thought ſomething entred into my
body, which I perſwaded my ſelf (from Satans inſtigation) to
be the Spirit of God deſcending upon me like a Dove, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into me, whereupon I heard (in my conceit) a voice
within me ſaying, <hi>It is day;</hi> whereupon looking up and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be light, I anſwered <hi>Yes;</hi> the voice replied twice over
to me, and ſaid, <hi>as certainly as it is light, ſo certainly ſhall Chriſt
give thee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I continued two or three dayes waiting for further
diſcoveries of light within me, being wrapt up into an extaſie of
exceſſive joy, and ſometimes again exceedingly dejected with
fears &amp; doubts of my condition, whether it were really good,
or I were under Satans deluſions; yet ſtill I waited for further
manifeſtations, and walking into the Garden, lying down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground with my face towards the earth, my right hand
began extreamly to ſhake, ſo as I could not hold it ſtill, the
meaning whereof whilſt I was wondering what it ſhould be, &amp;
apprehending my ſelf as being ſhaken by the hand, I was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118825:4"/>
brought into another rapture of great joy, imagining it to be a
figure of my ſpirituall Mariage and Union with Chriſt. Then
preſently I was by the power within me raiſed, and ſet upon my
feet, and by the ſame power turned and laid upon my back,
with my face towards the skie; at which time all my ſins parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
were again brought into my memory, &amp; at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of every ſin, my hand was carried round about with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little pat upon the ground, and then I imagined <hi>I</hi> heard
a voice ſaying, <hi>now ſuch a ſin is mortified;</hi> after which <hi>I</hi> being
perſwaded by it, that all my ſins were mortified by it one by
one; the power that <hi>I</hi> was then acted by, permitted me to ariſe
up again of my ſelf, ſaying unto me, <hi>Aske whatſoever thou wilt
of the Father, and he will give it thee: I</hi> replyed, <hi>I</hi> know not what
to aske; and therefore deſired that power to teach me what
to aske: he anſwered me again, and bid me aske <hi>wiſdom in the
firſt place;</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> deſired alſo, that God would give me
ſuch things as were moſt for his glory, and the good of others;
whereupon the power anſwered, <hi>that my requeſt was granted,
and that I ſhould alſo be endewed with the gift of prophecy, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
praiſes to God:</hi> wherewith being ſatisfied, <hi>I</hi> went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meeting within an hour after, at <hi>William Doddings</hi> houſe
in <hi>Kendall,</hi> which was the fifth and laſt meeting that I was at
with them where <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> being Speaker, I was
much more affected with what he ſpake then formerly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able more inwardly to witneſſe in part to what he ſpoke.
After he had done, &amp; a little pauſe had, the Company roſe up,
as if they had been ready to depart; I my ſelf was ready to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the firſt, but the Wife of the houſe (<hi>Iſa: Dodding</hi>)
took me by the hand, and wringing it very hard, bad me ſit
down again, which <hi>I</hi> did, &amp; preſently after one <hi>John Audland</hi>
ſtood up, and began to ſpeak, ſaying, <hi>cannot ye watch one hour?</hi>
and ſo proceeded after the uſuall manner. In the time of his
ſpeaking <hi>I</hi> was by the power within me drawn from the chair
upon which <hi>I</hi> ſat, and thrown upon the ground in the middeſt
of the Company, where <hi>I</hi> lay all night; all which time, my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and all the members of it were ſtill in motion, <hi>I</hi> being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from my back to my belly, and ſo back again ſeverall times,
and making croſſes continually with my legs one over the
other; my hands were carried to and fro upon the ground
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118825:5"/>
by a compulſive power, as if <hi>I</hi> had been writing upon the
ground; in all which actions and motions, <hi>I</hi> acted not in the
leaſt meaſure by a naturall power of mine own, neither did <hi>I</hi>
reſiſt, or could <hi>I</hi> reſiſt that power which acted me, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
paſſive; <hi>I</hi> was perſwaded that it was the immediate
power of Chriſt, and heard to my thinking a voice ſpeaking
to me, &amp; ſaying, <hi>that that writing with my hand upon the ground,
did ſignifie the writing of the Law within my heart.</hi> Having laine
all night upon the ground in the manner aforeſaid, the power
(as before in other actions) moved my hands to my head, and
laid them upon the top thereof faſt cloſed together, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>I</hi> heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>Chriſt in God, and God in Chriſt, and
Chriſt in thee;</hi> which words <hi>I</hi> was compelled to ſing forth before
the Company in a ſtrange manner, &amp; with ſuch a voice as was
not naturally mine own: <hi>I</hi> ſung alſo diverſe phraſes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which were given into me; after which <hi>I</hi> was raiſed from
the ground, &amp; ſet upon my fect by the power within me, which
bad me be humble, and brought me down again upon my knees,
and with a whiſpering voice ſaid to me, <hi>ſtoop low, low;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtooped near the ground with my face, it ſaid to me, <hi>take
up the Croſſe, and follow me:</hi> whereupon ariſing, I was led out
of the houſe (by the back door) down to the River, and back
again from thence into the Town another way, where I was
ſenſibly drawn down the ſtreet, and cauſed ſuddenly to turn
aſide to a door of an houſe (my ſelf not knowing who lived
in it) two of the ſaid company ſollowing me all the time,
(<hi>viz.) William Dodding</hi> and <hi>John Audland,</hi> and ſeeing me to
go to that door ſaid, <hi>whither wilt thou go? this is the Fidlers houſe;
I</hi> anſwered, <hi>whoſe houſe ſoever it be, Chriſt leads me hither, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I muſt go,</hi> whereupon my hand was carried to knock at
the door, and commanded by a voice to ſay, <hi>Behold Chriſt
ſtands at the door and knocks:</hi> after a while the Fidler opened,
and <hi>I</hi> was led into the houſe, not ſpeaking any thing unto
him: where my hand was carried to a Baſe-violl hanging up
in the houſe; <hi>I</hi> took it down and began to play upon it with
my fingers, and was immediatly compelled a fall to dancing,
which <hi>I</hi> ſeldome or never in all my life did before: hereupon
<hi>I</hi> queſtioned what power it ſhould be that carried me forth to
ſuch actions, to which the voice within me replyed, <hi>This is not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118825:5"/>
becauſe I love muſick, for I hate it, but to ſignifie unto thee what joy
there is in heaven at thy converſion; as alſo what ſpirituall melody
thou ſhalt have hereafter:</hi> then I was led out of the houſe into
the ſtreet, and ſo carried along through the Town, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to proclame as I went, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life,</hi>
with other expreſſions to the like purpoſe; after which I was
brought to mine own houſe, the foreſaid <hi>Wil. Dodding</hi> going
along with me, acknowledged that he had no power to leave
me all this time: being come home, the ſame power would not
ſuffer me to reſt, but caſt me upon the ground, and cauſed me
to make circles round about the houſe with my hand, with
many the like actions, telling me, <hi>that I was putting off the old
man;</hi> my hand alſo was carried to take up a ſtone which lay
upon the flore (which in my apprehenſion was in the form of
a mans heart) the voice within me telling me, <hi>that Chriſt had
taken that ſtone out of my heart, and given me an heart of fleſh,</hi> and
my hand was moved to hold it forth to the Spectators, and my
tongue to utter this ſentence, <hi>except you ſee ſigns and wonders you
will not believe:</hi> and throwing the foreſaid ſtone amongſt
them, I ſaid, <hi>Loe here is my heart of ſtone:</hi> afterwards being caſt
upon the ground upon my back, the voice ſpake to me, ſaying,
<hi>thou ſhalt have two Angels to keep thee,</hi> whereupon immediatly
two Swallows deſcended down the Chimne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and ſat upon a

being perſwaded that they were angels from heaven, and
that it was a fulfilling of the promiſe, <hi>I</hi> held out my hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, expecting they ſhould have come to me, but they
did not, but aſcended up the Chimney, though both the door
and the window were open.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> was alſo by the ſame power carried out of doors upon my
hands &amp; knees into the ſtreet, which my Wife &amp; others ſeeing,
endeavoured to hinder me, but <hi>I</hi> told them, <hi>I</hi> would not be
hindered, but leave Wife, Children, and all to follow Chriſt: in
this manner <hi>I</hi> went up the ſtreet, thinking that <hi>I</hi> bore a Croſſe
upon my neck, &amp; continued in this motion till ſome pulled me
out of the mire and dirt, and by force carried me into the houſe
again; whereupon <hi>I</hi> was moved to point to one of them which
brought me in, and to ſay to her, <hi>Chriſt points at thee, thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118825:6"/>
art a wicked woman, and haſt hindered the work of the Lord;</hi> then
the voice asked me where my Croſſe was, telling me <hi>I</hi> had
ſcattered it, whereupon <hi>I</hi> was moved to make a Croſs with my
finger upon the flore, and forced to ſet my head upon it, playing
topſie turvy, or bull necks, thinking then <hi>I</hi> had retaken up my
Croſſe. In theſe actions <hi>I</hi> was kept a long while, having many
Scripture-expreſſions given in, to the admiration of all that
heard me; ſometimes <hi>I</hi> was forced to leap and dance, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
being given in to me, <hi>now I have finiſhed the work which
thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> thinking my Redemption then fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;
but my joy continued not, for <hi>I</hi> was caſt down
again, and the voice told me, <hi>I had offended God in attributing
that to my ſelf which was proper to Chriſt;</hi> whereupon I was caſt
upon the ground, and lying upon my belly, I was forced to
lick the duſt, and my hand carried to ſtrike extraordinarily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my head, having a voice given me, <hi>that no ſin muſt go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed;</hi>
ſo creeping up and down the houſe, I heard a voice
ſaying, <hi>where is thy Croſſe?</hi> upon which looking aſide, I thought
I ſaw a viſible Croſſe hanging in a threed, which with my hand
I put behind my neck; I was kept in theſe poſtures all that day
till evening, when many Quakers came in to me, who ſpake
nothing but thus, <hi>Be lowly, mind thy condition, and harken to the
voice within;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="4+ letters">

               </gap>tion at all for me, but departed, leaving
me in this condition. My ſtrength being almoſt ſpent, and my
body much conſumed by continuall reſtleſneſſe; Two of them
offered to watch with me that night, but <hi>I</hi> refuſed, telling them
I was well, whereupon they departed. After this my Wife
&amp; Family being gon to bed, <hi>I</hi> being alone in the houſe, began
to recollect my ſelf, and to queſtion whether that power by
which <hi>I</hi> had been ſo ſtrangly acted, were Divine or Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call?
whereupon <hi>I</hi> was immediatly ſtruck with a pannick fear,
and my hand was carried to take up a Knife which lay upon
the Table, which being done, my hand was carried with it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my throat, and the voice ſaid to me, <hi>open a hole there, and
I will give thee the words of eternall life;</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> anſwered,
<hi>what, with a Knife?</hi> and ſo threw the Knife away, being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it was a temptation, from which <hi>I</hi> deſire God to deliver
me. My wife being in bed in the next room, &amp; hearing me ſpeak
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118825:6"/>
when none was with me, came out, and deſired me to go to
bed, which <hi>I</hi> did at her entreaty: all the night following <hi>I</hi>
was fully reſolved that it was the Devils power that had acted
me all along formerly, and was perſwaded that <hi>I</hi> was really
poſſeſt with a Devill, which muſt be ejected; and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>I</hi> verily thought that a Devill went out of me, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>I</hi> roared very hidiouſly, crying, <hi>now is the Devill gone out
of me,</hi> at which inſtant <hi>I</hi> &amp; my Family heard it thunder, (though
none in the Town beſides heard it) which made me think it
was the Devill, <hi>he being the Prince of the power of the air;</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame power came under another notion and told me,
<hi>that it was Satan that had poſſeſt and led me heretofore, but now
Chriſt was come, and he by his power had caſt out Satan, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me, that what ever I had done the day before was in obedience
to Satan, and that as I had ſerved the Devill all the time before in my
Clothes, ſo that day I must undo all that I had formerly done, only in
my ſpirit in obedience to Chriſt;</hi> which immediatly <hi>I</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
riſing out of my bed, and going into the ſtreet with my
ſhirt, only; but my Wife and others ſoon laid hold upon me, &amp;
ſtopt me, whereupon the power within me told me, <hi>that I muſt
be carried into the houſe with four women, as I had been the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or elſe I ſhould perpetually ſtand their like a pillar of Salt, as</hi> Lots
<hi>wife did.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> was born in by 4. women, who carried me again
into my bed, which being done, <hi>I</hi> told them, <hi>I had been doing the
Devills work the day before, but to day I muſt do the work of Chriſt,</hi>
&amp; pointing at a woman whom <hi>I</hi> had pointed at the day before,
ſaid theſe words, <hi>the Devill told me yeſterday that you were a wicked
woman, but now Chriſt tells me that you are Gods Servant:</hi> the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being departed, <hi>I</hi> fell to acting in my ſhirt only upon the
bed, as <hi>I</hi> had done formerly upon the houſe flore, playing top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
turvy from one bed to another, whereby I might have undon
my ſelf; but the power which acted me, bid me not fear, <hi>for I wil
give thee ſtrength.</hi> After this the power told me, <hi>that the Devill
had the other day commanded me to bear the Croſſe, but now Chriſt
commands me to lay aſide thy Croſſe; for Chriſt takes no pleaſure in
Croſses, nor will he have me worſhip them as yeſterday I had done:</hi>
Further, the power ſaid to me, <hi>the Devill made thee yeſterday to lie
all day upon the ground, but now I have provided a bed for thee,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Scripture to me, <hi>my yoak is eaſie;</hi> promiſing alſo, <hi>to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118825:7"/>
give me bread of life to eat, &amp; water of life to drink, &amp; that out of my
belly ſhould flow rivers of living water:</hi> whereupon my teeth were
cauſed to move as if I had been eating; and I thought <hi>I</hi> felt in
my belly a flowing up and down, as of Waters: I was alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that yeſterday the Devils angels had waited on me, but
now Chriſts Angels ſhould guard me; whereupon <hi>I</hi> ſaw two
Butterflies in the window, to which my hand was carried, and
having taken one of them in my hand, <hi>I</hi> was moved by the
power within me to put it into my mouth, and did ſwallow it
down into my body, which having done, <hi>I</hi> took the other in
my hand, and was moved to put it to my throat, the power tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me, <hi>it ſhould enter in there,</hi> ſaying, <hi>nothing is impoſſible to them
that believe.</hi> After this I was cauſed to make circles upon the bed,
as I had done formerly upon the ground: whereupon I began to
think, that this was not of God, and ſo began to reſiſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by which I was acted, and thereupon fell into great fear and
doubting, crying out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to to do?</hi> but the
power told me, <hi>that it was too late to cry unto God, for ſentence was
already pronounced againſt me:</hi> whereupon I lay down in my bed,
much deſpairing, and was then convict, that it was the Devill
which had again deluded me: in which condition having lain
a ſhort ſpace, I was again aſſaulted by a power the third time,
which told me, <hi>that it was a white Devill that had deceived me
the latter time, but now Chriſt was come indeed, and he would caſt
him out;</hi> whereupon I apprehended that Devill alſo to be eiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
after which, as I lay in my bed, all the members of my body
fell a working, as if the pangs of Death had been upon me, the
power telling me, <hi>that it was the pangs of the new birth, and that
Chriſt was new born in me;</hi> with which I was ſomewhat ſatisfied,
lying in that condition a whole day; in which time the power
perſwaded me, that <hi>I ſhould work wonders, and cast out Devills in
his name;</hi> ſoon after two Quakers came to me, viz. <hi>Geo. Bailey,</hi>
and <hi>J. Braban,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> told that <hi>I</hi> had two Devills caſt out
of me, but now Chriſt was in me for a truth; then the power
(pretending to be Chriſt) ſaid theſe words, <hi>I was crowned with
a crown of thorns, but I will crown thee with a crown of glory,</hi> and
bad me (as a figure thereof) <hi>to ſet my fiſt upon my head, and it
ſhould appear to the ſtanders by as a glorious crown, though I ſaw
nothing by my ſelf,</hi> which having done <hi>I</hi> ſpake to the ſtanders
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118825:7"/>
by, ſaying, <hi>what do you ſee?</hi> whereunto they gave me no anſwer,
(being Quakers) but turned their eyes another way, the power
telling me, <hi>that they ſaw the crown upon my head, but were ſo ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with admiration, that they could not expreſſe what they ſaw;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
the power bad me tell one of the Quakers then preſent
<hi>that he had a devill in him, and that I ſhould have power to caſt him
out;</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>O, thou hast a devill in thee;</hi> the
power told me he ſhould <hi>quake and tremble,</hi> which immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did; the power bad me ſpeak to him <hi>to fall flat upon the
ground,</hi> which he did, &amp; after a little ſpace roſe again, and <hi>I</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him <hi>whether the devill were gon out of him</hi> (having been before
perſwaded by the power that <hi>I</hi> ſhould caſt him out,) to which
he gave me no anſwer, but the power told me <hi>that the devill was
ejected. I</hi> was told alſo by the ſame power, <hi>who</hi> (of thoſe that
came to ſee me) <hi>had devils, and who not; and that my wife and
my mother had devils in them, but I had power given me to caſt them
out.</hi> After this, beginning again to queſtion whether this were
Chriſt or not, <hi>I</hi> fell into a great fear and doubting, as formerly;
whereupon the devil diſcovered himſelf to be the devill, &amp; told
me, <hi>that all this while I had been ſerving him, and blaſpheming
God; and that it was now too late to repent,</hi> whereupon I was
brought into deſpair for a time, thinking every thing which I
either heard or ſaw, to be the devil come to fetch me away: one
while I thought that I ſhould be taken away in a flame of fire, or
elſe that the earth would ſwallow me up quick; whereupon I
called my Wife, and deſired her to bring up my Children in the
fear of God, for the devil would fetch me away, my ſelf ſtill
thinking that he was drawing me out of the bed; thus I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
my ſelf wholy under the power of the devil, and had no
power to recover my ſelf out of that ſad condition. At laſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
(having bin ſo long deluded) to deſiſt from harkning to the
voyce within me, and apply my ſelf unto God, in and through
Chriſt, for deliverance from the power of Satan, knowing, that
God was able to deliver me, though I were ſo far involved in
the ſnare of the devill; thereupon my faith was in ſome meaſure
raiſed to believe that God would deliver me: whereupon I was
preſently in a great agony, and did ſweat extreamly, in which
condition I continued all night, but was ſomwhat more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the morning, eſteeming my ſelf in ſome meaſure reſcued
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118825:8"/>
from the power of the devil: yet having not reſolved as yet
finally to deſert that way, I was ſoon again aſſaulted by the
ſame, power, telling me, <hi>that now the devil was finally caſt out of
me, &amp; that the room within me muſt not be left empty, but that Chriſt
muſt come &amp; have the whole &amp; ſole poſſeſſion, or elſe Satan would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
&amp; re-enter with 7. other devils worſe then himſelf,</hi> telling me
withall, <hi>that he was Chriſt,</hi> and ſolliciting me to entertain and
imbrace him as I had done formerly: I reſiſted the ſuggeſtions
of this power for a time, having been ſo often deluded; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
as a motive to perſwade me to entertain it, he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to my memorie all, or moſt of the remarkable paſſages of my
life, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> told me how long I ſhould
live, <hi>viz.</hi> ten years, and where I ſhould die, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> &amp; that
I had a weak body, but he would ſtrengthen it, and thereupon
cauſed me to rub my body all over with my hands, at which
inſtant I conceived my body to receive ſtrength, &amp; the members
thereof to be more in ſubſtance then before; with divers other
paſſages, promiſing me proſperity in the world, and ſpeaking
theſe words to me, <hi>Joh. 4. 29. Behold a man that hath told thee all
things that ever thou didſt, is not this Chriſt?</hi> whereupon I was at
laſt perſwaded to imbrace this power, thinking that it was
Chriſt indeed; whereupon I was preſently ſenſible of a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
throughout my whole body, which ſoon ceaſed, and then I
thought that my condition was good, and Chriſt to be really in
me: afterwards this power told me, that I had highly offended
God in all my former paſſages, in giving way to Satan, and that
I was guilty of all ſins, except that againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but
told me, that I did it ignorantly, and therefore he had pitty on
me; I was further perſwaded by the ſame power, that I ſhould
lie (ſeemingly dead,) which I did, not daring to ſtir, till the
power moved me. Lying thus a while, the power began firſt to
move one of my legs, and then the other; after that my hands, &amp;
then my head, &amp; at laſt my whole body; cauſing me to ſit up in
my bed, &amp; telling me <hi>that thus ſhould my body be quickened &amp; raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up again at the laſt day:</hi> then the power told me, <hi>that I muſt
pull off my ſhirt and my cap, and the napkin which I had about my
neck,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that whatſoever was about me was polluted, and that he
bated the Garments ſpotted with the fleſh;</hi> whereupon I pull'd them
off, and threw them on the ground, uttering theſe ſame words,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118825:8"/>
               <hi>that I bated the Garment ſpotted with the fleſh,</hi> the power alſo told
me, <hi>that all my bonds were broken, &amp; my cords looſened, &amp; that Chriſt
had ſet me free;</hi> whereupon calling for a clean ſhirt, and other lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
<hi>I</hi> aroſe, concluding my ſelf to be in a good condition; yet
finding my ſelf being up, no better, nor my body more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,
but rather weakned, <hi>I</hi> began to ſee that <hi>I</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
in this laſt buſines as formerly; whereupon I was ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with fear, &amp; walking into the Garden, I thought one while
that the Devil would pull me into the earth, and another while
that he would pull me into the air, ſo that <hi>I</hi> was afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
abroad, and came again into the houſe, and ſuſpected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that I heard to be the Devil waiting to fetch me
away; being in this perplexity of ſoul, <hi>I</hi> began to conſider how
grievouſly <hi>I</hi> had offended God in rejecting the uſe of all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
means: as <hi>reading, hearing, prayer, &amp;c.</hi> in the uſe whereof
God hath commanded us to wait upon him, and therefore that
it was moſt juſt with him to leave me to my ſelf, and to give
me over to ſtrong deluſion, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould believe lies, which
was my condition for a time, by the juſt judgement of God
upon me, as for other provocations, ſo eſpecially for reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the revealed will of God in his word, and hearkning
only to a voyce within me; becauſe what was ſpoken by it, was
ſeconded by lying wonders, of which God hath given notice
in his word, that ſo his people might not give credit to them,
nor be deluded by them. I hope the Reader will ſo far give
heed to what I have related concerning my ſelf, as to le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rn
thereby to take heed of being impoſed upon by the devil, though
he doth transform himſelf into an Angell of light; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
if any reap by it, I have my end: it hath been no ſmall
burthen to my conſcience (ſince Gods gracious deliverance of
me from this ſnare) that I ſhould ſo far gratifie the grand Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
as not only to liſten to his ſuggeſtions, &amp; imbrace his
voice for the voice of Chriſt, but alſo wholy to neglect thoſe
means, in the conſtant &amp; conſcientious uſe whereof God hath
promiſed to reveal himſelf unto his people, &amp; to give in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to them, which becauſe I found not (though through my
own default) I did in effect ſay, <hi>why ſhould I wait on the Lord
any longer?</hi> and ſo turned unto lying vanities. O! that all who
affect novelties, would ſeriouſly conſider of it, &amp; take warning

his grace in ſuch a manner as to my ſelf. I had before this
made this known to the world, had I had tranquillity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

in his Grace reſtored to me, I deſire the Chriſtian Reader
to joyn with me in returning praiſes unto the Lord for his

FOr the prevention of any ſuſpition of the truth of what this
contained in this Relation, the Reader is deſired to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
not only of the fidelity of thoſe witneſſes, who have ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
their names to it, (who dare not give teſtimony to any thing,
of the truth whereof they have not ſome grounded certainty)
but alſo of a tacit confeſſion of the adverſaries themſelves; or in
a Pamphlet ſet forth by <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> of <hi>Kendall</hi> (wherein
he pretendeth to anſwer what is contained in it) there is no
denial of the matter of fact, but only a multitude of moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
expreſſions, caſt out againſt the perſon of this ſtanding
Monument of Gods mercy: but thoſe who are acquainted with
this Generation, will not much wonder at this, ſeeing it is
their uſual dialect towards all, not of their own faction. In the
concluſion of that Pamphlet before mentioned, <hi>John Gilpin</hi> is
charged with drunkenneſs, and returning again to his former
filthineſſe, which is ſuch a notorious falſhood, that ſuch as have
had any knowledge of the ſaid <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> ſince that time, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but admire how any ſhould arrive to ſuch an height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
as to faſten ſuch a calumny upon him. 'Tis true,
there was information given in againſt him for drunkenneſs, by
a Quaker,<note place="margin">Anthony Pearſon.</note> to a <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> (but not upon oath) but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of their own faction, (and deſiring to have it ſo) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
ſent forth a Warrant againſt him; but the ſaid <hi>John
Gilpin</hi> (being altogether ignorant of it) was abſent upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
occaſion, being called to ſerve the Common-wealth, in
the Gariſon of the City of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> but did not fly for fear of
the Warrant, as that lying Pamphlet doth ſcandalouſly report.
Some of his friends in his abſence, knowing the Warrant to
have iſſued out upon miſinformation, took occaſion to examine
the matter further, and told thoſe that were his accuſers, that it
was a groſſe forgery, to which ſome of them anſwered, that it
was not, for he was drunk with ſin; &amp; this was all the charge that
any of his adverſaries would undertake to juſtifie againſt him.
See whether theſe perſons be not acted with a Jeſuitical Spirit,
who can ſo groſly equivocate; but for the wiping off of this
and all other aſperſions caſt upon <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> by theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Prince of darkneſs, the Reader is deſired to take
notice of theſe two following Teſtimonies, ſigned by men of
unqueſtioned integrity, who by their acquaintance with him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118825:10"/>
ſince the time of his deliverance from that grand deluſion, have
fully known his manner of life.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſeveral perſons called <hi>Quakers,</hi> men of corrupt
mindes, and reprobate concerning the faith, have aſperſed <hi>John
Gilpin</hi> as guilty of drunkenneſs, and other licencious practiſes,
ſince the time of Gods great goodneſs extended to him in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of him from the grand impoſtures of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> Theſe
are to certifie all perſons whomſoever, that we whoſe names are

cogniſance of his converſation during the time of his abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, and have found it to be not only civil, but alſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and ſuitable to the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that it hath
