         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF THE
LETTER out of the North, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Deferred my Thanks for your Laſt, till I could tell you
I had received the little Pamphlet, wherein you thought
I had ſome concern, therefore if this appear a ſlow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to yours, you are to blame the Carrier's pace,
which was not like to mend in ſo bad Weather and Ways.
But this is to own that I yeſterday received it; and being at
preſent from my own Houſe, and wanting the convenience
of my Books and Papers here, I thought it better to give you
an account of thoſe things which a firſt and ſecond Reading
ſuggeſted, than to take a longer time to conſider of it, and
thereby raiſe your Expectations beyond what I can come up
to. But beſides, the Letter you ſent me being both without
Date and Licence, I know not how long I may have been in
this worthy Author's Debt, and therefore make all the haſte
I can to get out of it. For altho I did not intend to have
troubled either him or the World with any more of my
Pamphlets, yet the Reſpect that he is pleaſed to ſhew to my
<hi>Quality,</hi> is ſo particular and obliging, that I was afraid I
ſhould have diſperaged my Breeding, if I had not made my
Acknowledgments for it. I might indeed have returned his
Complement, and begg'd your Pardon for giving you a
trouble for which there is ſo little occaſion; for I believe
there are ſome that think his Letter does as little need an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61692:3"/>
Anſwer as mine did. But I'le aſſure you I am very ſenſible
of his Favour in taking notice of ſuch a Trifle, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned and weighty Treatiſes lie by him unanſwered;
therefore ſhall not ſuppoſe he pick'd mine out becauſe it was
the weakeſt, but becauſe there was ſomething in it that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
an Anſwer. But yet I muſt not be ſo vain as to aſſume
all the good Language in the Book to my ſelf; for, to ſpeak
the Truth, he has pretty equally diſpenced his Favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three of us; but mine being the largeſt Part, I ſhall
leave the other two to anſwer for themſelves, while I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Author's dexterity in knocking down three at one
blow; I have indeed heard of killing two Birds with one
ſtone before, but three at a time, beſides routing a whole
Party, is ſo extraordinary, that I begin to fear Bombs will
come in faſhion in this kind of War alſo, for one ſingle Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
could never have made ſuch Deſtruction: But if there
be ſuch Execution by the by, alas, what will become of me,
againſt whom the murderous Engine was directly levelled?
But you will ſuppoſe that I have a little too much buſineſs
on my hands to make a long Preamble, therefore ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Letter, and take it as it riſes.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, he preſents us with a ſhort, and ſo
very ſhort an Account of the good Biſhop's Life, from his
Cradle to his laſt Sickneſs, that I have nothing to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, but that it is no longer; and to beg leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Author a little better in one Paſſage of it,<note place="margin">Page 4.</note> which I
muſt confeſs I did a little wonder to ſee inſiſted on, becauſe
that of his expoſing himſelf to the Rabble was not by his
Friends look'd on as the moſt prudent Act of his Life. But
the Truth as well as the Short of the Story, is this: They
have for a long time at <hi>York</hi> had a Cuſtom (which now chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
the Priviledg of a Preſcription) that all the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
Journy-men, and other Servants of the Town, had
the liberty to go into the Cathedral, and ring the Pancake-Bell
(as we call it in the Country) on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday;</hi> and
that being a time that a great many came out of the Country
to ſee the City, (if not their Friends) and Church; to oblige
the ordinary People, the Minſter uſed to be left open that
day, to let them go up to ſee the Lanthorn and Bells, which
were ſure to be pretty well exerciſed, and was thought a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61692:3"/>
more innocent Divertiſement than being at the Alehouſe.
But Dr. <hi>Lake,</hi> when he came firſt to reſide there, was very
much ſcandaliz'd at this Cuſtom, and was reſolved he would
break it at firſt daſh, altho all his Brethren of the Clergy did
diſſwade him from it. For altho they had as much Zeal both
for the Honour of God and the Church as he could have,
yet being better acquainted with the Temper of the People
than he was, they knew it would be a vain, as well as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
thing to attempt it: but all their Arguments could
not prevail, for he was reſolved to make the Experiment,
for which he had like to have paid very dear, for I'le aſſure
you 'twas very near coſting him his Life, and others too, that
in kindneſs came at firſt to diſſwade <hi>him,</hi> but had much ado
to ſecure <hi>themſelves.</hi> But however he did make ſuch a
Combuſtion and Mutiny, that I dare ſay <hi>York</hi> never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
nor ſaw the like, as many yet living can teſtify. But how
well ſoever the good Man deſigned in the thing, (as I verily
believe he did) yet his Zeal was ſo indiſcreetly managed,
that it had like to have produced the worſt of Miſchiefs;
and therefore in ſome Peoples Opinion, that were better
Judges of the Fact than I was, he did not deſerve any Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium
for it. But however at this time it would not be very
reaſonable to follow ſuch an Example, which was all I took
notice of it for.</p>
            <p>The other memorable Thing he relates,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> of his entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Orders in the time of the late Diſtractions, is
truly praiſe-worthy, altho he is not the only Man that did
it; for I know one that now fills as eminent a Place in the
Church as Bp <hi>Lake</hi> ever did, that did the ſame thing, and
that under more diſcouraging Circumſtances, for he had not
only the Danger of the Times to contend with, but was to
reject the Importunity of his Friends alſo, nay more than
that, to overcome himſelf, and root out all thoſe Prejudices
that a contrary Education (for he was brought up a ſtrict
Presbyterian) and Prepoſſeſſion had implanted in him, which
were indeed ſuch Difficulties as might have diſcouraged any
body but himſelf, but by God's Grace he overcame them all,
and is now as uſeful, as eminent in that Church, to which
he dedicated himſelf ſix years before K. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.
But I do not ſay this to derogate from Bp <hi>Lake,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61692:4"/>
for the more Inſtances the better, of ſuch heroick Vertue;
therefore could have wiſh'd that our Author had given us a
larger Account of that excellent Biſhop, whoſe Life I dare
ſay might have furniſhed him with a great many more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Paſſages; however I think there is nothing more that I
need inſiſt upon in the firſt Part, for I do not know that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
queſtioned either the Biſhop's making of the Profeſſion,
or the Solemnity of the Circumſtances with which it was
done, therefore muſt crave leave to tell my Author, that he
has a little miſtaken the Point, for 'twas not the <hi>making,</hi> but
the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of it that I excepted againſt: for to another
body it would be pretty evident that it was only the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it that ſeemed ſo unaccountable to me, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it's a Parentheſis, and only in that, is ſaid, <q>That there
ſeemed no greater occaſion for the making of it, than there
was for my Lord Archbiſhop to put out Manifeſto's to tell
the People he is ſuſpended on the ſame account.</q> (for theſe
are the very Words of the Letter:) and where the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them lies, or <hi>the angry Objection againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Proteſtation,</hi> I muſt confeſs I do not yet ſee.
For I hope the putting him in the ſame form with his Grace
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> could be no Affront or Diſparagement; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I dare ſay the good Biſhop would not have thought it
ſo. But the Perſon of Quality is upon all occaſions ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
obliged to this worthy Author, that 'tis all one
what I ſay, for even my own Encomiums meet with this
Return; for theſe are his Words, <q>His Civility and due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for the Memory of the late Reverend Biſhop,<note place="margin">Page 13.</note> I ſhould
with all Thankfulneſs moſt readily acknowledg, if I could
think it not deſigned, with the better Grace and more Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
to caſt a blemiſh upon one of the laſt and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Acts of his Life.</q> But I wonder how long he and the
Perſon of Quality have been ſo intimately acquainted; for
although I am ſure he does not know my Face, yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to know my Heart a great deal better than I do my
ſelf, (if the Inferences he is pleaſed to make in this and ſome
other Places are true) for I can aſſure you he tells me of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
I never thought on. But ſince he makes ſuch Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I hope he will take care to anſwer them, for I thank
God I am not at all concerned to do it. But in the mean
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61692:4"/>
time he did very well to ſlip his own Neck out of the Collar;
and though he pretends to anſwer my Letter, yet waves the
main Point, which was the Deſign of <hi>publiſhing</hi> the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which he tells us does not at all <hi>concern his Friends,
who had no hand in it.</hi> But truly that would hardly be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if he did not affirm it; for not many lines before, the
Perſon of Quality is accuſed for deſigning to caſt a Blemiſh
on the laſt and moſt ſolemn Act of his Life. Upon which,
if this be true, it ſeems his Friends ſet no very great Value;
for methinks 'tis pretty odd that what was ſigned and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo ſolemnly, ſhould be immediately ſo expoſed, that the
Witneſſes and Friends, ſhould neither know how, nor why
it was made publick; but that was a Query that I believe it
was not convenient to anſwer, and ſo did very well to
ſtart a new Queſtion; and although he will not tell you
why the Profeſſion was publiſh'd (though he knows it as
well as moſt Men in <hi>England</hi>) yet he will tell you as good a
thing, and that is, the reaſon why the Biſhop <hi>made</hi> it. But
before he can do that, he muſt have t'other fling at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality, in whom he has made ſuch Diſcoveries, as
I dare ſay, you in ſo many Years Acquaintance have never
made. But Quality indeed, were a very deſirable thing,
if it would make one more ſagacious than other People;
but poor I, am like to loſe my Gentility, becauſe I am not
ſo quick-ſighted, as to ſee <hi>what is ſo obvious to Perſons of leſs
Rank and Quality, than I would be thought of;</hi> for ſtill he
will be divining my Thoughts, but has hitherto been ſo
much out, that I would not adviſe him to ſet up for a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-Teller,
of all things, unleſs he can make better
Gueſſes at other Peoples Hands, than he has from my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
for although I do extreamly value the Eſteem of good
Men, yet I never deſired either to be, or to be thought a
great Man. So that without any Offence, he may believe
me a Chimney-Sweeper, or a Cobler, if he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But now he tells us,<note place="margin">Page 14.</note> 
               <hi>That all Men of Reaſon, knew that
the Reaſons for the Doctrine of</hi> Paſſive Obedience <hi>could not
be contained in ſo ſmall a Compaſs, and are not well conſiſtent with
the Deſign of a Profeſſion.</hi> But if the Deſign of it was to
give the World Satisfaction, and that in a Controverted
Point, which was no Fundamental of the Faith, nor any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61692:5"/>
way eſſential either to the Being or Well-being of the
Church; then I cannot think it would have been ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to have ſubjoined the Reaſons that made him of that
Opinion, rather than of the other. For there being as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great and good Men too, of the other Side, Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s
bare Name and Opinion is not of Weight enough to turn
the Scales, and ſo we of the Laity muſt ſtill remain in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
For we muſt diſſent from ſome of our <hi>Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in God,</hi> let us take which ſide we pleaſe; and being
willing to hear both, ſhould have been very glad to have
ſeen the Biſhop's Reaſons for his adhering ſo ſtifly to that
Doctrine. For, with Submiſſion to the <hi>Reverend Author,</hi>
what Satisfaction ſoever it might give the good Biſhop in
the making, the publiſhing has not given the World very
much, for it only tells us, <hi>That he lived and died in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
For really, I cannot yet ſee any great Weight in that
Argument of his having been bred and born in it; Nay,
indeed, I think it is no Argument at all; for it being
common to all Religions, cannot be a Proof of the
Truth of any. And thoſe which do lay any great
Weight upon that, I ſhould ſuſpect had but very little to ſay
for that Religion, or Opinion, that muſt be adhered to only
on that account. But to prove the Properneſs of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
the Author is pleaſed to cite the ſaying of St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi>
               <q>Who when,<note place="margin">Page 24.</note> at his Martyrdom, he was offered
his Life if he would revile our Saviour, anſwered, That
he had now ſerved him 86 Years, and he never did me, ſays
he, any Injury, and how can I blaſpheme my King and my
Saviour? This was (adds my Author) thought ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as to be recorded in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
down to Poſterity. Though I ſuppoſe it can be no
more imagined that Chriſtians only lived then to 86 Years
of Age, than that only Men of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
now are bred and born in their Religion.</q> But what then?
for really he would have obliged ſuch a dull Creature as the
Perſon of Quality is mightily, if he would have told him
the Inference that he is to make from this extraordinary
Compariſon: For all that I can make of it is this, In <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>'s
Days, other People beſides himſelf lived to be 86
Years old. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s being bred and born in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61692:5"/>
Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> is an undeniable Proof of the
Truth of it. And in his next Paragraph he brings another
Evidence for the Antiquity of it, that I think is not much
ſhort of this, as to the end it was deſigned for; for he tells
us,<note place="margin">Page 25.</note> 
               <hi>The Biſhop had lived to hear it affirmed, that</hi> Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<hi>was a Doctrine of but 40 or 50 Years ſtanding.</hi> But
his Teſtimony alone being ſufficient to confute that Error,
it was moſt proper and requiſite for him to aver, that he was
educated in that Doctrine, and that it was not only as old
as he could remember, who was now 65 Years of Age, but
that it was taught him as an ancient Doctrine. <hi>And this, Sir</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>was the way of maintaining the Truth of old, by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt Hereticks.</hi> What? by bringing a Youth of 15
Years old (for Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> was no more 50 Years ago) to
depoſe for the Antiquity of a Doctrine, and by the ſingle
Inſtance of his being brought up in it, prove the Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it. And if this be ſuch convincing Evidence of his
ſide, and if he would pleaſe to give us leave to bring in our
Witneſſes, 'tis poſſible we might produce as ancient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Perſons, who would tell us another Story. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
truly for my own part, I can eaſily believe the
Doctrine to be of a much ancienter date than fifty Years, and
'tis poſſible might be taught by ſome from the Reformation.
For there was ſome reaſon to cajole <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and
ſo to make him more favourable to them, they might tell
him what good Paſſive Subjects they were like to make;
which was a thing he liked very well, and therefore it might
be a prevalent Argument with him to encourage them as
much as he could; but for all that, I am very far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it was the Faith of the whole Clergy, either then,
or at any time ſince; but yet believe it gained more ground
ſince King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reſtauration, and was more generally
received than ever it was before; but yet for all that, Sir,
I am ſure that both you and I know ſome of the eminent
Fathers of our Church, who never owned it in that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> and ſome others preach'd it up at.
But after all, the Truth is, no Doctrine ought to be valued
for the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. For at that rate
Heatheniſm might claim the Preference to Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis certain it had the Precedence of it; but Truth is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61692:6"/>
Truth, though reveal'd but yeſterday, and Error not the leſs
Error (but the more to be avoided) for being of ſome
hundred of Years ſtanding. But for all thoſe weighty
Reaſons for the Biſhop's making this Profeſſion, I cannot
ſay that I yet ſee any Reaſon to change my Opinion. For
I do ſtill believe that his ſubmitting to a Suſpenſion, was
a more convincing Proof of his Opinion, than a thouſand
Volumns; nay, I will ſay, than a thouſand ſuch Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For I dare appeal to the Author himſelf, whether
if Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> had not ſubmitted to Suſpenſion, he would
have believed this or any other Proteſtation of that Nature
that he could have made; ſo that it ſtill ſeems very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to me, that though he made it to pleaſe himſelf, yet
there was no Neceſſity on the Biſhop's Account to make it
publick; the World being as much ſatisfied of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as they could be. But although the Author does not
think fit to tell us what were the Deſigns of publiſhing it,
yet he is pleaſed to quarrel with the Inferences I make from
it, but how juſtly, you ſhall ſee preſently: For I thank
him, inſtead of confuting, he has confirm'd my firſt Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
ſo that truly I have no Reaſon to be offended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he ſays he has now found out the Cauſe why I am
ſo. But at this time the Perſon of Quality is not a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
but ſpeaks only for himſelf in his private Capacity;
ſo that I dare not undertake for others, to whom perhaps
he has given Provocation enough: but they being to be
Judges in that Matter, I have nothing more to ſay to that,
only to obſerve, that inſtead of denying what I charged
the Profeſſion with, the cutting off the Clergy in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, he does now abſolutely cut off the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of our Clergy now, that is, I am ſure the major
part of the Biſhops of this Kingdom, from being true Sons
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for which, if you pleaſe, you
may read his own Words;<note place="margin">Page 25.</note> where repeating my firſt Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which was to ſuppoſe that the Proteſtation did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
that from the beginning of the Reformation, ever
ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> was reſtored to its Purity,
<hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> was the Corner-ſtone of it, for 'tis call'd
(though he omits that Clauſe, which perhaps is the Reaſon
he does not underſtand the Epithite) the diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61692:6"/>
Character of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To which he replies,
<q>That whatever my meaning may be in calling it the
<hi>Corner-Stone,</hi> he muſt tell me plainly, That <hi>Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
has been ever the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And when I ſay afterwards, So that it ſeems none
were accounted her true Sons, that did not hold it; if
he means, that none beſides were accounted to hold her
Doctrines whole and entire, or to hold all the Truth
which ſhe teaches, the Deſign of the Paper is to aſſert it
too.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But here I muſt admire the Author's Cunning extreamly,
though I cannot much commend either his Ingenuity or good
Nature; for although he does very peremptorily in his own
Name tell the Perſon of Quality plainly, That <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
has been ever the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
yet he is ſo kind to Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> as to allow him the
Honour of condemning all that did not receive it: For he
owns it was the Deſign of the Paper to aſſert they were not
true Sons that did not. But, firſt, I would know by what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Priviledg it is, that Biſhop does take upon him to
cenſure ſo many of his Brethren; and in the next Place I
would be willing to be informed what Authority the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had to pronounce ſuch a Sentence againſt ſo many of
his Superiours. But whether he will think fit to anſwer
theſe two Queries or no, we have got a good Experiment
by the by; for although at firſt he pretended Ignorance
as to the Deſign of publiſhing the Paper, he now owns it
with a Witneſs, by which it ſeems the Perſon of Quality
was not ſo very much out in his Gueſs; but however, he
did very wiſely to lay all the Blame on the poor Biſhop.</p>
            <p>But by the Treatment the Living Clergy receive from
him, you may ſuppoſe the Dead had not fared much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for they had all certainly been cut off at one ſlap,
but that, by good Fortune for them, he can bring them
over to his Party. But that is the thing now to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
though having not at preſent the command of my
Books, (as I told you at the beginning) I ſhall take the
Gentleman's Quotations, hoping he has dealt a little
more faithfully with his Authors, than he has with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality in ſome places, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61692:7"/>
And ſince for Expedition-ſake I allow all his Citations;
all that remains for me to conſider, is, Whether his Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from them will hold or no. And in anſwer to what I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of the Clergies giving Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> three ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Subſidies on the account of her aſſiſting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
the Scotiſh and French Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to undertake to prove two things: Firſt, That <hi>Queen</hi>
Elizabeth <hi>did not aſſiſt the Scots or French in any Rebellion, but
always declared the contrary.</hi> But before he comes to that, he
is to premiſe two things, which I ſhall very willingly yield
him; The Firſt is, that for Soveraign Princes in War to ſerve
themſelves of the Treachery and Revolt of another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
Subjects, is no more than what is always done, and is by
the Law of Nations held lawful, and the neceſſity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ſeems to require it. Secondly, That it is lawful for
Princes to make the beſt Terms they can, for Subjects that
have <hi>been ſerviceable to their Intereſt in a juſt War, tho by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt their own Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it may not be amiſs to collect the Obſervations
theſe two Poſitions will afford us: for the Premiſſes being
granted on both ſides, I hope the Concluſions will not be
denied by either. And from the firſt we may infer that 'tis
not only lawful, but ſometimes neceſſary, to encourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in a neighbouring Prince's Kingdom; or elſe I
cannot very eaſily imagine what he means by ſaying, <hi>The
neceſſity of Affairs ſeems to require it.</hi> For it ſeems the
Good and Preſervation of a Nation is a thing of ſuch vaſt
Concern, that Princes are diſpenſed with, and not obliged
by the Rules of common Juſtice (as he himſelf tells us in
the ſame page.) And ſince he is pleaſed to grant this, I know
not why he ſhould ſtick at the further Conſequence, which
he is ſenſible does naturally enough flow from the former,
and therefore would prevent the Objection: And ſays, 'tis
no good Conſequence that Subjects may rebel, becauſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes may take advantage by their Rebellion to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their own Rights, or to ſecure their Dominions. But if
it be lawful for a King, for the Security of his own People,
to raiſe or foment a Rebellion in his Neighbour's Country, I
cannot ſee but it may be as lawful for Subjects to aſſert their
own Rights againſt their own Prince, as it is to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61692:7"/>
by ſetting others Subjects againſt their King, unleſs
he will pleaſe to ſay that Subjects have no Intereſt nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in the common Safety, but are obliged to ſtand ſtill to
have their Throats cut, which would be a pretty odd Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure
upon the Foundation he juſt now laid. For
ſurely the Diſpenſation that he ſays is given to Princes, by
which they are exempt from following the Rules of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Juſtice, was not given on their own but the Peoples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
And if a petty Prince may lawfully engage all the
great Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> in War and Confuſion for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of his own Subjects, ſhall the Rights of thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be ſo inconſiderable to them, that they muſt loſe them
tamely, if their Prince ſhould miſtake his Office, or miſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his Power, and ſubvert thoſe Rights he is obliged to
maintain? For although, by our Author's own Poſition, Kings
may lawfully do unjuſt things for the Preſervation of the
Rights and Liberties of their Subjects; yet neither this
Author, nor any I have yet met with, will ſay that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a King to deſtroy his Subjects, or ſubvert the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
although indeed ſome have ſaid that we ought to
ſubmit and be paſſive if they will do it. But truly our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has given us too high a value of our Priviledges (which
it ſeems are to be preferr'd before our King's Virtue and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice)
to make us part with them ſo eaſily. But perhaps
we may be a little miſtaken in the Nature of Rebellion, and
it may not be ſo great a Sin in ſome Countries as others;
and ſo we may lawfully excite them to that which we are
not to commit our ſelves: But beſides that, this is a little
too much encroaching upon the Devil's Office, who was firſt
known by the name of Tempter among Men, (and truly
much upon the ſame ſcore that he allows Princes to do it
for the Preſervation and Enlargement of their own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
but beſides this, I ſay, if it be but a ſmall Sin in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in other Countries to what it would be here; yet ſince
our Saviour hath told us, <hi>Mat. 5. 19. That he that teacheth
Men to break one of the leaſt Commandments, ſhall be the leaſt in
the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> I thought this had been as ſtanding
a Rule of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as Paſſive Obedience it
ſelf. For to make another body ſin, I always thought not
a leſſer, but a higher Guilt, than to commit it my ſelf, having
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61692:8"/>
his Fact, as well as my own Contrivance, to anſwer for. For
I think I may as lawfully be drunk my ſelf, as deſignedly
make another ſo. And in another Vice, the Procurer is
thought more inexcuſable and odious too, than the Party
that employed them, who may perhaps be under a greater
Temptation. But however, this is evident, that 'tis not the
doing of the thing, but the taking pleaſure in them that do
it, that is by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. ſet down for the
higheſt pitch of Sin and Wickedneſs. Therefore if, as our
Auther has obſerved, <hi>the neceſſity of Affairs ſhould require</hi> us
to become Tempters, let us not aſſume the other part of
the Devil's Title, and turn Accuſers of our Brethren alſo,
and condemn them for that to which we have betrayed
them, but find ſome gentler Name for that which our
Author grants may not be only uſeful, but ſometimes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
for the Preſervation of a Nation. But although I
have been longer on this than I deſigned, yet I muſt not
wholly balk the ſecond Poſition, for that will afford us
ſome very uſeful Obſervations, for he tells us, <q>'Tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Princes to make the beſt Terms they can for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that have been ſerviceable to their Intereſts in a
juſt War, though by Rebellion againſt their own Prince.</q>
From which we may gather, that our Author thinks it
poſſible for Subjects to be engaged in a juſt War againſt their
own Prince: And if they may with Juſtice fight againſt
their King for another Prince's Right, I cannot at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
why they may not for their own. For ſurely the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my own Country ought to be dearer to me than all the
World beſides; and I have more Reaſon to defend the
Rights and Priviledges of that, than all the Princes Titles
in the World. But if our Author ſhould not allow all the
Inferences I have made from his Conceſſions, yet I have a
great deal of Reaſon to thank him for them, becauſe they
will not only be of uſe to me hereafter, but do at preſent
in great meaſure ſupercede what I ſhould elſe have ſaid to
his Hiſtory. For 'tis perfectly indifferent to me, whether
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did aſſiſt the French and Scotiſh Proteſtants
or no, ſince by his firſt Poſition he grants, <hi>She might have
ſerv'd her ſelf of the Treachery and Revolt of other Princes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
For 'twas the lawfulneſs of the Action, and not the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61692:8"/>
Fact it ſelf, that was the great point in queſtion: and ſince
he allows ſhe might have aſſiſted them, though they had been
Rebels, we will never quarrel about it, whether they were
ſo or no. For truly, the Perſon of Quality is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that he has ſo learned an Author of his ſide, that proves
all he deſires ſhould be aſſerted in the point: For ſince he
will allow the French Proteſtants were not Rebels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had the Law of their ſide: Nor were the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>
guilty of Rebellion againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
becauſe he firſt acted contrary to the <hi>Laetus Introitus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 33.</note> 
               <hi>and
diſengaged them from their Obedience, when he had broke the
Condition of it.</hi> If he will but pleaſe to be as gracious to his
own Country-men, and allow them the benefit of their own
Laws, and ſuffer the Oaths of Princes to be as binding in
<hi>England,</hi> as it ſeems they then were in <hi>Spain,</hi> I know no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that will deſire any more of him. Nay, I will go farther
than this; for if he can name any one Perſon that was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
to King <hi>James</hi> after the Allowances above are granted
him; rather than he ſhould go unpuniſh'd, I think I ſhould
be his Executioner; for I hate thoſe that rebel againſt, and
break the Laws, as much as the Author can do: And ſince
Rebellion is ſo horrid a Sin, I would not have <hi>England</hi> to
have the Encloſure of it; but only deſire that we may be
allowed to fight for our Laws and Liberties, as other Nations
do, without being thought Rebels for ſo doing. But if our
Author will not allow us the ſame Priviledges he gives to all
the World beſide, there would be ſome reaſon to ſuſpect
that he deſigns us the Monopoly of that he ſo exclaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
and is ſo particularly kind to his own Country, as
ſometimes to lay them under the unhappy neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either Rebels or Slaves. And I have ſomething the more
Reaſon to fear this, becauſe I find he is not ſo ſollicitous to
clear the <hi>Scots</hi> from the imputation of Rebels, as he is the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> But let them be what they will, you ſee
'tis evident Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not aſſiſt them; ſhe only
furniſh'd them with Men, Money, and Ammunition. And
when the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> came and flung her ſelf into her
Protection, and implored her Aid for reſtoring her to her
Crown, ſhe then aſſerted her Cauſe with a witneſs. For
had that unhappy Princeſs truſted to the Mercy of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61692:9"/>
as great Rebels as they were, I am ſure they could not
have treated her worſe than ſhe was uſed by that Queen,
who our Author tells us, <hi>always declared againſt any Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Subjects in their Reſiſtance, which ſhe always called Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
But I ſuppoſe Princes are no more obliged to ſpeak
Truth, than they are tied to do Juſtice; for which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
gave them a Diſpenſation before.</p>
            <p>But I think it now time to proceed to the <hi>2d</hi> thing he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to prove, which is, <q>That it was the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time, that it is unlawful for
Subjects to reſiſt, and that therefore our Divines juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> no otherwiſe than upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which are conſiſtent with this Doctrine.</q> And
truly if our Author hold in the ſame mind he was when
he promiſed the two Poſitions (before enlarged on) and
acquitted the <hi>French</hi> from Rebellion, becauſe they had the
Law of their Side; and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> becauſe their King had
forfeited his Right to their Obedience by breaking his part
of the Pact and Stipulation between them; I do not ſee
but he and I ſhall agree in this, as well as the Divines
of this Age do with thoſe in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days.
For I ſuppoſe the Convocation at that time did approve
of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> his Sentiments as to that matter; for the
Author tells us the Book was peruſed and allowed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority, and alſo dedicated to the Queen; ſo
that it ſeems to be that which they were all willing to
ſtand by. And I heartily wiſh that all our Biſhops would
do ſo too, and make that very Paſſage he cites out of
Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> the Judg of the Controverſy; for then I
think it would be pretty ſoon decided; and therefore I
ſhall tranſcribe the Place in the very ſame words he has
done, <hi>page</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
might lawfully defend themſelves from Injuſtice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and be aided by other Princes their Neighbours.
If the King, as too mighty for them, ſought to oppreſs
them, to whom they owe not ſimple Subjection, but
reſpective Homage, as <hi>Scotland</hi> did to <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Normandy</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> when the Kings notwithſtanding
had bitter Wars each with other. The reſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61692:9"/>
that did aſſiſt them, if it were the King's Act that
did oppreſs them and not the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> except the Laws do
permit them means to ſave the State from open Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
I will not excuſe; and yet the Circumſtances
muſt be fully known before the Fact can be rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
with which I confeſs I am not ſo exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</q>
Now in this Paſſage here are three ſeveral
things obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He abſolutely acquits the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but their Aſſociates only upon Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Law permitted them to oppoſe the King's
Tyranny; but the <hi>Guiſes</hi> Oppreſſion they might without
Law. But although the Biſhop ſays, he will not excuſe
thoſe that reſiſt the King without Law, yet it is pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
that he ſeems to ſuppoſe that even in ſuch a Caſe,
there may be Circumſtances which may render them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,
and which ought to be fully known before the
Fact can be diſcerned, and therefore he does forbear
paſſing his Judgment on them, becauſe he is not thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with the Circumſtances. And now were
all our Divines of this good Biſhop's Faith in this Point,
or at leaſt had they but his Charity, and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
their Brethren before they underſtood the Cauſe,
they would certainly underſtand one another a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they do, or however there would be no Diviſions
nor Schiſmes about it, which God grant they do not
now make in the Church. But whatever others do, we
are I hope ſure of our Reverend Author, for he has proved
that the Clergy in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were of his Faith as to
this Queſtion, therefore ſhould have thought it unneceſſary
to have ſaid any thing more, but that for the Authors In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
I muſt anſwer an Objection or two about <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
whoſe Example though ſo much recommended, might
perhaps carry us farther, and give greater Liberties than
the Perſon of Quality ever deſired; for I'le aſſure you,
defenſive Arms will at any time content him.<note place="margin">Page 39.</note> But our Author
is pleaſed to ask how it appears, <hi>David</hi> took up defenſive
Arms, for the <hi>Homily</hi> tells us of no ſuch thing. But I
can tell him of as Authentick a Book that does; nay that
tells us a little more of <hi>David:</hi> for if he will pleaſe to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61692:10"/>
read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 2. and 29. 8. he will find it was not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Fault that he did not uſe offenſive Weapons againſt
<hi>Saul,</hi> if fighting againſt him be to be called ſo; for if
we may believe his own Words, he certainly intended
that as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Sam. 28. And it came to paſs in thoſe
Days, that the Philiſtines gathered their Armies together for
Warfare, to fight with</hi> Iſrael: <hi>and</hi> Achiſh <hi>ſaid anto</hi> David,
<hi>Know thou aſſuredly, that thou ſhalt go out with me to battel,
thou and thy Men. And</hi> David <hi>ſaid to</hi> Achiſh, <hi>Surely thou
ſhalt know what thy Servant can do. And</hi> Achiſh <hi>ſaid to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<hi>therefore will I make thee Keeper of mine Head for ever.</hi>
And in Purſuance of this we find <hi>David</hi> and his Men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<hi>Achiſh</hi> (the very Day before the Battel) as his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Guard, which perhaps might be one thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſo, that they would not
let him go to fight with them; and <hi>Achiſh</hi> againſt his Will
is forced to diſmiſs <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Expoſtulation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.
8. is very remarkable, for I think 'tis one of the moſt
paſſionate things of the kind I have met with; <hi>And</hi> David
<hi>ſaid unto</hi> Achiſh; <hi>But what have I done? and what haſt thou
found in thy Servant ſo long as I have been with thee unto this
Day? that I may not go fight againſt the Enemies of my Lord
the King.</hi> And <hi>Achiſh</hi> was forced to command him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, for you ſee he diſputed the firſt; which ſatisfies
me that he was in earneſt, and was unwilling to return.
And now what can be ſaid againſt ſo plain a Text? For
my own part I can foreſee but two things: the Firſt, That
<hi>David</hi> did diſſemble with <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and did not intend to
fight: but that I think is a very unworthy Thought, for
<hi>David</hi> had been a very baſe and ungrateful Man to have
either deceived or betrayed <hi>Achiſh,</hi> who had given him
Protection, and was ſo truly kind to him. The ſecond
thing is, That a Subject may liſt himſelf under a Forreign
Prince, and in his quarrel lawfully fight againſt their own
King; and if ſo, then all that liſted themſelves under the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> might ſtill be as good Subjects to King <hi>James</hi>
as <hi>David</hi> at that time was to <hi>Saul:</hi> And as to the proof of
his taking up defenſive Arms, he may find that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 2.
<hi>And every one that was in Diſtreſs, and every one that was in
Debt, and every one that was diſcontented, gathered themſelves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61692:10"/>
unto him, and he became Captain over them.</hi> And here is as
formal levying of War, as I think can be deſired, and if it
was not to defend himſelf, I know not to what purpoſe it
was; for if he deſired only Flight, he might have done
that ſafer as well as privater by himſelf than with an Army.
Nor was that Army of any uſe as to the gaining of the
Crown after <hi>Saul</hi>'s Death; for God commanded him to go
and live at <hi>Hebron;</hi> where the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> of their own
Accord went down and made him King, as he will find
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. So that ſo many hundred Men from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the ending were of no uſe unleſs it were to defend
him againſt <hi>Saul;</hi> and that he did deſign to have gariſon'd
<hi>Keilah,</hi> but that God told him the Men of the Place would
betray him: I think nothing can be more evident from
any Text, in Spight of all the Author's Comments. But
now he refers me to the laſt <hi>Homily</hi> againſt Rebellion, as I
did him to the ſecond;<note place="margin">Page 42.</note> and asks me, whether King <hi>John</hi>'s
Subjects took up only defenſive Arms? But by Biſhop
<hi>Bilſon</hi>'s excellent Rule above cited, neither he nor I ought
to judg them becauſe we do not, nor cannot know all their
Circumſtances: For Hiſtorians are ſeldom ſo impartial as
to give us all things in their true Colours. But the Deſign
of that <hi>Homily</hi> was only to ſhew the Intolerableneſs of
the Romiſh Yoke, and how impoſſible it was for them that
depended on and obeyed the <hi>Pope</hi> to be good Subjects. But
as for King <hi>John</hi> himſelf, he had been as great a Traitor,
and uſed him that ſhould have been his Soveraign, as ill as
his Subjects could do him; for all the World knows that
he firſt uſurp'd the Crown, and then killed Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>
that was the true Heir. And truly if their preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
would have purſued King <hi>John</hi>'s Method, they might
before this have had as indiſputable a Title, and had as
much Right to have been called Natural Soveraign Lord, as
King <hi>John</hi> had. But ſhall they have the leſs Reſpect,
and be the worſe thought on, becauſe they ſpared the Life
of our late unfortunate King, and ſuffered him to eſcape
when he was in their Power, nay would not abridg him of
his Liberty, although they knew he would uſe it againſt
their Intereſt? If this be the Quarrel that the Clergy have
againſt King <hi>William,</hi> I ſhall admire their Politicks a great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61692:11"/>
deal more than their Divinity. But to return to King
<hi>John:</hi> What Cauſe our Anceſtors might have to repent
them of their Wars againſt him I know not, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Poſterity think they have not much, for it
produced thoſe great Priviledges wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
glory. The Charter obtained from him being the
firſt part, or firſt Draught if you pleaſe, of the famous
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> confirmed afterwards by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> whom
the Homily might have cited as well as King <hi>John,</hi> if it
had been the Subjects Rebellion, and not the Pope's U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation
that they deſigned to declaim againſt. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am very far from juſtifying all that was done
in thoſe two King's Reigns, yet I think verily the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would have a harder Task to perſwade the People of
<hi>England</hi> to give up the Advantages they hold from it. And
I think I may undertake to call back both King <hi>James</hi> and
<hi>Popery</hi> (for they deceive themſelves that think they are to
be ſeparated, for could they have been divided he need
never to have forſaken his Crown and Kingdom) when he
ſhall prevail with the People of this Nation to give up their
<hi>Magna Charta:</hi> For if the former never return (as I pray
God they may not) till we are willing to part with the
latter; both the Author and I may have Reaſon to ſay as
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> does, <hi>Iſaiah 39. Good is the Word of the Lord, for
Peace and Truth ſhall be in my Days.</hi> But although 'tis a
very true Rule that we muſt not do Evil, that Good may
come of it, yet when Evil is done (eſpecially if without
our Conſent) it is certainly very lawful both to enjoy and
rejoice in that Good which God Almighty by his infinite
Wiſdom ſhall bring out of it; and if our Author is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conſcienced, that he is of another Mind, and will not
receive Advantage from any thing which ſprings from other
Peoples Sins, he muſt not only deny the Priviledges of his
Birth-Right as an <hi>Engliſh-Man,</hi> but even his Chriſtianity
alſo: For was there ever ſo horrid a Sin as crucifying the
Son of God? And yet what a loſt undone World has this
been, if that had not happened? And although for ten
thouſand Worlds I would not be the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> nor
any of the impenitent <hi>Jews,</hi> yet with what <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> ought
we to celebrate that Divine Goodneſs, that from Man's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61692:11"/>
greateſt Sin, and the Devil's higheſt Malice could thus
work out Mans Salvation. And indeed Events of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeem to be the great Abyſs of God's Wiſdom, as
well as Goodneſs, which Man's ſhallow Reaſon muſt never
pretend to ſound: but however we may adore what we
cannot comprehend, and with the Apoſtle cry out, <hi>O Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo,</hi>
Rom. 11. 33. <hi>Oh the Height and the Depth of the
Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledg of God! How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable
are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
And perhaps this might be a better Employment for all
our Thoughts than to cenſure and quarrel with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
becauſe they are not of our Sentiments in all Points,
and if they think themſelves ſo much in the Right, yet
pray let them remember the Apoſtle's Rules, <hi>That they which
are ſtrong ought to bear with the Infirmities of the weak, and not
to pleaſe themſelves,</hi> Rom. 15. 1. And he alſo commands the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> that they <hi>bear one anothers Burdens, and ſo to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the Law of Chriſt.</hi> But alas, inſtead of following this
Method, we rather chuſe to imitate the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi>
who by laying heavy Burdens on other Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
thought to diſcharge their own Duty. But for all
they ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Seat, yet all their Comments on the Law
were not true, nor were all Conjectures falſe that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
their received Opinions and Infallibility; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more intailed on the Chair now, than it was then,
it would be very happy if all ſides would remember and
obſerve <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s Advice to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſaid very well
when he told them, <hi>Acts 5. 38. If this Counſel and Work be
of Men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot
overthrow it, leſt happily ye be found to fight againſt God.</hi>
Therefore it would be Piety as well as Diſcretion for both
ſides to attend a little, and not divide from, much leſs fall
foul upon one another, till they are ſure that by ſo doing
they ſhall not oppoſe God alſo. Although I muſt confeſs
I have ſome Temptation to believe from what has already
happened, that it is the Lords Doing; and that upon this
Conſideration, that all the ways of returning to King
<hi>James,</hi> are guarded by the blackeſt and fouleſt Sins that a
Nation can poſſibly be guilty of; and you muſt break
thorow, that is commit all of them before you can open
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61692:12"/>
any one Door for his Return. For <hi>1ſt.</hi> There would be
the greateſt Falſeneſs, and higheſt Ingratitude in the World,
againſt a Prince that put his Life in his Hand, and expoſed
his own Perſon to the greateſt Hazard to reſcue a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church and ſinking Nation. <hi>2dly.</hi> No Perſon can ſo
much as treat of ſuch a thing without incurring the Guilt
of Treaſon, for by the ancient Laws of the Land 'tis Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to conſpire againſt the King <hi>de facto.</hi> Then <hi>3dly.</hi> There
would be the ſame Guilt of Perjury in breaking an Oath to
him as to King <hi>James. 4thly.</hi> They muſt betray God's
Church, and the true Religion, and give up their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to Ruin and Devaſtation; and conſequently have all
the Blood to anſwer for, that ſhould be ſhed in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Revolution: So that were King <hi>James</hi>'s Return a
good Worth projecting for on other Accounts, yet that
ſtanding Rule of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>That you muſt not do Evil that
Good may come of it,</hi> ought to deter any body from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
it; but when the thing it ſelf, if compaſs'd, would
be the greateſt Miſchief, it would then be the greateſt
Height of Madneſs as well as Sin to go about it. For can
any body think that the deſtroying a Church and Nation,
nay extirpating the true Faith out of the World (that is,
as far as we can go towards it) is ſo meritorious a thing,
that it will legitimate the uſe of thoſe means, which it was
not lawful to uſe, no not for the planting of the Goſpel;
and if any Man can think this but a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> (for a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
moral <hi>Papiſt</hi> I believe will not) I ſhould indeed think it
a great Infatuation; but however that would not alter the
Nature of things, but my Rule would ſtill remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken;
for the way to Duty always lies plain and open, <hi>ſo
that he that runs may read.</hi> And although ſometimes it may be
attended with Sufferings, yet I am confident never any
Perſon had the fatal Neceſſity of ſining laid on him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to diſcharge any Part of his Duty to God or Man.
But I beg Pardon for this Digreſſion which proved longer
than I at firſt deſigned it, but yet I ſhall not think it imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
if it proves uſeful to the undeceiving of any that have
been carried out of the way by the ſpecious Pretence of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.
But to return to my Author.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61692:12"/>
And the next thing we are to conſider, is the Epithet of
the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and you may remember that I ask'd you whether you thought
it neceſſary for particular Churches to have particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
Doctrines; for that to me it appear'd ſo far
from neceſſary, that I thought it very inconvenient. But
he tells us as to that, <q>Whether diſtinguiſhing Doctrines
be convenient or inconvenient, it is according as the
Doctrines are good or bad. No doubt it is inconvenient
to have bad diſtinguiſhing Doctrines, but it is as certain
that it is very convenient for a Church to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Doctrines, provided they be good ones, unleſs
a Church can be obliged to err for Company, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Diſtinction.</q> But I would be very glad to know up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what <hi>Theſis</hi> it is he grounds this dogmatical Concluſion,
That a Church muſt needs err that holds only the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, and has not ſome particular Doctrine of its own
to diſtinguiſh it from other Churches by. This did not
ſeem to be the Rule of the Apoſtles, who when they were
to preach to all the World, were ſo afraid of Diſtinction
and Diviſions in their Churches, that before they parted, it
is generally ſuppoſed they agreed of a common form of
Words; which they all delivered to their Converts, and
was not to be the diſtinguiſhing Doctrine of any particular
Church, but the common Badg of their Chriſtianity, and
is I ſuppoſe that to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> refers, when he charges
his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound Words, which
thou haſt heard of me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. and he alſo tells us, that
the Deſign of his leaving him at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, <hi>that thou
mighteſt charge ſome that they teach no other Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim.
1. 3. And the firſt Requeſt that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes to his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
is, <hi>That you all ſpeak the ſame things, and there be no
Diviſions among you, but that you be perfectly joyn'd together
in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10.
And this being a thing of ſuch extraordinary Concern, he
does not only make uſe of his own Authority, but as it
was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> to adjure by the Name of God
when they would oblige any Perſon to anſwer truly, as the
High Prieſt did to our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 63. So how the
Apoſtle uſhers in his Requeſt with the ſame Solemnity,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61692:13"/>
               <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt:</hi> thereby to oblige them the more carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what he ſays, from which you may gueſs how far he
was from thinking diſtinguiſhing Doctrines neceſſary, that
he would not tolerate them. And if Unity were ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
among Chriſtians then, is it leſs ſo now? Or what
Neceſſity is there of being ſo uncharitable as to ſuppoſe all
the Churches erroneous in their Creeds but our ſelves?
<hi>That 'tis now convenient for particular Churches to</hi> make new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, <hi>and have their diſtinguiſhing Doctrines, unleſs
they will be obliged to err for Company.</hi> I thought it had been
all along one of the great Charges againſt the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> their making ſuch large <hi>Addenda's</hi> to our Creed, and
making the Belief of ſome Points neceſſary to Salvation,
which neither our Saviour nor his Apoſtles taught: and
that Churches abounding ſo with diſtinguiſhing Doctrines,
and impoſing them upon others for Catholick Truths, has
formerly been look'd upon as one of their great Errors;
but I perceive, Sir, that was a great Miſtake, for this Learned
Author tells me, <q>That although the avoiding Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
does not very well agree with the Practice of the
Primitive Chriſtians; yet it agrees admirably with the
Principles of Popery thus to avoid Diſtinction, which has
its Numbers to boaſt on, when nothing elſe can be ſaid.</q>
But if their Unity and Number is the only thing that the
Author has to object againſt the Papiſts, I could as ſoon be
reconciled to their Uncharitableneſs as his; for Heaven I
perceive is to be the Encloſure of his diſtinguiſhing Doctrines,
or at leaſt no body is to be thought a Member of the true
Church, unleſs they hold that, and this ſtrange Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs
is that which does convince me of the great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of diſtinguiſhing Doctrines; for generally ſpeaking
all ſides are ſo apt to value themſelves upon them, that they
are ready with the Men in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 5. to cry,
<hi>Stand by thy ſelf, come not near me, for I am holier than thou.</hi>
And did we preſs our ſelves only for doing our Duty, and
adhering to our Common Creed, it might be the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable:
But alas, <hi>'Tis not the Faith that was once delivered
to the Saints,</hi> Jude 3. that <hi>we thus earneſtly contend for;</hi> for a
Man may hold all that, and yet be pronounced a Heretick,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61692:13"/>
unleſs he chance to agree with them in all their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are now to be the Standard of our Faith.
But whether the breach of Charity and Unity among
our ſelves, is the readieſt way to <hi>build us up in our moſt
holy Faith,</hi> our ſad Experience will I doubt too ſoon
ſhew. But however, ſure I am it does not agree very
well with Saint <hi>Jude</hi>'s Method, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. who bids us
<hi>keep our ſelves in the Love of God,</hi> and then we may <hi>look
for the Mercy of Chriſt unto Eternal Life.</hi> But becauſe it
is ſo poſſible to deceive our ſelves, Saint <hi>John</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us an infallible <hi>Criterion,</hi> whereby we may know
whether we love God or no, for he tells us, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.
20. <hi>If a Man ſay he loveth God, and hateth his Brother, he
is a Liar: for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath
ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Commandment have we from him, that he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
God, loveth his Brother alſo.</hi> Therefore ſince God
has made our Brother, as it were, his Proxy to receive
the Proofs of our Love to him; and our Saviour has
made it the Badg of our Diſcipleſhip, <hi>By this ſhall all
Men know that you are my Diſciples, if ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
It is very unhappy that thoſe that pretend to be
ſo, ſhould ſet up another Touch-ſtone for the Trial of
their Sincerity, and think to approve their Love to God
by their Zeal againſt their Brethren, if they chance to
diſſent from them in a bare Opinion. Although our
Saviour did not ſay, by their Faith and diſtinguiſhing
Doctrines, but by their Love to one another, Men ſhall
know whether you are my Diſciples or no. Therefore
I think it is not ſtrange if no Church be fond of thoſe
Opinions that will engage them to depoſit their Charity;
and if they are, 'tis certainly their Failing, not their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.</p>
            <p>But now it ſeems I am to beg the Author's Pardon, for
thinking that the diſtinguiſhing Doctrine of ſuch a Church
had been that which was peculiar to it; for it ſeems a
diſtinguiſhing Doctrine is that which they held in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with other Churches, which truly I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
before. And if this Doctrine be ſo, yet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61692:14"/>
of it to one, looks as if they had a mind to have the
Encloſure of it.</p>
            <p>But I skipped one ſhort Paragraph, wherein our Author,
according to his fair way of treating the Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
has jumbled two Texts together, which were cited on
different Accounts, as will be apparent to any body that
conſults the Paper. For when from our having but <hi>one
Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> I was willing to infer the
reaſonableneſs of being (or at leaſt endeavouring to be) all
of one Mind. I did not think that had been ſuch an Error
as ſtood in need of a Confutation. But now he asks, And
muſt not then thoſe, that held one Lord, one Faith, one
Baptiſm, neceſſarily diſtinguiſh themſelves from all that held
more than one? But I think there is diſtinction enough
made to our Hands, for thoſe Hereticks that firſt ſet up
thoſe Errors, and ſeparated from the Church on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I hope were diſtinguiſhable enough from the true
Church; and if others hold two Gods, or firſt Principles,
with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> muſt I therefore have a particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to diſtinguiſh me from that Church that holds but one?
And becauſe ſome are to blame in making Factions, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> muſt I for fear of mixing with
them, diſtinguiſh my ſelf from thoſe that are of <hi>Christ?</hi>
For, God be thanked, there never yet was a time that
Truth was left ſo without witneſs, but that there was a
true Church, to which if we adhered, we need not ſet up
diſtinguiſhing Doctrines for our ſelves, the Inconvenience
of which I am now more than ever ſatisfied of.</p>
            <p>And now he ſhould come to my ſecond Inference, but he
paſſes it over very gently, only denies the Conſequence, for
he ſaith,<note place="margin">Page 45.</note> 
               <q>This doth not imply that all who have taken
the Oath, have thereby renounced the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </q>
And in this I muſt own the Author's Candor, for
I believe, Sir, you know ſome that are of another Mind,
and that have urged this very Profeſſion of Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s to
prove it. Although I never ſaid it was Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as he very unjuſtly accuſes me, and although the Charge
is ſome pages off, yet belonging to this Point, I think I may
under it, take the opportunity of clearing my ſelf. His
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61692:14"/>
Words are theſe,<note place="margin">Page 50.</note> 
               <q>But when this Gentleman muſt needs
know that his Lordſhip at the ſame time received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament at the Hand of a Reverend Divine who has
taken the Oath, to inſinuate that he would hardly allow
thoſe who have taken the new Oath, to be ſo much as out-Liers
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a thing I confeſs I can
ſcarce reconcile to any degree of Charity.</q> But yet I do
not queſtion but that all I there ſaid is full as conſiſtent with
the great Doctrine of Charity, as firſt the making a Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and then charging the malicious Inferences of it on
their Brother. But I muſt confeſs this is a ſort of dealing
that I did not at all expect from ſo ingenious an Adverſary;
for I know there were weak Places enow in my Paper, that he
needed not have been reduced to thoſe pitiful ſhifts: but
the confuting of the Paper would not ſatisfy, unleſs he alſo
laid an Odium on the Perſon, whom I am ſure he does not
know, but has the good Fortune to have a beter Character
from them that do. But the Paſſage to which he refers,
and does ſo falſly render, is this: After the Story of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Papiſt, I ſay, <q>That I am confident the Biſhop would
not have approved of the Argument, had I turned Papiſt
on that dying Man's Declaration. But it ſeems ſome
think it no great matter what we turn now; for I
hear ſome are ſo exceeding fierce, that they will hardly
allow thoſe which have taken the new Oaths, to be ſo
much as Out-Liers of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
               </q>And then I
add immediately after, <q>But although the indiſcreet Zeal
of ſome have made them ſo uncharitable, I am far from
ſuppoſing it the Temper of all the worthy Men of that
Party.</q> Now I'le be judg'd by all the World, what there
is in this Clauſe that refers to Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> or does ſo much
as inſinuate that he was one of thoſe fierce ones: nay, any
one may ſee that I take particular care to free the worthy
Men of it; and if our Author will take Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> out of
that Liſt, and number him with the indiſcreetly zealous,
(who are the only People I charge) I cannot help that;
but be it known to the World, that is his doing, and not
mine. But although he accuſes me for want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I think I ſhall ſhew that I have a great deal, ſince I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61692:15"/>
can forgive this. For as I thank God I am (whatever
my Quality is) above ſuch mean Tricks, ſo I am above
revenging of them too, for ſuch Crimes are commonly
their own Lictors. For I am confident he will ſuffer more
by it than I ſhall, therefore 'tis generally my Pity and not
my Anger that it excites on ſuch occaſions. But now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
if this be a Digreſſion, I am glad to find our Author
think that there are ſo many accounts on which the Oaths
may lawfully be taken, but it is not my Task to examine
any Man on which of thoſe different Hypotheſes they took
it; for having ſatisfied the Law, and I am ſo charitable as
to believe their own Conſciences alſo, I have nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt it. For I am ſo far from diſapproving a tender
Conſcience, that I would have all the liberty in the World
allowed to thoſe who are truly ſo; ſo that his Queſtion was
a little ſuperfluous as to me, <hi>And muſt thoſe of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>only not be allowed to have tender Conſciences?</hi> But I
am really ſorry to find that any of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould think they are abridged of the liberty of theirs, if
they may not declaim againſt all thoſe that diſſent from
them; for as I think the Author is very free, ſo I think 'tis
very fit every body ſhould enjoy their own Sentiments, and
I hope I ſhall not be denied the Liberty I grant, but that
is only in private; for I know no neceſſity of impoſing
them on others, nor condemning all that do not approve
of them. And that is the main, and indeed the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
I have to Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s Profeſſion; for I did ſuſpect,
and the Author himſelf is ſo ingenuous as to own, that
the deſign of the Paper was to aſſert that none were true
Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (that is, as he himſelf
explains it, <hi>did not hold her Doctrine whole and entire</hi>) that
did not hold the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience in the ſame
ſenſe Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> did. And now I cannot but ſay this looks
aſſuming enough, but however our Author aſſures us, that
<q>the making this Profeſſion, was the moſt proper, and
the moſt ſeaſonable and charitable thing a dying Biſhop
could do, to declare that nothing but Conſcience was
the Cauſe of his Refuſal.</q> And although I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it might be ſo in the good Man's Intentions, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61692:15"/>
not ſay it was ſo, or was likely to be ſo in the Effects,
although we are told it <hi>was an Action that did naturally tend
to our Peace.</hi> For a Surgeon may wiſh very well to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and yet miſtake in his Applications; for if he uſe
Corroſives, where Oil and Balſam were needful, he will be
more like to feſter than heal the Sore. And truly I muſt
needs ſay, that a dying Man's entring a Proteſtation againſt
a whole Party, looks as it were deſigned to perpetuate, not
compoſe a Diſpute: However I am ſure it is much properer
for the former than the latter. For the ſhortning of this,
(which much exceeds the Bulk I deſigned) I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to skip whole Pages, to lay thoſe things together that
belonged to one Head, but having all along cited the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
own Words, I hope I have done neither him nor the
Reader much injury. But now we will go a little back,
and pick up what may be of uſe in the way. And in the
firſt place, I am very well pleaſed to find him ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for any thing that reflects on their preſent Majeſties,
but I am half afraid leſt ſome that ſhould have more Wit,
teach us of the Laity the ill-breeding he talks on; for I
could tell him of one, that in the Convocation ſaid, the
King had ſent them a <hi>bantring Meſſage,</hi> and they had ſent
him a <hi>bantring Addreſs:</hi> But I ſuppoſe the Gentleman does
not value himſelf ſo much on his Jeſt, but that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
enough to have his Name conceal'd. But however, it
would be well if the Clergy would ſet us better Example,
although I cannot juſtify any body for following their
ill.</p>
            <p>I do not at all queſtion what he ſays of the Diſſenting
Biſhops, for did they but once own themſelves to be their
Majeſties Subjects, I do verily believe they would be as
good, if not better Subjects than any they have; and I am
confident one might take their Words in the point, and
not exact an Oath from them, if that be all they ſcruple
at, with which they might long ago, I believe, have been
diſpenſed, had they offered any other Security. For I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Majeſties have as great Reſpect and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too for the Biſhops, as the Biſhops can have for them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61692:16"/>
and particularly to him that he mentions, to whom the
whole Nation muſt ever own a great Obligation, for his
Care and Diligence in ſo well principling the two Royal
Siſters; and 'tis a great deal of pity he ſhould deny them
the Satisfaction they would take in repaying his great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>There now follow ſome Pages, with which I think I
have little to do, he that is concerned in them being ſo
able to anſwer for himſelf; but yet rather than have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay to the <hi>Perſon of Quality,</hi> he will quarrel with
him on his Friend <hi>Julian</hi>'s account. But had the Author
obſerved the Rule he impoſes, and not made uſe of any
Arguments that had been urged before, I believe the
Perſon of Quality's part would have been much ſhorter
in his laſt Pamphlet than it is. But however of all
things I thought the Laws and Statutes of a Nation had
been in common, and not like a <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> only to
be appropriated to the uſe of the firſt <hi>Diſcoverer,</hi> that is
in this caſe the firſt <hi>Citer.</hi> But that he may not fear that
I ſhould hereafter make any Encroachments on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of ſo good a Friend, I ſhall (and I am ſure
with Truth) declare that I am not only a Stranger to his
Perſon, but alſo ſo much to his Writings, that I never heard
of the conceit of <hi>grinning Honour</hi> before, but from Sir
<hi>John Falſtaff</hi> in the Play; but however I do believe 'tis
a very good Jeſt, becauſe ſo ingenuous an Author repeats
it ſo often. But for any thing more, I ſhall ſay as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the blind Man did, <hi>Ask him, he is of Age, let
him ſpeak for himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is well if I can do ſo for my ſelf, for my har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Task is yet to come, for alas, I am to anſwer for
a <hi>whole Community;</hi> for at laſt our ſagacious Author has
diſcovered that the <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> is ſo: though to
tell you truly, I never knew before that I had Pigs in
my Belly, much leſs that I was with Child of a whole
Corporation. But although 'tis againſt the Canon, I
doubt I muſt anſwer for them all my ſelf, for I fear the
Author will not be ſo kind as to be Godfather to any
of my Productions, ſo I muſt provide for them as well
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61692:16"/>
as I can. But ſince Charity begins at home, I muſt firſt
conſider my ſelf in my private Capacity, and in that am
reſolved (as he ſees) to be as paſſive as he himſelf can
deſire: And altho 'tis poſſible I may have more than one
Title to be diſtinguiſhed by, yet truly I will not vie
with the Author in that point, to which purpoſe I will
tell him a Story: An unlucky Fellow met with Doctor
<hi>Harding</hi> on the Road, and knowing that he had divers
Preferments, he rides before to the Inn, and told the
Hoſt there was a great deal of Company to come to
his Houſe that Night, and therefore bid him get all the
good things he could provide for Supper; for, ſays he,
there is the Parſon of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> the Dean of ſuch a
Place, the Prebendary of another, and ſo reckoned up
all his Places. And at this rate 'tis poſſible the Author
may much better deſerve to be thought a Community
than poor Me; but however I ſhall anſwer his jocund
Diſcourſe a little more ſeriouſly. And I am ſure I need
not tell him that a new Relation does alſo lay a new
Obligation and Duty, and that ſometimes ſo contrary to
the former, that what was a Vertue and commendable
in one State, may be really a Fault in another. As for
Inſtance, for a ſingle Man to give all his Goods and
Poſſeſſions to charitable Uſes, is counted a great and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
piece of Charity; but ſhould the ſame Perſon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and have a great many Children, ſhould he by his
Charity diſenable himſelf from providing for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he will take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Word, <hi>That Man has deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> for thoſe are
the Words of the Cenſure that he paſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. on
him <hi>that provides not for his own, eſpecially thoſe of his own
Houſe.</hi> So that we may ſee what a vaſt difference an
additional Relation makes in the ſelf-ſame Action. And
me-thinks I ſhould not need to apply this to the Point
in hand; but becauſe he is ſo apt to miſtake the Perſon
of Quality's meaning, I ſhall tell him that when there
is nothing but my own Right in queſtion, I will quietly
ſacrifice that to my King's Pleaſure, and for my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
Peace. But if I am in a Publick Office, and made
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61692:17"/>
it were a Truſtee for my Country, to look after and
maintain its Rights and Priviledges, neither Fear nor
Favour ſhould ever prevail with me to part with one
Tittle of it. Therefore I think the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi>
have propoſed very well to lay a Brand on them who
did voluntarily deliver up their Charters, and thereby
betray thoſe Liberties they were ſworn to maintain: for,
for my part I cannot underſtand why I am not as much
obliged by the Oath that I take for the Defence of my
Country, and the maintaining of the Rights and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
of ſuch a Town, as I am by the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to the King; for if the King break his Oath, and
infringe thoſe Liberties he has ſworn to protect, yet I do
not ſee how he can abſolve or diſpence with mine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we make him Pope as well as King. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if that Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive,</hi> or if you pleaſe we
will call it <hi>Implicit</hi> Obedience to the King is binding, I
cannot ſee how 'tis poſſible for the Subjects to avoid
Perjury under ſuch a Reign as our late King <hi>James;</hi>
for was it not as downright Perjury for a Mayor of a
Town to deliver up the Charter he was ſo ſolemnly
ſworn to maintain, as it would have been to have reſiſted the
King in the Defence of it? But this of being perjured,
take which ſide you will, is ſuch an unhappy Neceſſity,
as I believe God never laid on any one; therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that in ſuch Exigencies there is yet a way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
ones ſelf without committing the Sin. And truly
to do the Author right, I have not met with a better
Reſolution of the Law, than what he himſelf thinks fit
to urge in the behalf of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> when they flung
off their Subjection to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and if he will
pleaſe to apply that to his own Scruples, I think he need
not go any further for a Solution, therefore ſuppoſe it
ſuperfluous for me to ſay any more on that Point, for if
he will not be his own Convert, I cannot hope he ſhould
ever be mine.</p>
            <p>And now, at laſt, <hi>SIR,</hi> we are come to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and, as he calls it, <hi>ſtabbing Queſtion of</hi> London-Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61692:17"/>
But really, Sir, the Perſon of Quality had no ſuch
murderous Intention, but ſince the Weapon was ſo in its
own Nature, it was very happy it fell into ſuch unskilful
Hands, for elſe no body knows what Execution it might
have done. But how ill ſoever I managed my Dagger, I
perceive he is a little afraid of it, and will not come near
the Queſtion; but that he may be ſure to be out of my
reach, he is ſending me as far as <hi>Troy.</hi> But methinks I need
not go ſo far for the Anſwer of one poor Queſtion. But
here our Author is forced to his old ſhifts of ſhuffling and
packing the Cards; for he has really the beſt Faculty of
ſingling out one Line out of a Sentence; and leſt it ſhould
not appear ridiculous enough by it ſelf, joins it to another I
know not how far off, to which it had no Coherence, as
he has done in ſeveral others as well as this place: for my
Query is in theſe very words; <q>Whether they did not both
wiſh and pray, that <hi>London-Derry</hi> ſhould be delivered out
of the Hands of thoſe mercileſs Butchers? And this the
Excellency of their Temper, as well as their Chriſtianity,
obliging to, I cannot at all queſtion but they did; nay, I
verily believe they would have gone farther, and aſſiſted
them with their Purſes, if they had known how to have
conveyed them Relief.</q> And how faithfully he renders it,
and how fully he anſwers it, you ſhall gueſs from his own
Words, which I'le aſſure you are tranſcribed a little exacter
than he does mine: <q>It is, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Duty of Chriſtians
to pray for Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and Peace to all
Mankind: How ſtrange a Queſtion is it therefore to ask,
Whether the ſuſpended Clergy did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> both wiſh and
pray that <hi>London-Derry</hi> ſhould be delivered out of the
Hands of mercileſs Butchers?</q> (for <hi>thoſe</hi> is to be left out
in that place for ſome Reaſons beſt known to himſelf.) <q>He
believes they did, becauſe there were many thouſand
innocent Perſons whom they never ſaw, and who never
did them any wrong.</q> And now I will appeal to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if here is not a Paſſage as faithfully cited, and as well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
as ever he ſaw. For let the Queſtion be what it will,
it would be pretty much if it be <hi>ſtranger</hi> than the Anſwer:
So that I think the ſuſpended Clergy are not much more
obliged to him, <hi>for bringing them in ſo needleſly, and uſing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61692:18"/>
ſuch weighty Arguments in their behalf,</hi> than the <hi>Derry</hi>-Men, as
he ſays, are to me. There is only this Difference, that by
his own Confeſſion mine may be urged for any Place, but
truly I know not for what Place or Subject his was calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But if what I ſaid of <hi>Derry</hi> may be applied to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
City in their Circumſtances, I ſee not where the Injury
would be to them by it; nor do I very well diſcern how the
Bigneſs or Diſtance of the City ſhould add weight to the
Argument, tho to tell him truly, I am very glad I had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to inſtance nearer home, tho I care not how ſoon I
may in all the Cities in <hi>Ireland,</hi> provided they conclude as
happily. But now was it not very kindly done of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who had ſo little to ſay for his own Tribe, to furniſh the
Inhabitants of <hi>Derry</hi> with an Apology in Law, when they did
not know what to ſay for themſelves? for his Inſtance in the
<hi>Netherlands</hi> is as pat to their purpoſe as if it had been made for
them. Altho I think their having ſo many thouſand innocent
Perſons among them that muſt certainly have periſhed, if
they had not taken up Arms for their Preſervation, was no
ill Argument, nor can I believe diſapproved by the Diſſenting
Clergy, if they would be once ſo ingenuous and kind as to
own their Thoughts in the Point: but I ſuppoſe they might
be committed to the Author under the Seal of Confeſſion,
and ſo are not to be made publick. For elſe methinks he
ſhould not ſo induſtriouſly have avoided the Queſtion, if he
had had any thing to have ſaid to it: for I know he has ſo
great Kindneſs for the <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> that he would ſhew
him all his Errors and weak Places; therefore I look upon
my two Inferences as irrefragable, ſince he dare not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
their Confutation. For either they did pray for the
Deliverance of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and would have contributed
to their Relief; or they would not: If they would, then
they are in the ſame Predicament with them, for 'tis with
Rebellion as in Murder, there are no Acceſſaries, but all are
Principals: A Maxim of our Law, for which ſome poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the <hi>Weſt</hi> paid pretty dear after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Defeat, as
I think the Lady <hi>Liſle</hi>'s Execution will ſufficiently convince
any body, who did no more than I believe all our diſſenting
Biſhops would have done for them in <hi>London-Derry,</hi> that is,
have kept them from ſtarving if they could: but if they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61692:18"/>
would not, (I muſt then repeat what I ſaid before) <hi>It would
give me a greater Prejudice againſt the Doctrine than ever yet I
had, ſince it not only made them put off thoſe Bowels of Mercies
which Chriſtians ought to have for one another, but even diveſted
them of Common Humanity.</hi> And whether it would not be a
greater Crime to ſin againſt Nature, than to break ſome
nice Bands of our own (not the Laws) impoſing in an Oath
of Allegiance? I ſhould at another time truſt our Author
to judg.</p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>SIR,</hi> I have in haſte run over that part of the
Pamphlet, wherein I thought I had any Concern, for I do
not pretend to anſwer for, or juſtify other People. But if
I have not acquitted my ſelf ſo well as you expected, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
my diſadvantage of having nothing but my Bible,
and a very bad Memory to conſult, I hope you will wink at
ſmall Faults. I ſhall not enlarge your Trouble by a needleſs
Apology for the length of this, but conclude with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of the Seaſon, this, and many happy New Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heartily wiſh'd You, by</p>
