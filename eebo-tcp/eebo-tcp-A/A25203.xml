         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THough, in the ensuing Letter the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is brought in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
some of those <hi>Errors,</hi> which
are in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Writings, and have
been Countenanced by his Subscription, and
the Defence he has written for him; yet it
ought not to surprize thee. For, it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
he may plead Prescription, and upon
this Foundation lay a claim to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of contradicting whatsoever himself
saith, or doth. His subscription to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
before Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Book, Intituled,
<hi>Gospel Truth Stated,</hi> in these words, <hi>We
<pb facs="tcp:100769:3"/>
Judge, that our Reverend Brother hath</hi> for
the substance, Rightly <hi>Stated the Truth and
Errors mentioned as such;</hi> then thus to it,
<hi>that he hath in all that is</hi> Material, <hi>Rightly
and Fully Stated them;</hi> And again his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in the presence of Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> Mr.
<hi>How,</hi> and others, <hi>that he subscribed</hi> only <hi>to
the</hi> Right stating of <hi>the Truths</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi>
thinking or believing, <hi>or not</hi> doubting, <hi>that
there are</hi> Errors <hi>amongst what he calls</hi> Truth;
<hi>and some Truths Represented by him to be</hi>
Errors <hi>and yet an</hi> Error <hi>as well as a Truth
may be rightly Stated;</hi> These contradictions,
as well as his Approving and Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>First Paper,</hi> then subscribing it, and
yet with the greatest virulence exposing it;
may serve instead of a Demonstration, that
how surprizing soever they may be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they ought not to be so in him: And
that his late seeming <hi>Tergiversations,</hi> Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Turnings are not so much to be
heeded, but that still his Judgment is to be
<pb facs="tcp:100769:3"/>
measured by what he has in his <hi>Anti-Sozzo,</hi>
and must be so, until he <hi>Retracts</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers</hi>
it.</p>
            <p>To which I will add, that I am of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
the <hi>Author</hi> of the Letter doth not
urge Mr. <hi>Alsops Authority,</hi> but his <hi>Reasons,</hi>
which are, it must be owned, a Solid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of those <hi>Errors,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s,
to which they are opposed. For Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops</hi>
Acting the Part of a <hi>Fickle man</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the Faith he once Preached, cannot in
the least weaken those Arguments, whose
strength lyeth in their Conformity unto, and
Agreement with the sacred Text. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the many different shapes he
seems to have assum'd, I'll hope the best of
him, that he has not Abandoned those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
so freely own'd and strenuously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him, in his <hi>Anti-Sozzo,</hi> and that
therefore the Letter is justly Stiled, A <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Matters in Difference between Mr. <hi>Daniel
Williams,</hi> and his Opposers, as we gather out
of his <hi>Books,</hi> compared with what hath been
<hi>Written</hi> against him, is not as has been Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us, meerly about <hi>Words,</hi> and Different <hi>Modes</hi> of
Expression; but about <hi>Things</hi> of the Nearest Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our <hi>Salvation:</hi> And the <hi>Menage</hi> of the <hi>Contest,</hi>
on our part, so odd, that unless our Brethren in the City,
do <hi>Directly,</hi> and with <hi>Great Plainness, Testify</hi> against the
Errors found in his <hi>Writings,</hi> the Scandal, under which we
shall all fall, will, with its Consequences, be much greater
than the Wisest of us can Foresee; Though, God knows,
it is already such, as makes us sink in the Esteem of Men
of Good Learning and Sobriety. For, Sir, the Errors he
hath vented if they are not the <hi>same</hi> with, they are so
<hi>like</hi> to the Impious Opinions of <hi>Socinus,</hi> in several Points,
that the more Exact our Examination is, the more apt we
are to take 'em for <hi>Socinian;</hi> or, at least, for what is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed
to Prepare the Way for their more Kind Reception
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100769:5"/>
and Entertainment. And to speak Impartially, He hath,
with an Industry Unparallel, and with all the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
together with an Heretical Freedom of <hi>Saying</hi> and
<hi>Vnsaying;</hi> of Subscribing and Renouncing, as it is for his
Purpose, one while appearing in the Light, and again ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his turns in the Darker Shades; Gained; he has,
Isay, gain'd such an Interest amongst our Brethren in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
gate-street,</hi> as to Conciliate some to his Notions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to his Person, and all of 'em to Act, as if they
were entirely of his Mind: And is it not wonderful to
observe, how almost all of you are wheedled into a Silence,
and Consequently into a Tacit Approval of what you
Abhor, by a Man, that Exceeds not his Brethren, either
in Learning, or Vertue, or any thing else that can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Blush, be so much as mentioned; and who is no
more, nor no longer ours, than his Interest, which made
him to be so, doth Influence; For He is as much, and no
more a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> than the Present Controversy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Church Discipline,</hi> which Representation, he has made
of it, is as Remote from Truth, as his Heart was from <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with the Congregational Brethren, when he declared,
That <hi>whilst he Liv'd, he would have nothing to do with
them.</hi> For, although he has got an Advantage from the
<hi>Independents</hi> absenting themselves from the <hi>Monday-Veet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in <hi>Bishopsgate-street,</hi> which he has Improved to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading
Divers of our Number to believe, that they have
wickedly Designed, and are Craftily Endeavouring the
Subversion of our Church-Government, yet it is as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
as the Light at Noon, That He is most Incessant in his
Labours to Possess us with an Opinion, That He is a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi>
for no other Ends than to take you off from a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Examination of his Writings, and from your giving
a Just and Necessary Testimony against his Errors; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath been so successful as to Prevail with most of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100769:5"/>
you to Joyn with him in the Cry, that the Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, are only about some Late Invented Terms and
Phrases, or Peculiar Modes of Expression, or Methods of
Explaining the Truths, in which you are, as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Agreed; Or, at most, about Tything the <hi>Mint,
Anise</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> of Religion, so Remote are they from
affecting the weightier matters of Faith, whence it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Demanded, To what purpose is there so much
Noise and Pother made? What hath Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> done?
Of what Nature are the Errors, with which he is Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Why are they not Assigned? They have been As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
first by six <hi>Independent</hi> Ministers in a Paper sent to

                     <q>Let none say, if Christ bore the <hi>Punishment</hi> due to sin,
he must suffer <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> seeing no less was due to
our Transgressions: For, (1.) The Eternity of <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is only due to Sin by <hi>Accident,</hi> as it is found in a
<hi>Finite Person,</hi> who being not able to bear at <hi>Once,</hi> or in the
<hi>Longest</hi> time, that <hi>Wrath,</hi> which his Sins have Demeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Divine Justice Exacts of him an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
(2.) Whereas sin is only <hi>Infinite,</hi> or of Infinite
Demerit, <hi>Objective,</hi> as committed against an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi>
God: The Sufferings of Christ are also <hi>Infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,</hi>
being the Sufferings of that <hi>Person,</hi> who is God,
tho not <hi>as</hi> God; and therefore Christ in a <hi>Finite Time,</hi> was
Able to give <hi>Infinite</hi> Satisfaction.</q>

               <head>Sect. II. The Next Point is about a Change of the Penal
Sanction of the Law.</head>
               <p>An Error of such a Nature, as hath
a Fatal Influence on our Ministry, and the Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
of Men. For, if the <hi>Penal Sanction</hi> of the Law
be changed for another, an Evangelical, and less Severe
Threatning, then it must unavoidably Follow, that the <hi>New</hi>
Threatning cannot be against any but such as are Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of <hi>that Law,</hi> to which it is Annexed, and the Eternal
Curse only against them, who do not so far Obey it, as to
get a Right and Title unto Glory; so that <hi>Original Sin,</hi>
which was committed Antecedently to the giving of <hi>this
Law,</hi> falls not under its Lash, and the <hi>Old Sanction</hi> being
Vacated, we who are only under the <hi>New,</hi> not a Man of us is
lyable unto wrath upon it's Account; Nor doth any other
Sin but <hi>Final Impenitence, Regnant Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Vnbelief</hi>
expose the Soul to Gods Curse. The <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi>
the <hi>Murder</hi> of a <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> the <hi>Lying,</hi>
the <hi>Perjury,</hi> the <hi>Envy,</hi> the <hi>Malice,</hi> and what sin soever else is,
in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Opinion, consistent with the Truth of
Grace, tho in the Lowest Degree, falls not under the
<hi>Curse</hi> of the Gospel. If these Abominations are Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some of his <hi>Saints,</hi> they cannot make 'em liable to
Gods Wrath, nor to any Curse at all, if what he saith be
true. For the Preaching of the <hi>Old Law,</hi> for Conviction
of sin, is a Crime; As if the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said,
<hi>Cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things, which
are Written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.
And when he Cryed out, <hi>Rom. 7. 9. I was alive without
the Law once,</hi> but when the Commandment came <hi>Sin Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
and I Dy'd;</hi> had been at that time, under the <hi>Old
Jewish Dispensation;</hi> For we have, with Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> no
other Law to Preach for <hi>Conviction of sin,</hi> but the <hi>New
Gospel Law.</hi>

                  <p>I. <hi>Crellius,</hi> That under the Gospel there are <hi>Abatements</hi> of
Gods Anger against sin, that most direful Sanction, <hi>Cursed is
every one that continueth not to do all things,</hi> as in <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Deut.</hi>

<hi>Cat.</hi> 23. But secondly, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> expresseth himself
as cleverly in his <hi>Pref. to Gospel Truth Stated.</hi> 
                     <q>The
Gospel hath <hi>another Sanction</hi> to the Preceptive Part of the
<hi>Law,</hi> than the Covenant of works had. Tho nothing be
<hi>Abated</hi> in the Rule of Sin, and Duty, yet <hi>Blessings</hi> are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>Lower Degrees</hi> of Duty.</q> He also tells us, that the
<hi>Threatning</hi> is not against <hi>Every Degree</hi> of Sin; so in the <bibl>
                        <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Gospel Truth,</hi> p. 30.</bibl> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Gospel Law doth not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Death</hi> for the <hi>same sins,</hi> as <hi>Adams Law did;</hi> That
<hi>Law</hi> threatned <hi>Death</hi> for the <hi>least sin,</hi> yea, for one sin. But
the Gospel <hi>Threatens</hi> Death <hi>not for every sin—</hi>Most of the
threatnings in the Bible, that refer to the State of Souls are
<hi>Evangelical</hi> threatnings. They are not by the <hi>Sanction</hi> of
the <hi>Law of Innocence,</hi> but of <hi>Gospel Grace—</hi>Every
<hi>Threatning</hi> used by God as an Argument to Conversion, is
a Gospel Threatning. <hi>Gospel Truth,</hi> p. 133, 134. There is a
<hi>Legal Preaching,</hi> which is opposed to the Gospel; and this
indeed is a <hi>Crime;</hi>
                     </q> And to <hi>that</hi> this Chapter Refers—Then
he sets it down as a <hi>Truth,</hi> 
                     <q>That the <hi>Legal Preaching,</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100769:7"/>
which is a <hi>Crime,</hi> is to Preach the Law as a <hi>Covenant of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi>
or Works</q>—The Real Difference between <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Cr.</hi> and himself, is, <q>Whether it be <hi>Legal</hi> (in the Culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sense) to <hi>threaten</hi> such <hi>Penalties,</hi> as are <hi>short</hi> of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
against such Offences as are <hi>Consistent with Sincerity,</hi>
and yet avoidable by <hi>Serious Care and Diligence.</hi>
                     </q> This he
denies. It is not Legal Preaching <hi>(saith he)</hi> in a Culpable
Sense, to <hi>threaten such Penalties,</hi> as are <hi>short</hi> of <hi>Damnation,</hi>
against such Offences as are Consistent with Sincerity. But
to Threaten these <hi>Sins</hi> with Damnation, that is <hi>Legal Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi>
which must not be endured; And why must not the
<hi>Sins</hi> which a Believer, consistently with Sincerity, commits,
be threatned with <hi>Damnation?</hi> The Reason is Manifest.
The <hi>Sanction</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Innocence,</hi> which did threaten
the least Sin, Every Sin with Damnation, is vacated, and
made void: And the Gospel <hi>threatens Damnation</hi> against none
but them who Die in <hi>Final Vnbelief,</hi> and <hi>Impenitence.</hi> But
what Sins are, or rather, what Sins (doth he think) are not
consistent with Sincerity? I presume he can't be of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Lying,</hi> or <hi>False Accusing, Reviling,</hi> or <hi>Reproaching</hi>
his Innocent Brethren, or acting the Part of a <hi>Delator,</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Evidence,</hi> are inconsistent with Sincerity; and therefore
it must be a Sin to threaten Damnation against these Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Abominations, if <hi>committed</hi> by himself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> This is such a Peice of <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> a Doctrine so
<hi>Licentious</hi> and vile, yea, such a Consecration of the most
Villanous Practices, that it Amazes the most Solid and
Grave Divines amongst us, to understand, that not a man of you
hath the Courage to Witness against this Mans Abominations.
What! when the Foundations are struck at? To look on, be
silent and revile them, who are hardy enough to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Man! What can the Orthodox Divines of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>beyond the Seas,</hi> or what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100769:8"/>
will <hi>Posterity</hi> think of these things? What is it that shuts
up the Mouths of our <hi>Grandee's,</hi> of a <hi>Bates,</hi> a <hi>Howe,</hi> a <hi>Veal,</hi>
a <hi>Glascock?</hi> And what is it that hath Infatuated an <hi>Alsop,</hi>
together with the whole Assembly in <hi>Bishopsgate-street,</hi> that
they must become Advocates for a Man who Publisheth
such <hi>Licentious</hi> and <hi>Libertine Principles</hi> as these? No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Ministry is no more successful, when we make the
Preaching of the <hi>Law</hi> void; I mean, the <hi>Old Law,</hi> under
whose Curse all that Remain in unbelief, still are; and
which makes the <hi>Sins</hi> of the best on Earth to be Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Damnation. Upon which Account we may, yea,
we must threaten the sins of Believers themselves with
Damnation, assuring them, that unless, when they sin they
Flee to Christ, their sin will be their Ruine. For there is
no change of its Threatnings, no Mitigation, or Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The least sin is as much of a Damning Nature as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which makes it necessary for him, who commits the
sin, Exercise Repentance towards God and Faith in our
Lord Jesus for Pardon. The <hi>[Do this and Live; Sin and
Dye]</hi> is so much in Force, that without a full satisfaction to
the Threatning Part of the Law, and a Righteousness fully
Answering the <hi>[Do this]</hi> there can be no Life attain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by any of us, and it is our Duty to Preach the Law of
Innocency, and Denounce its Curse against all that abide
in Unbelief, and against the <hi>Sins</hi> of Believers themselves.
This is the Doctrine of <hi>Protestants,</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and
<hi>Blessed Apostles.</hi> But I will go on to show the difference
there is between Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Father <hi>Alsop Distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

<hi>cannot but Punish</hi> Sin: And because this Sin is <hi>Inherent

himself</hi> is Promised in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as the Great Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Blessing of the Covenant. <hi>Esa</hi> 49. 8. 9. He tells
us, That God for Christs sake has entred into a Covenant,
made a Covenant, his Righteousness and Obedience have
<hi>procured</hi> a Covenant, are the <hi>Meritorious</hi> cause of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
when the total Summ of all is no more than this,
that <hi>God has Promised</hi> to Pardon, <hi>and save us if we believe

               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> tho he hath suck'd in <hi>Arminian</hi> Notions, could
never possess himself of <hi>Arminian</hi> Accuracy and Learning, and
tho he was given to Books ever since he was five Years Old,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100769:12"/>
and Regularly Admitted into the Ministry at eighteen,
so Great his Proficiency in Divinity as not only to Attone
for what would have been in another an Irregularity, but
to make it very Regular, yet it must be acknowledged that,
in his hast to the Theological English <hi>System,</hi> he skip'd over
his <hi>Logick,</hi> as is manifest from the Description he hath given
of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which he doth with a great Deal
of Formality, and Pomp. For Placing himself in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<hi>Chair,</hi> He very Gravely Asks;</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Covenant of Grace?</hi> And in <hi>Answer</hi> he saith,
<q>By <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> I <hi>mean, <hi>the Way that God</hi>
                     </hi> hath
<hi>Ordained</hi> to <hi>Apply</hi> to <hi>Sinners</hi> that <hi>Salvation,</hi> which is
<hi>Prepared</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>which he wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Enable the Elect to
Comply with;</hi>
                  </q> which being to the Question <hi>Qaid Sit.</hi> one
might reasonably Expect to find in it somewhat of the
Nature of a Covenant in General, and what doth in special
constitute it a Covenant of Grace. But not a word of these
things; not a word of the <hi>Genus</hi> of the thing defined;
nor of it's <hi>Specifick</hi> Difference, or of what is Proper and
Peculiar to the Covenant of Grace, Distinguishing it from
other Covenants. <q>It is (saith he) <hi>a way <hi>Ordained of God
to Apply Salvation unto Sinners.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </q> But doth the Word <hi>[Way]</hi>
denote to us any thing of the <hi>Nature of a Covenant,</hi> or
what word in the whole Answer Import what is Peculiar
to a Covenant of any kind or sort? Here is a Covenant,
which, so far as we can Judge of it, is without any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Covenanting, yea, without any Pact, or Agreement,
or <hi>Terms</hi> and Conditions; and may as aptly Contain
in it the Nature of what is Distinct from a Covenant of Grace,
as well as the Nature of such a Covenant. And if I Guess
Right, the Account he gives of the Covenant of Grace in
Particular is much the same with what the Gentlemen at
<hi>Racow,</hi> give of Religion in General, which is in these
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100769:13"/>
words, <hi>Religio Christiana</hi> est <hi>Uia</hi> a <hi>Deo per Jesum Christum
<hi>Monstrata,</hi> vitamaeternam</hi> Consequendi, and who can with
any tolerable <hi>Appearance</hi> of Reason say that the Christian
Religion is not the <hi>Way,</hi> that God hath ordained to Apply
to Sinners that Salvation, which is Prepared by Christ;
and which he will Enable the Elect to Comply with? The
same may be said of <hi>Preaching the Word,</hi> of <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi>
of the <hi>Blessed Sacraments,</hi> and the like things of another
kind. For, these are <hi>ways,</hi> Ordained of God to Apply sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
unto Sinners, and according to this Definition
(seeing <hi>cui convenit Definitio, ei Convenit et Definitum)</hi> they
must all of them be Covenants of Grace. Now, if <hi>Faith</hi>
be the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> what is it's Condition? If the
<hi>Sacraments</hi> be the Covenant of Grace, what are it's Seales?
This is one <hi>Specimen</hi> amongst many of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
skill in <hi>Logick;</hi> I say amongst many other which in
Faithfull Rebuke's, High Applauses of the man, and Rude
Demands, may Provoke some one or other to expose; and
and the rather, if Possible, to Provoke the more Learned and
Grave Fathers of our way, to Consider what manner of
man it is, to whose Conduct they have tamely submitted
themselves.</p>
               <p>But to make the most of what he saith of the Gospel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in this <hi>chapter,</hi> it amounts to no more than that the
<hi>Remission of Sins is Promised to Faith and Repentance;</hi> or
that the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>the Covenant are Promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

submit to the Terms of it. <hi>Gospel Truth.</hi> p. 68, 69. That
<hi>the</hi> use <hi>and</hi> Interest of <hi>Gospel Conditions</hi> is, but in a <hi>Degree</hi>
from the conformity of them to the Praeceptive Part of the
Law, but chiefly from their <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Rule of the
Grace</hi> of the Promise, p. 58.</p>
               <p>How to Explain this Distinction between the <hi>Rule yf the
Precept;</hi> and the <hi>Rule of the Grace of the Promise,</hi> I cannot
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100769:13"/>
see how it can be done better than it is by <hi>Wolzogenius,</hi>
one of the <hi>Fratres Poloni,</hi> who hath very exactly Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Socinian</hi> (which I take to be Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his)
Sense, to this Effect. <q>In every well constituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there are <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Rules of Two sorts.</hi> The <hi>First</hi>
are such as show the Subjects <hi>Duty, <hi>what he must do,</hi>
                     </hi>
and what he must not do.—Then there are <hi>Rules,</hi>
by which Rewards are Proposed for the Encouragement
of Obedience.—Haec duo <hi>Legum <hi>genere reperiuntur etiam
in Regni Christi</hi>
                     </hi>—For Christ (saith he) is our <hi>King,</hi>
but <hi>so</hi> that he is at the same time <hi>our Father</hi> and <hi>Faithful
Pastor.</hi> His <hi>Promises</hi> are Limited by certain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and yet these <hi>Conditions</hi> are not <hi>over-rigidly</hi> insisted
on in those Cases, where somewhat of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or other
<hi>Infirmities</hi> intervenes. The <hi>Promise</hi> of Eternal Life <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi>
an Observation of his <hi>Commands;</hi> but he knowing
our Frailties will not Impute to us our Daily Sins, if so
be there Remain in us a <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>Upright</hi> Heart,

and of that <hi>New Heart,</hi> whereby we are Enabled
to obey the Gospel. And first we have a <hi>Promise</hi>
of the <hi>Right</hi> Faith, made to us in the <hi>True Covenant,
John 6. 37. Eph.</hi> 2. 8.—We have a Direct and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

3. Upon the matter it's <hi>no Covenant of Grace at all.</hi>
For, (1.) A <hi>Promise of Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> upon <hi>Condition</hi>
of <hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Obeying,</hi> is neither <hi>better,</hi> nor <hi>worse</hi> than
a <hi>Threatning</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> and Death, to them who
<hi>Believe not,</hi> and <hi>Obey not.</hi> It may with equal right be
called a <hi>Threatning</hi> of Death; as a <hi>Promise of Life:</hi> It's
no more a Covenant of Grace, than a Covenant of <hi>Wrath.
