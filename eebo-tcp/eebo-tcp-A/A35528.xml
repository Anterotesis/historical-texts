            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>WHen the Idolatrous violence of heathen Rome, under the Emperor Decius, attemted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the Chriſtian Faith, and brought on the ſeventh bloody perſecution: Novatian a Presbyter of the Roman Church ſeparated himſelf from the communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and became leader of a dangerous ſchiſm, upon ſuggeſtion that others were polluted by the converſation of ungodly men, and favourd thoſe who were Idolatrous: reproching them with the titles of <hi>Apoſtats, Idolators</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> as Pacian informs us. Which moſt unſeaſonable rupture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weakned the hands of the Orthodox Chriſtians, and, as S. Cyprian expreſſes it, became <hi>another perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution unto them.</hi> In this unhappy ſtate of affairs, when Idolatry deſtroied from abroad with all poſſible vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Schiſm divided with like heat and earneſtneſs within; the good biſhop of Carthage S. Cyprian, thought it lay upon him, (for the privilege of the pope of Rome had not then placed his Church above admonition; nor his infallibility ſet it beyond inſtruction) to endeavor the reducing the diſſenters in that Church: whoſe godly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors had very great effect, bringing back into communion, ſeveral of the moſt eminent partizans in Schiſm; and thereby many others alſo, who by large pretences to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the name of ſome pious men drawn aſide into the party, gave reputation to it.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay how parallel a caſe we have in the Church of England. When we are now aſſaulted by the plots and machinations of Idolatrous Rome, we are moleſted by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
<pb facs="tcp:46659:3"/>
diſſentions from within, upon the ſame pretences that we are polluted with the converſation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, and favor thoſe who are Idolators; are lukewarm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, Popiſhly affected, and proteſtants in Maſquerade. It would be moſt happy if the parallel could be advanc'd yet farther; and that as the advices of the holy Biſhop and Martyr S. Cyprian were efficacious heretofore, they may again be ſo on the like occaſion. <hi>He being dead,</hi> above fourteen hundred years ſince, <hi>yet ſpeaketh;</hi> and his diſcourſes cannot be imagin'd to be levened by intereſt or paſſion; and therefore they are faithfully tranſlated into our Engliſh tongue; and preſented to the view and conſideration of Diſſenters among us.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Church ſtands under the ſame terms of duty to God and man, as heretofore it did; we have as ſtrict obligation to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among our ſelves, &amp; Obedience to thoſe <hi>who are over us in the Lord,</hi> as had our firſt forerunners in the faith. We are as forcibly bound to join in the ſame public Worſhip as they were; and Excommunication, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which the Schiſmatic voluntarily executes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf) will be as penal, and as certain a <hi>prejudice of the judgment of the great day,</hi> as it was eſteem'd in the primitive Church, and 'tis declar'd to be by Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. And not only the guilt, but alſo the danger of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, is now as great as it was ever heretofore; according to the ſaying of S. Paul, <hi>If we bite and devour one another, we ſhall be deſtroied one of another.</hi> God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty grant that we <hi>may ſee, at leaſt in this our day, the things belonging to our peace, before they be hid from our Eies.</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> may not ſeem deſtitute of wiſdom in ſecuring our ſalvation: for we are not only to fear that perſecution, which by open force attemts the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the ſervants of God. Tis eaſie to be cautious where the hazard is manifeſt. The mind is prepared before for the combat, where
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46659:4"/>
the enemie profeſſes himſelf. Then is he moſt formidable and moſt to be took care of, when he ſecretly approches, and under a fraudulent pretence of peace, by an undiſcernible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſteals upon us inſenſibly; from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of which methods the Devil has the name of Serpent: for ſuch hath bin always his craft, and ſo dark and conceled from all view is the fraud by which he circumvents the ſons of men. Thus in the infancy of the world he enterprizd upon, and by mixing flattery with lies, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved our unexperienced Forefathers thro their unwary credulity. Thus when he attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Lord, he ſecretly approched, as if by ſtealth he meant to deceive him: but he was immediatly underſtood, and as ſoon repulſed and vanquiſhd, becauſe he was diſcoverd and known. Whence we may learn to decline the path of the firſt Adam, and purſue the ſteps of Chriſt the victorious, that we may not again unawars be entangled in the ſnare of Death; but being provident againſt danger, we may at laſt enjoy the purchaſed immortality. But how can we attain the fruition of this immortality, unleſs we keep thoſe commands of Chriſt by which death is to be vanquiſh'd and ſubdued? according to that counſel and ſaying of his:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46659:4"/>

               <note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.</note>

               <hi>if you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> Such who are thus minded and reſolved, he ſtiles the couragious and ſtable, <hi>founded upon a rock</hi> of vaſt bulk and ſtrength, firmly compacted and conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an unſhaken immovable conſtancy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the ſtorms and tempeſts of the world. <hi>Whoſoever heareth,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24, and 25.</note> 
               <hi>theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man, who built his houſe upon a rock. And the rain deſcended, and the flouds came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe: and it fell not, becauſe it was founded upon a rock.</hi> It is our duty therefore to regulate our goings by his precepts, and to learn and do the things he taught and did: for with what face can any one profeſs he believes in Chriſt, while he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to do what he enjoyns to be don? or expect to reap the reward of faith, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the obſervation of his commands? It cannot be, but ſuch a one muſt ſtagger, and wander to and fro, being hurryed about by the ſpirit of error, like duſt driven by the wind.

He invented Hereſies and Schiſms to undermine the Faith, adulterate the Truth, and divide Unity it ſelf. Thoſe whom he cannot detain in the darkneſs of the old way, he circumvents by leading them in new and erroneous paths. Thus he ſiezes and takes

men out of the Church, and while they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with themſelves that they have made nearer approches to light, and left behind them the Night of the world, he inſenſibly involves them anew in thick darkneſs; that not conforming themſelves to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his righteous laws, and yet calling themſelves Chriſtians, and walking in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ſhould notwithſtanding perſwade themſelves that they were illuminated.

               <hi>one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm?</hi> Which unity we Biſhops, eſpecially, who preſide in the Church, ought firmly to maintain and defend; that we may evidence thereby the unity and individualneſs of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy it ſelf. Let none decieve the brethren with a ly, or corrupt the truth of our faith with perfidious prevarication. There is but one Epiſcopacy, which tho ſhared among as many ſeveral perſons as there are Biſhops in the Chriſtian world, yet each poſſeſſeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity entire. There is alſo but one Church, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her fruitfulneſs and growth is ſuch, that ſhe ſpreads and increaſeth to a multitude of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches. As the beams which iſſue from the Sun are many, and yet the light it creates by them is one and the ſame: or as the boughs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46659:7"/>
growing out of a tree are many, and yet is it but one ſtock, faſtned and fixt to it's place by one tenacious root: So too, when many rivulets flow from a fountain, whereby it ſeems ſo encreaſed as to become many by the plenty of water, which is ſuch as to require ſeveral chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels for it's conveyance; yet 'tis but one water ſtill, becauſe it all riſes at, and runs from one ſpring head. Intercept a ſun-beam from the body of the ſun, the oneſs of light will not admit of diviſion. If you break a bough from a tree, 'twill never ſhoot forth or grow again. Cut off a river from it's fountain, 'twill immediatly dry up. In like manner the Church being enlightned by our Lord, extends it's beams thro the whole world; yet is it the ſame light that every where appears, and is entirely one however ſcatter'd: As a tree, ſhe ſpreads her branches, luxuriant in growth, and plenteous in fruit. And as a river enlarges by her courſe her ſwelling ſtreams, yet is there but one head, one ſource, one ſtock, of all this happy plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Out of the Church there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>We are all the fruit of the Churches womb, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht with the milk of her breaſts, quickned by her ſpirit.

She is acquainted but with one houſe, and by a modeſt ſhamefacedneſs ſecures the reputation of the marriage bed.

Whoſoever departs from the Church, joins himſelf to an harlot, and forfeits the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto her; nor can he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the rewards of Chriſt, who abandons his Church; ſuch a one is an Alien, is profane, is an Enemy. He cannot have God for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who diſowns the Church for his Mother. If any one eſcaped in the Flood, who was out of Noah's ark, he may likewiſe be ſaved, who is out of the pale of the Church. Our Lord informs us of this, ſaying:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.30.</note> 
               <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me: and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth.</hi> He who breaks the peace and agreement of the Church, ſets himſelf againſt Chriſt. He who gathers and makes proſelytes out of the Church. ſcatters and makes havock of it. It's our Lord's ſaying: <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10.30.</note> And again it's writen concerning the Father, Son, and holy Spirit: <hi>Theſe three are one.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> And now can any one believe that this unity, which proceeds from the Divine immutability and is conſolidated by heavenly myſteries, can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46659:8"/>
be rent aſunder in the Church, and divided into parts by the diſcrepancy of the jarring wills of men? He who keeps not this unity, holds not the law of God, nor the belief of the Father and the Son, nor the faith by which he ſhould be ſaved.</p>

He cannot have the garment of Chriſt, who rends and tears his Church.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt's people cannot be torn in ſunder, therefore his coat which was wove throout and of an entire piece, was not parted and ſhared by the ſouldiers, whoſe fee it was. It's being undivided, and the parts of it being cloſely and imperceptibly conjoyned, is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious emblem of that concord and union which ought to be between all who have put on Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>I ſay unto you, that if two ſhall agree upon earth, as touching any thing they ſhall aſk; it ſhall be don for them of my Father, which is in heaven: for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them</hi>; ſhewing thereby that the ſucceſs and force of prayer was not to be imputed to the number of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants, but unanimity of them. <hi>If two of you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall agree upon earth,</hi> he placed unanimity in the front, and began with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of peace, that he might inſtruct us to agree faithfully and firmly together. But how can he agree with any one, who agrees not with the body of the Church, and the brotherhood in general? How can two or three be gathered together in Chriſts name, who apparently are ſeparated from Chriſt and his Goſpel? For we did not go out from them,

but they departed from us. And whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and ſchiſms had their birth and original from mens making of diſtinct conventicles for themſelvs, tis they who are deſertors of the head from whence truth takes it's original. But the Lord ſpeaks there concerning the Church, and ſpeaks to them who are of it and in it; that if they ſhall according to his command and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, unanimouſly joyn in prayer, tho they be but two or three gather'd together, yet they ſhall obtain from the Divine Majeſty a grant of what they aſk.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note>

After this ſort he was with the three Children in the fiery furnace; and becauſe they kept their ſimplicity towards him, and continued in unanimity with one another; he therefore refreſht them, amidſt the flames, as it were with a cooling breath of air, or the falling of dew:<note place="margin">Act. 5.19.</note> He was with the two Apoſtles, ſhut up in priſon; foraſmuch as they were ſimple, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they were unanimous. He opened the priſon gates, and brought them into the

court of the temple, that they might declare that word, they had before faithfully preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the multitude.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note> When therefore he commands and ſaies, that <hi>whereſoever two or three are gatherd together in my name, I am in the midſt of them</hi>; he who founded and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Church, doth not divide men from it: but upbraiding the diſcord of the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and recommending with his own mouth peace to the faithful, he thence declares, he will rather afford his preſence to two or three who are met together with one heart and one mind in prayer, then to very many diſſenters; and that more may be obtain'd by the prayer of a few who agree in what they aſk, then by the ſupplication of many, whoſe very petitions as well as themſelves are at variance againſt each other. Upon which account, when he gave a rule of prayer to his diſciples, he added:<note place="margin">Mark 11.25.</note> 
               <hi>And when ye ſtand praying, forgive, if you have ought againſt any: that your Father alſo which is in heaven, may forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> Nay he calls back the perſon who deſigns him a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, from the very altar,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.23.</note> if he comes thither having a difference with his brother, and bids him firſt to be reconciled to his brother, and then to come again in peace, and offer his gift;

Can they think Chriſt will vouchſafe to be in the midſt of them when they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, whoſe meeting is without the Church? Such if ſlain for the confeſſing of Chriſt, would not waſh away their ſin even with their blood. The heinous and inexpia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime of diſcord is not to be purg'd away, no not with death. He cannot be a Martyr, who is not in the Church: nor can he ever come to the kingdom of Chriſt triumphant, who here deſerts it being militant. Our Lord left us peace for a legacy, commanded unanimity unto us, and gave in charge that we ſhould <hi>keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> He cannot be a martyr, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of brotherly love.

               <hi>ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And tho I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and tho I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46659:13"/>
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth nothing. Charity ſuffers long, and is kind: charity envieth not: charity vaunts not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, thinketh no evil: beareth all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things: charity never faileth.</hi> This ſhall continue in that kingdom we look for, this ſhall remain to all eternity in the brotherhood and never to be divided union of glorified ſaints. Diſcord cannot enter heaven nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve rewards from Chriſt, who has declar'd to his diſciples: <hi>This is my commandment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.12.</note> 
               <hi>that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.</hi> He can have no relation to him who violates his love by perfidious diſſention. Whoever hath not charity, hath not God. It's the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle John's aſſertion: for he ſaith:<note place="margin">1 John 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> They cannot dwell with God who thro diſſention will not abide in his Church. Tho they fry in flames, tho caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire or to wild beaſts, they lay down their lives, therein they recieve not the crown of faith, but the reward of diſobedience; not the glorious exit of religious fortitude, but

men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleſures more then lovers of God, having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof. Of this ſort are they which creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women, laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

But they ſhall proceed no further; for their folly ſhall be made manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was.</hi> What hath been foretold, hath been exactly fulfill'd, and the world now drawing to an end, the times and men are a proof thereof.

Yet notwithſtanding all this, the abounding of iniquity ought not to ſhake and diſturb us, but rather the truth of the prediction ought to confirm and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our faith.

markt in the forehead with the ſtein of Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. The offended Lord ſet the mark of his anger on that conſpicuous part of his body, where they are ſign'd who are reciev'd into his favor. So likewiſe the ſons of Aaron for offering up ſtrange fire to the Lord, which he commanded not,<note place="margin">Lev. 10.1.</note> were forthwith conſumed before the Lord in his diſpleſure; and yet theſe are imitated and followed by all ſuch, who ſlighting what was delivered by God, ſeek after and are in love with doctrines of human invention: for which crime our Lord in his Goſpel ſharply rebukes and reprooves them:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.3, and 6.</note>

In this caſe the Church is ſought to, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe is oppos'd: in this there might be ſome pretence of neceſſity, in that the crime is purely voluntary: here the lapſed perſon prejudiceth himſelf alone; there who ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes others to ſchiſm or hereſy, decieves as many as he draws in: here is the loſs of one ſoul, there the danger of many. This is plain,

the lapſed underſtands he hath offended, and mourns and bewails his condition; but the ſectary is puft up in his ſin, and pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his tranſgreſſion; he parts the mother and her children, whom he draws off from her; he enticeth the ſheep to follow his voice and not the ſhepheards; and, in ſhort, diſorders Gods ſacraments. And whereas the Lapſed perſon ſin'd but once, the perſevering ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic goes on in daily ſinning. To conclude, the lapſed recovering his ſtation, may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd now with the crown of Martyrdom, and may hereafter were a Heavenly one; while the ſchiſmatic ſlain out of the Church, can never recieve thoſe rewards which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly hers.</p>

               <note place="margin">It is not to be wonder'd at, if Confeſſors fall into Schiſm.</note>And here, my beloved Brethren, let it be no wonder to any of you that Confeſſors fall into ſchiſm; and that ſome of that rank may be guilty of crimes ſo heinous as not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. For it is not the confeſſing of Chriſts name which privileges a man from the Devils ſnares, or which defends and perpetually ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards one while in this world: for if it were ſo, we ſhould never meet with deceit, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and adultery in Confeſſors, and yet theſe are crimes which to our grief and ſadneſs we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46659:17"/>
ſee in ſome. Whoſoever that Confeſſor be, he is not greater, nor better, nor dearer to God then Solomon, who yet held that grace he once obtain'd of the Lord, ſo long only as he walkt in his ways: But after he forſook his way, he loſt his favor alſo, as it is writen: <hi>The Lord rais'd up an adverſary againſt him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 11.14. Revel. 3.11.</note> And therefore it is ſaid: <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown.</hi> Which threat had not bin menaced, were it not that upon departing from righteouſneſs, the crown likewiſe was to be tranſlated. Confeſſion is the firſt ſetting out towards glory, but carries not the prize: perfects not praiſe, tho it ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate to honor: as it is writen:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.22.</note> 
               <hi>He who endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the end, he ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Whatſoever is before the end, may be a ſtep to aſcend by to the height of ſalvation, but it is not that laſt round which ſeats us in the utmoſt ſummity thereof. By being a Confeſſor, one becomes afterwards in greater danger, becauſe it gives greater provocation to the enemy. Is any one a Confeſſor, for this very reaſon he ought to keep cloſe to the Goſpel of our Lord, having by the Goſpel obtain'd glory from him. For he has ſaid: <hi>To whom much is given,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>of him much ſhall be required</hi>; and the higher a perſon ſtands
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46659:18"/>
rais'd in dignity, the more ſervice ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him. Let no man perish by the example of a Confeſſor, nor any one learn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, pride, faithleſneſs from a Confeſſors ill morals. Is any one a Confeſſor, let him be humble and quiet, let him in his converſation be orderly and modeſt; and as he is call'd the Confeſſor of Chriſt, let him imitate that Chriſt whom he has confeſt. For when he ſaith: <hi>Every one that exalteth himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 18.14.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> and was himſelf exalted by his father, becauſe being the word, the power, the wiſdom of God the Father, he humbled himſelf here upon earth; how can it be that he ſhould love a proud ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of our ſelves, who both himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd humility in his law, and reciev'd from his father a name above all names as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his humility? A Confeſſor he is of Chriſts; but upon this condition, that he doth not afterward blaſpheme Chriſts Majeſty and Glory. The tongue which hath once confeſs'd Chriſt, ought not to rail, or be turbulent; ſhould not be heard making a noiſe in reproches and wrangling; nor having ſet forth the divine praiſes, ſpit out ſerpentine venom againſt the Brethren and Prieſts of God.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46659:18"/>
But if the Confeſſor ſhall grow criminal and deteſtable afterwards, if he ſhall overthrow his good confeſſion by an ill converſation, if with ſome filthy action he ſhall bring a foul blot upon his life, if laſtly forſaking that Church in which he became a Confeſſor, and cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the band of Unity, he ſhall exchange his firſt faith for infidelity at the laſt, he is not to flatter himſelf as if his confeſſion made him one of the Elect, and to be rewarded with Glory; when hereby he deſerves the ſeverer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our Lord choſe Judas to be an Apoſtle, and yet this Judas betray'd afterwards his Lord.</p>
            <p>But albeit the traitor Judas fell off from the fellowſhip of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The falling away of ſome, do's not leſſen the glory of thoſe Confeſſors, who retain their dignity.</note> yet was not this an empeachment of their fidelity and duty; and ſo here in the preſent affair, it doth not leſſen the dignity of Confeſſors, becauſe the faith of ſome hath faild. The bleſſed Apoſtle ſpeaks to this purpoſe: <hi>For what if ſome have not believ'd.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.3, 4.</note> (or fallen away) <hi>ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi> The better and greater part of Confeſſors ſtands firm in the faith and in the truth of the Lords law and diſcipline. Nor do they depart from the Churches peace, who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46659:19"/>
keep in mind that it was in the Church where thro the mercy of God they obtain'd grace: And in this reſpect their faith is more to be commended, that they withdrew from a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them in ſchiſm, with whom they had bin join'd in an unconquerable confeſſion: who withdrew from the contagion of guilt, being irradiated with the true Goſpel light, shin'd upon by the pure and bright beams of the Lord; as much to be renown'd for keeping Chriſts peace, as they were for their conqueſt in their conflict with the Devil.</p>

               <note place="margin">The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſchiſmatics is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</note>I wish, my beloved Brethren, and withal give my counſel and advice, that if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not one of the Brethren may perish, and our joyful mother the Church may recieve into her boſom the whole body of agreeing people.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46659:19"/>
take the ſtraight way which leads to heaven. It is the Apoſtles adjuration:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>Now we command you, Brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he reciev'd of us.</hi> And again he ſpeaks to this ſenſe:<note place="margin">Eph. 5.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Let no man decieve you with vain words. For becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. Therefore be not partakers with them.</hi> We muſt therefore depart from ſuch offenders as theſe, nay rather we ought to fly from them, for fear leaſt if one join himſelf to ſuch diſorderly walkers, and goes with them in their ways of ſin, wandring from the track where the true road lay, he may at laſt be involv'd in an equal ſhare of guilt with them. There is one God and one Chriſt, his Church one, his faith one, and his people by concord are firmly cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one body. Unity is not to be divided, nor can the ſame body by the diſſolution of its contexture be diſſever'd from its ſelf, or ſubſiſt, having its bowels torn out piece-meal. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver infant is cut off from the womb, cannot live and breath apart, but looſeth its ſafety and life. It is the holy Spirits admonition:<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>What man is he that deſireth life, &amp; loveth many days that he may ſee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46659:20"/>
good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they ſpeak no guile. Depart from evil, and do good; ſeek peace and purſue it.</hi> He who is a ſon of peace, ought to ſeek and follow after it, and he who is acquainted with, and hath any affection for the bond of charity, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain his tongue from evil diſſention. To the reſt of the divine precepts of wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which our Lord being about to ſuffer diſpenſed,<note place="margin">Jo. 14.27.</note> he added this: <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> This legacy of peace he left us, and hath promiſed us all the gifts, all the rewards he hath to beſtow, on condition we preſerve it. If we are coheirs with Chriſt, let us abide with Chriſt in peace: If ſons of God, we ſhould be peacemakers. <hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.9.</note> ſaith he, <hi>for they ſhall be call'd the children of God.</hi> Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be peaceful, of a mild ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, innocent in their diſcourſe, in affection united, inviolably faſtned to each other by the links of unanimity. This accord was in the Apoſtles time. So the new nation of believers kept the commandments of the Lord, and held faſt their mutual charity; for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of which this Scripture may be alleg'd:<note place="margin">Acts 4.32.</note> 
               <hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46659:20"/>
one heart and of one ſoul.</hi> And again: <hi>Theſe all</hi> (i. e.<note place="margin">Act. 1.14.</note> the Apoſtles) <hi>continued with one accord in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication with the women, and Mary the mother of Jeſus, and with his brethren.</hi> And therefore they could pray effectually, and be confidently aſſured of obtaining what they askt of Gods mercy.</p>
            <p>But unanimity is decreas'd to that low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among us,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the Church declining in its primitive zeal and purity.</note> that the bounty of charitable giving is contracted. They ſold houſes and lands then, and being mindful only of laying up treſures in heaven for themſelves, they layd down the ſeveral prices for which their goods were ſold at the Apoſtles feet, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed by them among the poor according as their neceſſities required. But alas, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days we give not the tithe of our eſtate, and when the Lord calls to ſell, we are upon the buying and encreaſing hand. So much hath the vigour of Faith witherd and decay'd; ſo much hath the healthy conſtitution of Believers languish'd. And therefore the Lord with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our times ſaith in the Goſpel:<note place="margin">Luke 18.8.</note> 
               <hi>When the Son of man cometh, ſhall he find faith upon the earth?</hi> We ſee that accomplish'd which he foretold. In the fear of God, in the Law of righteouſneſs, in all our actions, we are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46659:21"/>
No man bears in mind the terrors of the Lord, his wrath and future judgement; the vengeance he will take on unbelievers, and the eternal torments to which they are conſign'd. Which are ſuch as would terrify our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if we did believe them, but therefore we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard becauſe of incredulity: If we did believe them, we should avoid, and avoiding should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape them.
