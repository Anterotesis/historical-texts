         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

written by the
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
ROBERT, LATE
Earle of SALISBVRY,
With his requeſted Instructions to the Earle
of <hi>Bedford</hi> for the Government of
<hi>Barwick,</hi>
Worthy of memory.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Officers and Councellors of
Princes have a preſcribed Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
by Patent, by Cuſtome or
by oath, the Secretary onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
but to the Secretary out
of a Confidence and ſingular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
there is a libertie to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
at diſcretion at home and
abroad with friends and enemies
in all matters of ſpeech and intelligence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:156256:3"/>
All Servants of Princes deale upon ſtrong and warie
authoritie and warrant in disburſements as Treaſurers, in
conference with enemies as Generall, in Commiſſions in
executing Offices by Patent &amp; inſtructions, &amp; ſo in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe, only a Secretary hath noe warrant or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
noe not in matters of his own greateſt particulars,
but the vertue and word of his Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>For ſuch is the multiplicitie of actions, and variable
motions and intents of Forraigne Princes, and their dayly
practiſes, and in ſo many parts and places, as Secretarie's
can never have any Commiſſion, ſo long and univerſall as
to ſecure them.</p>
            <p>So as a Secretary muſt either conceive the very
thought of a King, which is onely proper to GOD; or a
King muſt exerciſe the painfull Office of a Secretary,
which is contrary to Majeſtie, and libertie, or elſe a
Prince muſt make choice of ſuch a ſervant of ſuch a
Prince, as the Princes aſſurance muſt be his confidence
in the Secretary, and the Secretarie's life his truſt in the
Prince.</p>
            <p>To deale now with a Prince <hi>tanquam infirmum futurum,</hi>
cannot be a rule for a Secretary, for all that he hath to
truſt to is quite contrary, which is that his Prince will be
<hi>ſemper idem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All ſtrange Princes hate Secretarie's, all Aſpirers,
and all Conſpirers, becauſe they either kill thoſe
monſters in their Cradles or elſe tract them out where
no man elſe can diſcerne the print of their footing.</p>
            <p>Further more this is manifeſt that all men of warre
do malign them except they will be at their deſires.</p>
            <p>Their fellow Councellors envy them becauſe they
have moſt eaſie and free acceſſe to Princes, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
a Prince hath cauſe to delay or deny to ſearch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156256:3"/>
or puniſh, none ſo ſoone beare ſo much burthen.</p>
            <p>Kings are adviſed to obſerve theſe things in a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
            <p>Firſt that he be created by himſelf and of his owne
raiſing.</p>
            <p>Secondly that he match not in a factious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</p>
            <p>And laſtly that he have reaſonable capacitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
abilitie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the place of a Secretary is dreadfull,
if he ſerve not a conſtant Prince, for he that liveth by
truſt ought to ſerve truly, ſo he that lives at mercy ought
to be carefull in the choice of his Maſter that he be juſt
<hi>&amp; de bona Natura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Princes be not confident on thoſe, whom they
have made choice of, they ſhall ill truſt the work of a
ſtrange hand, and if the rule hath failed in ſome of
thoſe that have ſinned in ingratitude to thoſe Princes,
it is in thoſe of the higheſt order, <hi>Ero ſimilis Altiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for thoſe of private qualitie who have no other
conſiſtance nor can ever look for equall bleſſedneſſe, there
the jealouſie of a Prince hath never beheld ſuſpect but
meere contempt.</p>
            <p>As long as any matter of what weight ſoever is
handled onely between the Prince and the Secretary:
Thoſe Councells are compared to the mutuall affections
of two lovers, undiſcovered to their friends.</p>
            <p>When it commeth to be diſputed in Councel, it is like
the conference of Parents and ſolemnization of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
the firſt matter, the ſecond Order, and indeed the
one the act, the other the Publication.</p>
            <p>If there be then a Secretary whoſe State can witneſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156256:4"/>
that he covereth not for profit, and if his carefull life,
and death ſhall record it, that love is his Object, if
he deale leſſe with other mens ſuites, whereby Secretarie's
gaine, then ever any did, if he preferr his Majeſtie, and
deſpiſe his own.</p>
            <p>If ſuch an one ſhould finde that his hope could not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
him, no not againſt the Slanders of thoſe wicked
ones, whom he muſt uſe onely, then ſurely that Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
muſt reſolve that the firſt day of his entrie is the firſt
day of his miſerie, for if he be not worthy of truſt, he
is leſſe worthy of life; and a ſuſpicion of a Secretary is
both a tryall and Condemnation and a Iudgment.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very ſorry, that I find in my ſelf,
that I am neither able to ſatisfie your
Lordſhips requeſt, nor my owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires;
and yet your ſelfe perchance will
better accept my doings, then I ſhall my ſelfe
allow them. Your Lorſhip, would have me (by
your Letters) give you advice, for your affaires
and ſervice there. It commeth of your two much
good opinion of me, that your Lordſhip thinkes
me able thereunto, which ſurely I am not: and
though my deſire be to do this, as you would;
yet cannot I ſatisfie my ſelfe, as I would; and if I
ſhould ſpend any words to declare my owne
unabilitie, your Lordſhip would not like them;
and to enterpriſe to do that which I know not,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156256:5"/>
I am not therein like my ſelfe. Yet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I had rather pleaſe your Lordſhip with
my folly; then alltogether my ſelfe with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
if I write fooliſhly, or unſeaſonably,
the lack is mine, but the occaſion of my fault
is your Lordſhips. I heard ſo good report of
your doings, the beſt is, I can give you, to
go forward, and countenance your owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
and the next advice thereunto is, that
when you ſee one day comming, to amend the
day paſt; my meaning is, to have you in all
your action do, as all other naturall things
do, and moſt plainely. Things growing which
dayly from time to time do Increaſe, whoſe
example, if a man would follow; he ſhould
as his body groweth in age, ſo ſee his witt
with knowledge, his conditions with vertues
ſhould amend; and, as we do live, we grow
towards death, by moments of time, ſo ſhould
we grow towards heaven, by multiplying of
vertues, and good gifts. You ſee, I am at the
firſt ſtep in Divinity; and ſo might I ſeeme to
many other of your Eſtate, to be of ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to fall in Preaching to him, that muſt
be occupied in Muſters, with looking to fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156256:5"/>
and ſuch like worldlie affaires. But my
Lord, I know to whom I write, to him, which
conſidereth between things worldly, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
to him, that knoweth the feare of God,
is the beginning of wiſdome; and therewith I
end.</p>
            <p>Now, to your Externall care; where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely,
God is ſerved, and pleaſed with them,
that accompliſh the ſame to their powers; and,
if wiſdome lacke, they may aske it of him,
who hath the treaſure of Wiſdome and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Your Lordſhip hath there a great charge
of Government, I know, you think your ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
thereunto, eſpecially, in knowledge; and
ſurely to know that, amendeth your abilitie;
for more hurt comes of mens ſecurities, and
preſumption of wiſdome, then in miſtruſt. It is
a good thing, for you to be think your ſelfe, of
ſome Noble man, whom you have either read
or heard, whoſe doings have bin worthy of
commendations, in ſuch ſervice as this.</p>
            <p>And to make a Paterne, and example to
your ſelfe, dayly in your doings, practiſing the
imitation of him throughout all your life, and
in this point, may you chooſe manie noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156256:6"/>
of your owne naturall, good Father, to
follow; whereunto, nature ſhall bend, and make
you ſooneſt inclinable. If you have heard of any
Noble man famous in Juſtice; not being led by
affection on the one ſide, or on the other; nor
being ſtrict, in ſevereneſſe of Law; it were good,
to follow him. If alſo you have heard the ſame to
be mercifull, to have had compaſsion of others in
adverſitie, and willing to end all cauſes with
quietneſſe and charitie; the example will be
good. You may alſo propound to your ſelfe the
example, to follow ſuch a one, as hath liberalitie
in expences without prodigalitie, remembring
that the propertie of vertue is, to continue in
well doing, and therefore to hold the meane is
hard. As certainely in theſe or other like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
you ſhall ſee the fault on both ſides ſo nigh ſtanding
to the vertues, that unleſſe you keepe
your ſelfe in your doings very upright, it is eaſy
to erre on the one ſide or the other; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
in your expences if you keepe not a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in your giving, you ſhall faile on the one
ſide; and ſhall lack to give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when moſt gladly
you would give: on the other ſide, if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to give, where you may, and when you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156256:6"/>
ought, then do you as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>heape
up ſtones for your Grave.</hi> The like is in the
vertue of Juſtice; wherein, it ſhall ſuffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
of one <hi>Byas,</hi> that when he had given
Judgment on one, wept himſelfe; and being
asked of the cauſe, he ſaid, in weeping he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
nature: in my ſentence the Law: his pitie
was naturall and hindred not Juſtice, his Juſtice
was lawfull and not unnaturall. Thus, I might
ſpend your Lordſhips time, in reading a long,
and weary Letter, if I would continue in that
Morall advertiſement; I will therefore draw
more to particulars of your charge, and as I
gueſſe thereby, more aptly to ſatisfie your
Lordſhips requeſt. The foundation of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
there is your commiſsion, and under ſeale
of diſcharge, the force thereof is the end of
your charge. wherefore, you ſhall do well; by
frequent reading and conſideration thereof, to
underſtand it well, and keepe it in memory; for
which purpoſe, it ſhall be expedient, to have
ſome conference with ſome learned man in
the Law for the behalfe in Law; and of ſome
other diſcreet men, for the execution of the ſame.
In like caſe this know as you ſee time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156256:7"/>
ſo may you performe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But me thinkes you will ſay, I took upon me,
the eaſieſt parts of advertiſement, that is, to
do diſcreetly, but I ſhew you not how, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
you to others, and then will you thinke, that
I do, as one that may bidd a ſicke man be
whole, be quitt, ſhake of your ſickneſſe but how
to do, he teacheth not.</p>
            <p>Forſooth my Lord, my excuſe is too waies:
firſt, I know not your Commiſsion, and that you
know is true; next, if I did know it, yet J have
no ſuch knowledge, (ſpecially in Law) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you withall more particularly, then J
do; but theſe J thinke contenteth you not, for
you will (according to your old mirth) call
this, a reaſon that commeth from <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſton,</hi>
and therefore to keepe you occupied
with ſcribling, J will follow on with a hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch
of ſentences.</p>
            <p>Jn your Commiſsion, J think, manie things
be committed to your diſcretion, which maketh
the burthen greater, then if you had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
commanded what to do. Therefore,
muſt you needs conſider, what is ment, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156256:7"/>
which, as we terme it in our language;
ſeemeth to be a knowledge, to diſcerne and
judge one thing from another. And this part
truly is properly pertaining to wiſdome; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man can diſcerne, he muſt know it, and
he that will performe this part, muſt meaſure
and judge of theſe things; and therefore before
you ſhall conclude of anie thing of weight, you
muſt diſcerne oft thereupon; and before you can
do that, you muſt know the thing that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
and then for the election of theſe it is
very profitable, to imagine a paire of Ballances,
and in the one to lay reaſons on the one ſide, and
in the other to lay the contrary, and then judge
which is the heavieſt, I meane which Ballance
hath the beſt reaſons, nor the moſt</p>
            <p>And touching your owne perſon, ſee things
pertaining thereto, be meet for the place
which you keepe; neither too negligent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too curious; to the one of theſe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
you are more ſubject then to the other,
and therefore, you muſt regard your ſelfe the
more.</p>
            <p>Your houſehold, muſt be Governed as it
may be an example of vertue to others, and an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156256:8"/>
ornament to your Office, let your Officers have
good ancient Rules for order, and ſee they be
not neglected; you muſt your ſelfe ſo with the
ſame, as your ſervants may know you acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their doings; and yet not ſeeme to
ſtrangers, to meddle therewith. If you have
cauſe to blame your Officer, and have a mind
to keepe him, do it ſecretly, that he may know
his fault, but not be known to the ſervant, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him: in any wiſe cauſe not idleneſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
among your people, let not your ſervants
exceed in Apparell their degree, for the charge
at length will be to your purſe or eſtimation:
let them underſtand, that you love them beſt
who live beſt in order; them next, who live
neareſt order, and them nothing at all; which
live farr from order; let them which do well
in your houſe, feele both your love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>At your table, let no matter of Princes affaires
or Princes regiments, be diſputed; nor of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
for meate and drinke requireth meaner
talke; to keepe men occupied of the Common
talke of the Country, or other honeſt merry
talkes. Laſtly note, let Job ſerve in his degree,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156256:8"/>
your Lordſhip can well enough, with a few
queſtions, ſet men occupied in talke.</p>
            <p>For your fare, (your Lordſhip muſt give me
leave to be bold) I can very well like, that in
reſpect of your degree, that your ſervice be
both in order, and ſervice honourable: and in
ſubſtance plenreous, and in art curious, but
conſidering the proneſſe of this age to exceſſe;
J can beſt allow the firſt without the laſt: and
in any wiſe whatſoever you ſhall like, do in
other places, let not your Orders belonging to
your Eſtate (eſpecially in Common aſſemblies)
at your table be neglected: and if your table be
alſo plenteous, it is alſo ſerviceable for the poore:
but the laſt, to have many deviſes of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
meates, and alſo ſpiced, maketh waſt in
the houſehold, gaineth little, giveth ill example
to be followed, and is not wholſome to your
gueſts, and in the end, ſerveth ſmall to hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</p>
            <p>Now for the uſage of men there in thoſe
parts, as you find them at your comming, ſo as
little as you may, ſeeke to alter their eſtate, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you ſee ſome cauſe:) let it not appeare, you
uſe any man, with ſingular affection, above the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156256:9"/>
reſt; and yet you may uſe (indeed) as you ſee
cauſe, men either for wiſdome, credit with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of others envyes, not them whom you ſhall
make choice of.</p>
            <p>Jn your Conſultations give every man leave
to ſpeake and beare with their lackes, ſo that
you make choice of the beſt; do what you can, to
make every one live according to his own eſtate:
the Gentlemen to live of their owne without
reproach, and if you ſee any young Gentlemen
towards waſting, conferr with his friends, for
the ſtay thereof: eſpecially, if his be of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance:
likewiſe ſee, that poore men have their
right, not for importunitie of clamour, but for
pitie and truth.</p>
            <p>Touching the Lawyers of the Countrie,
eſteeme them of learning, ſee they lack not too
much honeſtie, but in no wiſe ſeeme to favour
theſe Demy-Lawyers, except you ſee perfection
of honeſtie, for in all Countries they have leaſt
kill, and do moſt harme.</p>
            <p>Do what you can, to make the Gentlemen
accord amongſt themſelves; and to extinguiſh
old factions, either by ſome deviſe of marrying,
or by redemption of titles of Lands, or ſuch like
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156256:9"/>
incumbrances, which commonly be the ſeeds
of diſcord. For termination of poore mens ſuites,
remit them, (as much as you may) to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Arbitrators to end: do not intermeddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
your ſelfe: for ſo ſhall your labour be bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt you be in that Countrie, (if you take
anie ſervants) let them be Gentlemens ſonnes,
and if you may their heires, that by their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with you, they may know you and yours.</p>
            <p>Set up artillerie, and neglect not the game of
wraſtling, let there be frequent games, as ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
running on horſe and foote, and wreſtling:
in my Countrie have been uſed all waies for ſuch
purpoſes, and in this behalfe I meane, not to have
you induce new devices in that Country, if they
have other of their owne. But ſome might aske
me this, is this the true uſe of Holy daies forſooth?
touching that part of the day, where the Civill
Magiſtrate hath power, I thinke it not much
amiſſe, but for the time the Eccleſiaſticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
doth appoint to pray, and teach a Sermon,
I thinke it not meet, to be put to this uſe. But
therein I will not much diſpute, for it belongeth
to Divinitie, whereunto your Commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156256:10"/>
not; for hereof the Biſhops and others,
have their charge.</p>
            <p>Surelie my Lord, it would be time now to leave
my ſcribling leaſt I ſhall be like the ſ ingers, which
are dainetie to begin, &amp; know not when to leave:
I thinke your Lordſhip ſhall be weary of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
wherefore J will leave with a few lines,
like to my beginning</p>
            <p>Your doings here have deſerved praiſe, ſee you
continue your diſtance: ſo farre of your acception
here J meane, as J know. You were wont, and
have profeſſed unto me that is to ſerve uprightly
and truly, and to do therein as you can, and then
may you be bold of praiſe: and if you miſſe of
that, yet, of no diſhonour: for nothing indeed is
honourable, but well doing; the weale of your
Countrie (J meane the quietneſſe of ſuch, as you
have authoritie to governe) is your marke, ſhoote
thereat: guiding your purpoſe with the feare of
God, and ſo ſhall you gaine the love of God, and
Man. Jf you do ſome time (as you ſee cauſe) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
the Queenes Majeſtie of the good Eſtate
of that Countrie, and of the Gentlemen there, (ſo
it be by ſhort Letters) referring (if you have anie
long Declaration of things to your Letters) to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156256:10"/>
the Privy Counſell: if any thing be to be miſliked
or tedious to be advertiſed, procure others alſo
to write thereof, and in no wiſe write thereof
alone: for you know fortunate things are well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
from anie man but how the contrary may
come from you, you may doubt.</p>
            <p>Jt is full time for me to end my follie, and
your Lordſhip to end your labour, beſeeching
you, to make my will in ſatisfieing your requeſt,
anſwer the other lacke fault: and that J may be
humbly remembred to my ladie, to whom J
acknowledge much dutie, and am aſhamed of
my ſmall deſerving of her great goodneſſe to
me wards.</p>
