            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>The Giant now leaves off to stand,</l>

               <l>By its engaging Arguments to save</l>
               <l>Thee, I shall lay out that poor help I have,</l>
               <l>Thee to entice; that thou wouldst dearly fall</l>
               <l>In love with thy Salvation, and with all</l>
               <l>That doth thereto concurr, that thou may'st be</l>
               <l>As blessed as the Blessed can make thee,</l>
               <l>Not only here, but in the World to come,</l>
               <l>In bliss, which I pray God may be thy home.</l>
               <l>But first I would advise thee to bethink</l>
               <l>Thy self, how sin hath laid thee at the brink</l>

               <l>Unto that Jesus whom the Father sent</l>
               <l>Into the World, for this cause and intent,</l>

               <l>Prepared for the Devil, and for those</l>
               <l>That with him, and his Angels, rather chose</l>

Now to encourage us for to begin,</l>

               <l>Or hinder us; the Crown is at the end,</l>
               <l>Let's run, and strive, and fly, and let's contend</l>
               <l>With greatest courage, it for to obtain,</l>
               <l>'Tis Life and Peace, and everlasting gain.</l>
               <l>The gate of Life, the new and living way,</l>
               <l>The Promise holdeth open all the day,</l>
               <l>Which thou by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder must ascend,</l>
               <l>Where Angels always wait, and do attend</l>
               <l>As Ministers, to minister for those</l>
               <l>That do with God, and Christ, and glory close.</l>
               <l>If guilt of sin still lieth at our door,</l>
               <l>Us to discourage, let us set before</l>
               <l>Our Eyes, a bleeding Jesus, who did dye</l>
               <l>The Death, and let's believe the reason why</l>
               <l>He did it, was, that we might ever be</l>
               <l>From death, and sin, from hell, and wrath, set free.</l>
               <l>Yea, let's remember for that very end,</l>
               <l>It was his blessed Father did him send,</l>
               <l>That he the Law of God might here fulfill,</l>
               <l>That so the Mystery of his blessed Will</l>
               <l>Might be revealed in the blessedness</l>
               <l>Of those that fly to Christ for righteousness.</l>
               <l>Now let us argue with our selves then, thus</l>
               <l>That Jesus Christ our Lord came to save us,</l>
               <l>By bearing of our sins upon his back,</l>
               <l>By hanging on the Cross, as on a Rack,</l>
               <l>While Justice cut him off on every side,</l>
               <l>While smiles Divine, themselves from him did</l>

While earth did quake, and rocks in pieces rent,</l>
               <l>And while the Sun as veiled, did lament</l>
               <l>To see the innocent and harmless dye</l>
               <l>So sore a death, so full of misery.</l>
               <l>Yea, let us turn again and say all this</l>
               <l>He did and suffered for love of his.</l>
               <l>He brought in everlasting Righteousness,</l>
               <l>That he might cover all our nakedness:</l>
               <l>He wept and washt his Face with brinish tears,</l>
               <l>That we might saved be from hellish fears:</l>
               <l>Blood was his sweat too in his agony,</l>
               <l>That we might live in joyful extasie:</l>
               <l>He apprehended was and led away,</l>
               <l>That Grace to us-ward never might decay:</l>
               <l>With swords and bills, and outrage in the night,</l>
               <l>That to the peace of Heaven we might have right:</l>
               <l>Condemn'd he was between two Thieves to dye,</l>
               <l>That we might ever in his bosom lye:</l>
               <l>Scourged with whips his precious body were,</l>
               <l>That we lashes of Conscience might not fear:</l>
               <l>His head was crown'd with thorns, that we might be</l>
               <l>Crowned with glory and felicity.</l>
               <l>He hanged was upon a cursed Tree,</l>
               <l>That we delivered from death might be:</l>
               <l>His Father from him hides his smiles and face,</l>
               <l>That we might have them in the heav'nly place:</l>
               <l>He cry'd, <hi>My God, why hast forsaken me,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That we forsaken of him might not be:</l>
               <l>Into his Side was thrust a bloody Spear,</l>
               <l>That we the sting of death might never fear:</l>

               <l>Then at his Chariot-wheels he captive led</l>
               <l>His Foes, and trod upon the Serpents Head;</l>
               <l>Riding in triumph to his Fathers Throne,</l>
               <l>There to possess the Kingdom as his own.</l>
               <l>What sayst thou? will't not yet unto him come?</l>
               <l>His Arms are open, in his Heart is room</l>
               <l>To lay thee; be not then discouraged,</l>
               <l>Although thy sins be many, great, and red:</l>
               <l>Unto thee Righteousness he will impute,</l>
               <l>And with the kisses of his Mouth salute</l>
               <l>Thy drooping Soul, and will it so uphold,</l>
               <l>As that thy shaking Conscience shall be bold</l>
               <l>To come to Mercys Seat, with great access,</l>
               <l>There to expostulate with that Justice</l>
               <l>That burns like fiery flames, against all those</l>
               <l>That do not with this blessed Jesus close;</l>
               <l>Which unto thee will do no harm, but good,</l>
               <l>Because thou hast relyance on that blood,</l>
               <l>That Justice saith hath given him content,</l>
               <l>For all that do unfeignedly repent</l>
               <l>Their ill spent Life, and roll upon free grace,</l>
               <l>That they within that bosom might have place,</l>
               <l>That open is to such, where they shall lye</l>
               <l>In ease, and gladness, and felicity,</l>
               <l>World without end, according to that state</l>
               <l>I have, nay better than I can relate.</l>
               <l>If thou shalt still object, thou yet art vile,</l>
               <l>And hast a Heart that will not reconcile</l>
               <l>Unto the holy Law, but will rebell,</l>
               <l>Heark yet to what I shall thee farther tell.</l>

Two things are yet behind, that help thee will,</l>
               <l>If God shall put into thy Mind that skill,</l>
               <l>So to improve them, as becometh those</l>
               <l>That would with mercy and forgiveness close.</l>
               <l>First then, let this sink down into thy Heart,</l>
               <l>That Christ is not a Saviour in part,</l>
               <l>But every way so fully he is made</l>
               <l>The All of those, that underneath his shade,</l>
               <l>And wing would sit, and shroud their weary Soul,</l>
               <l>That even <hi>Moses</hi> dare it not controul,</l>
               <l>But justifi't, approve of 't, and conclude,</l>
               <l>No Man nor Angel, must himself intrude</l>
               <l>With such Doctrine, that may oppose the same,</l>
               <l>On pain of blaspheming that holy Name,</l>
               <l>Which God himself hath given unto Men,</l>
               <l>To stay, to trust, to lean themselves on, when</l>
               <l>They feel themselves assaulted, and made fear</l>
               <l>Their sin will not let them in life appear.</l>
               <l>For, as God made him perfect Righteousness,</l>
               <l>That he his love might to the height express,</l>
               <l>And us present compleat before the Throne;</l>
               <l>Sanctification too, of his own</l>
               <l>He hath prepared, in which do we stand</l>
               <l>Compleat in Holiness, at his right Hand.</l>
               <l>Now this Sanctification is not</l>
               <l>That Holiness which is in us, but that</l>
               <l>Which in the Person of this Jesus is,</l>
               <l>And can inherently be only his,</l>
               <l>But is imputed to us for our good,</l>
               <l>As is his active Righteousness and Blood,</l>
               <l>Which is the cause, though we infirm are found,</l>
               <l>That Mercy and Forgiveness doth abound</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104030:30"/>
To us ward, and that why we are not shent,</l>
               <l>And empty, and away rebuked sent,</l>
               <l>Because that all we do imperfect is.</l>
               <l>Bless God then for this Holiness of his,</l>
               <l>And learn to look by Faith on that alone,</l>
               <l>When thou seest thou hast nothing of thine own;</l>
               <l>Yea, when thy Heart most willing is to do</l>
               <l>What God by his good Word doth call thee to;</l>
               <l>And when thou find'st most Holiness within,</l>
               <l>And greatest power over every sin,</l>
               <l>Yet then to Jesus look, and thou shalt see</l>
               <l>In him Sanctification for thee,</l>
               <l>Far more compleat, than all that thou canst find</l>
               <l>In the most upright Heart, and willing Mind,</l>
               <l>That ever Men or Angels did possess,</l>
               <l>When most fill'd with inherent Righteousness.</l>
               <l>Besides, if thou forgettest here to live,</l>
               <l>And Satan get thee once into his sieve,</l>
               <l>He will so hide thy Wheat, and shew thy Brun,</l>
               <l>That thou wilt quickly cry, I am undone.</l>
               <l>Alas, thy goodliest attainments here,</l>
               <l>Though like the fairest blossoms they appear,</l>
               <l>How quickly will they lowr and decay,</l>
               <l>And be as if they all were fled away,</l>
               <l>When once the East-wind of temptations beat</l>
               <l>Upon thee, with their dry and blasting heat.</l>
               <l>Rich Men will not account their treasure lyes</l>
               <l>In crackt Groats, and in Four-pence-half-pennys,</l>
               <l>But in those Bags they have within their Chests,</l>
               <l>In staple Goods, which shall within their brests</l>
               <l>Have place accordingly, because they see</l>
               <l>Their substance lyeth here: But if that be</l>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104030:31"/>
But shaken, then they quickly fear and cry,</l>
               <l>Alas! 'tis not this small and odd money</l>
               <l>We carry in our Pockets for to spend</l>
               <l>Will make us rich, or much will stand our friend;</l>
               <l>If famine, or if want do us assail,</l>
               <l>How quickly will these little pieces fail!</l>
               <l>If thou be wise consider what I say,</l>
               <l>And look for all in Christ, where no decay</l>
               <l>Is like to be; then though thy present frame</l>
               <l>Be much in up and down, yet he the same</l>
               <l>Abideth, yea, and still at Gods right hand,</l>
               <l>As thy most perfect holiness will stand.</l>
               <l>It is, I say, not like to that in thee,</l>
               <l>Now high, then low, now out, then in, but he</l>
               <l>Most perfect is, when thou art at the worst,</l>
               <l>The same, the very same, I said at first.</l>
               <l>This helpeth much when thou art buffetted,</l>
               <l>And when thy graces lye in thee as dead,</l>
               <l>Then to believe they are all perfect still</l>
               <l>In Christ thy head, who hath that blessed skill,</l>
               <l>Yet to present thee by what is in him</l>
               <l>Unto his Father, one that hath no sin.</l>
               <l>Yea, this will fill thy mouth with Argument</l>
               <l>Against the Tempter, when he shall present</l>
               <l>Before thee all thy weakness, and shall hide</l>
               <l>From thee thy Graces, that thou may'st abide</l>
               <l>Under the fretting fumes of unbelief,</l>
               <l>Which never yielded Christian man relief.</l>
               <l>Nor help thy self thou may'st against him thus:</l>
               <l>O Satan, though my heart indeed be worse</l>
               <l>Than 'twas a wile ago, Yet I perceive,</l>
               <l>Thou shalt me not of happiness bereave;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:104030:31"/>
Nor yet of holiness, for by the Word</l>
               <l>I find, that Jesus Christ our blessed Lord,</l>
               <l>Is made Sanctification for me</l>
               <l>In his own Person, where all Graces be,</l>
               <l>As water in the Fountain, and that I</l>
               <l>By means of that have yet a sanctity,</l>
               <l>Both personal, and perfect every way,</l>
               <l>And that is Christ himself, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth say.</l>
               <l>Now though my crazy Pitcher oft doth leak,</l>
               <l>By means of which my Graces are so weak,</l>
               <l>And so much spent, that one I cannot find</l>
               <l>Able to stay or help my feeble mind.</l>
               <l>Yet then I look to Jesus, and see all</l>
               <l>In him, that wanting is in me, and shall</l>
               <l>Again take courage, and believe he will</l>
               <l>Present me upright in his Person, till</l>
               <l>He humble me for all my foolishness,</l>
               <l>And then again fill me with holiness.</l>
               <l>Now if thou lovest inward sanctity,</l>
               <l>As all the Saints do most unfeignedly,</l>
               <l>Then add to what I have already said,</l>
               <l>Faith in the Promise, and be not afraid</l>
               <l>To urge it often at the Throne of Grace,</l>
               <l>And to expect it in its time and place:</l>
               <l>Then he that true is, and that cannot lye,</l>
               <l>Will give it unto thee, that thou thereby</l>
               <l>May'st serve with faith, with fear, in truth, &amp; love,</l>
               <l>That God that did at first thy Spirit move</l>
               <l>To ask it to his praise, that he might be</l>
               <l>Thy God, and that he might delight in thee.</l>
               <l>If I should here particulars relate,</l>
               <l>Methinks, it could not but much animate</l>

Thy Heart, though very listless to enquire,</l>
               <l>How thou may'st that enjoy, which all desire,</l>
               <l>That love themselves, and future Happiness;</l>
               <l>But Oh! I cannot fully it express:</l>
               <l>The Promise is so open, and so free</l>
               <l>In all respects, to those that humble be,</l>
               <l>That want they cannot, what for them is good,</l>
               <l>But there 'tis, and confirmed is with Blood;</l>
               <l>A certain sign, all those enjoy it may,</l>
               <l>That see they want it, and sincerely pray</l>
               <l>To God the Father, in that Jesus Name,</l>
               <l>Who bled on purpose to confirm the same.</l>
               <l>Now would'st thou have a Heart that tender is?</l>
               <l>A Heart that forward is to close with bliss,</l>
               <l>A Heart that will impressions freely take</l>
               <l>Of the New Covenant, and that will make</l>
               <l>The best improvement of the Word of Grace,</l>
               <l>And that to Wickedness will not give place,</l>
               <l>All this is in the Promise, and it may</l>
               <l>Obtained be of them that humbly pray.</l>
               <l>Would'st thou enjoy that Spirit that is free?</l>
               <l>And looseth those that in their Spirits be</l>
               <l>Opprest with guilt, or filth, or unbelief,</l>
               <l>That Spirit that will where it dwells be chief,</l>
               <l>Which breaketh <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Cord, as rotten thread</l>
               <l>And raiseth up the Spirit that is dead,</l>
               <l>That sets the Will at liberty to chuse</l>
               <l>Those things, that God hath promis'd to infuse</l>

               <l>From thy most blessed Covenant of Grace,</l>
               <l>Where Jesus rules as King, and where thy face</l>
               <l>Is only to be seen with comfort, and</l>
               <l>Where sinners justifi'd before thee stand.</l>
               <l>If these thy groanings be sincere and true,</l>
               <l>If God doth count thee one that dost pursue</l>
               <l>The things thou cryest after, with thy heart,</l>
               <l>No doubt but in them thou shalt have a part.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104030:33"/>
The next word that I would unto thee say,</l>
               <l>Is how thou may'st attain without delay,</l>
               <l>Those blessed Graces, and that Holiness</l>
               <l>Thou dost with so much godly zeal express</l>
               <l>Thy love to, and thy longing to enjoy,</l>
               <l>That sins and weakness might thee less annoy.</l>
               <l>Know then, as I have hinted heretofore,</l>
               <l>And shall now speak unto a little more;</l>
               <l>All graces in the person of the Son,</l>
               <l>Are by the Father hid, and therefore none</l>
               <l>Can them obtain, but they who with him close;</l>
               <l>All others graceless are, but only those,</l>
               <l>For of his fulness 'tis that we receive,</l>
               <l>And grace for grace; let no man then deceive</l>
               <l>Himself, or others, with a feigned shew</l>
               <l>Of Holiness, if Jesus they eschew.</l>
               <l>When he ascended to his Father, then</l>
               <l>It was that he received Gifts for men;</l>
               <l>Faith, hope, and love, true zeal, an upright heart,</l>
               <l>Right humbleness of mind, and every part</l>
               <l>Of what the word of Life counts holiness,</l>
               <l>God then laid up in him, that we redress</l>
               <l>And help might have, who do unto him fly</l>
               <l>For righteousness, and Gospel-sanctity.</l>
               <l>Now if thou would'st inherent righteousness,</l>
               <l>And so Sanctification possess,</l>
               <l>In Body, Soul, and Spirit, then thou must</l>
               <l>To Jesus flye, as one ungodly, first;</l>
               <l>And so by him crave pardon for thy sin</l>
               <l>Which thou hast loved, and hast lived in;</l>
               <l>For this cannot at all forgiven be,</l>
               <l>For any righteousness that is in thee,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104030:34"/>
Because the best thou hast is filthy raggs,</l>
               <l>Prophane, presumptuous, and most beastly braggs</l>
               <l>Of Flesh and Blood, which always cross doth lye</l>
               <l>To God, to Grace, and thy Felicity.</l>
               <l>Then Righteousness imputed thou must have,</l>
               <l>Thee from that guilt and punishment to save</l>
               <l>Thou lyest under, as a sinful man,</l>
               <l>Throughout polluted, and that never can</l>
               <l>By any other means acquitted be,</l>
               <l>Or ever have true holiness in thee.</l>
               <l>The reason is, because all Graces are</l>
               <l>Only in Christ, and be infused where,</l>
               <l>Or into those whom he doth justifie,</l>
               <l>By what himself hath done, that he thereby</l>
               <l>Might be the whole, of all that happiness</l>
               <l>The Sinner shall enjoy here, and in Bliss.</l>
               <l>Besides, if Holiness should first be found</l>
               <l>In those whom God doth pardon, then the ground</l>
               <l>Why we forgiven are, would seem to be,</l>
               <l>He first found Holiness in thee and me;</l>
               <l>But this the Holy Scriptures will refute,</l>
               <l>And prove, that Righteousness he doth impute,</l>
               <l>Without respect to goodness first in man;</l>
               <l>For to speak Truth indeed no goodness can</l>
               <l>Be found in those, that underneath the Law</l>
               <l>Do stand: For if God Goodness in them saw,</l>
               <l>Why doth he once and twice say, <hi>Thers is none</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That Righteous be, no not so much as one,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>None understandeth, none seek after God,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>His ways they have not known, but have abode</hi>

               <l>Now where's the Holiness that should them save?</l>
               <l>Or as a preparation go before,</l>
               <l>To move God to do for them, less or more.</l>
               <l>No, Grace must on thee Righteousness bestow,</l>
               <l>Or else Sin will for ever thee undo.</l>
               <l>Sweet <hi>Paul</hi> this Doctrine also doth express,</l>
               <l>Where he saith, <hi>Some may have a Righteousness,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Though Works they have not, and it thus may stand,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Grace by the promise gives, what the command</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Requireth us to do, and so are we</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Quitted from doing, and by Grace made free.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Now then if Holiness thou would'st obtain,</l>
               <l>And would'st a tender Christian-man remain,</l>
               <l>Keep Faith in action; let that Righteousness</l>
               <l>That Christ fulfilled, always have express</l>
               <l>And clear distinction in thy Heart, from all</l>
               <l>That Men by Scripture, or besides it, call</l>
               <l>Inherent Gospel-holiness, or what</l>
               <l>Terms else they please to give it; for 'tis that,</l>
               <l>And that alone, by which all Graces come</l>
               <l>Into the Heart; for else there is no room</l>
               <l>For ought but pride, presumption, or despair,</l>
               <l>No love or other Graces can be there.</l>
               <l>Received you the Spirit, <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul,</l>
               <l>By hearing Faith, or Works? not Works, and shall</l>
               <l>No ways retain the same, except you do</l>
               <l>Hear Faith, imbrace the same, and stick thereto.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104030:35"/>
The word of Faith unto me pardon brings,</l>
               <l>Shews me the ground and reason whence it springs,</l>
               <l>To wit, free grace, which moved God to give</l>
               <l>His Son to dye, and bleed, that I might live.</l>
               <l>This word doth also loudly preach to me,</l>
               <l>Though I a miserable sinner be,</l>
               <l>Yet in this Son of God I stand compleat,</l>
               <l>Whose righteousness is without all deceit;</l>
               <l>'Tis that which God himself delighteth in,</l>
               <l>And that by which all his have saved been.</l>
               <l>When I do this begin to apprehend,</l>
               <l>My Heart, my Soul, and Mind, begins to bend</l>
               <l>To God-ward, and sincerely for to love</l>
               <l>His Son, his Ways, his People, and to move</l>
               <l>With brokenness of Spirit after him</l>
               <l>Who broken was, and killed for my sin.</l>
               <l>Now is mine heart grown holy, now it cleaves</l>
               <l>To Jesus Christ my Lord, and now it leaves</l>
               <l>Those ways that wicked be, it mourns, because</l>
               <l>It can conform no more unto the Laws</l>
               <l>Of God, who loved me when I was vile,</l>
               <l>And of sweet Jesus, who did reconcile</l>
               <l>Me unto Justice, by his precious blood,</l>
               <l>When no way else was left to do me good.</l>
               <l>If you would know, how this can operate</l>
               <l>Thus on the Soul; I shall to you relate</l>
               <l>A little farther, what my Soul hath seen,</l>
               <l>Since I have with the Lord acquainted been.</l>
               <l>The word of Grace when it doth rightly seize</l>
               <l>The Spirit of a man, and so at ease</l>
               <l>Doth set the Soul, the Spirit of the Lord</l>
               <l>Doth then with might accompany the Word,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:104030:35"/>
In which it sets forth Christ as crucifi'd,</l>
               <l>And by that means the Father pacifi'd</l>
               <l>With such a wretch as thou, and by this fight,</l>
               <l>Thy guilt is in the first place put to flight.</l>
               <l>For thus the Spirit doth expostulate;</l>
               <l>Behold how God doth now communicate</l>
               <l>(By changing of the person) grace to thee</l>
               <l>A sinner, but to Christ great misery,</l>
               <l>Though he the just one was, and so could not</l>
               <l>Deserve this punishment: behold then what</l>
               <l>The love of God is! how 'tis manifest,</l>
               <l>And where the reason lyes that thou art blest.</l>
               <l>This Doctrine being spoken to the heart,</l>
               <l>Which also is made yield to every part</l>
               <l>Thereof, it doth the same with sweetness fill,</l>
               <l>And so doth sins and wickednesses kill;</l>
               <l>For when the love of God is thus reveal'd,</l>
               <l>And thy poor drooping Spirit thereby seal'd,</l>
               <l>And when thy heart as dry ground, drinks this in</l>
               <l>Unto the roots thereof, which nourish sin,</l>
               <l>It smites them, as the worm did <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd,</l>
               <l>And makes them dwindle of their own accord,</l>
               <l>And dye away, instead of which there springs</l>
               <l>Up Life, and Love, and other holy things.</l>
               <l>Besides, the holy Spirit now is come,</l>
               <l>And takes possession of thee as its home;</l>
               <l>By which a war maintained always is,</l>
               <l>Against the old man, and the deeds of his.</l>
               <l>When God at first upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> spake,</l>
               <l>He made his very servant <hi>Moses</hi> quake;</l>
               <l>But when he heard the Law the second time,</l>
               <l>His heart was comforted, his face did shine.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:104030:36"/>
What was the reason of this difference,</l>
               <l>Seeing no change was in the ordinance?</l>
               <l>Although a change was in the manner, when</l>
               <l>The second time he gave it unto Men.</l>
               <l>At first 'twas given in Severity,</l>
               <l>In Thunder, Blackness, Darkness, Tempest high;</l>
               <l>In fiery Flames it was delivered,</l>
               <l>This struck both <hi>Moses</hi> and the Host as dead;</l>
               <l>But <hi>Moses</hi> when he went into the Mount</l>
               <l>The second Time, upon the same account,</l>
               <l>No fear, nor dread, nor shaking of his Mind,</l>
               <l>Do we in all the Holy Scripture find,</l>
               <l>But rather in his Spirit he had rest.</l>
               <l>And look'd upon himself as greatly blest.</l>
               <l>He was put in the Rock, he heard the Name,</l>
               <l>Which on the Mount the Lord did thus proclaim;</l>
               <l>The Lord, merciful, gracious, and more,</l>
               <l>Long-suffering, and keeping up in store</l>
               <l>Mercy for thousands, pardoning these things,</l>
               <l>Iniquity, Transgressions, and Sins,</l>
               <l>And holding guilty none, but such as still</l>
               <l>Refuse forgiveness, of rebellious will.</l>
               <l>This Proclamation better pleased him,</l>
               <l>Than all the Thunder, and the Light'ning,</l>
               <l>Which shook the Mount; this rid him of his fear,</l>
               <l>This made him bend, make haste, &amp; worship there.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> when he was sore opprest</l>
               <l>By <hi>Amon,</hi> and by <hi>Moab,</hi> and the rest</l>
               <l>Of them that sought his Life, no rest he found,</l>
               <l>Until a word of Faith became a ground</l>
               <l>To stay himself upon; O! then they fell,</l>
               <l>His very Song became their passing Bell.</l>

Then Holiness of Heart, a consequence</l>
               <l>Of Faith in Christ is, for it flows from thence;</l>
               <l>The love of Christ in Truth constraineth us,</l>
               <l>Of love sincerely, to make Judgment thus:</l>
               <l>He for us dyed, that for ever we</l>
               <l>Might dye to sin, and Christ his Servants be.</l>
               <l>O! nothing's like to the remembrance,</l>
               <l>Of what it is to have deliverance</l>
               <l>From Death and Hell, which is of due our right;</l>
               <l>Nothing I say like this to work delight</l>
               <l>In holy things; this like live-honey runs,</l>
               <l>And needs no pressing out of honey-combs.</l>
               <l>Then understand my meaning by my words,</l>
               <l>How sence of mercy unto faith affords</l>
               <l>Both Grace to sanctifie, and holy make</l>
               <l>That Soul, that of forgiveness doth partake.</l>
               <l>Thus having briefly shewed you what is</l>
               <l>The way of Life, of Sanctity, of Bliss,</l>
               <l>I would not in conclusion have you think,</l>
               <l>By what I say, that Christian-men should drink</l>
               <l>In these my words with lightness, or that they</l>
               <l>Are now exempted, from what every day</l>
               <l>Their duty is; No, God doth still expect,</l>
               <l>Yea doth command, that they do not neglect</l>
               <l>To pray, to read, to hear, and not dissent</l>
               <l>From being sober, grave, and diligent,</l>
               <l>In watching, self-denyal, and with fear</l>
               <l>To serve him all the time thou livest here.</l>
               <l>Indeed I have endeavoured to lay</l>

               <l>Pardon to get, and also Holiness,</l>

Thee, with the Kingdom he will give to those,</l>

               <head>From Mount <hi>Ebal.</hi>
               </head>
               <l>THus having heard from <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> I shall</l>
               <l>Next come to <hi>Ebal,</hi> and you thither call,</l>
               <l>Not there to curse you, but to let you hear,</l>
               <l>How God doth curse that Soul that shall appear</l>
               <l>An unbelieving man, a graceless wretch,</l>
               <l>Because he doth continue in the breach</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and also doth neglect</l>
               <l>To close with Jesus; him will God reject,</l>
               <l>And cast behind him, for of right his due</l>
               <l>Is that, from whence all miseries ensue.</l>
               <l>Cursed <hi>saith he,</hi> are they that do transgress</l>
               <l>The least of my Commandments, more or less:</l>
               <l>Nothing that written is must broken be,</l>
               <l>But always must be kept unto by thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>And must fulfilled be; for here no man</l>
               <l>Can look God in the face, or ever stand</l>
               <l>Before the Judgment seat, for if they be</l>
               <l>Convict, condemned too, assuredly.</l>
               <l>Now keep this Law no mortal Creature can,</l>
               <l>For they already do as guilty stand</l>
               <l>Before the God that gave it, so that they</l>
               <l>Obnoxious to the curse lye every day,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104030:37"/>
Which also they must feel for certainty,</l>
               <l>If unto Jesus Christ they do not fly.</l>
               <l>Hence then as they for ever shall be blest,</l>
               <l>That do by faith upon the promise rest;</l>
               <l>So peace unto the wicked there is none,</l>
               <l>'Tis wrath and death that they must feed upon.</l>
               <l>That what I say may some impression make</l>
               <l>On carnal Hearts, that they in time may take</l>
               <l>That course that best will prove, when time is done,</l>
               <l>These lines I add to what I have begun.</l>
               <l>First, Thou must know that God as he is Love,</l>
               <l>So he is Justice, therefore cannot move,</l>
               <l>Or in the least be brought to favour those,</l>
               <l>His Holiness and Justice doth oppose.</l>
               <l>For though thou may'st imagine in thy heart,</l>
               <l>That God is this or that, yet if thou art</l>
               <l>At all besides the truth of what he is,</l>
               <l>And so dost build thy hope for life amiss,</l>
               <l>Still he the same abideth, and will be</l>
               <l>The same, the same for ever unto thee.</l>
               <l>As God is true unto his promise, so</l>
               <l>Unto his threatning he is faithful too,</l>
               <l>Cease to be God he must, if he should break</l>
               <l>One tittle, that his blessed mouth did speak.</l>
               <l>Now then none can be saved but the men</l>
               <l>With whom the God-head is contented, when</l>
               <l>It them beholds, with the severest eye</l>
               <l>Of Justice, Holiness, and yet can spye</l>
               <l>No fault nor blemish in them; these be they</l>
               <l>That must be saved, as the Scriptures say.</l>
               <l>If this be true, as 'tis assuredly,</l>
               <l>Woe be to them that wicked live and dye;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104030:38"/>
Those that as far from Holiness have been</l>
               <l>All their Life long, as if no Eye had seen</l>
               <l>Their doings here, or as if God did not</l>
               <l>At all regard, or in the least mind what,</l>
               <l>Wherein, or how, they did his Law transgress,</l>
               <l>Either by this or other Wickedness;</l>
               <l>But how deceived these poor creatures are,</l>
               <l>They then shall know when they their burthen bear.</l>
               <l>Alas, our God is a consuming fire,</l>
               <l>So is his Law, by which he doth require</l>
               <l>That thou submit to him, and if thou be</l>
               <l>Not in that Justice found, that can save thee</l>
               <l>From all and every sentence, which he spake</l>
               <l>Upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> then as one that brake</l>
               <l>It, thou the flames thereof shalt quickly find,</l>
               <l>As scourges thee to lash, while sins do bind</l>
               <l>Thee hand and foot, for ever to endure</l>
               <l>The strokes of vengeance, for thy Life impure.</l>
               <l>What I have said, will yet evinced be,</l>
               <l>And manifest abundantly to thee,</l>
               <l>If what I have already spoken to,</l>
               <l>Be joyned with these Lines that do ensue.</l>
               <l>Justice discovers its antipathy</l>
               <l>Against Prophaneness and Malignity,</l>
               <l>Not only by the Law it gave to men,</l>
               <l>And Threatnings thereunto annexed then,</l>
               <l>But in as much as long before that day,</l>
               <l>He did prepare for such as go astray,</l>
               <l>That dreadful, that so much amazing place,</l>
               <l>Hell, with its Torments, for those men that Grace</l>
               <l>And Holiness of Life, slight, and disdain,</l>
               <l>There to bemoan themselves, with hellish pain.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104030:38"/>
This place also, the Pains so dismal be,</l>
               <l>Both as to Name and Nature, that in me</l>
               <l>It is not to express, the damning wights,</l>
               <l>The hellish Torture, and the fearful plights</l>
               <l>Thereof; for as intolerable they</l>
               <l>Must needs be found, by those that disobey</l>
               <l>The Lord: so can no word or thought express</l>
               <l>Unto the full, the height of that distress,</l>
               <l>Such miserable Caitiffs, that shall there</l>
               <l>Rebukes of Vengeance, for Transgressions bear.</l>
               <l>Indeed the Holy Scriptures do make use</l>
               <l>Of many Metaphors, that do conduce</l>
               <l>Much to the symbolizing of the place,</l>
               <l>Unto our Apprehension; but the case,</l>
               <l>The sad, the woful case, of those that lye</l>
               <l>As wracked there in endless misery,</l>
               <l>By all similitudes, no mortals may</l>
               <l>Set forth in its own nature; for I say,</l>
               <l>Similitudes are but a shade and shew</l>
               <l>Of those, or that they signifie to you.</l>
               <l>The fire that doth within thine Oven burn,</l>
               <l>The Prison where poor People sit and mourn,</l>
               <l>Chains, Racks, and Darkness, and such others, be</l>
               <l>As painting on the Wall, to let thee see</l>
               <l>By Word and Figures, the extremity</l>
               <l>Of such as shall within these burnings lye.</l>
               <l>But certainly, if Wickedness and Sin</l>
               <l>Had only foolish toyes and trifles been,</l>
               <l>And if God had not greatly hated it,</l>
               <l>Yea could he any ways thereof admit,</l>
               <l>And let it pass, he would not thus have done,</l>
               <l>He doth not use to punish any one,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104030:39"/>
With any place, or punishment that is</l>
               <l>Above or sharper than the sin of his</l>
               <l>Hath merited, and Justice seeth due;</l>
               <l>Read sin then by the death that doth ensue.</l>
               <l>Most men do judge of sin, not by the fruits</l>
               <l>It bears, and bringeth forth, but as it suits</l>
               <l>Their carnal and deluded hearts, that be</l>
               <l>With sensual Pleasures eaten up; but he</l>
               <l>That now so judgeth, shortly shall perceive,</l>
               <l>That God will judge thereof himself, and leave</l>
               <l>Such men no longer to their carnal lusts,</l>
               <l>To judge of wickedness, and of the just</l>
               <l>And righteous punishment, that doth of right</l>
               <l>Belong thereto, and will too in despite</l>
               <l>Of all their carnal reason, justifie</l>
               <l>Himself, in their eternal misery.</l>
               <l>Then Hell will be no fancy, neither will</l>
               <l>Mens sins be pleasant to them, but so ill,</l>
               <l>And bitter, yea so bitter that none can</l>
               <l>Fully express the same, or ever stand</l>
               <l>Under the burden it will on them lay,</l>
               <l>When they from Life and Bliss are sent away.</l>
               <l>When I have thought how often God doth speak</l>
               <l>Of their destruction, who his Law do break;</l>
               <l>And when the nature of the punishment</l>
               <l>I find so dreadful, and that Gods intent,</l>
               <l>Yea resolution is, it to inflict</l>
               <l>On every sinner that shall stand convict,</l>
               <l>I have amazed been, yet to behold,</l>
               <l>To see poor sinners yet with sin so bold,</l>
               <l>That like the Horse that to the battel runs</l>
               <l>Without all fear, and that no danger shuns,</l>
               <l>Till down he falls. O resolute attempts!</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104030:39"/>
O sad! amazing, damnable Events!</l>
               <l>The end of such proceedings needs must be,</l>
               <l>From which, O Lord, save and deliver me.</l>
               <l>But if thou think that God thy noble Race</l>
               <l>Will more respect, than into such a place</l>
               <l>To put thee; hold, though thou his off-spring be,</l>
               <l>And so art lovely, yet sin hath made thee</l>
               <l>Another kind of Creature, than when thou</l>
               <l>Didst from his fingers drop, and therefore now</l>
               <l>Thy first Creation stands thee in no stead,</l>
               <l>Thou hast transgressed, and in very deed</l>
               <l>Set God against thee, who is infinite,</l>
               <l>And that for certain never will forget</l>
               <l>Thy sins, nor favour thee if thou shalt dye</l>
               <l>A graceless Man; this is thy misery.</l>
               <l>When Angels sinned, though of higher race</l>
               <l>Than thou, and also put in higher place,</l>
               <l>Yet them he spared not, but cast them down</l>
               <l>From Heaven to Hell, where also they lye bound</l>
               <l>In everlasting chains, and no release</l>
               <l>Shall ever have, but wrath that shall encrease</l>
               <l>Upon them, to their everlasting woe.</l>
               <l>As for the state they were exalted to,</l>
               <l>That will by no means mitigate their fear,</l>
               <l>But aggravate their hellish torment here;</l>
               <l>For he that highest stands, if he shall fall</l>
               <l>His danger needs must be the great'st of all.</l>
               <l>Now if God noble Angels did not spare</l>
               <l>Because they did transgress, will he forbear</l>
               <l>Poor dust and ashes? will he suffer them</l>
               <l>To break his Law? and sin, and not condemn</l>
               <l>Them for so doing? let not man deceive</l>
               <l>Himself or others; they that do bereave</l>

Themselves by sin of happiness, shall be</l>
               <l>Cut off by Justice, and have misery.</l>

               <l>But only eight the Deluge did escape,</l>
               <l>All others of that Vengeance did partake;</l>
               <l>The reason was, That World ungodly stood</l>
               <l>Before him, therefore he did send the flood,</l>
               <l>Which swept them all away, a just Reward</l>
               <l>For their most wicked ways against the Lord,</l>
               <l>Who could no longer bear them, and their ways,</l>
               <l>Therefore into their bosom Vengeance pays.</l>
               <l>We read of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> too</l>
               <l>What Judgments they for sin did undergo,</l>
               <l>How God from Heaven did fire upon them rain,</l>

               <l>Condemning of them with an overthrow,</l>
               <l>And turned them to ashes: who can know</l>
               <l>The miseries that these poor People felt</l>
               <l>While they did underneath those burnings melt.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg n="20">
               <l>20. When they do talk of Banishment,</l>

               <l>Then to me God sends Hearts content,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg n="21">
               <l>21. Alas, they little think what peace</l>
               <l>They help me to, for by</l>
               <l>Their rage my Comforts do encrease;</l>
               <l>Bless God therefore do I.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="22">
               <l>22. If they do give me gall to drink,</l>
               <l>Then God doth sweetning cast,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg n="23">
               <l>23. For as the Devil sets before</l>
               <l>Me Heaviness and Grief,</l>
               <l>So God sets Christ and Grace much more,</l>

               <l>Because we here do lye,</l>
               <l>I answer, Goals are Christ his Schools,</l>

               <l>He frequently, both soon and late</l>
