            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our beauties (La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women) are but types and shadows of the beauty of your vertuous minde, which is discerned by Noble and Courteous actions. I may therefore presume that
<pb facs="tcp:98216:6"/>
               <hi>Ovid's</hi> Heroical Epistles, chiefly translated for your sakes, shall find a gentle accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, sutable to your Heroical dispositions, for Courtesie and Ingenuity are the companions of Gentility. But those who claim this Title, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded of it by their own viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities, <hi>Ovid</hi> disclaims them. Vertue is an invisible gift, which is not discerned by the outward habit, but by speech and action, and a certain delectation in vertue, as Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, Temperance, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:98216:6"/>
curtesie; to which <hi>Ovid</hi> doth appeal. For when <hi>Rome</hi> knew him famous, he was esteemed of Love and Ladies, so that he was fain to shadow the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious love of the Emperours daughter towards him under the vail of <hi>Corynna,</hi> but the Emperour saw through it, and banished him. Besides, these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, in regard of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, have just relation to you, Ladies and Gentlewomen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the complaint of Ladies and Gentlewomen for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their Lovers; And that
<pb facs="tcp:98216:7"/>
their sorrow may be more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, there is a Table prefixed, &amp; adjoyning to the book, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the several Pictures of the Arguments of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. So much concerning the work, and the Author <hi>Ovid,</hi> now you expect a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Dedication.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlewomen, since this book of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s which most Gentlemen could read before in Latin, is for your sakes come forth in English, it doth at first address it self a Suiter, to wooe your acceptance, that it may kiss your hands, and afterward have the lines thereof in reading sweetned by the odour of your breath, while the dead letters form'd into words by your divided lips, may receive new life by your passionate expression, and the words married in that Ruby-coloured Temple, may thus happily united, multiply your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in a word let this be.</p>

            <l>OF all the Poets, that in verse did raign</l>
            <l>As Monarchs, none could equal <hi>Ovid's</hi> strain,</l>
            <l>Especially in the affairs of Love,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ovid</hi> the Master of that Art did prove:</l>
            <l>His fancies were so pleasing and so sweet,</l>
            <l>That Love did wish no other winding sheet,</l>
            <l>If he had mortal been, for he would die</l>
            <l>To live again in his sweet Poesie.</l>
            <l>When he intended to inflame the mind,</l>
            <l>Or shew how Lovers proved too unkind,</l>
            <l>As in these Epistles, where Ladies bemoan</l>
            <l>Themselves, when their unkind lovers were gone;</l>
            <l>He doth so mournfully express their passion,</l>
            <l>In such a loving, and a lively fashion,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:98216:8"/>That reading them grief will not let you speak,</l>
            <l>Untill imprison'd tears from your eyes break;</l>
            <l>Such passions in his Letters do appear,</l>
            <l>That every word will make you drop a tear.</l>
            <l>But you fair Gentlewomen of this Isle,</l>
            <l>He would have you to glance one gentle smile</l>
            <l>On his Epistles, stil'd Heroical,</l>
            <l>Because by Lords and Ladies written all.</l>
            <l>You know that Love is the Hearts pleasant tamer,</l>
            <l>Whose motto is this, <hi>Omnia vincit Amor</hi>;</l>
            <l>For he can with his lighted Torch enflame</l>
            <l>Assoon the Lord and Lady, as the Swain.</l>
            <l>If then you hope to be happy in Love,</l>
            <l>If other sorrows may your pity move,</l>
            <l>If you the complaints of fair Ladies tender,</l>
            <l>Which English doth for your contentment render</l>
            <l>Unto your view, let these Epistles here,</l>

            <l>Yet this his comfort was in Banishment,</l>

               <l>Because once <hi>Theseus</hi> stole me as a prey,</l>
               <l>Shall I the Second time be stolne away?</l>
               <l>It had been my fault had I given consent,</l>
               <l>But being stolne against my will I went.</l>
               <l>And yet he gathered not my Virgin slower,</l>
               <l>He us'd no violence, though I was in his power:</l>
               <l>Some kisses onely he did striving gain,</l>
               <l>But no more kindnesse could from me obtain.</l>
               <l>Such is thy wantonnesse, thou wouldst not be</l>
               <l>Like him content alone with kissing me.</l>
               <l>He brought me back untoucht, his modesty</l>
               <l>Seem'd to excuse his former injury;</l>
               <l>And plainly it appear'd, that the young man</l>

               <l>This I do doubt, although I do not feare,</l>
