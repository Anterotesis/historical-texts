         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is no place nor perſon ignorant with what

beyond expectation, produceth an excellent and admired
good in the happie iſſue, yet is it not commended, or in any
caſe permitted (as being verie dangerous) in ordinarie

reaſonable likelihood, to beſtow in caſes of their liues
the truſt and care of their craſed healths, but for the moſt
part wanting a right notice of a iudicious choice, take
counſel either of common report which is a common lier,
or of priuate commendations, which are euer partiall. The

things, do ſteale from men the minds of men. Hence eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where prepoſterous intruſion doth diſorder the right
and propriety of euery thing, and the generall forgetfulnes
of that which to euerie one is moſt pertinent, doth beget
an itching buſineſſe in that which to euerie one is moſt
impertinent; and ſelfe conceited and preſuming ignorance
doth pricke forward raſh ſpirits to become more bold &amp;
buſie, then modeſtie doth permit diſcreete mindes, ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

miſerably perplexed with the doubtfull deliuery of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly

the ordinarie aſſiſtance of women in thoſe caſes ſhrinking

Afterward according vnto the ſecond indication from the

churched of the firſt. It is teſtified by many now inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Northampton, that from within the wombe of
a woman with child (then dwelling in the towne) her child
was audibly heard to cry, vnto her owne amazement, and

Anno 1610 a woman of Northampton<note n="g" place="margin">Of Woolaſton in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire.</note> ſhire being with
child and growing neare the time of her deliuery, was
extraordinarily diuers dayes pained in the bellie an inch
diſtant from the nauill, vntill at length diuers wormes, each
equalling in length a quarter of an ell, ſodainly at two
diſtant places did eate themſelues a paſſage through the
skinne of her bellie; and ſo came forth and gaue her eaſe.
A gentlewoman my late patient, and now dwelling in
Northampton, reporteth vnto me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her owne ſight with
many other eye witneſſes; that among her owne children
a male child, being then fiue weekes of age, a fortnight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
had the breaſts full of milke, as readily &amp; plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flowing and ſpouting out milke as the breaſts of a ſuck-giuing
nurſe. Theſe few inſtances are ſufficient to proue
the like contingence of other the like, which other times
in other manner, may and do oft bring forth. Neither is
euer nature ſo great a niggard (though not to euery eye
alike bountifull) but euery day almoſt may poſe bare and

that good will and excellent medicines put to death more
liues then open murther. For as the moſt complete ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
engins, and forts of warre, the excellent munition

but thoſe that are more generally learned then the beſt
acquaintance and familiarity which particular medicines
can afforde. From hence it cannot but be manifeſt, how
infinitely blinde good will and zeale do herein daily erre
to the deſtruction of many. It were happy if at length
the common inconuenience and publike ſcandall might
beget a law, and law bring forth reſtraint. For illuſtration
of that which hath bin ſaid, it were indifferent to inſtance
in any diſeaſe, but I will make choyce of ſome few onely,
to ſatiſfie for all. It is an ordinarie cuſtome in thoſe daies
with women to giue medicines for the greene ſickneſſe; &amp;
other ſtoppages in young women. In which practiſe if it
ſo happen that no inward impediment fruſtrate the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
they caſually ofttimes do ſeeming preſent good, and
blaze the excellencie of their medicine: but if ofttimes
(which they cannot diſtinguiſh or obſerue) the generall
cauſe of the obſtruction be not firſt by the generall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

though commonly as ſtrong as ſteele or iron, do not onely
no good or ſmall good, but ofttimes incorrigible hurt and
miſchiefes neuer after able to be reformed, or by the moſt
learned counſell to be redreſſed; while from the plenty or
ill diſpoſition of humors in the body theſe ſearching and
piercing medicines carry with them into the ſtopped parts
either more or worſe matter then was before, and thereby
there leaue a diſeaſe which ſhall neuer after die except by
exchange for a more pernicious. In the common knowne
diſeaſe of the ſtone likewiſe many and famous medicines
are at this day in many common hands, and perhaps truly

be worne out of Adams children. Alas an apple can do no
great hurt. It is faire and beautifull vnto the eye, pleaſant
to taſte, and but a trifle, a ſmall matter, a little quantity,
and of excellent quality; Adam muſt needs taſte. It is good
for his eyes, it will cleare his ſight, an excellent medicine
to make him ſee. What is more faire, more eaſie, more
gentle, more harmeleſſe, more cordiall, more daintie then
an apple? Eue in good will offered it, and ſo Adam tooke
it. It made him alſo ſee; but Adam had bene better ſtill

and caution<note n="d" place="margin">Foelix qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque dolore Alterius diſces poſſe carere. tuo. Tibull.</note> to himſelfe. It is ordinary with many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull

perillous medicines, which haply alſo they do not ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

they ſpeake their thought,) yet tell not truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they thinke not right.<note place="margin">Hiſtoria.</note> I was ſometime ſolicited by a

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14271:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and acute conuulſion violently diſtorted, and before time
allowed leaſure for preparation of remedies, ſwiftly ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.
In any propenſion thereto in the conſtitution or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſpoſition of the child, was nothing which might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
be accuſed; and therefore making diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
after ſome outward cauſe, I found that the ſuſpition
of wormes had occaſioned the commendations and vſe of
of the hearbe Bearefoote, which though ordinary and
much accuſtomed for that end among women, and oft by
good hap without hurt; yet we could not but with good
reaſon hereof conuince, conferring the preſent harme
(which no preſumption could vnto other thing impute)
with the danger and maligne nature of that herbe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of ſuch like effects: (although many for the like
vſe haue in like manner giuen it vnto their children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blame.) Thus ſometimes ſome men haue deuoured
mortall poyſons, not onely without harme, but with good
and commodious effect. By theſe conueyances &amp; through
the like preſumption, many vnwotting bodies oft bury in
themſelues vnbewailed (becauſe vnknowne) Ellebor,
Quickſiluer. Precipitate, and the like, coloured with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
names, and at the preſent vnperceiued. Deſperate tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
ſometime bring forth ſtrange deliuerances, yet neither
is the boldneſſe warrant, nor the eſcape encouragement.
There happen oft in theſe daies many ſodaine, maruailed
and ſtrange accidents, poſing the beſt Phyſitions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
without doubt oft raiſed from cauſes by theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
vnknowne, ſecret, concealed, or haply by time before
the effect appeare, forgotten: (for ſecret miſchiefs long
time inſenſibly vndermine before the ſenſible euent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.)
For proofe of dangerous cuſtomes in ignorant
hands,<note place="margin">Hiſtoria.</note> I will make one example a light vnto many. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſometime came to aduiſe concerning an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
accident in her ordinary vſe of ſpurge-comfits. She gaue
(at the ſame time her ſelfe, and ſome others in the ſame
houſe taking thereof with anſwerable effect and euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
vnto a very aged man eight in number (being her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14271:22"/>
vſuall doſe.) The firſt day they had no effect with the old
man, and in all the reſt performed their wont: ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gaue him as many the next day with the like effect,
and as many euery day vnto the 10 day, with the like
proofe. It was then her feare he had taſted his owne fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
feaſt before his death, but he ſuruiued the feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſenſe of change or danger. Is it ſafe from this good
hap, for other in hope ſtill to hazard themſelues in ſuch
vnſafe handling? Is it not rather manifeſt how ignorantly
and commonly theſe creatures ouerlooke the danger
which iuſtly wiſdome and reaſon ſuſpend and feare? Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete
feare awaketh vigilance and circumſpection, but
ignorance of danger is void of feare, and therefore of care.
Careleſſe attempts draw harmfull and repented iſſues: and
though good haps ſometimes flatter vaine ſecurity, yet if
ſeldome harmes be not wiſely extended as a caution and
example vnto many, the cuſtome of neglect will make the
rare confuſion quickly common. So large a feaſt of ſpurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfits
hath ſeldome kept ſo many holy daies in one bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
or a banketting likenes ſo harmeleſly priuiledged idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in a working quality. The conſequent hapned much
fairer then could be foreſeene or hoped. If for that cauſe
any man will againe aduenture the like, who will not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that in the thought he hath already loſt his wits, &amp; in
the proofe may loſe himſelfe? If notwithſtanding he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
any man will wonder, but no man, I ſuppoſe, imitate.
It may be haply deemed incredible, that ſo common and
meane ſort of people can attaine acquaintance with ſo
dangerous inſtruments, as ſome before mentioned and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like; but due exploration oft by the harmes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
doth teſtifie it, and the meanes of their acquaintance
diſcouered doth proue it eaſie. Quackſaluers, banckrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apothecaries,
and fugitiue Surgeons euery where ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauelling
the face of this kingdome, hunted by want of
riot from place to place, are oft compelled to inſinuate
and creepe into the fauour of many meane people; and in

their prodigality for luſt and loue, theſe generoſe and

already ſo far ſpent) I refuſed to promiſe or meddle farther

At length by ſome friends there was commended
highly for a farther and better performance, a Barber Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,

deliuered, after he had by ſtoole thus procured,
auoyded one whole pill vndiſſolued (ſeene by diuers well
vnderſtanding witneſſes preſent,) as alſo diuers ſmall fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Quickſiluer fluctuating and floating like white
pinnes heads, as the women that ſaw reported vnto vs.
To make the cauſe of theſe accidents yet more manifeſt;
it happened that two maid-ſeruants there attending vpon
the gentleman, by their continuall conuerſing neare him
and the infected ſweate of his body, fell ſtrangely and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
into the ſame fits one after another by courſe, and
each hauing ſuffred ſixe or ſeuen apart, were carried forth,
and after that time neuer ſince (as I yet heare) nor euer
before had the like, as they both then ſaid. One of theſe
now liueth maried in Towceſter in Northamptonſhire, the
other was lately ſeruant vnto an honorable Lady. This
hiſtory is knowne vnto many of note and worth beſide.
To conclude, the gentleman thus eſcaped, and grew by
little and little vnto his former ſenſes and ſtrength as his
firſt diſeaſe would permit. Within a quarter of an yeare
after, or thereabout, another Surgeon againe put the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
into a new hope of recouery: &amp; although the report
of my iudgement did ſomewhat (as I heard) ſhake his
confidence, yet not conceiuing my reaſon nor ſeeing the
cauſe, and ſuppoſing no other but the vlcer in the bladder,
he tooke him in hand; and in his hand within few dayes he
left his life, according to my prediction vnto diuers his
friends concerning this ſecond attempt likewiſe ſolicited.
By theſe examples it is manifeſt, both how bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

who precipitate commonly euery one alike, and confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without reſpect or order thruſt all through the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie

how far it behoueth the erected mind of higher contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,

conſideration and compoſition of a medicine and the

in the ordinary and daily difficulties that befall the health,
do plainely proue and demonſtrate. It is not the medicine
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14271:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it ſelfe, but the iudgement and knowledge of the learned,
and right accommodation annexed vnto the wholeſome
medicine, that addeth vnto it a worth aboue it ſelfe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

The Ancients themſelues haue not ſhamed ſo to
do, as Galen in diuers places profeſſeth of himſelfe. Vnto
Apothecaries therefore that faithfully and truly apply
themſelues and their whole indeauor, that haue tried and
experienced skill, and vſe faithfull induſtrie in fitting
wholeſome and incorrupt remedies to attend each honeſt
need and neceſſity without fucation, adulteration or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and containe themſelues within themſelues, no man
can deny a worthy eſteeme both in priuate thoughts and
publike eſtimate; but if the pride and maiſter-ſhip of
the medicine ſtirre once in them the ambition of medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in the former men comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them, ſo in the ſecond
they ſhall iuſtly condemne them: and as in the one ſafely
vſe them, ſo in the other with ſafe diſcretion refuſe them,
fearing leſt with Salomons fly being taken in the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
boxe, they alſo in like manner make a ſtinke of the
medicine,<note place="margin">Hiſtoria.</note> &amp; an end of themſelues. Valleriola mentioneth
an Apothecary who with the imprudent vſe of quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
poyſoned himſelfe. I knew ſometime an honeſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
good Apothecary in Warwickſhire, who imitating
a preſcription of precipitate againſt an inueterate diſeaſe
which he ſuppoſed in himſelfe, exulcerated his guts, and
therefore died. Theſe experiments in other then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
had bene bloudy and vnhoneſt, and in themſelues
rather then in other argue their ſtrong confidence, (which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14271:30"/>
therefore might eaſily ſeduce them to be in time bold
with others.) Example and imitation (which are the rules
of an Apothecaries practiſe) are but patterns of anothers
ſufficiencie. Sufficience therfore being not their owne, it is
ſufficient to put them in mind of their owne. It is good for
euery one to be contented and contained within his owne
liſts, and of his owne ſtore with liberality to lend, and of
anothers with loue and licence to borrow. This vpholdeth
ſocieties and good orders in common weales, maintaineth
mutuall neighbourhood and humanity, friendly and iuſt
commerce with loue and loyall reciprocation, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of euery right to euery owner, with good to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and common, and without hurt to euery priuate
and particular. I ſay nothing of banckrupt Apothecaries,
who hauing left their owne ſtanding become walking
merchants, and with a few pedlarie wares remaining
keepe ſhop in their owne hoſe, or elſe in their guts, who
(wanting other vſe) imagine them ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make cleane

worth good eare: Anno 1607. a Parſons wife of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonſhire,
dwelling within three miles of the towne,
came vnto a Phyſition, complaining of a tumor in one of
her breaſts. He demanded her among many other things
concerning the Sciatica, which he<note n="a" place="margin">Narrata ab aegrotante prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter totius ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laſsitudo partium omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inferiorum cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> menſium reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, coxarum grauitate in motu, torpore dum quieſceret, paratum affectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> monſtrabant.

her. She denied any acquaintance or notion thereof in all
her former life. The ſame night (being returned home) ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
about midnight the Sciatica ſeized painfully and
grieuouſly vpon her. Some few daies after, it happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of her neighbours came alſo vnto the ſame Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
whom (beſide the diſeaſe which ſhe her ſelfe made

and curſorily queſtioned her thereof. She neuer before
ſenſibly knowing any ſuch paine, after her returne alſo
that night ſuffered thereby exceeding torment. Theſe two
accidents compared together by the firſt partie, (the one
in her ſelfe, and the other in her neighbour) and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
being whet by her exceeding paine continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cauſed in her a ſtrong and reſolute opinion of bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
which ſhe preſently vnremoueably imputed vnto
the Phyſition. Her outcries and impatience through her
paine, made ſuch forcible impreſſion in her husband, that
to ſatisfie his wiues vnreaſonable importunacie, he was
contented to come vnto the Phyſition from her to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate.
He, before he could vtter his meſſage, bluſhing at
the folly, and yet deſirous to ſatisfie his wiues iniunction,
becauſe ſhe would not otherwiſe giue him reſt, at length
related vnto him the cauſe of his coming, deſiring him
for his ſake (being much aſhamed thereof) to conceale
the folly of his wife. This done, he returned home, and
found his wife nothing better, but aſſuring her ſelfe and
him, that if he would but once more come vnto the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and (as I coniecture) gaine him to forgiue her, ſhe
ſhould preſently be well. Accordingly the next day he
came vnto him, and (then concealing the reaſon and cauſe
of his coming) deſired him to forgiue and pardon his wife.
This eaſily granted (as ſuch a toy) he preſently demanded
the houre of the day, which inſtantly the clocke gaue two,
being afternoone. He haſtened homeward, and before he
could ſpeake vnto his wife, ſhe ioyouſly entertained him,
and with preuention told him that ſhe was perfectly well,
and that iuſt at<note n="c" place="margin">She was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red late the night before of the Phyſitions being at home that ſame day; ſhe knew the length of the way, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vſuali pace, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

She might eaſily compare the time of his going forth, with a competent time for his attaining the Phyſition, and with all theſe might well hope of the Phyſitions facilitie by his friendly entertainment the day before. From hence her i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination ſatisfying itſelfe with the confidence thereof, ſhe might thereby, ſetling and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſpirits, minde and humors, for a time thus appeaſe and mitigate her paines. As for her ſo true and iuſt coniecture at the time which was two of the clocke, the circumſtances before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and likelihood it ſelfe did guide her to ſuppoſe it. If this reaſon ſatisfie not, religion and reaſons giue leaue farther to ſuſpect, that the diuell to aduance errour and illuſion, might conuey into her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſecret ſence of the time.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14271:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe (it ſeemed) imagined (as it alſo hapned) to haue bene
the ſame time and moment that the Phyſition had giuen
her deſired pardon. The next morning her husband did
write vnto him, diſcouering with this newes the reaſon of
his laſt coming vnto him the day before, together with this
ſtrange euent following it. Within halfe a yeare after, ſhe
fell ſicke againe, and<note n="d" place="margin">After the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, the cauſe and maner of her death by her neighbours of worth and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, at her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſute, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Surgeon, whom fame, it ſeemeth, had magnified for charmed and potent cures of ſuch as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched. The Surgeon deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a medicine vnto the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, promiſing a miraculous cure thereby, and charged him withall, by no meanes to be feared, though haply there might fall out ſome ſtrange and fearfull operations vnto the ſeeming. The medicine with this ſtile coming vnto the patient, was gladly receiued; and after ſhe had receiued it into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſhe died. The glorious name of the medicine, together with a confidence that this was onely the ſtrange operation of the medicine foretold by the Surgeon, cauſed the friends about her ſtill to expect ſome admirable euent of recouerie, and therefore they ſtill gaped after her rpriſing: but in the end neceſſitie called for a graue: and thus their hope with her was buried.</note> died. This ſtrong imagination, with
this ſtrange euent, might haue intangled many a poore
ſpinſter in a thicker ſtring then her cunning could vntwiſt,
to ſaue the cracking of her neck. But if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold more duly
oft examine and weigh theſe caſes, they ſhall many times
find the Witch in a fooliſh ſconce; and greater and more
dangerous are the bewitchings of a mans owne folly, and
more effectuall oft times vnto his owne hurt and others,
then any witch, yea or diuell whatſoeuer. Without doubt
chance may flatter and countenance the imagination with
vnwonted, yea and iuſtly wondered euents, and yet is that
no demonſtration of ought about nature or reaſon. Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie
doth ſo apt oft times conſequences vnto dreames, as
if there were ſome ſecret power or influence in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
vnto ſuch effects, yet is it no proof of truth or truſt
in them. Women oft times out of their<note n="e" place="margin">Aelianus lib. 4. ſcribit Aſpaſiam concubinam Cyri poſterioris admonitam fuiſſe in ſomno de medicamento quo ſanauit vitium oris, quod venuſtatem priùs valdè deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerat.</note> ſleepes haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene

reaſon hath bene true: yet neither is this any diſpoſſeſſion
of themſelues of this ſpirit of folly, nor no iuſt proofe or
accuſation of any one to be a witch. I cannot therfore take
it for an ingenuous courſe, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch grounds to draw ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people vnto confuſion. It is an eaſie matter for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

Therefore ineptly and iniuriouſly may the illuſion of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

I ſee no reaſon why I may not thinke, that the diuell by the
permiſſion of God, hath power indifferently to worke
theſe effects vpon any man, whether a witch or no. For if
he had power for his owne malitious purpoſe vpon the

If the diuell may marke them without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

how ſhall I be aſſured he cannot ſo do? He that can do the
greater, can do the leſſe. He that could giue vnto the Son
of God a view of all the kingdomes of the world in one
inſtant (which was no doubt a ſpeciall ſtraine of his vtmoſt
ſpirituall cunning, conſidering he was then to deale with
wiſedome it ſelfe) can that cunning finde no meanes to
make a ſmall ſcarre, impreſſe or tumor in fleſh? Who
dare preſume to ſay, God will not ſuffer him? Who euer
ſo farre entred into the counſell of God, or meaſured what
therein he doth permit? If no holy writ, no reaſon manifeſt

if ſhe ſuruiued her conuulſiue fits which ſtill remained
as before mentioned. Betweene hope and this feare we
continued endeuour, and in the end by the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God, her fits before mentioned (namely of gaping

It hath bene and is ſtill a great doubt
and queſtion, not onely among the common and vulgar
ſort, but diuers alſo learned, whether this gentlewoman
(in maner aforeſaid afflicted) ſhall iuſtly be ranked among
thoſe vpon whom (by the permiſſion of God) diuels and
witches haue had a power, or whom nature and the courſe
of naturall diſeaſes haue thus in maner aforeſaid afflicted.
My owne iudgement muſt needs incline vnto the latter,
for that I could behold in the gentlewoman nothing
(moſt continually conuerſing with her) which either my
eies had not before ſhewed me in others, or perfect notion
from reading both ancient writings and later neotericall
deſcriptions, had not before made the ſame<note n="l" place="margin">Qui vniuerſale cognoſcit quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo pacto cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcit &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare. Ariſtor.</note> vnto my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
which they then preſented themſelues vnto
my ſight. The firſt is in part teſtified in the margine of the
page 59. 60. and 64. The ſecond, any man may witneſſe true
who can compare the report of all the fits and accidents
which befell this gentlewoman (which as truly and nearly
as I could, and I ſuppoſe fully, by the teſtimony of any that
ſaw her, I haue related) with the ſeuerall ſhapes of ſome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14271:40"/>
diſeaſes before mentioned, pages 59. 60. 61. 62. which are
truly ſet downe according to the common conſent of moſt
writers. The mixture of diuers of them one with another,
muſt needs make ſome difference in them from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
where they are each alone and ſeuerall: but he that
with that iuſt allowance of that oddes onely, can conſider
the particular accidents in the ſpeciall example, with the
true notion of the diſeaſes before it generally deſcribed,
muſt needs grant them to be the ſame in kind and nature.
It may farther perſwade, that my ſelfe with reaſon from the
knowne cuſtome and nature of ſuch diſeaſes, gaue both
by ſpeech and writing, prediction of the conuulſion which
after followed, and alſo of the termination of her<note n="g" place="margin">Saepius enim deprehendeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur repentino lapſu aut depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatione omnis ſenſus &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, comitante difficultate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus &amp; ſtertote nec non rectri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis facultatis functionibus omnino cohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.

of witchcraft, that ſuch medicines as were miniſtred
vnto her, in reaſon good for her, according to that reaſon

immediately with their vſe reducing her vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and by litle and litle euermore repairing continually
ſome decayes, notwithſtanding many and diuers relapſes;
which both her parents themſelues, and the ſeruants, and
all that miniſtred vnto her, muſt needs vnto God and truth
with thankes acknowledge. It farther confirmeth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
of witchcraft, and is not the leaſt, that while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
thereof moſt hotly poſſeſſed moſt hearers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
the parents of the gentlewoman at no time in the
height of their daughters affliction, or a good ſpace after,
could reſolue vpon whom with any iuſt ſhew of reaſon to

among the learned eſteemed are generally reputed three:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14271:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, a true and iudicious manifeſtation in the ſicke of
ſome reall power, act or deed, in, aboue and beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and naturall cauſe. Secondly, annihilation and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wholeſome and proper remedies, with diſcretion
and art adminiſtred, without any iuſt reaſon or cauſe
thereof. Thirdly, ought either in the knowledge or ſpeech
of the diſeaſed, diſcouering a rauiſhment, poſſeſſion or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of their minds or ſpirits by any infernall inſpiration.
Hence the ſicke oft ſpeake ſtrange languages<note n="f" place="margin">Fernelius de Abditis rerum cauſis, lib. 2.</note> vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnknowne, and prophecie things to come, aboue
humane capacitie. To the firſt doth ſatisfie the former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
reference of all accidents befalling the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
mentioned, vnto the preualence and power of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
before related. The ſecond is negatiuely anſwered by
plaine teſtimonies. Of the third and laſt was neuer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor queſtion, nor reaſon of either. There can nothing
be required more vnto ample ſatisfaction: and as I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
reſt and ſtay my ſelfe, ſo I doubt not the conſent and
content of all that affect truth and embrace reaſon. I will
notwithſtanding for the better exerciſing and ſtirring vp
of diligence, circumſpection and vigilance, generally in
this ſo hard and deceiuable point of witchcraft, and alſo
for their ſakes, whoſe weakneſſe may as yet be vncapable
of ſatisfaction in the former particular, anſwer ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
therein made. The forenamed conuulſiue fits, of
lifting vp her hands aboue her head,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> which were the laſt
remaining fits, toward their decay and latter end, neuer
came vnto her but onely when prepared at the night for
bed, and vnclothed into her night-weeds, ſhe began to
yeeld and decline her body to lie downe. In that inſtant,
each night without failing, euer and neuer before began
her fits. When ſhe at any time lay her ſelfe downe to reſt
vpon her bed in her clothes (whether by day or night) her
fits notwithſtanding appeared not. Some haue imagined
ſome coniuration or witchcraft vpon or in her nightcloths
or ſheets; but to them that ſeek reaſon, I ſuppoſe it found.
The power of voluntary motion, which is the animall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14271:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the diſeaſe it ſelfe both poſſeſſing the ſame
parts, namely the ſinewes and muſcles, while the diſeaſe
was in his vigor and ſtrength in the beginning, it therfore
maſtered the facultie and mouing power, and continually
ruled, ſo that the fits then neuer almoſt ceaſſed by day or
night. Now in the declination and weakneſſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
and toward the end, the facultie grew ſtrong, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
and commanded ouer the diſeaſe, whereby all
the day there appeared no fits at all. But when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
power or facultie compoſed it ſelfe to a true and
generall ceſſation and reſt, then in that inſtant the diſeaſe
tooke his aduantage and libertie to ſtirre.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> But why was it
not thus alſo when ſhe ſlept in her clothes? The ſenſe and
incumbrance of the day-habite is euer an hinderance of
perfect ſleepes. Therefore to them that ſleepe in their
clothes, or vpon their beds, commonly there is not ſo true
a ligation of their ſenſes, neither are their ſleepes ſo
ſound, nor of the like continuance. While therefore ſhe
lay or compoſed her ſelfe to reſt in her clothes, the ſenſe
thereof both interrupted the facultie from the true and
ſound diſpoſing it ſelfe to reſt, and alſo thereby put it in
mind of the diſeaſe which had ſo lately ſharply viſited it,
with tart remembrance; and the diſeaſe being now too
weake to reſiſt or to prouoke the facultie, could not vpon
that vnperfect aduantage ſtirre, vntill by a more ſound
and true diſpoſe to reſt and ſleepe, the ſpirits and naturall
heate more truly retiring inward, had more perfectly left
the outward parts, and thereby the diſeaſe there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
might haue more libertie and power to ſtirre,
which notwithſtanding alſo ſoone after of the owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
deſiſted, becauſe it wanted the former ſtrength to
maintain continuance.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> That which breedeth other doubts,
is that at ſuch time when ſhe wanted all her ſenſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſeemed ſenſleſſe of any obiect offered vnto her,
or of it ſelfe occurring, yet had ſhe a curious feeling of
ſuch things as her minde and liking ſought or ſeemed to
hunt after. This is no wonder to them that know where
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14271:41"/>
the imagination intently and earneſtly worketh, it there
giueth ſenſe to thoſe<note n="d" place="margin">Primum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorium omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſenſuum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune eſt. Galen de ſympt. differ.</note> parts it exerciſeth, though all other
parts be ſtupified or aſleepe. This is oft ſeene in many who
in their dreames walke, talk, and do ſeriouſly many works,
diſtinguiſhing and feeling thoſe things whereabout the
fancie occupieth them, of other obiects, though haply
more neare hand and of quicker remembrance, taking no
notice at all. The diſeaſe or accident which moſt oft and
frequently poſſeſſed this gentlewoman, was a kinde of

the ſame reaſon may indifferently ſerue both. It is
farther obiected, that the gentlewoman oft pointed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
this way, ſometime that, as ſeeing the appearance of
a woman of ſuch and ſuch forme and colours, which alſo
according vnto her maner of vnperfect ſpeech, ſhe after
deſcribed, as ſome ſay. It is not vnuſuall with the ſicke oft
to imagine indifferently, as well things inconſiderate
and<note n="f" place="margin">Sicut in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis decipimur inſomnijs, ita vigilantes in ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritudinibus, <gap reason="foreign">

which I thinke before ſufficiently ſatisfied. And in this
gentlewoman (hauing her head, where her diſeaſe had ſo
manifeſtly deeply ſeated it ſelfe, therefore ſo mightily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed)
it was more eaſie for any faculitie therein to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and erre, then to conceiue aright. And therefore
though it might haply manifeſtly appeare (which may be
and is ordinarily rather the abuſiue impreſſion of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreete
<note n="h" place="margin">The mention of her ſuppoſed ſight of the witch, came after the returne of all her ſenſes, and when onely the conuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her armes and face were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Obiect.</note> whiſpering about the ſicke) that ſhe of her ſelfe
primarily and without ſuggeſtion conceiued the forme or
ſhape of a witch, yet is that no ſound proofe or clearing
of the queſtion of witchcraft in generall, nor any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
euidence againſt one particular, ſince the trials of truth
are not ſterred by imaginations. It is laſtly obiected, that
certaine witches lately dying for ſorcerie, haue confeſſed
themſelues to haue bewitched this gentlewoman. I grant
the voluntary and vncompelled, or duly and truly euicted
confeſſion of a witch, to be ſufficient condemnation of her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14271:42"/>
ſelfe, and therefore iuſtly hath the law laid their bloud
vpon their owne heads, but their confeſſion I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
ſufficient euiction of the witchcraft it ſelfe. It is
knowne euidently vnto men learned, that the ſubtill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and deceiuer the diuell doth vſually beguile, delude
and deceiue thoſe that truſt in him by his iugling colluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
perſwading oft times thoſe actions and euents to be
his gratification of their malicious affections, which are
indeed the very workes of nature, and oft times the rare
effects onely of hidden cauſes in nature. A witches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
therefore being onely grounded vpon his credite,
information and ſuggeſtion, whoſe nature, cuſtome and
propertie is and euer hath bene to lie and deceiue, is a
meane, poore and vncertaine proofe of witchcraft, though
a iuſt condemnation vnto the witch, her ſelfe being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
an aſſociate with the diuell in any ſort. Her death
therefore doth ſatisfie the law for her offence, but is no
ſound information of the iudgement of the witchcraft.
Thus according to that whereof my ſelfe could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in this gentlewoman (if more full information of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
obſeruations in thoſe things that by my ſelfe were
not ſeene or noted, faile me not) I haue truly and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
euery materiall accident and circumſtance; and to
all the knowne or conceiued likely doubts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
therein haue carefully and directly anſwered, and
therein alſo haue (I ſuppoſe) ſatisfied the ingenuous and
reaſonable with breuitie at full. Now to conclude the
former explication of the queſtion of witchcraft in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
I intreate the Reader to call vnto mind the formerly
mentioned feares and doubts of witchcraft, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
accidents and diſeaſes eaſily impoſe vpon mindes
herein vnacquainted and not diſcerning their cauſe and
reaſon, and in them farther for future good to conſider the
poſſible contingence of many more of like nature and ſort
in other the like caſes elſewhere hapning, and here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
In both and with both let alſo be recalculate
and caſt the ſtrange and ſlie ſuggeſtions of the fancie and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14271:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imagination, ſometimes countenanced by admired caſuall
euents and chances, ſometimes applauded by ignorant
credulitie, and ſometimes aduanced by ſuperſtition in all
and euery of theſe ſtill with the vulgar ſort, aduantaging
the ſame error and opinion of witchcraft. I haue ſo much
the rather thus farre laboured, for that ordinarily herein
I ſee truth and iudgement too much peruerted, the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their health and life thereby neglected, and many
times ſimple ideots and fooles oppreſſed, whoſe weaknes
doth oft ſeeme guiltie, becauſe euer vnable to defend it
ſelfe. Euery one in theſe caſes is not fit or competent arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
it requireth the learned, and not learned in word
and ſuperficiall ſeeming, but indeed truly iudicious and

ſent for a wiſewoman, &amp; her wiſedome came vnto them.
At the ſame time it fortuned my ſelfe to be in the towne
with a patient of mine, a worthy and vertuous Lady there
inhabiting, who moued me to ſee the bewitched child, and
vpon the motion together with her Preacher then liuing
in her houſe, I went vnto the place where the child lay.
There among other ſtanding ſilent and vnknowne, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the fits, &amp; heard alſo the wiſewoman wiſely diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and among other things of the like nature, declaring
vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, that the lungs of the child were as white
as<note n="c" place="margin">An poſſit ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los tantum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendere Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus?</note> her kercher. With this and ſome other ſuch like ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

vnto my patient, I there profeſſed my opinion concerning
the manner and nature of conuulſions with their ſeuerall
cauſes, amongſt the reſt not omitting the ſtrange accidents
which did oft fall out in ſuch diſeaſes by wormes. Not
long after, when the cunning of the wiſard was now
growne without profite, ſtale and forſaken, the child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
a great and long worme, and immediatly after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
without other helpe or meanes, and ſo hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
euer ſince. Thus the ſerpent beguiled the woman,
and the woman beguiled (though not Adam) many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
ſonnes of Adam. At length a poore worme gaue them
demonſtration of their ridiculous folly. Such teachers are
fitteſt for ſuch ſchollers, whoſe groſſe ignorance is euer ſo
farre in loue with it owne preiudicate conceite, that
though they were brayed in a mortar, yet cannot this
loue be beaten out of them for any loue of truth or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I did not therefore trouble them with my patience
to inſtruct them, nor they moleſt me with their impatience
to heare.</p>

thereof, either by their diſtinct and truly digeſted vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

thirdly, ſuch as haue ſpent moſt part of their life o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
diſtracted, and haue not had entire emploiment

vnto euery one by their imperfect parts ſtamped and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

bounds, and from ſome borowed houres and time for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in phyſicke, grew to affect therein more then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
name and vnderſtanding. In the end his pride and
conceit of his knowledge tranſported him ſo farre, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other ridiculous paradoxes, he both in ſchooles
and common profeſſion defended an indifferencie in the
natures, qualities and vſe of Stibium and Ratsbane: to
conclude, his confidence herein ſo farre bewitched him
that he made triall thereof in himſelfe, and as a iuſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
vpon himſelfe, was the ſame day poiſoned. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14271:46"/>
of my knowledge and acquaintance, a man in the
Greeke, Latine, Hebrew, Chaldey, and other languages
much ſtudied, and in the iudgement and theory of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of approued worthineſſe and vnderſtanding, hauing
therein beſtowed the beſt part of his time, ſodainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
with an vnaduiſed courſe of practiſe in Phyſicke;
he ſpent ſome time in trauell beyond the ſea, and returned
againe thence dignified; but his former ſtudies were ſo
well and ſoundly foreſetled, that they admitted not ſo true
and right after-ſetling of the ſecond. Hence as his braine
ouerflowed with vnconſtant propoſitions, and his tongue
with paradoxes, his actions alſo thereto ſuited. In the end
he made vpon himſelfe an experiment of the force of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium
in a more then ordinary doſe, and ſo compoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto a deſired ſleepe, neuer returned to view the iſſue
of his experiment, but deſcending into the graue, left this
memory behind him. If any man wonder at theſe grand
lapſes in men learned, let him ſtay and ſatisfie his doubt
with admiration of the multitude of ſects in all ages, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

labour after it. For example, in his ſixt booke of aphoriſmes
and 52. aphoriſme, Hippocrates doth nominate a mortall
ſigne in the diſeaſed, the appearance of the white of the
eye in ſleepe, and ſleeping with vncloſed eyes. In many
diſeaſed, this oft is found vntrue, but with Hippocrates
vnderſtanding it is neuer<note n="k" place="margin">Vide Galenu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in praedictum Aphoriſ. &amp; Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauolum in vtroſque.</note> falſe. He that ſimply and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
onely vnderſtandeth, and without meditated diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

ſearch, ſhall hardly truly find the certaine and true limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this truth. For if this maner of ſleeping fall out
from any outward cauſe, or beſides reaſon or cauſe thereof
in the inward diſpoſition, it is not ſimply or altogether
bad, much leſſe mortall. For where the ſicke are thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to ſleepe in health, or ſo ſleep by reaſon of fumes

onely from wormes in children, and the like, the incaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

by the coming of a feauer thereto, the profligation of

Infinite might we be in theſe and the like, euery triuiall
and vulgarly receiued rule requiring a more circumſpect
and conſiderate vnderſtanding, then the firſt view or light
reading doth offer or preſent. It is a common well known
and commendable caution, to ſuſpect phlebotomy in

fiftie or ſixtie yeares. But with what reſtraints and limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

whereby that man whoſe owne iudgement cannot giue

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14271:49"/>
ſhall oft times dangerouſly erre. In aboue 40. yeares
being, I haue now twenty yeares bene an vnderſtanding
obſeruer and partaker of diuers and different medicinall
practiſe, and therein haue oft noted how that which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
hath oppoſed common receiued rule, in the peculiar
proofe of ſome other learned, hath giuen good occaſion
of new diſquiſition of before vnconſidered reaſon or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
in the rule. For a briefe taſte of many, I will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize
ſome few. I haue obſerued in ſome kind of Palſies
bloud taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paralytike ſide, when all other meanes
haue proued vaine, to haue bene the ſole preſent ſuccesful
remedie, yea beyond all hope hath oft reſcued the lateſt
hope out of the iawes of death. This much experience
doth teſtifie, yet is it contrary vnto receiued ancient edict.
In like manner in ſome diſeaſed plethoricall bodies, I haue
obſerued and ſeene, that their generall numneſſe,<note n="a" place="margin">Torpor leuis quaedam Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. Galen. de Sympt. cauſis.</note> torpor
and ſtupidity raiſed in them from the diſtention, compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

deliuery from thoſe accidents with great lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and alleuiation, the oppoſite ſide ſtill continuing in
the former manner oppreſſed and greeued, vntill the ſame
remedy of phlebotomy hath bene thereto likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtoppages of the wombe I haue oft ſeene
when the vſuall bleeding in the foote hath nothing at all
profited, but in vaine wearied the parts thereby fruitleſly
vexed, that the inciſion of a veine in the arme hath imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
opened the ſtoppage, and the former current hath
freely ſtreamed. In ſome kind of dropſies, cachexiaes, or
greene ſickneſſes. I haue obſerued that letting bloud by
excellent fruite and benefite, hath proued the ſuccesfull
remedie, aboue, beyond, and after all remedies. Theſe
things are witneſſed by many worthy teſtimonies, and yet
are generally eſteemed violations of rule. I will not here
diſpute the cauſes and reaſons of theſe things, nor diſquire
how iudgement did guide vnto theſe trials, nor how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
or probably the effects and conſequent followed,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14271:49"/>
or cohered with the iudgement. I will leaue it indifferent
vnto euery one learned, and vnto right perpenſion in iuſt
occaſion of due conſideration hereof. I giue not theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
(as raſh ſuppoſall may imagine) to encourage
Empericall boldneſſe, vnto common imitation hereof, nor
do hereby allow (as ſome not diſtinguiſhing may imagine)
bloud-thirſtie phlebotomy to ſuck mens liues in raſh trial
hereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to proue and manifeſt how neceſſary it is for a
iudicious and orthodox Phyſition, diligently and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his facultie exerciſed according to art, to retaine and
enioy a reſerued power and warranted ſufficiency within
himſelfe, to varie and differ ſometimes from too ſtrict &amp;
ſuperſtitious imitation of a common rule and receiued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.
And from this worth and vertue hath it come to
paſſe, that many learned &amp; famous men, in their ſeuerall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
haue left ſo many worthy additame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnto knowledg
and the common good, by their owne ſpeciall proofes &amp;
trials of rules, in their peculiar practiſe oft different from
vulgar conceit, vſe and cuſtome; vnto whom may not be
denied beyond the ordinary bounds, a libertie and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
contained within the latitude of ſafe diſcretion and
art. And thus briefly both by the vſe of common diſtracted
reading, and thence indigeſted vnderſtanding, and alſo by
the former particular proofes of eaſie deception in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of common rules, and laſtly by examples of practiſe,
it is manifeſted that men otherwiſe, and in other reſpects,
eſteemed iuſtly learned, may inconſiderately &amp; eaſily erre,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſtractedly &amp; deuidedly they employ their thoughts

are ordained ſecond cauſes, which indeed in nature haue
their neceſſitie, but in the will of man haue a power onely

earth, from the ſea, from the land, from the aire, from the

therto, can touch him or once<note n="g" place="margin">Aſtrologoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decreta non sunt praetoria. Ptolomaeus.</note> come neare him. For
whether calamitie approch from aboue or below, from

man by his ſpirit of vnderſtanding, by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and circumſpect prouidence, hath a large immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereby he may and oft doth auoide theſe violences,
and delude their forces. The wiſe man (ſaith Salomon)
foreſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe, neither can any
euill befall the wiſe, which he may not and doth not, either
being to come by prouident foreſight preuent, or preſent
by carefull induſtrie allay, or paſt by diligence redeeme, no
influence or deſtinie being able to bring mans will and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to an higher point then wiſedome and goodneſſe.
This is the reaſon that common calamities befall not all
men alike, yea rather to euery one vnlike. This is alſo the
reaſon that many borne vnder the ſame conſtellation, haue
different fortunes from each other, and farre vnlike their
like conſtellation: nay it is oft ſeene, and cannot be denied,
that many men by their owne induſtrie haue contradicted
their ſtarres, whereby vnfortunately marked in their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities,
they haue triumphed ouer the heauens in the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

by his friends (after my deſpaire of his recouerie ſignified
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14271:60"/>
priuatly vnto them) to call the aduice of a famous Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides-maſter,
who coming vnto him, and not knowing
(and therefore not conſidering his diſeaſe) from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
table of his Ephemerides pronounced, that if the patient
ſuruiued 3. or 4. daies (which we muſt ſuppoſe were of an il
aſpect) vntill the next enſuing Tueſday (which was, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
a fairer influence) he made no doubt of his recouerie
and life. But he ſuruiued three moneths or thereabout, and
in the interim neither did the aforeſaid ill diſpoſed ſtarres
any apparent hurt, nor the wel diſpoſed any eminent good:
but after the forenamed three moneths, the ſtarres brake
promiſe, the diſeaſe kept touch, the gentleman<note n="d" place="margin">Aſtrologi dum coeli ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur plagas, quod ante pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des eſt, nemo eorum ſpectat. Cicero.</note> died. The
reaſon in the diſeaſe was manifeſt: without a new creation
or generation, a part in it ſelfe radically, and in the whole
ſubſtance periſhed, can neuer be reſtored. The diſeaſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not lie, nor all the heauens could performe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a new generation (becauſe the patient could not again
enter into his mothers womb) nor a new creation (becauſe
the world could not againe returne into the old chaos.)
How vainly then did here the Aſtrologer gape and gaze
after vncertaine ſtarres, when the true knowledge of the
diſeaſe, the cauſe and nature thereof (wherein conſiſteth
an infallible ground) manifeſted the certaine iſſue? How
fooliſhly and ignorantly (or ſhameleſly and impudently)
did Aſtrologicall ſimple folly or intollerable impoſture,

and circumuention of ſimplicity and ignorance;
whereof the chiefe vſe is not the benefite of the ſicke, but
the colour of fraud and comodity by deceit. Touching the
oracles of Fortune pretended in the vrine, and their floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fauours in ſo low an ebbe, thoſe that too commonly
in their owne experience find good drinke to ſteale their
wit out of their braine, may haply imagine it thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into the vrine. I leaue them there to ſeeke it, that
want it ſo much, and deſerue it ſo litle. The mention is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
mention. Concerning the looking of vnborne
babes in an vrinarie glaſſe, and the making of old fooles in
loue with their owne reflexion: to vnmaske the common
illuſion in this kind, I will briefly point vnto the diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the folly, whereinto entring their ſerious cogitation
&amp; due recognition, they may more amply after exerciſe &amp;
ſatisfie themſelues, whom their owne fatall ſtupidity doth
not detaine, or reſolute obſtinacie preoccupate. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of women, together with the accidents accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the ſame, do neceſſarily bring forth generall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto the whole body, partly by the conſequent ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14271:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the body, and partly by diſtracting the naturall
heate and ſpirits from other parts vnto that new intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whereby is added either quantitie or qualitie, or both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bloud and humors, and from thence the vrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
different tincture &amp; ſubſtance doth manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the ods. Yet for that this ſodain productio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of change

beſide, &amp; alſo by other diſtractions of the naturall heate &amp;
ſpirits, by criticall intentions, concoctions, &amp; maturations
of diſeaſes; therfore is the confuſed alteration of the vrine
found vpon conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indefinite, &amp; can be no ſpecial note
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception. This is alſo further manifeſted by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and effects themſelues following conception, which
not onely in differing bodies, but in the verie ſame, are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the ſame, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly farre vnlike, yea and oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
at one time from themſelues at another. This women
themſelues in their owne experience muſt needs witneſſe,
ſeldome obſeruing the changes of bodies after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception
in all alike, &amp; oft each in themſelues finding the particular
manners of their owne alteration farre diſcrepant. This
their oft deceit in themſelues, miſtaking, and vncertaintie
in themſelues commonly doth teſtifie, ſometimes ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with child when they proue diſeaſed, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doubting diſeaſes being only with child. Since then
conception is neither in it ſelfe a ſole, nor a ſeparate cauſe,
nor any true immediate cauſe of the alterations of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
following therupon, but onely the occaſion mouing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſes, and thoſe cauſes are as indifferently alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

their generalitie doth diſcharge their proprietie in
this particular, and the common indication in the vrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſpeciall ſignification proper vnto conception alone.

of ſufficiencie, doth oft enter into the rights of better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,

part of his eſſence, but as an ornament, receiuing the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and perfecting of it ſelfe from the eſſence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a foreſetled and continuing vnderſtanding. The

with late repentance. Some bring home more then they
would, ſome more then they ſhould; and all that begin
trauell with raw iudgement, for the moſt part come home
perpetually after drunken with opinion. Different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
aires, people, cuſtomes, manners, zones and climates,
do fruitfully expoſe commodious conſideration vnto thoſe

the reaſon that our common trauelling Phyſitions for the

reſtorer of particular nature, how can he for that end but
become ſcholler and imitator of the generall? For as all
particulars do euer participate the nature and kind of the
generall, and are therein comprehended, ſo beſides that
which vnto euerie indiuiduall nature is ſpecially proper,
there is an eſſentiall<note n="l" place="margin">Species generis, indiuiduum vtriuſque naturam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipat, vtrunque &amp; indiuiduum &amp; ſpeciem genus &amp; facit &amp; comprehendit.</note> propertie in it belonging vnto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:

what God either in heauen or in earth, in the whole
world, or the wide occan, from all the elements or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
things hath ordained for any good or vſe of man.
For as God hath created all things for the good of man, ſo
hath he appointed the Phyſition to fit and accommodate
all things vnto the neceſſitie and need of man, and hath
farther alſo deputed him to ſupply vnto man euen thoſe
things which<note n="g" place="margin">Natura non poteſt aratro boues iungere, nec illorum opera terram ſcindere, arte vtrun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fit. Scalig.</note> nature her ſelfe oft times cannot. Nature

from the fields and mountaines her medicinall herbes,
fruit, wood and plants vnto her owne neceſſitie; but Art
tranſporteth them vnto her at ſeuerall ſeaſons, and for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall

Since then knowledge is the eye and ſight of the mind,
and all knowledge cometh either by the ordinarie light of
nature, or the extraordinarie illumination of the Creator
of nature, whence ſhall the ordinary diſpenſation of mens

doth the generall ſlightneſſe and lightneſſe herein of moſt,
ſprinkle a common diſgrace and ignomie vpon all, caſting
the excellent facultie it ſelfe ineſtimate almoſt behind the
moſt inferiour ſcience. To leaue therefore the proud and
diſdainfull contemners herein vnto the iuſt contempt of
God and nature in his greateſt need, that others deſerue
not ſo ill, and all may learne rather to chuſe the good from

point the inquiſition of the beſt, who though haply rarely
found, yet may the patterne commend the neareſt thereto,
and draw the well deſeruing vnto his ſafeſt choiſe. In all
caſes and ſubiects of election, it is wiſedome chiefly firſt
to ſeeke that is moſt excellent; next, where excellence is
not, prudently to accept mediocritie, but euer knowingly
to auoide euill. The patterne of perfection doth ſhew the
more and leſſe perfect, and manifeſteth the more or leſſe
imperfect, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the fartheſt diſtance is the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and the neareſt affinitie the beſt excellence. Of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie
are many degrees. There is mediocritie aſcending
<hi rend="sup">b</hi> from it ſelfe toward perfection or excellence, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie
