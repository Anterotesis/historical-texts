            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the mean time the Prelates not ſufficiently ſencible of the diſhonour of our gracious Soveraigne, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of theſe happy and Illuſtrious Kingdomes. Nay, beſides all this, many of the late Church-Governours have alſo complyed too much with the Popiſh Faction, and drawn <hi>(quantum in illis)</hi> the <hi>odium</hi> of the late diſturbances upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie (let them pretend what they pleaſe) and diſhonour upon the Proteſtant Religion, in the eyes of the Romiſh party, and the whole world by their tongues, pennes and indeavours.</p>
            <p>May it therfore pleaſe this Honourable Houſe to take Epiſcopall Government into your grave and ſerious Conſideration. And if it may ſtand with the wayes and cuſtomes of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe, That our Petition may be preſented to the Houſe of the Lords, and finally to his moſt excellent Majeſtie.</p>

When <hi>God</hi> viſited <hi>Sodom</hi> in Judgement, he firſt ſent his Angels to inquire of the truth of the crimes thereof.</p>

any moderate ſpirit ſhould deſire the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Government ſo long eſtabliſhed: but if (in <hi>toto compoſito)</hi> there be an univerſall diſſolution and weakneſſe of all parts, that then the old decayed frame may be taken down; and ſuch a new modell propounded as may moſt nearely agree with the Word, the Apoſtles, and Primitive times: with the Aſſiſtance of a ſelect Company of grave pious-learned and Orthodox Divines, in nature of a Nationall Synod, which may be choſen by your ſingular care and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, gathered out of all parts of the Kingdome, and authoriſed for that purpoſe. And in caſe it may ſtand with the pleaſure of his Majeſty, and this High and Honourable Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that ſome <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Divines may be alſo admitted to ſuch Aſſembly, which may happily tend, not only to mutuall information of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to a more firme obligation of all members in theſe Churches in Civill or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall affaires under our moſt gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne as Supreme Governor unto a more firm union and obedience.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, it is not the deſire of your Petitioners, with the Sonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> that fire ſhould come down from heaven and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this frame of Government; neither any illegall or precipitant violence ſhould demoliſh it; ſuch reverence doe we owe to the memory of thoſe induſtrious-pious-learned Biſhops, which have ſomtimes ſealed the teſtimony of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157029:4"/>
with their blood. And to our happie Princes (whoſe Names are ever bleſſed with us) who have yielded all Princely indulgence unto Epiſcopall dignities. Only thus farre do your Petitioners humbly ſue, for aſmuch as there is ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of grievances and complainants, through the whole Kingdome, (as may appeare by the numerous Petitions and Remonſtrances to this Honourable Houſe,) That in the meane time whileſt a Commiſſion iſſues out for a more full diſcovery of Corruptions in Eccleſiaſticall Government and Miniſters, notoriouſly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the above-named Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly be called, and Epiſcopall Governours allow'd a faire and legall tryall by Miniſters, men of their own Order (as Lords are tryed by their Peers) but impartiall, and not ingaged by the dignities and preferments of the times.</p>
            <p>And if it may not ſavor of ſawcines, or too high preſumption, May it pleaſe this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe, to require the Epiſcopall party to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ſome of their own choice to anſwer in ſuch a well conſtituted Aſſembly, and to give liberty to the Presbyteriall Diſciplinaries, as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or them of the Paſtorall and more Independent way, as in New <hi>England,</hi> to come in and oppoſe, only give leave we beſeech you that the Word may be the moderator in this Nationall Synod. And if we may not be thought to preſume upon this intelligent and Religious Houſe, we humbly ſue, Firſt, that in ſuch a well diſpos'd Aſſembly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157029:4"/>
the Doctrine of the Chnrch may be cleared and explaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Diſcipline queſtioned. Firſt by what tenure Epiſcopacie holds, whether <hi>Jure Divino, vel Eccleſiaſtico?</hi> If <hi>Divino,</hi> it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtand for ever. Secondly, if <hi>Eccleſiaſtico</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not alterable according to Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons attending it, or the varying Conſtitutions of particular Churches, or the like conſiderable Circumſtances?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If alterable, whether this Government may ſafely be altered in this Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If it may be altered, what Government can be propounded more nearely agreeing to the Word, and more fit for theſe times?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> left any certaine and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Diſcipline to be obſerved in his Church for ever?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether Examples, which have not grounds on expreſſe Rules, or neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences out of thoſe Commands doe bind the Conſcience to ſubjection, as to an Ordinance of <hi>Chriſts?</hi>

In the meane time moſt noble Patriots, ſuffer not the glory of our Church to ſet under a cloud. We have betruſted you with our ſelves, and all ours, faile us not in the maine, <hi>(viz)</hi> in the matters of Religion, neither Doctrine not Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Begin we beſeech you where your forefathers left, in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> Let the noble bloud of your Anceſtors which runs in your veynes induce you to perfect the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beginnings of your renowned Predeceſſors. Never think the Common-wealth can be well healed, unleſſe the Church be alſo Cured. Did not our ſufferings in the Church lead the way to yours in the Civill State? If you conceive your worke is fully ended, when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths grievances are removed: <hi>God</hi> himſelfe will not take it well at your hands to leave <hi>Sion</hi> weeping, and none comforting her. You have come on nobly and like religious Patriots, in giving faire hopes of eaſing the diſtreſſed part of the Church: Go on like your ſelves, and the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven proſper you. Let not golden Balls turn you out of the way: Neither Syrenian mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, nor Crocodile teares of the degenerate part of the Tribe of Levi captivate your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You have the whole Nation ingaged to be Servants unto the King for ever in a ſtricter bond, if you his great Councell of State, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his truſt in you, ſee Religion freed from the complaints and grievances of it. It is true,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157029:5"/>
Epiſcopal Governors, with their neareſt friends, think it ſcorn to come to tryall of their title. We are not ignorant of many of their choyſeſt Arguments: but if you pleaſe with patience to ſurvey them, you ſhall find they have ſtudied fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies more then demonſtrations. It is true, they pretend 1. the Word: 2. Antiquity. 3. Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Laws. 4. Order. 5. Suppreſſion of Errors, Schiſmes, and Hereſies. 6. Incouragement to Learning. 7. Conformity of Epiſcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment unto Monarchie. All ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we confeſſe, like the Grapes and fruits of <hi>Sodom:</hi> but if you touch them they fall to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Word, no better plea in the world, nor ſtronger Argument, if the pontificiall ſide would ſhew but one expreſſe Command or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inference for Epiſcopacie over the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie (it is our meaning) to be a conſtant and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing office in the Church: we ſhould think our ſelves deſerved to loſe our Eares, liberty, life and all, for ſpeaking againſt a Law of <hi>Gods</hi> own making. But whilſt the great Clerks of the Kingdome in this <hi>multa dicunt, nihil probant.</hi> We muſt deſire this Government (but in an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall aſſembly) may goe to the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Antiquity,</hi> a plea which would well have ſerved in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> for keeping up the High Places, becauſe they had continued from the dayes of <hi>Solomon</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If this Argument were ſufficient, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and Queen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157029:6"/>
               <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory ſhould have ſtaid their hands from taking away ſuch ancient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as had continued many hundred years.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground an old ruinous Houſe which is rotten from the foundation, to the higheſt part of the ſuperſtructure ſhould not be pulled down; upon the like ground old Vines, where the <hi>humidum radicale</hi> is quite gone, and fruit ceaſes, ſhould not be plucked up, nor others plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their room.</p>
            <p>The brazen Serpent was at the firſt erected upon better warrant then ever Epiſcopacie, yet when it grew worm-eaten with corruption of Antiquity, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made bold to take it down, and the fact is fronted with the name of Zeale unto Immortality.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Reference to our Laws,</hi> It is true, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie is too truly and too much Inter-woven with the Statutes of this Kingdome; Not that Epiſcopacie ſtrengthens the Laws, but the Laws Epiſcopacie. So that it ſeems no neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for this dignity ſtanding <hi>Statu quo nunc,</hi> but rather ſerves for a good caution that in the taking down of this old frame, the Statutes of the Land ſuffer no violence, which we doubt not but by the wiſdome of this Honourable Houſe, may be well contrived.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Order,</hi> a great deale of reaſon for it, if <hi>Order</hi> doe not violate that eternall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Rule of <hi>charity,</hi> unto which the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Government hath done much violence,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:157029:6"/>
by their Pride and Tyranny over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their Brethren. In ſuch caſe we deſire the Word, Chriſtian Liberty and Charity may be preferred afore any pretended Order in the the world.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Suppreſſing of Schiſmes, Errors, and Hereſies; we deny not but when Epiſcopacie was firſt rayſed and inſtituted in the Church, there was ſuch a politicke intention, but Where is the Succeſſe? Have not Corruptions, Schiſmes, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, if not Hereſies, more grown under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Epiſcopacie, then under any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Proteſtant Church in the world?</p>
            <p>Let the Remonſtrance of the Miniſters ſpeak unto this, together with the Numerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from all parts of the Kingdome. It is not to be denyed, but as theſe Weeds, ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Corne hath grown within the bounds of Epiſcopall Government, not that we muſt thank the ſmiles and indulgence of the Pontificiall party, but their frowns, brow-beatings, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold oppreſſions, or rather <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, who multiplyed the Iſraelites under <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Encouragement to Learning,</hi> Give looſers leave to ſpeak, let the inferiour Clergie of the Kingdome (as they are uſually called) come in, and ſpeake what they uſually feel in their own experience; Doth not the burthen and heat of the day lye upon poore Parſons, Vicars, Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Curates? What encouragement to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157029:7"/>

               </gap> part of Eccleſiaſticall maintenance, taking little or no paines, in feeding the ſoules of the people, ſtudying only Law-ſuits; how to riſe higher in the world, and to ſowe diſſention betwixt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Princes, and their Subjects, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clergie in the meane time muſt ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſalt, gather up the Crums from under Epiſcopall Tables, and account it favour enough to have a nod from a Biſhop; nay happily leſſe then that, an hollow-hearted leave or Licence to uſe a Pulpit in his Dioceſſe.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, A Conformity of Epiſcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment unto Monarchie. We confeſſe the Conformitie is too much and too neare. For Kings ſend out Writs in their own Names (as it is fit they ſhould) ſo doe Biſhops. Kings Rule and Command, ſo doe Biſhops: yet this Conformity in Government unto Monarchie, cannot induce our Charity to think they (at leaſt many of them) can cordially affect Supreme Government whilſt ſo many in latter times have complyed ſo much with the Pope in all Papall uſages, the great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to all Kingly Government. How can we judge, but if oppertunity ſerved, they would fall in with the Pope in matter of Supremacie, as in other his Traditions; Beſides our Biſhops in late dayes have caſt the <hi>odium</hi> of all unacceptable Commands upon the King, a point of Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft we confeſſe, but never uſed by faithfull

Stateſmen to their Princes, ſince the beginning of the world, till theſe our dayes. Whereas, we (though the loweſt of the Tribe of <hi>Levi)</hi> dare proteſt unto this Honourable Aſſembly, we could be contented to wipe off with our blood the leaſt aſperſion upon the honour of our moſt gracious Soveraigne, whom we ſincerely value above all Princes of the world.</p>
            <p>But now moſt noble Senators, miſtake not, we beſeech you, the candor and ingenuity of our intentions, we doe account it an inexpiable fault to preſcribe unto you that muſt preſcribe Laws to us; only we proſtrate what we have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all hvmility at your feet, wherein we have both expreſſed our grievances and Petitions. Notwithſtanding all aboveſaid, we are not ſo faln out with Epiſcopall Government: but if it ſeems good to his Majeſty, and this High and Honourable Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> to continue it, we can (as formerly) ſit down under the ſhadow of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Authority of it be ſufficiently cleared by a well conſtituted Church Aſſembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we ſhould willingly ſubject, as a way of the Church (anciently uſed) in ſuch difficulties; only, in caſe it be thought meet upon adviſe by your ſingular wiſdomes to continue Epiſcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church; be pleaſed that the ſting therof be taken away: we meane the High-Commiſſion burthenſome and ſuperfluous Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the unneceſſary Ceremonies and ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to their Canons, which they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157029:8"/>
have only uſed as ſnares and nets to catch the Innocent and faithfull in the Land; And the ſcandalous Miniſters removed, the ſpots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of the Eccleſiaſticall State. But in caſe ſuch a Church Synod, or Aſſembly, doe finde a Presbyteriall, or Paſtorall, and independent Juriſdiction to be more nearely agreeing unto the Word, and more fit for the preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Churches, May it then pleaſe you to incourage that way which comes next to the mind and will of <hi>God,</hi> and ſuits beſt with the preſent ſtate of times.</p>
            <p>So that finally, the ſum of all we ſue for, is, that Juſtice may be eminently done unto all ſides, and <hi>truth</hi> (with leave of his Majeſtie, as Supreme) may by the beſt Reaſon hew out its way in a Church Aſſembly or Synod, unto <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity;</hi> not that we any way ſuſpect your Candor or Integritie, with whom we have truſted both our ſelves and all ours: But becauſe the premiſed Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe chiefly fall under Eccleſiaſticall cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, it would be moſt ſatisfactorie (under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of more ſublime judgements) to the minds of all men, and no way derogatory to the honour of his Majeſtie, or this High and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi> If ſuch of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as have not violated their Conſciences, nor ſtaind their garments, but men of good temper, Piety, Learning, and conſulting heads ſhould be authoriz'd to adviſe in the matters of the Church both Doctrine and Diſcipline.</p>

Pardon we beſeech you, our rudeneſſe, and brokenneſſe of our expreſſions, Truth is never ſo amiable as when ſhe goes in her playneſt garb. Honour us ſo farre as not to take us for the giddy Sons of <hi>Apollo</hi> who would ſet the whole world on fire. We abhorre the intemperance of ſuch ſpirits. And doe humbly deſire that all Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets may be ſtaid from the Preſſe, which take upon them (afore their time) to propound mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells and new formes of Government till a well Conſtituted Church Aſſembly have fully diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the maine queſtions now in Controverſie. So ſhall you honour <hi>God</hi> Almighty, bring out the Truth more fully, which is now overclouded and obſcured; perform the Truſt which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath put in you; happily unite more firmly theſe Churches of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Make our State admired in the eyes of forraigne Churches, pull down the proud and mighty from their Seats, and exalt the humble and meek. And by ſuch happy ſatisfaction in all Eccleſiaſticall wayes, you ſhall ingage the Church to pray more fervently for the happineſſe of our Illuſtrious King, and this flouriſhing Common wealth.</p>
