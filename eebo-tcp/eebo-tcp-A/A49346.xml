            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS enſuing Deſcription of the Hogan-Mogan Herd, a hotch-potch of all Sects and Factions, that lately fetch'd in none of the beſt Friends (you may imagine) the King, or the Church had, to ſtand as Members in Parliament for this City, was Writ by an Eye-witneſs of it; one that heard the bleating of the Calves, as plain as the Inhabitants of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> did thoſe of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s, when driven through their Streets.</p>
            <p>And the Deſcription was deſign'd only to turn the Fanatick zeal here into Ridicule; to ſhame the more tender of their reputation (if any amongſt them) for ever appearing again
<pb facs="tcp:39090:3"/>
in ſuch Cabals, and to make the Royal party Merry.</p>
            <p>But the fallen Angels, with their Luciferian Crew, have falſly magnified the Qualities and Quantities of ſuch Cattel, (what tho', I pray ye? ſays my beloved <hi>Hudibras,</hi>

            <p>Of thoſe fiery <hi>Meteors,</hi> thoſe <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that never keep their Stations, that diſparage the Element they move in, and amuſe the Inſipid here below, (on whom alone they have Influence,) leading them out of the ſure paths they are appointed to walk in, by meer Chymaerical jealouſies and fears, which they call <hi>Portenſions</hi> and <hi>Prodigies,</hi> to actuate the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile into Sedition.</p>

            <p>The contempt of theſe men (my Lord) thus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipl'd, made me ſtay at home the other day, when a <hi>Cavalcade</hi> of Fanatical Porters, and other Mercenary

Fellows, mounted on Halliers and Colliers Horſes, rod out to fetch in a rotten Member, who ('tis hoped) will ſcarce hold together till it meets the Body at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> But what ſhould ſuch an old Logerheaded Dunce doe at a <hi>

            <p>Since that, here has been a more numerous but equally ſplendid Regiment of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> to fetch in (and conſequently to diſgrace) our worthy Recorder; here was Colonel <hi>Tagg,</hi> Major <hi>Ragg,</hi> and Captain <hi>Bobb,</hi> in ſhort, <hi>Tagg, Ragg,</hi> and <hi>Bobb,</hi> did each lead up a Squadron: All that could ſuck an Egg of the <hi>Cockatrice,</hi> all that were hatch'd from theſe Eggs, and brooded under the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Petticoats; all that could peep, and all that could run of that race, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their reſpective Maſters of their Service the while; and footed it to mend the Muck-heap.

(my Lord) had you ſeen 'em ride! you would have taken them ſingly for ſo many <hi>Centaurs,</hi> and altogether for a <hi>Covy of Witches,</hi> mounted upon anointed Broom-ſticks and Fire-ſhovels at an appointed Rendevouze, by their Grand Maſter the Devil.</p>
            <p>'Tis too long (my Lord) for a Letter to deſcribe either their perſons or their parts. <hi>Zancho Pancho</hi> pickeering upon <hi>Roſinante</hi> in <hi>Don Quixot</hi>; and <hi>Ralpho</hi> riding to the Slaughter of the Fidles and the Bears in <hi>Hudibras,</hi> are too gentile and learned for a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, tho' they come the neareſt to them (I confeſs) in Story. For thoſe Squires could reade we hear, but the Devil a one of Three hundred in this Farce could tell a Letter of the Book; and I am informed it was more for fear than love that this illiterate Crew atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, leſt he ſhould uſe them (they ſay) as he did their Coſin <hi>Bromfield,</hi> who he ſerved right enough (for being their Kinſman) when he hang'd him in this City, becauſe he could not ſay his Neck Verſe, as was pretended, tho' the more Judicious ſay there was <hi>Emulation</hi> in the caſe; for this <hi>amorous Bromfield</hi> (you muſt know) was an Ingroſſer of Fine Women,

and two of a Trade can never agree, according to the old <hi>Greek</hi> Diſtick, as aptly apply'd as engliſhed;

            <p>Thus was this noble Knight, Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> attended into the ſame place, and by ſome of the ſame Perſons that had formerly uſher'd in <hi>James Nayler,</hi> the <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiſt,</hi> with triumphant <hi>Hoſannahs</hi>; and marcht hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (poor Gentleman) as much aſhamed of his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage (I warrant ye) as the great <hi>Godfry of Bullen</hi> when he went to the holy War: Where the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> obſerves, that Thieves and Murtherers took upon them the <hi>Croſs</hi> to eſcape the <hi>Gallows.</hi>

            <p>But in all this excellent Proceſſion, where every individual Devil carried his peculiar Croſs, to the eternal praiſe of thoſe that love, honour, and obey the King, and the Church, as it is now eſtabliſhed by Law, there was not one ſuch perſon ſeen amongſt them.</p>
            <p>And now to undeceive the credulous, let them know that <hi>Briſtol</hi> has at length ſhaken off her Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fetters, which hitherto have hung as Lead on the heels of her jollity, and dull'd her motion, and is fled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Loyal Feathers, (into an activity) that will carry her above the reach of thoſe <hi>Vermin,</hi> whoſe Habitations are in holes and naſty corners, that never crawl out but to doe miſchief, and then skulk again into obſcurity, hating the light without them becauſe their deeds are evil.</p>

            <p>I beg your Lordſhips pardon for this rude diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and remain (as every honeſt man ought to his Dioceſan)</p>
