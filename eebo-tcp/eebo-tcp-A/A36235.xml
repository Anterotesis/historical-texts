            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not to be expected this whole following
Diſcourſe to be all new, ſince the neceſſity
of making it to appear rational, compells
me to a recital of many things as well
known unto others as my ſelf; and ſo to
uſher your judgements to approve of it as
reaſonable, (which the whole Level as an
intire argument doth perſwade) I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
no other cure for her preſent Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
then what Nature her ſelf hath appointed for a Remedy.</p>
            <p>And, in the firſt place to acquaint you with the Circumference
and Quantity of Ground I am to treat of; and likewiſe to acquaint
you with the Soyl, or Earth we are to work upon, and then the
ſeveral Rivers and Rivilets which fall into, and run through this
great Level, and how the unruly Tides do beat back our Freſhes
into our boſoms, when they are poaſting to the embraces of their
Mother the Sea.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not divide this great Level into piece-meals, but as my
induſtry, and thirty years Experience and more hath taught me, I
ſhall give you the Deſcent of each part of it, as it is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to the Sea, as alſo thoſe Rivers which Nature hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to conduct the ſupernumerary Waters to it; and then I ſhall lay
down the Rules, and way for the perfect Draining of this great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98959:6"/>
Level, and at a ſmall charge, and to take off all hazzards of being
drowned for the future, and alſo the vaſte expences of yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs,
whereby will eaſily appear the great advantage which will
accrew to his Sacred Majeſty, the Honourable Corporation, and
to the whole Countrey, reſolving as much brevity as the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſo important an affair may permit.</p>
            <p>The Circumference beginning at Saltors Load in Norfolk,<note place="margin">The Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</note> and
ſo by the hard Lands of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeſhire, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtonſhire,
Northamptonſhire, and Lincolnſhire to Croyland,
and ſo to South Ea Bank, to their Drain to Tidgoat, from thence
to Wisbidge, ſo to Well, and to Saltors Load again; which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
contains at the leaſt 120. miles, within which lieth at the
leaſt 400000. Acres of good Land, if once perfectly drained.</p>
            <p>The Soyl or Earth is generally a black or red Moor,<note place="margin">The Nature of the Soyl or Earth.</note> the black
Moor is naturally a rich Soyle, the red is not ſo ſtrong; but both
the red and black being laid dry, becomes a perfect black mould,
and good Soyle: witneſs Thorney Fenns, and all others which
have lien dry for ſome years paſt. The Soyl is good and profitable,
and lyes in moſt part of the Fens a foot deep, and in ſome places
more, though Nature and Art have taken their way through the
worſt of our Fens,<note place="margin">Morton's Leam and Bedford River.</note> I mean the two Rivers of Morton's Leame,
and Bedford River, (the laſt made by the Right Honourable <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and the firſt by that Reverend and Learned
Prelate Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> were the two moſt famous Works as ever

the banks being made of this light Moor,<note place="margin">The light Moor not good for banking.</note> (which could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be avoided) which now being rotten with long lying dry, hath
loſt its tufneſs, and is become a light black mould, and yields to
thoſe waters lying on the banks, and makes the banks meer water,
by which means they have loſt their former ſtrength to withſtand
a reaſonable Flood.</p>
            <p>To and through this great Level runneth certain Rivers and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilets,<note place="margin">The River Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land excepted in this Deſign.</note>
I exclude the River Welland, as not to meddle with it in this
Deſign; and thoſe which I call Rivers, (which we have to deal
withall) are new Nean, <hi>alias,</hi> Morton's Leame, Bedford River, and
great Owſe: The River Nean is very conſiderable, it runs out of
Northamptonſhire, and brings many Rivers and Rivilets which
fall into it; and with reaſon we may believe Northamptonſhire to
be the higheſt County in all England, there being no River which
runs into it, but many which run out of it Eaſt, Weſt, North, and
South.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98959:6"/>
Bedford River is equal with Nean,<note place="margin">Bedford River.</note> and brings with it all thoſe

Rivers of great Owſe and Morton's Leam, which upon neceſſity
muſt drain the Countrey; but if Morton's Leam and great Owſe
cannot be brought to run ſo low, as to gain a Draught into them,
we cannot be perfectly drained: but this without all doubt may be
effected.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Fens and Grounds which lye on the Eaſt ſide of great
Owſe in Norfolk and Suffolk,<note place="margin">The deſcent of the Fens on the Eaſt ſide of great Owſe.</note> with Sohame Fens, Swaffam Fens,
Ditton, Burwell Fens, Iſeſam, Milnall, Whelps Moor, and the
Fens of Feltwell have their Deſcent Weſt to the River Owſe, but
is little or nothing. Yet there is no doubt but to gain theſe Rivers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98959:7"/>
two foot fall into the River Owſe, and that Sohame Meer ſhall
never come within four foot of its former height in ordinary
Floods.</p>
            <p>For beſides the Sock, and down-fall into this Level, we have
three conſiderable Rivers which runs through it into the Sea.<note place="margin">Three conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rivers run through the Level</note>
Morton's Leame, whoſe way is through Wisbidge, and ſo into the
Waſhes, and Bedford River, and great Owſe, which joyn together
at Saltors Load,<note place="margin">The Deſign of former Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</note> and run intire to Lynne, and fall into the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Waſhes. There hath been great induſtry, and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
expended in making of great and vaſte Banks to keep thoſe
Rivers within their Bounds, and to carry our Freſhes to run at that
height as to ride the Tydes; and this hath been the Deſign of all
the Undertakers ſince Lyn Law was firſt made: but if ever they
had found the Deſcent (which they hoped for) the Tyde (their
greateſt enemy) could not then have poſſibly prevailed to flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the very Center of this great Level every twelve hours,<note place="margin">The Tide a great enemy.</note> though
the late made new Rivers do run high by reaſon of the imbanking
and the flux of the Tyde.</p>
            <p>One other enemy (though not ſo dangerous) to this great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,<note place="margin">Want of Freſhes a great enemy.</note>
is, the want of Freſhes in the Summer to water the Grounds
and Cattle,<note place="margin">The light fuzzy Moor to make Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks withal, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other enemy.</note> and to ſcour the Out-falls. And the other enemy is
the fuzzy light Moor to make Banks withal, which mooriſh Earth
hath deceived all the worthy Undertakers from the beginning, and
therefore is not to be truſted any more.</p>
            <p>Neither is it without reaſon, that thoſe three I laſt named are
ſuch obſtacles to the perfecting of this great work of Draining this
Level.<note place="margin">Reaſons why the Tyde is an enemy to Draining.</note> For if we conſider the Floods which fall down into this
Great Level, intending for the Sea, which for want of deſcent
cannot run quick, and the Tyde every twelve hours meets our
Freſhes, and beats them back; the Tyde by reaſon of his great
aſcent at Sea, flowes quick into the very bowels of our Fens, ſo
far as above Welney upon Bedford River, which is no leſs then
eight and twenty miles from the Sea: And likewiſe it flowes above
Guy-heirne in Morton's Leame into the midſt of our Fens; and it
muſt be confeſſed the Tyde flowes into us three hours and an half,
and we allow four hours for the ſame quantity of water to ebb
back again, ſo that at the moſt we have but four hours and an half
in twelve hours, to run out our Freſhes which drown us.</p>
            <p>Thus the Floods increaſe in our Rivers between the Banks,
and riſeth, and lieth on them at a great height, and as I have ſaid,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98959:7"/>
theſe moory Banks will deceive all that truſt in them: It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that the moor Earth is tuff ſo long as it lies wet, but is
good no longer then till it is rotten, and that it will be if it lie
dry four or five Summers,<note place="margin">Reaſons againſt the Banking with light Moor.</note> and then it ſinks, and becomes a light
black mould; and if it chance that a Flood lie upon it but three
or four dayes, it ſoaks in the water and becomes ſobbed, and is
neither Earth nor water, and then it leaves you when you have
moſt need of it, and drowns the Fens more, then if there were
no Banks at all.</p>
            <p>The third enemy is the want of Freſhes in the Summer, which
doth not onely make the Countrey, and the Cattle miſerable,
but the Out-falls will be deſtroyed for want of water to ſcour
them in dry Summers:<note place="margin">Reaſons why the want of Freſhes is a great enemy to Draining.</note> Nor would I have the late dripping
Summers be an encouragement, that the Out-falls are ſo good
that there is no cauſe to fear them, (may they alwayes continue
good I wiſh) but if the Out-falls once fail, it will be a greater
inconvenience then the breaking of a Bank onely, my fear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is juſt enough; In a dry Summer you have none, or very few
Freſhes, either by the River Morton's Leame, or great Owſe,
and ye are ſure to be viſited with the Tyde every twelve hours;
and then I may tell you, if you have Northernly windes, you
will have ſuch foul waters from the Sea, that quickly will lodge
up your Out-fall at Wisbidge, and Lyn, by reaſon your Rivers
in thoſe places are wider then they ought to be, (which may be
helped by this my Deſign) ſo that the Flux and Re-flux of the
Sea, doth not grinde but feed.</p>
            <p>The River Owſe which hath its Out-fall at Lynne,<note place="margin">The River Owſe much obſtructed with ſhelves of Sand below Lyn.</note> is for
ſome miles at Sea below that Town much obſtructed by ſeveral
ſhelves of ſands, which are moveable as the winde and ſea for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
them; and yet the winter Chennels are kept by the winter
Floods; but in Summer our want of Freſhes or Floods make us
not able to maintain our winter Chennel, and ſo we loſe it till
our firſt Floods in November (or thereabouts) can gain their
own Chennel again; in the mean time all our Banks and Works
are in great danger, and the poor Countrey-man in hazzard of
utter ruine, and the Navigation of Lynne very uncertain and
dangerous; the ſame hazzards in all reſpects are in the River
of Wisbidge through the Waſhes to the Sea.</p>
            <p>And now to prevent theſe dangers, and to make our
Fens and Level ſecure, without truſting to the hazzard of our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98959:8"/>
Out-falls without us, or the breaking, or the ſinking of the
Banks within us, the taking away all thoſe great charges of
maintaining and repairing all thoſe Banks made to hold up our
In-land Floods at ſuch a vaſt height as to rid the Spring tides
(as I have ſaid before) I dare be bold to ſay, that twenty years
hence for want of Earth at a reaſonable diſtance, the Banks
will coſt more in one year then now they do in four; I wiſh
the Charge of thoſe Fen Lands may not exceed the Profit, as
ſome of them have already done, and much good Land without
the Level in likelihood to come into the ſame condition if not
prevented.</p>
            <p>When I was DIRECTOR, I would have cut through Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-gate
to the Horſeſhooe at Wisbidge,<note place="margin">Murrow-gate cut to the Horſeſhooe at Wisbidge.</note> which would have
coſt leſs then the widening of that River, and there to have
fallen into Wisbidge River cloſe to the Apron of that gallant
Sleuce then ſtanding; and ſo far I had (as I did then believe) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Adventurers to conſent unto, and they at a general
meeting at Wisbidge 1649. did make a perſonal view of the place,
and found what I affirmed to be truth; and this River I would
have compleated by reaſon of the great benefit it would have
been to all the North-ſide of Wisbidge, and other parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
to drain them, and a certain Slaker in all Floods to eaſe
Morton's Leam and all the Banks upon it upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>Then take the River Owſe,<note place="margin">The River Owſe and Morton's Leam made to run quick below Downham and Wisbidge.</note> and all the Branches which fall
into it before it come to Downham-Bridge, and likewiſe caſt
your eye upon the River called Morton's Leam as it runs at the
Horſeſhooe below Wisbidge, to meet there with my new River
that is to be made through Murrow-gate; and this is the firſt
part of my Deſign, to bring all our Floods and Freſhes to run
quick below Downham, and Wisbidge.</p>
            <p>In the next place, to give more particular ſatisfaction, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but all rational men will grant, and allow, that if by
this Deſign, thoſe two conſiderable Rivers of great Owſe, and
Morton's Leam, can be be brought to run all the year, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hour of the year, in two great Rivers at Downham-Bridge,
and Wisbidge-Bridge, notwithſtanding the Spring Tides or
the Ebb Tides; they muſt needs confeſs that they then believe
they ſhall be perfectly drained, yet they cannot believe this can
be done,<note place="margin">The Tide ſtopped</note> but that the Tide muſt be ſtopped; and it is true, and
good reaſon for it; which as I ſaid before, flowes into us every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98959:8"/>
twelve hours into the midſt of our Fens, and flowes no leſs
then three hours and an half, or four, and then four hours to
ebb back again, ſo ſhall we have not above four hours in twelve
for our Freſhes to run out of the Level.</p>
            <p>But it is intended, and will be made good by this my Deſign,
the Freſhes ſhall run quick all the year, and every hour of the
year, at Downham-Bridge, and Wisbidge, if they may have
leave by a Sleuce below them ſome miles diſtant; and though
I name this laſt,<note place="margin">The great Sluce to be at German-Bridge, or near Magdelen in Norfolk.</note> yet it is the firſt thing to be perfected, that is
by a ſubſtantial large Sleuce made at German-bridge, or Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in Norfolk; and near unto it one Soſs to maintain Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
from Lynne to Cambridge, Wisbidge, and to all other
places formerly uſed into the adjacent Contreys: And this being
once ſubſtantially performed, the whole work of Draining is in
a manner perfected.</p>
            <p>And as for the River of Wisbidge, and the Slaker through
Murrow-gate,<note place="margin">A new River to be cut through Marſland.</note> I carry them joyntly in a River through Marſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
from the Horſeſhooe to the great Sleuce at German-Bridge,
or near Magdelen, by ſufficient Banks of good ſollid
Earth; then have I ſufficient water way for all thoſe Freſhes to
the Sea, which will force good Navigation, and maintain the
Chennel Winter, and Summer, to the great benefit of all thoſe
Sea men which uſe that Port of Lynne; and all the Rivers in
and out of the Level will be much bettered, and improved.</p>
            <p>As for the ſleighting any Banks upon Bedford River,<note place="margin">No Banks to be ſleighted.</note> or
Morton's Leam,<note place="margin">A ſmall new bank at Guy-heirne.</note> or to make new ones, (except a ſmall one at
Guy-heirne) it is no part of my Deſign, but I do wiſh thoſe
Banks which are upon Bedford River and Morton's Leam,
had not been placed at ſo great a diſtance one from another.</p>
            <p>And as for the Soſſes at Stanground,<note place="margin">The Soſſes at Stanground, Erith Well, &amp;c. are uſeful.</note> Erith, Well, and others,
they are of ſingular good uſe, yet I do affirm, there will be a

Navigation to Cambridge is loſt,<note place="margin">A Soſs and Sluce at Ditton.</note> by reaſon the waters will be
ſo low both Winter and Summer in the River Owſe, that the

            <p>The like it will be with Morton's Leam from Guy-heirne to
Peterborough,<note place="margin">A Soſs and Sleuce to be made at Guy-heirne.</note> otherwiſe it will not be alwayes navigable either
Winter or Summer, unleſs we keep the waters in the new Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98959:9"/>
alwayes.<note place="margin">The uſe of that Sluce, and of that at Murrow Plaſh.</note> This Sluce, and that at Murrow Plaſh, commands the
River through Wisbidge, and that through Murrow-gate with
your new River through Marſland, by the help of the great
Sluce and Soſs at German, that if need ſhould require, would
lay the very ſoles dry, inſomuch that at all times you drain the
North-ſide of Wisbidge,<note place="margin">North-ſide of Wisbidge drained with the Smee, and the great Common in Marſland.</note> and parts adjacent, the Smee, and the
great Common in Marſland: neither will there be any need of
raiſing the Bank from Guy-heirne to Bevis-hall, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the North-ſide of Wisbidge, whereof many complaints
have been made; for here that great River will run low in a
great flood with great ſwiftneſs.</p>
            <p>One other ſmall work I would do,<note place="margin">A ſmall Cut from Owſe to Little-port Chair.</note> which is a Cut from the
River Owſe near Ely, to the Chair at Little-port, which will
be about three miles, and this I would make fifty foot wide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Banks; this is to help old Owſe to take off a ſudden flood,
which otherwiſe will hang long upon Water-beach, Swaffam
Fens, the Phillips, Stretham, and other Grounds adjacent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſhelves, and ſtops in the River Owſe are taken away.</p>
            <p>Croyland had alwayes Navigation into Norfolk, Suffolk,
and Cambridgeſhire, and all other parts of this great Level, and
from thence to Boſton, Lynne, and unto the City of York,
which is now obſtructed. I mention this place, by reaſon I
know it is very eaſie to make from this Town good Navigation
to Stampford,<note place="margin">The benefit of Navigation through Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> to the great benefit of that Town, and Countrey,
likewiſe to Boſton, Lynne, and other parts; the Honourable
Earle of Bedford is no ſmall loſer for want of this Navigation
through this Town of Croyland into the River Welland, and
his Tenants at great charges to cart their Corn and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to the River Welland, and elſewhere, to the dammage
of the Earle, and his Tenants, I do verily believe Five hundred
pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> But I ſhall ſay no more to this, but I know
the want of Navigation makes many Towns poor, and the
having of it makes many Towns and Countreys rich; and the
making of this Navigation good is performed at a ſmall and
inconſiderable charge,<note place="margin">Great Benefit to Thorney Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> and without any danger of drowning of
Thorney Grounds (as ſome have alledged) but will prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to all that part of the Countrey in a dry Summer.</p>
            <p>And as for Sheir-Drain I have no intentions of ſleighting it,<note place="margin">Sheir-drain not to be ſleighted.</note>
it is good to convey freſh waters into the Countrey, and of

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98959:9"/>
It may now be conjectured what my Deſign is for the perfect
Draining this great Level; and leſt I ſhould be miſtaken, I
will farther expreſs my ſelf: It is to cauſe our Waters and
Floods to run low and quick in our two great Rivers of Owſe
and new Morton's Leam; for if once theſe two great Rivers be
brought to run low, the Fens cannot be drowned, nor can any
other River or Rivelet in our Fens run high.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, as for the Dimentions of theſe new Works I have
named, and what water way I would make both in the new Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and through our new Sleuces, I ſhall give you particularly;
and in the cloſe of this Deſign, I ſhall give you my Reaſons, and
ſhew you the Benefit, the King, Kingdom, Undertakers, and the
Countrey will receive by this my Deſign, and way of Draining.
And likewiſe give you my Anſwers to divers Objections that
are, or may be made, either out of peeviſhneſs or ignorance,
ſelf-ends or malice, whereby to obſtruct the carrying on ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a work, as the perfect Draining this great Level.</p>
            <p>The River through Marſland from the Horſeſhooe at Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge
to German-Bridge,<note place="margin">The Dimenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the River through Marſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> or near Magdelen in Norfolk, will
be in length about eight miles; I make this River ſix foot deep
to a perfect ſole quite through: likewiſe I make it eighty foot
wide, yet inclining wider toward the new Sleuce, to help the
Draught of this River. I leave Foreland to this Bank to the
River-ward twelve foot, the ſeat of this bearing Bank ſhall be
five and forty foot; I leave Forelands of this my bearing Bank
to the Land-ward eight foot; the two In-drains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I make both
of them eighteen foot wide, and ſix foot deep; by which
means I gain good firm Earth out of the River, and the two
In-drains, to make my bearing Bank twelve foot high from the
ſuperfices of the Soyl, and ten foot broad on the top of the
Bank, which being flagged to the River-ward muſt needs
grow well.</p>
            <p>As for the Slaker through Murrow-gate I held it alwayes
very neceſſary,<note place="margin">The Slaker through Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-gate.</note> by reaſon the River of Wisbidge was and is ſo
full of ſhort Angles, and every ſhoulder of thoſe ſhort Angles
checks our Freſhes running to the Sea, and that ſmall neck of
that River at Guyheirne too hard to be found by ſuch a ſea of
Freſhes between thoſe Banks to Whittleſey, that the waters
grope the way to finde that ſmall quill to creep out at; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I make from Guyheirne to Murrow-plaſh, which is two

miles,<note place="margin">A ſingle Bank from Guyheirn to Murrow-Plaſh, 2 miles.</note> one ſingle Bank, which is on the South-ſide of that
Bank that now is to Murrow-plaſh, to ſtand with it equal in
height, and that old River to be bottomed ſix foot to raiſe
that Bank to the Plaſh, and to have there a convenient Sluce
with ſufficient water-way into our Slaker in Murrow-gate; this
River or Slaker from Murrow-plaſh to the Horſeſhooe is about
four miles and an half:<note place="margin">The river from Murrow-Plaſh to the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhooe, four miles long, ſix foot deep, fifty foot wide.</note> I make this River fifty foot wide and
ſix foot deep to a perfect ſole throughout; I leave Foreland
to each Bank to the River-ward ten foot, the ſeats of thoſe
Banks to be forty foot each; the Foreland from the Seat of
the Bank to the Land-ward, ten foot each; the two In-drains
fifteen foot each,<note place="margin">The dimention of the Banks.</note> and ſix foot deep. This is all ſollid good
Earth as Marſland, and will raiſe the Banks to ſtand at eight
foot high from the ſuperfices, and ten foot broad at the top:
There will be no haſte of this work, till the Banks above be ſunk
to about five foot high; and till then the North-ſide of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge
hath no good Drain.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Rivers leads us to the new Sluce at German-Bridge,<note place="margin">The new Sluce at German-Bridge.</note>
or near Magdelen in Norfolk; and I conceive moſt
are at a ſtand in their Judgements, as believing this not eaſily
to be performed, yet tacitely do allow, that if this can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to be a durable work, the Countrey then muſt needs be
Drained: Yet for better ſatisfaction of thoſe which doubt, it
will not be unneceſſary to take the judgements of able, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Artiſts, and good work-men, ſo to underſtand their ſenſe
of the feaſability of this work: <hi>viz.</hi> This Large Sluce, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable

known, and ſeen in the like Works.</p>
            <p>The ſoyl,<note place="margin">The Soyl for the new Sluce to ſtand upon.</note> and foundation whereupon this large Sluce, and
Soſs is to be placed, is very good, being a firm and ſollid clay,
or galt, which is not to be found for that purpoſe elſewhere;
and our materials are moſt of them by us,<note place="margin">The Materials for the new Sluce where to be had.</note> as Brick, at Ely and
Saltors Load; at Ely and Reach, Lime plenty and cheap enough;
good ſeaſoned Oak Planks and Timber in Norfolk and Suffolk;
and good Deal Timber at Lynne, and Iron, as good, and as
cheap as elſewhere; and there is nothing wanting except Tarras,
of which we muſt uſe in this Work good plenty, and this is to
be had at Dort or Roterdam much cheaper then here: at Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough
and Ely, rough Stone for our Foundation and
Fillings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98959:10"/>
Now I have brought you to the Materials, with which you
are to make this Sluce, and Navigable Soſs, now follows the
Dimentions of them both.</p>
            <p>The Sluce I divide into four and twenty Arches,<note place="margin">The Dimenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the new Sluce.</note> each Arch
containing ſeven foot in wideneſs for the water-way; the ſole
of theſe Arches ſhall lie level with the ſole of Great Owſe at
German-bridge, or near Magdelen; the Foundation under the
ſole of thoſe Arches ſhall be four foot deep; the Supporters or
Peires between each Arch, or Water-way, ſhall be ſix foot thick,
made of good Brick, and other good Stone, for that purpoſe;
and the outwardmoſt Bricks to be laid in Tarras and Lime;
theſe Arches for the Water-way are made ten foot high from
the ſole, beſide the Crown of the Arch, and ſo built, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above to what height and weight may be thought fitting.</p>
            <p>The bredth of this Sluce compoſed of four and twenty
Arches, from their Butting upon the River Owſe, to the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the new River which runs to it through Marſland,
ſhall be forty foot, beſides the Apron to the River Owſe, and
the Apron to the new River of Marſland.</p>
            <p>To finiſh this Sluce,<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the finiſhing this great Sluce.</note> there muſt be four and twenty double
Gates to Sea-ward, to play with the Tide when need ſhall
ſerve; but theſe cannot play but with leave of the Fall-gates,
which are eight foot broad, and ten foot deep; all thoſe Fall-gates,
or ſo many of them as ſhall be needful, according to the
Floods which are coming down, are drawn up, and then our
Gates to Sea-ward play to run out our Floods. In Winter, by
reaſon of the great Floods, they may all play; and in Summer
Droughts one may be ſufficient to do the work, ſo uncertain
are our Waters, yet ſhut themſelves at the riſing of the Tide,
or Back-water, and Butt in the bottom againſt the ſoles of the
ſeveral Arches, and Butt on the top as well as on the ſides
they hang on; and theſe Gates are to be ten foot high, yet the
Spring Tides will over-top them five or ſix foot, but cannot
hurt us, but make us ſtronger. In this Sluce you have Water-way
an hundred ſixty eight foot in bredth, and ten foot in depth;
this Sluce will vent more Water then will ever come to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it.</p>
            <p>Your Soſs for Navigation muſt be placed twenty Poles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this Sluce,<note place="margin">The placing of your new Soſs.</note> for if it ſtand in it or near it, it cannot be uſeful
at all times, by reaſon of the great force and ſtream of water at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98959:11"/>
the Sluce in a flood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Cut which leads from the new river
to the Soſs muſt be twenty Pole before the Sluce, leſt that
coming too near the Sluce, the great Draught of the River
there may force down the Veſſels to the Sluce, and there they
muſt either break or ſink.</p>
            <p>The Soſs may be made as large as you pleaſe, to hold ten
or twelve Boats at a time,<note place="margin">The great uſe of a large Soſs.</note> and the charge not much more then
though it were made for two or three Boats, ſeeing we ſhall
not need to fear the loſs of waters. I do wiſh the Soſs may be
made large, for there is no queſtion but Navigation will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
within us, being it is ſo feizable to be made to Stampford
in Lincolnſhire, to Rockingham in Rutlandſhire, and to Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
in Bedfordſhire.</p>
            <p>As for your Sluces at Ditton, at Croyland, at Murrow-Plaſh,
at Guyheirne, with that ſmall Cut which I deſire may be made
at Littleport Chair, theſe are but ſmall Works, and will coſt
but little money; I have given the reaſon for them, and the
great uſe of them before.</p>
            <p>One thing more I ſhall adde to what I have already ſaid, The
Slaker through Murrow-gate is four miles and an half long,<note place="margin">The Dimenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rivers.</note>
and it is fifty foot wide; Wisbidge River from Guyheirne, with
the new River to German-Bridge, or near Magdelen, is twelve
miles long, and eighty foot wide; Great Owſe from Saltors
Load to the ſame Sluce at Germans is eight miles long, and
an hundred and twenty foot wide; theſe Rivers being joyned
all together make a goodly Indraught, as well as Rivers, at your
very Out-fall, all of them bound in with gallant Banks of good

            <p>This was the DESIGNE I would have finiſhed in the Year
1649. when I was DIRECTOR.</p>
            <p>But it will be Objected,<note place="margin">This was the Deſign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1649.</note> that the former Works I mention
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98959:11"/>
will coſt much money; I ſhall anſwer to this, and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
but this firſt, becauſe it concerns the Adventurers
which lay out the money.</p>
            <p>If that the old and new Adventurers have laid out in the
Draining of this Great Level,<note place="margin">Several Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> theſe thirty years and more, five
or ſix hundred thouſand pounds, and if they believe this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and theſe Works will perfect the work of Draining, ſurely
then they will lay out one whole years Rent and an half to make
all their moneys good, and free themſelves from ſuch vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
which will be ſwallowed up in the yearly Repairs of
thoſe uncertain Banks.</p>
            <p>If this Deſign, being perfected, doth take away all fears as
well as future charges, and bring the Level into repute and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
it will be worth their expences, and twenty times more.</p>
            <p>And when this Deſign is throughly underſtood, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
of the moory Banks, this Deſign is to be followed,
otherwiſe this Level muſt be left in a worſe condition then it
was found.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, ſince this Objection is of ſuch force that it will
coſt much money, I then ſay, if a year and an halfs Rent will
treble my Rent yearly, to what it yields at preſent, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my ſelf none of the beſt Husbands, that will not lay out
ſo much money to ſuch an advantage. I will now anſwer ſome
other Objections.</p>
            <p>That there is as much done for the Draining of this great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
as can be done,<note place="margin">1. Object.</note> and that it is not in the Invention of man to
do more then what is already done.</p>
            <p>This is the opinion of thoſe which give credit to our moory
Banks,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and underſtand not the Deſcent nor Aſcent of this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
in general, nor do they know the Deſcent that may be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Sea, but will ſay, if Banks will not do the work, there
is no more to be done; but do diſhearten all men from doing or
attempting any thing, leſt their weakneſs ſhould appear.</p>
            <p>Why did you then,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> when you were Director for the Work,
make ſuch great and high Banks upon Morton's Leam, of two
and fifty foot in the ſeat, twelve foot high, and eight foot
broad at the top?</p>
            <p>All this I did it is true,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but thoſe Banks I did not make for
Sea Banks, or to withſtand ſuch a Sea or Waſh as now they
have, but laid them near to avoid a Winde-catch; and I told
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98959:12"/>
the Adventurers at Wisbidge in 1649. at their Meeting there,
that thoſe Banks made ſo high by me then, would not ſtand
above four or five foot high twenty years after their making;
and I did promiſe them then, that (my Deſign being finiſhed)
the Floods ſhould never charge thoſe Banks above two foot:
and it muſt have been ſo, if this Deſign of mine had gone on,
and been perfected; neither was it poſſible that this two foot
of a Flood ſhould have lain out of the River three neaps of a
Tide, if the Sluce at German-Bridge be ſuffered to run.</p>
            <p>Many wiſe men are of opinion,<note place="margin">3. Object.</note> that the Banks being Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every Year, the Draining may be perfected.</p>
            <p>Wiſe men may think ſo,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and the Countrey men which get
all the money for Repairing every Year will tell them ſo, till
the Charge exceed the Profit; but if they look upon Deeping
Fen drained with moory Banks by Captain LOVEL, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a ſmall time rich Ground, till the moory Banks were rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a mould, then the Banks failed, though there was no coſt
ſpared by the Right Honourable the Earle of Exeter, to repair
or maintain them; yet it is now, and hath been theſe twenty
years under water, and nothing to be had from it but a little
Fiſh; yet this Fen doth contain thirty thouſand Acres of good
Land (if drained.) Look upon Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi>'s works, the
Lord <hi>Popham</hi>'s works, Governour <hi>Peyton</hi>'s works, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Francis</hi> Earle of <hi>Bedfords</hi> works, all theſe Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
perſons were wiſe men, and undoubtedly did act by a great
ſcale of Prudence in their Undertakings, yet could not make
their moory Banks any longer durable, then till the moor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
mould: Theſe Preſidents are all within our Level, and in
the memory of this our age.</p>
            <p>But if you run our freſhes ſo low in Winter,<note place="margin">4. Object.</note> what ſhall we
do for water for our ſelves and Cattle in Summer?</p>
            <p>Whilſt you have water at Deeping-Bridge,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> at Peterborough-Bridge,
Saint Ives-Bridge, Cambridge-Bridge, and at the
Bridges of Milnall, Brandon, and Stoke, undoubtedly our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
cannot want water; for under theſe Bridges come all thoſe
waters which drown us, and under theſe Bridges ſhall come
thoſe waters for us, and our Cattle. Yet take notice, that the
great Sluce at German-Bridge, or near Madelen, is able to hold
up the waters, with little helps, as high as you pleaſe; then it will
be confeſſed to be an abſolute Draining, when we can Drown,
and Drain at our pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98959:12"/>
But how ſhall thoſe Fens in Norfolk,<note place="margin">5. Object.</note> Suffolk, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire,
which lie on the Eaſt-ſide of Owſe, be drained,
for they lie the loweſt of all the Fens in this Great Level?</p>
            <p>If great Owſe run low,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> then all theſe Fens you name will lie
dry, for ſtill your great Sluce drains all your waters out of Owſe,
and Morton's Leam, if you pleaſe; but then Navigation will be
hindered, which is to be helped by bottoming of thoſe Rivers
where there may be occaſion, neither is the bottoming of a
River ſo chargeable as banking.</p>
            <p>Wisbidge River may run where it doth,<note place="margin">6. Object.</note> as well as at German-Bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to go through Marſland, the Ground will coſt dear, and
that money may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>To anſwer this I have much to ſay;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> firſt, Wisbidge Out-fall
lies high upon the Waſhes, and then it is too near our Fens to
check our Freſhes; my drift is to keep the Sea at a greater
diſtance, that I may have our Freſhes at all times both night
and day, to run quick under the Bridges of Wisbidge, and
Downham, without the leaſt check. Again, the River at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Bridge
lies lower then the River at Wisbidge-Bridge, and
there is more fall from Wisbidge-Bridge to German-Bridge at
low water, then at the fall from Peterborough-Bridge to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge;
and our Out-fall at Lynne is below the Waſhes, and
this River of Wisbidge joyned with the River Owſe at the
Sluce, makes a gallant In-draught, and will gain Lynne a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Channel to Sea, to the great benefit of that fine Town,
and the Town of Wisbidge. As for the charge of the Ground
through Marſland, I may juſtly anſwer, good and great things
are not done without coſt; but the coſt of this will not be
much, by reaſon we may carry much of the River through the
Common, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Common belonging to the ſeven
Towns in Marſland, and the Common called the Smee, and
Drain them both, which the Marſland men will thank you
for.</p>
            <p>The River of Wisbidge is (as it is now widened) ſufficient to
carry in it all thoſe waters which fall from Peterborough,<note place="margin">7. Odject.</note> and
therefore you may ſpare your pains and coſt at Murrow-gate.</p>
            <p>Wisbidge River is wider then it was,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> eſpecially at the Out-fall,
which doth, and will deſtroy us; but it is not the depth nor
the width of the River that will drain that Level, it is the
deſcent, and quick current, that muſt do our work: But this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98959:13"/>
River is ſo full of ſmall Angles, to ſhoulder up our Freſhes,
yet I will ſay, it will ſerve till the moory Banks in the Fen be
ſunk. But it is good to be ſure in this great Work, for if this
River ſhould prove defective, to receive and carry away a great
Flood, it is not onely the loſs of having our Grounds drowned,
but may be the ruine of many good mans Eſtate, to the value of
ten times the charge of making the Slaker through Murrow-gate,
to the Horſeſhooe; beſide, the benefit of this River, and
the In-drains to drain all the North-ſide of Wisbidge, which
is many thouſand Acres of good Land.</p>
            <p>The Tide being ſtopped at German-Bridge,<note place="margin">8. Object.</note> or near Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,
will riſe higher, and run over our Banks, and drown us in
Marſland.</p>
            <p>This Objection is eaſily waved,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Tide hath its bounds,
and cannot riſe higher then its center at Sea, and though it be
ſtopped at German-Bridge, it ſhall not riſe higher by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of one hair, as if it never had been ſtopped at all.</p>
            <p>But your great Sluce and Soſs at German-bridge,<note place="margin">9. Object.</note> or near
Maddelen, will be quickly ſilted up, and what will become of
the Fens then?</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible it ſhould,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> being no ſilt comes near it, nor
any ſalt water, for which I give this reaſon; <hi>viz.</hi> The Freſhes
at low water have got the Channel at Lynne, there the Tide
comes in, and beats the Freſhes back; the freſh and ſalt water
unwilling to mix, the Tide beats back thoſe Freſhes to its own
height, that ſo two miles below the Sluce at Germans it will
not be brackiſh. I hope the River of Thames at Blackwall
and London-bridge will give you an experiment; and if no
ſalt water at the new Sluce, and Soſs, it muſt be confeſſed, no
ſilt and ſand.</p>
            <p>We have great Froſts ſome years,<note place="margin">10. Object.</note> and then upon a ſudden
thaw the Ice comes down and will choak your Sluce and Soſs.</p>
            <p>Soſſes and Sluces are the means to prevent the danger of the
Ice in a ſudden thaw.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It is confeſſed, many Bridges by the
force and weight of the Ice have been beaten down, but the uſe
of Sluces prevents that danger thus: In great and long Froſts
we can have no Floods, and if our Rivers are frozen over to
make it impaſſable for Boats, then are our Sluces to run; by
this means I ſink the Water, and the Ice with them, as low as
I can, then by our Sluces I hold up our waters, and this water
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98959:13"/>
riſeth one foot or two above the Ice, which is frozen faſt to
the bottom of our Rivers after a night or two lying there;
and although they be not diſſolved, yet they are ſo rotten, brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and ſhort, and cannot hurt either Bridge or Sluce: this I
have made experience of by Sluces, and can prove it; and this is
practiſed in Holland, Freezeland, and Gronning.</p>
            <p>Our Diviſion Dikes,<note place="margin">11. Object.</note> and all our Dikes in our Fens, though
they be made twelve foot wide, and ſix foot deep, they keep
their width, yet in our dry years the bottoms riſe two foot, and
our Dikes become ſhallower, and they are no good fences.</p>
            <p>Obſervation and experience will teach you,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the bottom
of your Dikes grow not up, nor riſe as you ſay, but it is your
Ground lying dry, the Moor Earth groweth ſollid to a good and
fruitful ſoyl; and it is not your Dikes bottoms which riſe, but
your Grounds which ſink, and become much better; therefore
when your Grounds are thus ſunk with lying dry, bottom
then your Dikes two foot, and your Dikes will hold good for
many years.</p>
            <p>It is perceivable by your Deſign for the Draining of this
great Level,<note place="margin">12. Object.</note> that in a flood we ſhall have no Navigation upwards
from your new Sluce up Bedford River, up Owſe to Cambridge,
or up your new River to Wisbidge, and Peterborough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the waters will run ſo quick that we cannot hale with our
Horſes againſt the ſtream, but our three Rivers will become
like the river Rhyne for ſwiftneſs in a flood.</p>
            <p>It is granted,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Rivers in a flood will run quick, by reaſon
they have water-way, and fall ſufficient at the great Sluce;
but this force of a flood will not laſt for above a day or two,
it may be longer, and it may be not ſo long, therefore you muſt
ſtay while the flood be paſt; neither are theſe Rivers ſo much
your enemies, as conſtantly to oppoſe you, as the river Rhyne
doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All which work againſt a conſtant ſtream muſt have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and ſo muſt you; yet the motions of theſe great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
down the river Rhyne are quick, and ſo will yours be in a
flood, which laſts not long, neither will they be common with
us; for the Compariſon will not hold between the river Rhyne
and any of our Rivers in our Level.</p>
            <p>If this Deſign of yours be perfected,<note place="margin">13. Object.</note> we may then lay all our
Boats aſide, as having no uſe for them; for Owſe, Bedford Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98959:14"/>
Morton's Leam, and the new River through Marſland, will
draw in all our Land waters.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed that Morton's Leam and Owſe will run low,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
by reaſon that at German-bridge at low water mark, the River
will be lower then the height of the Level ſoyl at Saltors
Load, by twelve foot, and much more; and ſo likewiſe it will
ſtand with Guyheirne, and there ſhall be no need of raiſing the
Banks from thence to Bevis-hall, for there is Bank enough, and
the River will run lower then the Soyl or Superficies of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge
high Fen, for Wisbidge River will quickly grinde it ſelf
to its old bottom, and keep it; and it is feizable and neceſſary
to bring part of Owſe from Erith unto Wisbidge, by the Weſt-water,
through the Town of March, and the other branch by
Chatris, Doddington, and Wimbleton-hook, without the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of drowning any part of the Level;<note place="margin">This is of great uſe to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and the Countrey, for Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Middle Level.</note> and will water all the
parts of the middle Level, even to Maney, the two Wells, and
to Saltors Load, and will prove good for Navigation to the
Undertakers, and the Countrey which have quantities of
Grounds lying upon this Weſt-water; and if the Diviſions of
the Intercommons be laid out, there will be a neceſſity that this
Work of the Weſt-water be made good: This (you will ſay)
will afford you water-way for your Boats, No, ye are deceived,
for without the uſe of means at our Out-falls into Bedford Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Owſe, and Morton's Leam, to hold up your In-drains, you
will ſtill have no waters for your Boats, and this will coſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
which to do, I compare it to Paper and Packthred, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the rich Commodity bound up in it.</p>
            <p>We have now two gallant In-draughts,<note place="margin">14. Object.</note> as Bedford River,
and Morton's Leam, for our Floods to bed in, as Receptacles;
and after the Flood is ſpent, thoſe run and ſcour the Out-falls,
and maintain them.</p>
            <p>I know not what you mean by an In-draught,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
either of thoſe Rivers to be your In-draughts, in which
your Waters now bed, whoſe Banks are at ſuch a wide diſtance,
and at ſo great a diſtance from your Out-fall, as near twenty or
thirty miles, it is a Riddle to me, and beyond my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in my judgement againſt all the rules of Draining; for
in all Draining we have reſpect to our Out-fall, for if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be maſter there, all other endeavours ſignifie nothing.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98959:14"/>
You may as well call Whittleſey Mare,<note place="margin">The Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles between the Banks no In-draughts.</note> Ramſey Mare, Soham
Mare, In-draughts; and the Dutch may better call Harlem
Mare an In-draught, for none of thoſe I have named are In-draughts;
for there can be no In-draught, but it muſt be cloſe
to the Out-fall,<note place="margin">The proper place of the In-draught.</note> otherwiſe it works no effect. You have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in Holland, and in all the Low Countreys, their In-draughts
are at their Sluces cloſe to the neck of their Out-falls;
neither is there any Haven, River, or Creek, lying upon foul
Seas, that hath not ſufficient Freſhes to maintain its Out-fall,
but he muſt by Art gain an In-draught, which In-draught muſt
be at hand to uſe when there is occaſion for it;<note place="margin">The Reaſon wherefore.</note> for all true
In-draughts are to be held up, and are to be made uſe of at the
laſt quarter Ebb, or before, and ſo it works its effect; but when
the In-draught is about a mile or two above its Out-fall, it is
ſo weak upon its ſtream by that time it comes to its Out-fall,
that it cannot work any effect to the cleanſing of either Haven,
River, or Creek.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely inſtance in two Havens or Harbors, though I
could trouble you with many;<note place="margin">Dunkirk and Delfts Haven.</note> the one is Dunkirk in Flanders,
the other is Delfts Haven in Holland: As for that of Dunkirk
I have ſeen it when upon the Wharf they have been forced to
uſe a Ladder to go up into a Ship of an hundred Tun at low
water, the next day they have been forced to uſe the ſame Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
down from of the Wharf into the ſame Ship; this might
ſeem ſtrange, but it was ſtrange to me to ſee by what a ſmall
means this Effect was wrought, which was thus: <hi>viz.</hi> In all dry
Summers the Haven is very ſubject to be ſilted up by the Sea
bearing its foul waters into it, by reaſon of the many ſhelves
of ſand upon that Coaſt, ſo that the ordinary ſtrength of that
ſmall River coming from Bergue,<note place="margin">Wynox Bergue</note> is not able to carry out of that
Haven what the Sea lodgeth in it, but then Reaſon and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
doth the work of that Haven thus: When the Haven is
ſilted up to ſuch a height, the Town cauſes the River aforeſaid
to be kept up by their Sluce, or Soſs, for ſome eight or ten
dayes together, then they command the Ships and other Veſſels
in that Haven to ride in the midſt of it as cloſe to each other
as they can;<note place="margin">How the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk is cleanſed by the In-draught.</note> and being thus placed, they at a Level water open
their Sluces and Soſſes, and give liberty to the pinned up waters
from Bergue to run through the Haven, ſo that it grindes the
bottom through the Intervals between the Ships, that it carries
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98959:15"/>
away all the ſilt and ſand out of the Haven, whilſt the ſhips
rock too and fro, as if they would fall one upon another; and
by this means the Haven becomes as deep again. It is much
the ſame with Delfts Haven in Hollaud, and that ſmall River
which comes from Overkey to the Town and Haven, doth the
like effect with that of Dunkirk, otherwiſe there could be no
Haven, but by reaſon the Sluces which caſt their In-draughts
into both theſe Haven, ſtand at the very entrance of them,
otherwiſe they could not grinde and effect ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>Now look back to our ſelves which have been ſo much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">The Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Walder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey dangerous to Coldham and Walderſey</note>
as to make Receptacles of In-draughts within Land ſo
remote from the Out-falls, and you may be aſſured, that if the
Receptacle or In-draught made at Walderſey, had taken that
effect as was ſuppoſed, to have received from a Spring Tide
from Sea ſix foot water, yet it could not have done you any
good, by reaſon it lay ſo far from the Out-fall: but certain it
is, that if it had proved that that In-draught had but gained
from the Sea, four, five, or ſix foot water, the Banks had been
gone long e're this; and Wilderſay and Coldham had been both
loſt, or little worth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you no farther trouble, but to aſſure you of my
readineſs to anſwer any other Objections which may be made
againſt this my Deſign, or way of Draining, to the beſt of my
knowledge and judgement.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to give you my ſenſe of the great benefit
which will ariſe to his Sacred Majeſty, the Honourable Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the Countrey, and the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Subjects in this Level,<note place="margin">Conſiderable benefit to the King and Kingdom.</note> who were formerly very
poor, by reaſon of the uncertainty of the Banks, and their Ground
lying dry, but being once perfectly Drained, will grow rich and
populous, to the ſtrengthning of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It will better Navigation and Trade to all his Towns in this
part of the Kingdom.<note place="margin">Advantageous to ſome Towns His Majeſties Land ſecured from drowning Fifty thouſand Acres of good Land gained from the Sea, called the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, the Kings Waſte.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It ſecures His Majeſties Land, being ten thouſand Acres ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Level, from all farther charge or fear of being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any Flood, either in Winter or Summer.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty gains hereby fifty thouſand Acres of good Land,
called now the Waſhes, or Salt Marſhes; this Land is equal to
thoſe Lands in Marſland, or Holland, for goodneſs, the one
lies on the Eaſt and the other on the Weſt-ſide of theſe Waſhes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98959:15"/>
or Salt Marſhes, which is all the Kings Waſte: and I do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that thoſe Waſhes contain more Land then lies in Marſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
it ſelf; and more, thoſe Waſhes lies much higher then doth
Marſland or the North-ſide of Wisbide; yet through this
Waſh doth Wisbidge River, Sheir-Drain, and Spalding River
make their way to the Sea. But when Wisbidge River, Sheir-Drain,
with Spalding River, are forced to a better Out-fall,
as Wisbidge to great Owſe, and Spalding River, and Glean
ſecured, to the great benefit of North and South Holland;
then muſt thoſe ſpacious Waſhes ſuddenly become good Land
for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> for theſe Rivers by force of winter Floods
do ſcour and cleanſe theſe Waſhes, and will not ſuffer the ſilt
or ſand to bed upon them; but theſe Rivers being taken away,
which run through, and ſpread themſelves upon theſe Waſhes
every low water, doth carry away to Sea what the Tide hath
left behinde; but the Cauſe being taken away, the Effect
ceaſeth, and all thoſe Waſhes will become good Land at little
or no conſiderable charge; and yet the Navigation of His
Majeſties Towns of Lynne, Boſton, and Wisbidge, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and prove great Out-falls, and Navigable Channels to
the North Sea.</p>
            <p>Yet let me tell you,<note place="margin">The Waſhes get height up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Freſhes.</note> that though the Freſhes work this effect,
to cleanſe and ſcour the Waſhes, yet the Waſhes grow and get
height upon them; and though formerly Wisbidge was the beſt

it,<note place="margin">No good out-fall through the Waſhes for Wisbidge, Spal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or Sheir-Drain.</note> which now run by Lyn, by reaſon of late years the Sea hath
left us, and the Waſhes have gained a great height; and in my
judgement it is impoſſible ever to gain any good Out-fall
through thoſe Waſhes, either for the River of Wisbidge, Sheir-Drain,
or Spalding River.</p>
            <p>As for the Noble and Honorable Adventurers I ſhall ſay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
onely aſſure them, that this Deſign, and way of Draining this
Great Level, being perfected, the Great Level will be perfectly
Drained;<note place="margin">The charge of two hundred miles in Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken off.</note> whereby the great charge of maintaining two or
three hundred miles in Banking already made, will be taken off;
which being of no farther uſe, will be of no farther charge: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they freed from this charge alone, but from the charge
of many of their Sluces and Soſſes;<note place="margin">Some Sluces and Soſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs.</note> as that of VVell-creek,
and that upon Owſe, at Saltors Load, and thoſe works at Ely,
which will become as uſeleſs as the two or three hundred miles
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98959:16"/>
of Banking. And in fine, it may be believed, that Six pence
the Acre <hi>per annum,</hi> will maintain the Charge of upholding
the Works, and procure a Stock, if the beforementioned works
be once ſufficiently effected, for there will be no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of Banks any more.</p>
            <p>The benefit which will ariſe to the Inhabitants of this
Countrey will be very conſiderable, in being freed from all
danger of being drowned any more; that they may freely plow,
and ſowe, build, and plant; and then there will be no fear of
the want of water in the Summer, for themſelves or Cattle;
and which will be very conſiderable, is the Navigation to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every ſmall Town in this Level, eſpecially if their Inter-Commons
be divided,<note place="margin">The Diviſion of the Inter-Common.</note> which will be a great benefit both to the
Lords and the Tenants: but in all theſe Navigable Cuts avoid
Banks, and then theſe Cuts and Diviſion Dikes may be done at
a ſmall charge, having a care to carry your leading Drains into
their proper Out-falls of Bedford River, Great Owſe, and
Morton's Leam.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deviat from my preſent Diſcourſe, if I tell you,
that by my Obſervations abroad, both in my youth and age, I
gained ſome Experience to ſerve my native Countrey; and that
one Province of Holland,<note place="margin">The Province of Holland.</note> I compute to be equally as large as
this Great Level; and I do verily believe that there is one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times more money expended in this Province, in Rivers,
Sluces, Soſſes, and Bridges, then can be needful in this Great
Level of the Fens.<note place="margin">The Provinces of South and North Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Freize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; Gron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, admits no Tides to run into them.</note> The Provinces of South and North Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Freizland, and Gronning, admit of no Tides or Rivers
from the Sea to run into them, onely South Holland admits
of the river Maze to run to meet the river Rhyne; yet this
Holland runs her water into the river Maze by ſubſtantial
Sluces, and Navigable Soſſes, as I have ſeen at Mazelandt,
Ulerdine, Skeydam, Delfts-haven, and at Roterdam, all theſe
play into the river Maze, which runs by the Brill to Dort. On
the North-ſide of this Province is Harlem Mare, by Sluces and
Soſſes, at Amſterdam there are many, at Myden, Nardam, all
theſe run into the Zuyder Sea, and yet thoſe Sluces, and thoſe
upon the river Maze, have not one quarter of the ebb to run at.</p>
            <p>North Holland upon the Zuyder Sea hath its Sluces to run
at Sardam,<note place="margin">North Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath not a quarter Ebb to run at.</note> Monkenden, Horn, Ancuſen, and Middle-bleak,
and they have not above a quarter Ebb to run at; though they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98959:16"/>
force their waters into thoſe leading Rivers by coſtly Mills;
and in this North Holland much of their richeſt Grounds,
where they make their beſt Cheeſe, lie under the low water
mark at Sea,<note place="margin">Draining with a multitude of mills.</note> at leaſt ſix or ſeven foot; as the Bempſter, the
Skermer, and the Wart, &amp;c. they are all Drained by a multitude
of Mills, each Mill coſts near ſix hundred pounds Sterling.
In the Skermer I have ſeen four Mills,<note place="margin">Four mills to caſt up water ſixteen foot.</note> one ſtanding four foot
higher then the other, and they have worked one to another, till
they have brought the water ſixteen foot high, to run into the
Drains which leads to the Sea.</p>
            <p>Freizland and Gronning;<note place="margin">Great care to prevent the flowing in of the Sea into any part of the Provinces.</note> from Campen in Gilderland to
Dam in Gronning, is all drained by Soſſes and Sluces to Sea-ward;
the length of thoſe three Provinces is no leſs then an
hundred and twenty miles along the Sea Coaſt, and yet they
have no Rivers run into them from the Sea. I did obſerve in
all thoſe parts of the Netherlands where I have been, they do
not admit the Sea to flow into any of their Provinces,<note place="margin">The Sea kept out by Soſſes and Sluces.</note> but keep
it out by their Sluces and Soſſes, ſo far as Art and Coſt will
promiſe them ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Theſe Works of theirs will confirm all rational perſons,
that if they have but one quarter of the Ebb to run at, and lie
dry, what can be ſaid againſt a Sluce and Navigable Soſs at
German-bridge,<note place="margin">The Sluce at German Bridge runs at half Ebb, and more.</note> upon old Owſe, and new Nean, which hath
half the Ebb but in a Flood more, becauſe the Freſhes do riſe
one foot within the Sluce, for two foot the Tide riſeth againſt
the Sluce without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Sea-ward.</p>
            <p>I hope the experience we all have of Holland,<note place="margin">Marſland low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the great Level of the Fens, and yet is Drained into the River Owſe.</note> the North-ſide
of Wisbidge, with that of Marſland, all of them lie below
the Fens of the Great Level five or ſix foot, yet drain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into great Owſe and the Sea: Neither are the benefits
inconſiderable, which Holland, the North-ſide of Wisbidge,
and Marſland, will receive by this Deſign.</p>
            <p>As for Hollaud,<note place="margin">South Ea bank ſecured.</note> all that Bank called South Ea Bank, from
Doweſdale to Clowes-Croſs, being eight miles, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
formerly to have been a thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi>

            <p>The North-ſide of Wisbidge will by this means ſave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of that Bank from Clowes-Croſs to Guyheirn, and part
of the Bank upon Wisbidge River which formerly coſt much
money; but the greater benefit this North-ſide of Wisbidge

will receive,<note place="margin">The North-ſide of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge drained, and the flat of Tid St. Mary's</note> is the perfect Draining of all that flat and low

Tid St. Mary's, in the County of Lincoln, did contract for the

            <p>Now as for Marſland their benefit will be the greateſt, for
this work being done, they ſave the charge of repairing all thoſe

the Common alſo called the Smee,<note place="margin">The great Common of the 7. Towns of Marſland Drained, and the Smee.</note> for which a great quantity
of Land was offered to thoſe which ſhould undertake the
Draining of it, as I have been informed. And another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
benefit is, they will conſtantly have freſh water out of

            <head>Anſwers to the ſeveral Objections againſt this
my Deſigne, ſince the Delivery of it to
the Honourable Corporation.</head>
            <p>FIrſt,<note place="margin">1. Object.</note> it is objected, that the place that I intend to ſet the
great Sluce upon, which is near Magdalen, is a Quick-ſand.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the place I have deſigned to ſet the
great Sluce upon is no Quick-ſand, but a firm and ſollid Clay,
as the place where Magdalen Bridge ſtands, or the Sluce at Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
Load, or Well-Creek; and this is at an eaſie charge made
appear to them that doubt, by ſinking the place twelve foot,
where they will finde what I have aſſerted in my Deſign to
be truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> It is objected, that the River is deep there, and
that it is not poſſible to ſet a Sluce in the River.</p>
            <p>It was never intended to ſet this Sluce and Soſs in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
for that were great folly to undertake; but this Sluce is
ſet near the River of Owſe, and ſo cut into the River; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the River were as deep again as it is, it is all one; for
I ſet not the ſole of the Sluce two foot below the Channel (as
it is pretended) but I ſet it two foot below the ſole of the River,
or low water mark, and therefore the depth of the River is no
prejudice to me by being ſo deep, but contrary a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and of much benefit to carry away the Freſhes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Object.</note> It is objected, that if a Sluce ſhould be ſet there,
that the Doors of that Sluce muſt be thirty foot in length.</p>
            <p>The Sluce I have Deſigned is in height from the loweſt ſtone
in the foundation,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to the higheſt ſtone in the work, but eight
and twenty foot high; the ſeveral water-wayes in this Sluce but
ten foot high; neither doth the greateſt Freſhes within us riſe
above ten or twelve foot upon the Sluce, why ſhould the Flood-gates
then be made thirty foot high for ten or twelve foot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
you have a preſident by all thoſe Goats that ſtand upon the
River Owſe in Marſland, that drain all Marſland into that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98959:18"/>
otherwiſe Marſland could not be drained, yet their Flood-gates
are not above five foot high ſet to low water mark, ſo
that the Spring Tides flows about thirteen foot of plum water
above them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Object.</note> It is objected, that if this Sluce and River through
Marſland were finiſhed, it would do no good to the Draining
of the Great Level, but no reaſon is given for it.</p>
            <p>If that the gaining of a great and conſiderable Deſcent to
the Sea,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> at the very Out-fall, will do no good to drain that great
and flat Level, that lies in a Flood above twenty foot higher
then low water mark at the Out-fall, and yet this Out-fall but
twelve miles from this flat Level, makes this Objection frivolous.
But to give farther ſatisfaction, I did deſire a view might have
been made of that River called the Horſeſhooe, below Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge,
where they might have ſeen the Tide riſe to the height
of eight or nine foot up the Banks of that River, higher then
the Superficies of Marſland; and if you will ſtay untill it be
low water, you ſhall ſee this River two or three foot within ſoyl,
lower then the ſuperficies of Marſland; and yet the River of
Owſe at the great Sluce, at low water mark, will be ten or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
foot below the ſuperficies of Marſland there; for all the
deſcent of Marſland lies from the Bank upon the Horſeſhooe, to
the new Sluce near Magdalen; and the Goats in Marſland on
the River Owſe doth Drain the whole Countrey into the ſaid
River, following the refluxes of the Tide.</p>
            <p>It is objected,<note place="margin">5. Object.</note> that the ſtopping of the Tide by a Sluce at
Magdalen, will not take away the great waters in a Flood from
off the Banks at Sutton and Meapool.</p>
            <p>If the Tide be not ſtopped here at Magdalen,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or Germans,
yea, lower to Sea, if it were convenient, it is not poſſible but
that in a Flood, Swacy, Over, Erith, the Waſhes, and thoſe
Banks about Sutton Meapool, Witham, Witchford, and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
muſt all ſuffer. My reaſons are,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note> the Floods come quick from St. Ives, making their
way to Sea; the water-way is large enough at Erith, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
but at Sutton, Galt, and Meapool, in the new Bedford
River, there it runs upon an Aſcent, the like again at Pye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor-hill,
which is a great Obſtruction of the Freſhes in a flood
running to Sea; for Gravels and Fords in Rivers are a great
hinderance to the free paſſage of all waters: for although the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98959:18"/>
River be never ſo deep, it muſt be allowed where ſuch Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are; you can run no more waters in thoſe Rivers then
what runs over your Gravels or Fords, and it is the ſame with
Sutton, Galt, and Pyemoor-hill, in new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bedford River. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, there is another great Obſtruction, which is the weeds
that are admitted to grow in this, and many other of our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and are of very dangerous conſequence; for in a Flood,
where our Freſhes in this River hath but ſmall deſcent, they
hold them up, inſomuch that the Freſhes are inforced to ſoyl
through thoſe weeds as through a C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eve, which muſt of neceſſity
cauſe thoſe quick waters from the Uplands to ſwell backwards,
to the great dammage of Erith, Swacy, and Over, on that ſide
of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> after the Flood hath paſſed theſe three great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
in this River, it meeteth with another rather worſe
then the former, which is the Tide, and Winde-catch; for when
theſe great bodies of Freſhes come to run to the Sea, they then
at the very Out-fall meets with the Tide (who viſits that River
twice in four and twenty hours) and doth not onely ſtop the
Current of thoſe Freſhes, and forceth them back even as far as
Sutton-bridge upon new Bedford River; and if the winde blow
hard almoſt in any Point, when the Floods are within the great
Waſh of that River, the Banks are in great danger of being
loſt, or blown up; for it maketh ſo rough a Sea, that it waſhes
and undermines the Banks; and if it do not break them, it puts
the Corporation the next Summer to a vaſt charge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing.</p>
            <p>Now on the contrary, to free this Level from the bad Effects
of this indirect River, the Tide, Winde-catch; and weeds,
to give this River from Erith free paſſage, by the old and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
River by it, (for it is old Bedford River that is the River)
though it hath been much ſleighted; yet if it had not been made
uſe on of late years, it had been much worſe for the Countrey
then it was. For I dare and will affirm, that the Freſhes in a
Flood ſhall vent themſelves, running from Erith a day or two, at
Saltors Load, by the old River, before they come down thither
by the new: now, theſe two Rivers having their free paſſage,
the weeds being cut and roded, and the Tide ſtopped at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
or Magdalen, will free this part of the Level, that is ſo
much oppreſſed by St. Ives waters, the Winde-catch, and the flux
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98959:19"/>
of the Tide up that River, for the Freſhes then in thoſe
two ſpacious Rivers hath no Obſtruction; for the Tide being
ſtooped at Germans, theſe Rivers will run continually, having
ſo great a Receptacle as ſeven or eight miles in length, without
the Level, from Saltors Load to Germans Bridge; for the
Freſhes at the great Sluce muſt riſe at leaſt ten foot higher
then its uſual height, to maintain Navigation, before the water
can run back at Saltors Load to obſtruct the Current of this
River, which is impoſſible, if the Sluce and Soſs be admitted to
run; for the water-way in this Sluce and Soſs is no leſs then an
hundred eighty two foot broad, and ten or eleven foot deep,
which is more water-way by much, then runs through thoſe two
Bridges of VVisbidge and Downham; now theſe Rivers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thus continually in the greateſt Floods, it will be allowed,
that the waters cannot lie long, or rife ſo high as formerly, by
ſix foot upon thoſe Banks; if ſo, then the VVinde-catch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in the leaſt prejudice thoſe Banks. By this, I hope, it may
be perceived, that the waters cannot lie upon thoſe Banks of
Sutton and Meapool, or in the leaſt damnifie Erith, Swacy, and
Over. This may be an anſwer for the River of Morton's Leam
to Peterborough, and that part of the Countrey, for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
are the ſame.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Object.</note> It is objected, that my In-let of the River from
VVisbidge into Marſland Cut, cannot be performed at ſix foot
deep, at the River called the Horſeſhooe, as I have Deſigned
it, and they give this reaſon for it, That if I make my River
there ſix foot deep, the height of the Tide will not reach the
ſole of that River to be cut through Marſland.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to anſwer this Objection,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it being altogether
without reaſon or ſenſe, but referre you to my Anſwer to the
fourth Objection, which will give any one full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. Object.</note> It is objected, that the Charge of a Sluce, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
of the Grounds through Marſland, and the reſt of the
works Deſigned by me, will coſt 200000l.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That certainly they that made ſo large an
Eſtimate upon thoſe works I have Deſigned, know how to ſet
a price upon their own; for it is well known, the Eſtimate I
gave in to the Honourable Corporation, with my Deſign, did
not amount to above 46000l. for I had rather, and it was my
reſolution, to ask more, or at leaſt as much as would do the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98959:19"/>
work, (having ſo ſhort a warning) then ask leſs, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
ſhould finde it more, thereby to induce the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make uſe of my Deſign; but upon further conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and having better digeſted the charge, I have ſince for the
better ſatisfaction of this Honourable Corporation, made a
Moddel of part of the great Sluce, and the Soſs proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to ſhew the true Dimention of the ſame; which Sluce and
Soſs will be undertaken at a price, by able and ſufficient Work-men.
And that ſuch miſtakes as theſe may not affright
the Corporation from going on with ſo Beneficial a work, I
have here annexed to my Deſigne, the Eſtimate of all my
works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they are, and will be undertaken; and ſhall be ready
when this Honourable Corporation pleaſe, to make every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of this Accompt appear.</p>
            <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8. Object.</note> It is objected, that this Sluce is to maſter a quick
water, which is not believed it is proper; for the reaſon is,
they have not known the like practiſed elſewhere.</p>
            <p>As to this I hope to give full ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and Examples of other Countreys in the like caſe, as alſo
ſome known to our ſelves within the Iſle.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance in the firſt place Freizland, which is a larger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Countrey then this Level by much; here all Winter their
Grounds lies very deep in water, frozen over with Ice and
Snow, this they thus ſuffer, to keep their Ground warm, and by
this means preſerves the roots of their Graſs from periſhing by
the Froſt; and in February or March, when the weather break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
they then run all theſe waters out into the Sea by their
Sluces, which runs quick and violently for one moneth and more
together, (more quick then ever it will run at the great Sluce)
neither have they any way to avoid their great and quick waters
but by Sluces.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is the like with North Holland and South <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Holland, by the multitude of Mills, working all the latter part
of Winter, which cauſeth a very quick River to their Sluces
at Sea: and I doubt not but theſe all may be termed quick
waters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we look at home, we ſhall finde that we had a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
gallant Sluce upon the River of Wisbidge, which was of great
uſe until it was overcharged by the River of Welland, which was
contrary to the intentions of the then Adventurers; for there
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98959:20"/>
was no waters intended to that Sluce, but what run under Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough
Bridge, from Burrough Fen and Thorney, and the
water-way was made accordingly in that Sluce; and that Sluce
was uſeful and convenient in that place, and might have been
to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Come to the Soſs at Well-Creek which is ſtill
ſtanding, and hath to the great benefit of the Countrey theſe
thirty years, preſerved Navigation, and wrought that River
to a great depth, and keeps it: This may be juſtly called a quick
water, upon ever Land flood, or Down-fall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Look upon the Sluce upon old Bedford River at
Saltors Load, which is ſtill ſtanding, and for many years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Out-fall of that River, until our Troubles began in
England; and then the people ſtole away the Flood-gates, ſo
that the Out-fall of that River was ſuddenly ſilted up: and
this Sluce ſtood upon a conſiderable quick River.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Come to the open Soſs and ſeveral Sluces at Saltors
Load, which was ſet down ſome fourteen years ſince upon
this great Quick, butting upon the Tide from ſea, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was made of wood, which cannot be durable againſt
the ſea) neither was it ſet in its proper place; yet it is clear
it did much preſerve that part of the Level, and alſo maintained
Navigation whilſt it was kept in repair.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to give you my Reaſons, that a Sluce
upon a Quick water is as uſeful, with as little danger, as a Sluce
upon a Dead water, as it is termed; it is confeſſed, that a Sluce
upon a Quick, that hath not water-way ſufficient, is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a Dam to obſtruct the Current of thoſe Rivers in a
Flood, and is deſtructive; but if there be water-way ſufficient,
and to ſpare, in the greateſt Flood, then this Sluce or Soſs
preſerves that Countrey from all ſudden and quick Floods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger. And for the prevention of all ſudden Floods, it
muſt be granted, that no Flood falls into this Level, but by
great Rains, or ſudden Thaws, in the Upland Countreys; of
which we cannot but be ſenſible ſome dayes before it come
down, in which interim of time we pull up all our Fall-gates,
and run out all our Freſhes that are holden up by the Sluce to
maintain Navigation, ſo that when the Floods come down, the
Rivers are empty (if clear of weeds) to receive them; and if I
run twice the water of thoſe Bridges where the Floods muſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98959:20"/>
come under, certainly I may wait three hours in twelve upon
the re-flux of the Tide, and yet not ſo much if the Flood be
great; for as the Tide riſeth two foot without us, the Freſhes
in a Flood riſe one within the Sluce, by which means we run
the ſooner, for our Freſhes run whether the Tide be coming
in or going out, until the Tide riſe higher then our Freſhes,
and ſhuts the Flood-gates.</p>
            <p>Theſe Examples and Reaſons I hope may be ſufficient,<note place="margin">☞</note> and
give full ſatisfaction to them that doubt of the truth I have
aſſerted in my Deſign; for unleſs (in my judgement) we can
maſter the Tide, it is not poſſible to Drain this Level.</p>
            <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">9. Object.</note> It is objected, that the Sluce I have deſigned will
not bear the weight of water that will lie againſt it, and that
the Eager will carry away the Sluce.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the Sluce I have Deſigned is in the
Foundation two and fifty foot broad; the bredth of the Sluce
upwards is forty foot, and beſides this bredth, between every
Arch a Butterice raiſed from the foundation, on both ſides
the Sluce, of three foot ſquare, all of good Brick, Stone, Lime,
and Tarras outwardly, which I do affirm is thrice the ſtrength
of any Bank in Marſland: And further, to ſupport this
Sluce, which in my judgement needs none, I keep the water
eight foot high conſtantly to Land-ward, to maintain Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo that I can have but the weight of ten foot water upon
my Sluce in the greateſt Tide. Now as to the ſtopping of
the Eager, which is no more then the flux of the Tide from
Sea, which comes in quick, I ſhall onely ſay this, That if the
Tide be once ſtopped in any River whatſoever, by Sluce or
Dam, it hath no more force; for when the Current of the Tide
is ſo ſtopped, it riſeth againſt that Sluce or Dam inſenſibly,
and thoſe Sluces or Dams bears no more but onely the weight
of water that riſeth upon them.</p>
            <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">10. Object.</note> It is objected, that if the Tide have not his Flux
and Re-flux up Owſe, it may be feared that Lynne River
may be loſt.</p>
            <p>Where Sluces with In-draughts are placed to any Out-fall
near the Sea,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> they alwayes make good the Channel or Out-fall
without them, as well as deepen the Channels of thoſe Rivers
within them; now the flux of the Tide is but a ſmall diſtance
from this Sluce, and the re-flux the ſame, which continual
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98959:21"/>
motion of the Tides ebbing and flowing in ſo ſhort a diſtance,
it cannot filt up that River, eſpecially when there is ſo great
a Freſh within our In-draught, in thoſe two great Rivers, that
leads all our Freſhes and Floods to that Sluce, and follows
the tail of the Tide to Sea; which muſt in all reaſon grinde
the Channel to Sea, to a great depth, below Lynne; and as it
is now uncertain and dangerous, this will improve it to the
admittance of greater Veſſels then formerly, to the great
benefit of that Port. And if the way that I have Deſigned
to Drain this Great-Level ſhould prove any wayes injurious to
this Town of Lynne, I would ſoon deſiſt from proſecuting it
any further; but I hope by this they underſtand a benefit and
no dammage to that Town.</p>
            <p>If I divert Wisbidge River from running through the
Waſhes,<note place="margin">11. Object.</note> or ſalt Marſh, then all thoſe Waſhes will become good
Ground; but then that part of Holland from the Sheir-Drain
to the River Welland, with the North-ſide of Wisbidge, will
be loſt, by reaſon they will loſe the Out-fall of Sheir-Drain,
Sutton-Goat, Fleet-Goat, Quapload-Goat, and Weſton-Goat,
which are their Drains into the Waſhes.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to Drain one part and Drown another, is
no part of my Deſign, but what I endeavour, is to perfect and
Drain that part of Holland, with the North-ſide of Wisbidge,
and yet Drain the great Waſhes containing near fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Acres of the Kings and Queens Waſte, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to any Land-holder in that part of Holland, or North-ſide
of Wisbidge, but to their great benefit. For it will be
confeſſed, that the Town and High Lands of Tid St. Mary's,
Sutton, Gidney, Holbeach, Quapload, Molton, to Spalding,
lies higher by ſix foot then the low Grounds on the North-ſide
of Wisbidge and Holland, and all theſe High Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named, lies betwixt the Sea and theſe Low Grounds; ſo
that Cubbet, Spalding, Drove-Chappel, Gidney, St. James,
and Fleet, are forced to Drain themſelves by ſmall Cuts through
this Aſcent betwixt the Sea and them, in ſome place three,
four, five, or ſix miles, and many of them ſeven and nine
foot deep; yet for all this great depth of thoſe Drains, a great
quantity of thoſe Low Grounds are drowned commonly two
foot; although you are at great charge with the ſpade to keep
your Goats and Sluces open into the ſalt Marſh or Waſhes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98959:21"/>
and yet cannot Drain your ſelves: (the reaſon is plain) for
it is well known to the ancient Inhabitants, that the Sea of late
years hath lodged its ſilt and ſand ſome feet above your
Sluces or Goats to Sea, and in ſhort time the loſs of
much good Land may be feared, yet to help you I do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
but to hurt you, or any part of the Countrey, is
no part of my Deſign. Now to free you from theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
the turning of Wisbidge River through Marſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
near to Germans-Bride, will be of much advantage and
benefit to thoſe low Grounds; for by the help of the Sluce
at Germans, we keep Wisbidge River, when we pleaſe, as
low as we will; and this River of Wisbidge will prove the
Out-fall for all thoſe low Grounds of Holland, and the
North-ſide of Wisbide, and perfectly Drain them Winter
and Summer: My reaſon is this, Thoſe low Grounds in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
lies higher then thoſe low Grounds on the North-ſide
of Wisbidge, and thoſe waters in Wisbidge River will lie
lower by ſix foot then the ſuperficies of thoſe Lands or
drowned Grounds on the North-ſide of Wisbidge; ſo that
at all times, by the help of a Navigable River, through that
part of Holland, from Cubbit upon Welland, to Grammoke-houſe
upon Sheir-Drain, and from thence to Murrow-gate,
and ſo to Leverington, into the River of Wisbidge; where
you have ſo great a fall, that it abſolutely Drains all thoſe
drowned Grounds aforeſaid, and the beſt and moſt certain Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
for Sheir-Drain, when Clowes-Croſs will give leave, to
the great benefit of Thorney, Burrough great Fen, and the
Town of Croyland. This work will not onely be of uſe to
the perfect Draining of all thoſe Grounds, but likewiſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Navigation from Lynne, Wisbidge, and Peterborough,
to Spalding, to Boſton, to Croyland, to Deeping, and to
Stampford, by the help of a ſmall ſingle. Soſs placed upon
Welland River near Cubbit. This I have now ſaid may be
performed at an inconſiderable Charge, conſidering the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
it brings with it, with the conſent and allowance from the
Honourable Corporation; of which there is no doubt, but
they will be very willing to ſerve the Countrey upon ſo Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
an Accompt, being of ſo great Advantage to thoſe parts
and little or no dammage to themſelves.</p>
            <p>

Thus having (to the beſt of my judgement) Anſwered the
aforeſaid Objections, and do confeſs my obligation to him, or
them that did make them; by which means, Reaſon will finde
the better allowance, and truth appear with more Iuſtre. I
ſhall now trouble the Reader with ſome few Objections of
my own, againſt that Deſign laſt intended to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrice,

            <head>According to an Order of this Corporation, the
<date>17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of November, 1664.</date> I do here, with
ſubmiſsion to the ſaid Corporation, humbly
tender theſe my Objections following, againſt
that Deſign now in agitation.</head>
            <p>WHereas it is deſigned by this laſt new Deſign, that all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Rivers ſhall be left open to the Sea, for the Tide to
have his free paſſage into all thoſe great Rivers.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Object.</note> To this I object, that if the flux of the Tide from Sea
be admitted to flow up old Owſe, Bedford River, and Morton's
Leam, that the Banks that are made, and to be made, in Order
to this Deſign, cannot ſecure the Level from Inundation, or
Drowning. My Reaſons are as followeth:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Reaſon.</note> The Tide flowing up the River of Owſe, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge,
hath been the deſtruction of all thoſe Undertakings, for
the Draining of the Great Level, the reaſon is plain; the Spring
Tides at Germans riſe twenty foot from low water mark, and at
Wisbidge it riſeth fourteen foot at leaſt above low water mark,
running to Sea; now the aſcent of the Tide from Sea flowing
ſo high within our Level, obſtructs the Freſhes in their Current
to Sea; and not onely that, but bears our Freſhes back (as I am
credibly informed) that the Freſhes have been ſeen to run back
through Sutton-Bridge towards Erith, which is near thirty
miles from Germans; the ſame it is with Morton's Leam up to
Eldernel: therefore the flux of the Tide is not to be admitted
into any of our Rivers.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> If the Rivers be open to Sea every Spring Tide,
if the windes blow hard at North or North-weſt, all the Level
is in danger of drowning; (as for example) the laſt Winter
when you had little or no Land Floods, the Spring Tides put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in with a ſtrong North winde, put Morton's Leam in great
danger; and as for Bedford River, it raiſed the waters ſo high,
that it carried away a conſiderable part of one of the beſt Banks,
to the great dammage of the Corporation and Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note> If the three Rivers be left open, and admit of the
Tide to flow up them, then Peterborough and thoſe parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98959:23"/>
muſt ſuffer, and ſo muſt Erith, Swacy, and Over, in that
part of the Countrey: neither can Haddenham, Swaftham, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-beach,
Stretham, or Wilberton, be freed from the ſaid incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
for it muſt be confeſſed at all hands, that Morton's
Leam lies much higher then Bedford River, and Bedford Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lies much higher then old Owſe; and likewiſe it will be
allowed, that the Tide will flow equally up theſe two Rivers of
Owſe and Bedford River, (for water will finde his level) now
certainly it was very indiſcreetly done of him, whoſoever he
was, that did give direction for a Bank of ſix foot to be made
upon Owſe, and Grant, againſt the Tide, Owſe being the loweſt
River in the whole Level, when they make Banks of ten and
twelve foot upon Bedford River and Morton's Leam, which
lies higher then this River by much. And as for thoſe Banks
deſigned to be made upon Mildenhall, Brandon, and Stoak, with
thoſe from Stretham-Ferry up to Aldry Cauſey, they will not
be able to ſecure that Countrey; for as it is with Bedford Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at Erith, Swacy, and Over, the ſame it will be with Stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Wilberton, Haddenham, and that part of the Countrey;
yea, rather much worſe, by reaſon the River lies ſo low, it will
give the greater reception to the Tide: for when the Tide did
flow up Owſe formerly, I have ſeen the water riſe a foot
at Stretham-Ferry in a Spring Tide; and now the River
being widened from Saltors Load to Littleport, you will finde
it will flow into thoſe parts with a more Eager then formerly,
to the deſtruction of that Level.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reaſon.</note> If Owſe and Bedford River be open to Sea for the
Tide to have his flux and re-flux, then will all Marſland be put
in a hazzard of utter ruine, they being now at a vaſt charge
to keep their Banks from the fury of the Eage<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by lineing their
Banks with Brink wood, which is cauſed but by the admittance
of the Tide into one River; but when it ſhall have its free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
and regreſs into thoſe two ſpacious Rivers of Owſe and
Bedford River, it will double the ſtrength of the Eager in his
flux from the Sea, having ſo great a reception above: And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in a Froſt when the Ice ſhall come down thoſe two great
Rivers, expecting to go to Sea, the Tide ſends it back again,
ſo that of neceſſity it will gore their Banks, and hazzard their
Bridges; the like it will be with the Banks of Owſe, Bedford
River, and Morton's Leam. And whereas it is ſuppoſed, nay
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98959:23"/>
believed, that the flowing of the Tide up Owſe will eaſe Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
River, that the waters ſhall not riſe ſo high there as they
uſe to do, it is a great miſtake, for the Sea is as well able to
furniſh the whole Level with a conflux of waters, as thoſe two
Rivers; and there is no doubt but the Tide will riſe as high in
both Rivers, as ever it did in new Bedford River; but if his
water-way be not wide enough in Owſe at preſent, he will
run ſo much the ſtronger, and in a ſhort time he will make his
way, having ſo great a reception, as is now allowed him, though
to the great prejudice of Marſland.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is likewiſe Deſigned, that a new Cut be made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
from Raſſels Dam to Littleport Chair, and the old River
Dammed up near Raſſels Dam.</p>
            <p>To this I object,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> That if you make this new River from Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
Dam to Littleport Chair, and dam out Owſe, and ſuffer
the Tide to flow up, (which muſt of neceſſity when Saltors
Load Sluce is taken up) you hazzard the loſs both of the new
Cut and old River; for the making of this new Cut is no more,
then what was done by the Right Honourable, <hi>Francis</hi> Earle of
Bedford, and his participants in Lynne Law, and was called
Sandys River, yet they did never attempt to dam up Owſe; this
River was made then in a direct line to Littleport Chair, and
they then admitting the Tide to flow up Owſe, it was in four or
five years ſilted up and utterly loſt, although they had four times
more Freſhes to maintain it, then this Deſigned River is like to
have: And as to old Owſe, if you admit a Dam upon that,
then the Tide will without all queſtion ſilt up that River, having
little or no Freſhes admitted to run through it to ſcowr the ſilt
away; ſo that conſequently you muſt loſe both the new Cut
and the old Rieer.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is Deſigned, that for the maintaining of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the Weeds in the Rivers are not to be cut or roded in
dry Summers, that the waters may not run out of the Countrey,
but hold up your Freſhes.</p>
            <p>To this I object,<note place="margin">3. Object.</note> That if you keep not your Rivers and
Leading Drains to them-well roded twice in a Summer, you
hazzard your Meadows, and other good Grounds, to a ſudden
flood from the Land-water, for the Weeds hold up the Freſhes
more then Sluces; and theſe Weeds admitted, decayes thoſe
Rivers and Drains they are ſuffered to grow in, and deſtroyes
Navigation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98959:24"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Whereas a multitude of Banks, Weer-Dikes, Cuts, In-drains,
Counter-Banks, Sluces, and Tunnels are Deſigned for the
Draining of this great and flat Level, to the vaſt expence and
charge of the Corporation.</p>
            <p>To this I object,<note place="margin">4. Object.</note> That the number of the ſeveral Works in
this Deſign, is an hundred and odd, and moſt of them vaſt and
chargeable; and if the Sea be admitted to flow into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
they are no wayes able to withſtand the flux of the Tide,
brought in by a Northerly or North-Weſt winde, meeting with
the Land-floods: On the contrary, if the flux of the Sea be
ſtopped at a diſtance from the Level, then they are uſeleſs, and
may prove hurtful, and hinder the deſcent of the Down-fall, or
ſmall Drains, into the three Rivers that will run low to receive
them. Now before this Deſign was known, it was declared,
that there was no leſs then three hundred miles of Banking to
to be repaired, and this new Deſign ſpeaks of more Banks to be
made, with new Cuts, In-drains, and Counter-Banks; which
charge of making and repairing, I fear will coſt more then the
Annual Rent of the 95000. Acres is able to maintain: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe Works mentioned were finiſhed, the whole Level
would be in a perpetual danger; for it is no other then what
hath been practiſed theſe fourteen years, to carry the Freſhes ſo
high, as to ride the Tide; which I doubt not but both the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
and Countrey are ſenſible of the difficulty to effect it
with Banks of Moor Earth, and in truth not to be performed.
As for your Brick-tunnels under your Rivers, they are no wayes
uſeful in this flat Level, whether you admit the Tide in, or
keep it out: If you exclude the Tide, it may be requiſite to
have ſmall Sluces upon the Out-fall of your Creeks and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Drains,
where it may be needful, into the three Rivers, to
hold up water for your Cattle, by reaſon your three Rivers will
run ſo low.</p>
            <p>By this you ſee my Objections and Reaſons againſt the flux
of the Tide into this flat Level, which if that ſhould be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
then you need not the help of thoſe chargeable Moory
Banks, which hath ſo often deceived you, excepting Bedford
River, and Morton's Leam Banks, which in twenty years will
require no repairing, nor can ſuffer any Breaches, by reaſon the
Freſhes cannot lie three neaps of a Tide two foot upon the
Banks. Beſides theſe two now named, there is Burrough ſingle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98959:24"/>
Bank, from Peakirk to Croyland, four miles in length; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Croyland ſingle Bank, from Croyland to Clout-houſe, two
miles in length; theſe muſt be kept in repair to reſiſt the River
Welland, which lies much above our Level, and is excluded from
us; ſo that it is eaſily perceived, that four or five hundred miles
of Banking will be laid aſide as uſeleſs: For if you exclude the
Tide, your vaſt and uncertain Charges will be taken off; but on
the contrary, if you admit the Tide to flow into the Level, as
is intended by this new Deſign, your Banks, Counter-Banks,
Weer-Dikes, and Tunnels, will not ſecure the Level from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation.</p>
            <p>Thus, according to your Order, and for the better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that ſo the truth might the better appear, I humbly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
