            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the name of <hi>Mercury</hi> hath been lately ſo defyl'd, that ſcarce a ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſheete hath appear'd, but it hath aſſumed his Name; yet ſince they have injured him only in his Office, of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick capacity, it is the more pardonable. Reader, the <hi>Mercury</hi> you have ſo much heard of, I am, who do now appear abroad, to ſhew thee, that I have a naturall, or phyſical capacity too, though it be but a moderne one, wherein I am as ſerviceable to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as I was heretofore to <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not yet full an hundred years ſince <hi>Mercury</hi> made <hi>Vulcan</hi> a Cuckold, and had firſt to do with <hi>Venus,</hi> ever ſince vvhich time I am known by the pleaſing appellation of ſweet <hi>Mercury:</hi> Since <hi>Paracelſus</hi> made me one of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, conſtituting me the third principle, or creator of all things, I have been ſufficiently debaſed by his Succeſſors; for whereas heretofore I plaid the theef for mine own uſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110148:3"/>
now the Chymiſts ſend me to the bottome of your pockets to pick the money out for their worſhips; and though they give you nothing in exchange, yet they call it tranſmutation: and if they would ſtop here, they were as reaſonable as other Phyſitians; but they ſend me of an errant into the bowels, and bodies of both ſexes, where I ſhould, though an unpleaſing gueſt, ſo journe all my life, if I did not ſometimes make an eruption, or get out at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther door, like that poor Queene, who ſunke down at Cheering Croſs, and roſe up at Queene-Hive: by this meanes I come to know the ſecrets of perſons, of all conditions and qualities, which for the publick good I do intend to declare in this enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, that I may not be thought a Leveller, I will begin with the Lords in Parliament aſſembled: Into one of whom I got admittance (it ſeems the priviledge of Peeres protects them only from Law, but not from Phyſick) here I expected to have been at the inventing of ſome rare Plot, agreeable to my active nature; for it was juſt as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army had entred upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground; and to that end, thought to have mounted up into this great perſons head, but I found that ſo filled with lead before, that there was no roome for poor <hi>Mercury;</hi> nay, I could not make him ſenſible of the dangerous courſes he run, ſo that I found nothing more certaine then that, <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius.</hi> We ſhould ſtay ſometimes three houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in expectation of what the <hi>Iuncta</hi> of Ladies had contrived, which we ſwallowed without bones; whence I learned, that as the Commons are ſervants to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo the Lords are to the Ladies: but this courſe of life was ſo contrary to my Genius, to ſit ſtill three or four houres and do nothing, that I tooke the opportunity of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110148:3"/>
his yawning, (for he never ſpoke,) to ſteale out of his mouth and be gone; though ſince I heare I might have ſtayed, for that they are now to ſit no more.</p>
            <p>When thus I had obtained my liberty, I found the Army was marching out of <hi>Wales,</hi> to fight the <hi>Scots;</hi> then would I rather then my life have turned Souldier, to have revenged the many injuries, affronts, and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments put upon me by Quacks of that Nation, who are more, I dare ſay, then of all the world beſide; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was a harder matter to get into the Army, then into the houſe of Peers: in ſumme, it vvas impoſſible to obtaine entrance, whether it were that they would not ſpend ſo lightly, or that they have all handſome wives, (as moſt other Preachers have) I know not, but now it will be much more difficult to gain admiſſion, for as much as I underſtand they have caſt off their Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: well fare the Cavalier Souldiers yet, though they are better born, yet they are not ſo hard of acceſs; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, as the Play hath it, is known by his Gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conditions: this I am ſure (my friends of the Army) they would never have ſuffered themſelves to have been twice conquered by ſuch Sectaries as you are, if they had been <hi>tam Marte, quam Mercurio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being diſappointed here, I thought to make my addreſs to the <hi>Iuncta</hi>-Ladyes, that I might comprehend (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Lords I could not, by what deepe and grave councels, this laſt Summers war was mannaged; but I fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of my attempt there too) for they were ſo ſtricken in years (as wiſdome you know, is the daughter of gray haires) and had been ſo accuſtomed to <hi>Mercuries</hi> ſervice, that they were grown (like <hi>Mithridates)</hi> proof againſt me, and knew by experience that I was but like <hi>Herb Iohn</hi> to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110148:4"/>
them, and could doe no further good to their faces, or harme to their bones: all that I learnt here, was, that moſt of the beauties turne wits afterward, as naturally as a Caterpillar becomes a butterflie; and laſt of all arrive to be Statiſts.</p>
            <p>Finding my ſelfe like thus to remaine in <hi>Cuerpo,</hi> I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to doe as Gallants doe, who when (in a long vacation, or plague time) they finde themſelves deſtitute of the amours of gallant Ladies (which, you will ſay, is a hard caſe in theſe dayes) are faine to betake themſelves to <hi>Bloomesbury;</hi> ſo I, rather then I would want a place to hide my head in, rendered my ſelfe at diſcretion to my old enemy the <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> who when he had ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ined and tortured me, ſent me priſoner into the body of a fat Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, who had not long before married a Ladies daughter, by which match he became ſo much a Gentleman, that he was made fit for my Company; at my firſt entrance into his head, I found all in diſorder, nothing but crabbed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails and caſes, but I mended the conveiances in his brain, and opened more obſtructions then are in the ſale of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands: at laſt, his little Law, and leſſe equity, by the help of the nimbleneſſe I lent his tongue, brought <hi>Jndy's</hi> home, for I put mettall into him, and he played they Phyloſophers ſtone, and turned all that mettall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gold; had not he then a good wife, that could heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his eloquence thus, and by her practice mend his? One day my Lawyer went to plead at the Committee of Indempnity, and as he was opening a Petition, I crept up into one of his eyes, to peep out, and looke about me, to ſee if I could ſpie any of my acquaintance, and vvho ſhould I firſt blurt upon, but a worthy Member of that Committee, whoſe inward friend I had long been; when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110148:4"/>
he ſavv me, he was ſo angry, that I ſhould come to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and upbraid him there, that he ſilenced my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, and vvould never heare Petition opened ſince. Notwithſtanding, my Patron was not long after made Sergeant, and as he was trimming himſelfe in the glaſſe, I could not abſtaine from looking abroad againe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold by reflection his reverend aſpect, when finding his beard ſhaved, and a coife on his head, I conceived my ſelfe to be a gueſt to one of theſe ancient procuring Matrons, in whoſe corps I had been ſo often tormented; and without farther ſtudy, broke out at his noſtrils in a ſneeze, and carryed away halfe his braines with me; but the remaining halfe vvill be ſufficient for him now, ſince he is to have double fees.</p>
            <p>When I was got out here, I bethought vvhat could happen to me worſe, and could gueſſe nothing, except I ſhould be ſent (as the Devils were) into ſvvine. Well, imployment grew ſcarſe, and <hi>Mercury</hi> cannot be idle: I was reſolved to trie my fortune anew, and bound my ſelfe apprentice to an Apothecary, who preſently ſold me to one of your renevvers of nature, or menders of Ladies faces, who was a french man, newly come over to recruit, and lengthen out Engliſh beauties; My new Maſter clapt me into a pot, with ſome other ingredients, and ſent me to a Country Lady, new come to Towne, to take off her husbands Sequeſtration, from whom ſhe had received two things in commiſſion: Firſt, to ſtrive to looke faire when ſhe went to the Lords, and then to take care, ſhe fell not acquainted with the wits; and being by a great Lady addreſt to my Maſter, and being ſupplyed in the firſt point, by ſpreading me as thick as bread and butter on her face, ſhe goes one morning to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110148:5"/>
               <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to the lobby by the Lords houſe, but it not being much paſt eleven, which is too early an houre for their Lordſhips, ſhe enquired the way to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Houſe, at whoſe doore ſhe waited, till a ſpruce handſome Gentleman, powdered, perfumed, and ſet round with ribbons of ſeverall colours, came out, to vvhom ſhe makes her application, and cries, Sir, if I were ſure you vvere not one of the wits (as I hope you are none, for you ſeeme to be a fine Gentleman) I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to my lodging; but indeed my husband hath given me warning of thoſe naughty men, who they ſay, if a poore Lady doe but pleaſure a friend, or be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the rheume at the mouth, or a cold in her bones, preſently they make ſongs and libels of her, and doe no more eſteeme the embraces of perſons of quality, then of a milkemaid, or a Landreſſe: The Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, with a low leg, replies, I beſeech you Madam to ſatisfie your ſelfe that I am none of the wits; if I were, I ſhould ſcarce have the honour to ſit vvithin the walls of this houſe: they alas are careleſſe, ſlovenly people; vvhereas I have all my cloathes, powder, linnen, nay, gloves and ribbons out of <hi>France;</hi> beſides, I voted the Army to be disbanded eighteen moneths agoe, with ſix weekes pay, and have ever ſince been of the ſide againſt them, even ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> were beaten, and made a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire at my doore, the laſt 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>November.</hi> And then Madam, tis well knovvne, that I honour great Ladies ſo much, that I am ſeldome out of their company, and had rather looſe my money at twelve-peny-Gleeke with them, though I ſee them jogg one another, or be ſeene with them in a velvet coach in Hide-parke, though it coſt me tvvo peeces in ſtops, or venture my health to enjoy

the oldeſt of them, then be plunged in the embraces of a young, freſh, innocent Countrey beauty, with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of an indempnity in her breech: more he would have ſaid, but my Lady was by this ſatisfied, that the Gentleman was none of the wits, which makes her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to her lodging in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> about eleven a clock that night: he promiſed to obey the ſummons, though for the preſent he was much diſtracted with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique buſineſſe; and had his head full of freedome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſafety.</p>
            <p>He keeps the aſſignation, and comes; after the uſuall complements, ſhe fals to tell the ſtory of her life and buſineſſe, which is too dull for <hi>Mercury</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and conculdes all with an earneſt requeſt, that he will tell her what theſe wits are, that ſhe may avoyde them: he eaſily condeſcends, and begins, Madam, you muſt know, that before theſe warres, the wits were a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, or rather a Monopoly, for no man was ſuffered to be accounted able, or eſteemed for parts, if he were not free of their company, or at leaſt, had licence from them; They ſet up ſome for Schoole Divinty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Others for inventing new Religions; Some for Politicians; The inferiour ſort, for Poltry, and all for Scepticks. Hither all the young Courtiers, and Innes of Court men made their addreſſe, to know whether they might like the laſt new play or no? whether ſuch a Lady might be cride up for a wit? or ſuch a new face rankt among the beauties? vvhether ſuch a worke was well written? and they gave out their orders, as duly as <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Doctrine was to be preacht.

her could prevaile more then all the Sullibubs, and Cheeſcakes of the Age; whereas theſe women (they tell you) had rather heare one crie God dam me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, or whiſtle a French tune, then have whole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadiaes</hi> made to them: then they will count you long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what wiſe diſcreet husbands parents would in thoſe dayes provide for their daughters, and adde, that now, if a young Gentlewoman doe not marry a foole, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will thinke her caſt away; and if the poore Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome prove in time to have any Sparkes of wiſdome, is ready to put him for a cheat. They will urge next, that there was no Lady in thoſe dayes, but ſcorned to accept Diamond Rings, to have Gownes ſent them by Gentlemen out of <hi>France,</hi> to be fancied at Faires, or be truſted by Millaners, for gloves, ribbons, or Spaniſh red, or to walke in the Exchange to have ſweet meates given them. If a woman of quality be led in <hi>Spring gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> by a Gentleman bare-headed, you ſhall have one of them breake a jeſt, and cry, why ſhould men be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe dayes of Reformation to worſhip in Groves? If any of them get admittance into a Ladies chamber, and finde her <hi>Sperma-caeta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>maske,</hi> he exclaimes (by way of a Saryricall ſtrong line) oh what a caſe are we poore men in, that the whales luſt muſt be brought hither to enflame ours! If he finde out her Sunday teeth, though they be of pureſt Ivory, they cannot ſcape him, but he will crie out, What, muſt both the Sea and Land Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Leviathan</hi> and <hi>Bohemoth</hi> contribute to the luxury of this Age? one to plaiſter the cheeke, and the other to repaire the jaw? but theſe are ſometimes ſcorned in their kinde, for I am credibly informed, that he who writ

               <hi>the Parliament of Ladies,</hi> dyed not long after of a Prya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſme, and not a Lady, or Gentlewoman in this Town could be entreated to take pitie on him, and cure him: a judgement much like that, which befell the Author of <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> who loſt a living for want of a Lawyer. Then they are as hard to be pleaſed with men too, and as cenſorious as Schoole-maſters: They will allow a quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be no jeſt, &amp; cannot heare a gingle with patience, they diſpraiſe you <hi>Quarlles,</hi> and <hi>Withers</hi> works, and crie up D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

member did in her husbands, or her buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The deſcription I had heard made of a vvit, filled me with ambition, to be in the poſſeſſion of one of them, vvhich was croſt a long time, for that this Sect of men have little to do vvith Phyſitians; at laſt, by the help of a Baud, and a <hi>Scots-man,</hi> I got entrance into one, who ſoone perceived vvhat gueſt he had (notwithſtanding that the <hi>Scots-man</hi> cry'd, The Deel tack my ſal gif ye gat eny) and vvould never reſt till he vvas rid of me; it ſeems men of the ſame profeſſion cannot bear one another, vvhich was the cauſe that vve two great vvits could not live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one roofe, ſo that by the helpe of an able Quack, he made me be drawn by the head and ſhoulders out of his ſhin-bones; the example, and miracle of vvhich conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt all the wits, and they are ſince married; for though they are ſcattered and diſperſed, yet they, like the <hi>Iews,</hi> keep a ſtrict correſpondency.</p>
            <p>The next body I got into, was a great maſty <hi>London</hi> Parſon, with a red head, which was thus; this Patriarke was not ſo much of the Spirit, but he was ſomewhat for the fleſh too, which made his wife, out of pure jealouſie ſend for me, and put me into a caudle, to diſpatch him; but as the devill would have it, and the ſins of his Pariſh, being brought to him one day, as he was reading the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Occurrences, to examine his Hebrew, and con his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence by heart, to help him out with his next thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Sermon, he ſwallowed me, but his red head overcame me, it being naturall for one poyſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer another, and ſo I could do him no harme: but he had little need of my help, for he never preached, but he could poyſon the people without <hi>Mercury:</hi> he was a great dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110148:8"/>
of State affaires, the Presbyterian members rid him, and he rid the City, and begot Petitions, and Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no man was a more punctuall expecter of the Northren Letters then he, in hope to be inſpired from <hi>Scotland</hi> (for the Spirit, as it did from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> comes thence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very week in a cloakbag) and he was once gathering hands to a Petition, to have the day of the Poſts arrivall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Munday to Saturday, that ſo the people here might know their duty out of the Pulpit a week ſooner: When he inveighed againſt the ſins of his Auditory, he did it with ſo much ſcurility, that they could not be more aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, then they were of him, for he vented Libells in ſtead of Sermons, whilſt they that heard him did pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and his Pulpit was the chair of Repentance for the whole Pariſh: when he chanced to preach before an aſſembly of Ladyes, he would confute open breaſts, and prove black patches to be the marke of the beaſt, and ever was in league with ſome Waiting-woman, or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maide, of whom he learned the name of every pin and knot, the way to put on their cravats, handcharchiefs and cauls, to pin their bought locks to their rolls, and the very ingredients of their waſhes, dentifriſes, and powders to dry ſweat (for it ſeemes <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies muſt, like beefe, be powdered, to keep them from ſtinking) all which ſerved him in ſtead of Schoole Divinity, which he abhorred as Popery, or Cavalariſme: when he came to any Lords, or Parliament mans table (whom he preached into great places, as they voted him into livings) there it was that he chiefly promoted the work of Reformation: he viſited every diſh more ſtrictly then the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and impoſed cenſures on the wine, &amp; ſervants, but would not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110148:8"/>
ſuffer Gluttony to be any of the enumerated caſes, nor cauſe one diſh to be ſuſpended from the bleſſed table: when he was full fraught here (though moſt of the wives and daughters of his Claſſis were at his diſpoſall for their ſpirituall, and his corporall conſolation) he would ſneake into a little blinde bordell in Holborne, where he would have three young wenches whip him; ſo great an enemy was he to the ſuperſtition of <hi>Rome,</hi> that what that Church ordained for pennance to take down the fleſh, he uſed to raiſe it. He married his eldeſt ſon to a Parſons daughter, whoſe father ſoon after deceaſed, and left her portion in Sermons, all of the Presbyterian cut, which being tipt a little with the ſtory of the times, and ſome new inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt the Independents, would have ſerved him all his life, when behold a moſt ſad accident; the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters of Sion (for ſo the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtile themſelves) had juſt changed their old tune, and learned another of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troopers, and had ſent ſtrict orders to their ſubjects here, that no more Presbytery ſhould be heard of in the Pulpit, no more Independents delivered to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than; this put him into great ſtraights, as well what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to preach, as what Religion to be of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he have any, I beleeve he is by this, a Seeker, for I came away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking leave, having perſwaded two of his teeth to fall out to open me a paſſage, and make his tedious diſcourſes in the Pulpit leſs intelligible.</p>
            <p>By this time you will beleeve I had need of a little aire, vvhich I went to take in St. <hi>Iameſes</hi> Parke, vvith a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if I could, like the Camelion, live by it, never to be a Caniball, and feed on mans fleſh more: vvhen I came into the Parke, it was Sunday after Sermon, and by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110148:9"/>
reaſon that Spring garden was by ſpeciall order ſhut, and ſo the tarts and rheniſh-wine ſuſpended till the next day; I found the great walke full of Ladies and Gentlemen, and all of my acquaintance, which made me ſteale back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for fear of being ingaged; and as I vvas nigh the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gate, a leane chapfaln Chymiſt ſtarts out of the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, ſnaps me up, and vvhen he had conveied me home, clapt me into a Pill, and carried me the next morning to a grave Member of the Houſe of Commons, of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian judgement: the Gentleman made many faces, &amp; was very unwilling to ſwallow me, for (as I underſtood ſince) he tooke me for the ſelf-denying Ordinance; at length he paſt me, and I began to comfort my ſelf, in hope now to comprehend the true meaning of the Covenant; but I ſoone found that he knew no more of that then I, but had truſted the Aſſembly with the interpretation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they the <hi>Scots;</hi> he never ſpake in the Houſe till he received a nod from ſome of the Grandees of his <hi>luncta,</hi> whom they needed not trouble themſelves to keep in ignorance, Nature had ſaved them that labour: He never ſpoke <hi>Non-ſence,</hi> but he told Mr. Speaker twas the ſenſe of the City, and thought the beſt Government in the world, was a Commoncounſell; at laſt I began to diſlike the dulneſs of my clime, and reſolved to be gone, and thought to have taken my opportunity one day, when the Houſe was divided, and thoſe of my Patrons faction went out, but he (conceiting that two vallant Independents, who ſtood neer the door, looked ſterne upon him) durſt not go out, but hath been ever ſince for a balloting box, and was in minde once to move the Houſe, that (ſeeing he, and many more of his party had voted Blindfold, for above
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110148:9"/>
two years together) thoſe two Gentlemen might at leaſt be blinded, when the Houſe was divided, that ſo people might go according to their conſciences: Well, thought I, tis not ſafe for me to dwel with a man of ſo little courage, leſt I be knocked; ſo when his noſe dropt, I ſlipt out, and got into the noſegay of him that was next me, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be of the other faction, he ſoone ſnuft me up into his noſe, and thence into his head.</p>
            <p>When I began to underſtand his ſecrets, I wondred to ſee him there, for I found that he was no member, but unlawfully returned; and looking into his conſcience, perceived he was no Independent neither, only he had received this light, that the only way to ſtay in the houſe, was to ſeeme ſo, and his ſtaying there the only way to eſcape the comming to an account for fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds he owed the State. <hi>Mercury</hi> was never in his own element till he came to him, for I learned my old trade of ſtealing, perfecter then ever; I uſed before to filch here and there, a bit from ſuch as were not aware of me; but I was with one now, who took all he ſaw, even from them that truſted him, and like <hi>Midas,</hi> turned every thing he touched into gold. Then he had other trades too, he would fall in talke with people he never ſaw, and make them ſpeak againſt the Army, which he adored (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince their great Remonſtrance ſpeaks nothing of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countants and would threaten to informe, except they compounded with him: nay, he was the Grandees ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to watch what the Presbyterians who ſate next him whiſpered one to another; he applied himſelf to the Congregations too, would have been entred at the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Club at the Roſe, but they were too honeſt for

him, and would talke all day of glorious lights, and ſteale at night to a baudy houſe, without ſo much as a Lanthorne and candle; whether for ſecreſie I know not, or covetouſneſſe; for he was ſo ſparing, that two pence roaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>beefe in Hell was a feaſt to him, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't vvhen the Houſe was up, for ſooner he durſt not goe, though he ſhould have ſtarved, for feare of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing the Grandees: This cuſtome kept him faſting ſo long, that I began to be in danger of my life (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kills <hi>Mercury</hi> ſooner then faſting ſpittle) which made me thinke of diſlodging, and I tooke my opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity one Sunday, as he was preaching in a Coach-houſe, in Vinegar yard, and came out of him without a lavvfull call.</p>
            <p>Reader, I ſhould now deſcend, to acquaint thee with my ſeverall tranſmigrations through the Ladies of this Town, vvith many of which I have had not only a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall correſpondence (as vvith the ſequeſtered) but much intimacie too; I ſhould relate how I was toſt like a Shuttle-cock, from this Lady, to that Lord, from him, to the next waiting-woman, and ſo to the Roarers, where I learnt to ſtand bare to exchange women, and call Chamber-maids Madam, and by them ſent to the Citie, and ſo backe againe to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> How I went in the long vacation to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and hovv I paſt my time there, but this would require a volume by it ſelfe, and vvould containe a Diurnall, or rather Nocturnall of the women of this Town. But moſt men being ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in the vvritings of others, and malice being the greateſt ingenuitie of this Age, I feare I ſhould not want Commentators, vvho would point out every Subject, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110148:10"/>
if ſhe vvere named, or glanc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t at, vvhich proceedings <hi>Mercury</hi> abhorres; nothing but this can ſublimate me, and make me poyſon, by rendring that a Libell, which was meant a faithfull hiſtory: And though I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that if I ſhould take ſo bad a courſe, I might happily pleaſe more generally, then I diſpleaſe; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of theſe times having no higher pleaſure, or greater Lechery, then to heare one another ſpoke ill of, and to joyne in the defamation; yet all that cannot vvorke with <hi>Mercury,</hi> who amongſt all his thefts, never ſtole any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reputation from him; and though he have much of a French man, yet he is unlike them in this qualitie of theirs, that if they get poſſeſſion of a beauty, they cannot reſt, till they proclaime her name to all the world: No, the obligation I have to that Sex, is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to expect ſuch a returne, they having kept me out of Gilders ſhops, and Schoole-Maſters clutches (vvhere I ſhould have made ointments for ringwormes, and waters for ſcabbie Children) to give me a noble ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in their owne bodies and boſomes. Thus much notwithſtanding, to avoid calumnies, I am forced to ſay in generall, for mine ovvne juſtification, That many of theſe beauties having made their breath ſtink with talking bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, would lay the fault upon poore <hi>Mercury.</hi> And as for the old ſaying, that Ladies never piſs, but ſpit only, though the modeſty of that, &amp; all ſuch expreſſions be wholly laid aſide, few fearing to avow any evacuation of nature, or to call it by any name; yet that Proverb was never lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally true till now, for few females of my acquaintance void any moiſture, but at the pores, and mouth: Sure, if I had been as much in credit thirtie yeares agoe, as now,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110148:11"/>
this Nation might have been happy, and have avoided this warre, and undone hackney Coach-men; for the Children of this Age (I meane ſtall of Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) which will be men the next, will be of too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a conſtitution to make Troopers of, and will be contented to travell up and downe, in Chaires and Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. See then rare beauties the reciprocall obligation you have to <hi>Mercury,</hi> who hath not only changed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into more ſhapes then ever <hi>Jupiter</hi> did, to ſerve your Sex, but even of a God, made himſelfe corruptible, to be diſgeſted by you, and converted into you, and your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; ſo that whilſt he lives, he lives ſerving you, and when he is killed, his deſire is that he may be employed to make Looking-glaſſes, that ſo he may ever be before your faces.</p>
