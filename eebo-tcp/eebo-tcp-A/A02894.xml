            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and vnderſtanding of man, cannot bee euer drawne beyond the beginning of time, or the extent: So neither without time was euer any man begotten, beſides Chriſt which was <hi>man and God,</hi> and as vpon this day was borne <hi>Man:</hi> whom if wee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to haue beene made, that is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: If wee thinke that hee was not begotten, wee ſhall then derogate much from the Deitie: If wee denie his Humanitie, we then runne the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of loſing our eternall ſafety,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15600:8"/>
being the fruit and end of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie. Thus (to ſpeake in generall) muſt wee acknowledge euery thing in God to bee farre aboue the ſtraine of reaſon, but nothing beyond the reach of faith. No leſſe ought wee to conceiue of <hi>God the Sonne</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar. For hee is alſo <hi>totall</hi> God, as hee is <hi>totall</hi> man; and yet not <hi>totally</hi> God becauſe hee is alſo man; nor <hi>totally</hi> man, becauſe hee is alſo God. O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable vnion! Surely, this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and combination of the diuine &amp; humane nature, proceeded only from the immediate and ſole act of the Deitie. And therefore now, O man, ſee that thou adore and reuerence this myſterie, and vpon this day thinke vpon thy happy eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, purchaſed by the obedience and humility of thy <hi>Sauiour:</hi> who being <hi>borne</hi> as vpon this day, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>begotten</hi> from euerlaſting: &amp; being God, for mans ſake, became man: <hi>There being no way to ſaue man but by dying for man, and no way to dye for man, but by being man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:15600:9"/>
Here may, wee beholde both his <hi>Deitie</hi> and <hi>Humanitie:</hi> The one muſt worthily be <hi>esteemed,</hi> becauſe the other is worthy to bee <hi>admired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man</hi> could not be made <hi>God,</hi> and therefore <hi>God</hi> became <hi>Man.</hi> And to this end &amp; purpoſe, that thou, O man, mighteſt acknowledge thy <hi>Creators</hi> power, &amp; embrace thy <hi>Sauiors</hi> lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that ſo, although his Maieſty <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> thee, yet his Humility may <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>It will bee worthy our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, if we think, how, as vpon this day God that is moſt purely immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and free from all ſhadow of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity, was vnited vnto a body: how he that was inuiſible became appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and euident; how he that could not bee diſcerned by the touch, was as vpon this day encompaſſed with the claſping armes of his tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: How hee that neuer had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, now beganne to be: and laſtly, how the Sonne of God became the Sonne of man. So that as vpon this day, God and men, heauen and earth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15600:9"/>
mortality and eternity, humanity and diuinitie were combined. In whom? in our Sauiour: <hi>Whom the Father hath appointed Heyre of all things, by whome alſo he made the World, being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his glory, and the expreſſe image or character of his perſon,</hi> who being no leſſe <hi>admirable</hi> for his humility, then <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> in reſpect of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, deſcended farre below the pitch of his eminencie, that hee might <hi>preſerue by his mercy,</hi> what hee had <hi>created by his omnipotency.</hi> Hee that once was cloathed with the luſtre of glory and maieſty, <hi>no leſſe terrible then admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> whom neither Angels nor Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, nor Seraphims, nor Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims could endure to behold; he that once was Lord of hoſts, the God of glory, hee that once could with his onely countenance turne the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines topſie-turuie, and wind-ſhake the foundations of the whole earth: Hee I ſay, as vpon this day, <hi>for vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one of vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vnſpeakable <hi>Maiesty of the Father</hi> manageth the myſterie, the <hi>inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable</hi>

               <hi>loue and affection of the Sonne</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth our <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>incomprehenſible power of the Spirite</hi> reſideth within the narrow limits of the wombe; albeit it cannot bee contained in the vaſte ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity &amp; circuit of the world. On this day was death vanquiſhed, becauſe life was produced: On this day was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboliſhed, becauſe truth was mani feited: on this day was errour aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, becauſe the true way was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: on this day was the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of mercie, and the dole of heauen</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, which hee that eates ſhall not die; but liue eternally. O bleſſed day, O beautifull and glorious day! A day without <hi>euening</hi> or <hi>ending;</hi> the verie period of mortalitie, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and <hi>alpha</hi> of eternitie. A day of our ſecond Natiuitie and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wheron, that <hi>man</hi> might <hi>bee borne of God, God would be borne like man.</hi> In the Creation <hi>man</hi> was formed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the image of God, but now God taketh vpon him the Image of man.</p>
            <p>In the beginning God made man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15600:10"/>
of the earth: but now euen GOD himſelfe is made that that hee made, that that might not periſh that he had made. Now therefore, let the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of man be defaced, ſeeing the wiſedome of God is ſo clearely manifeſted. Henceforth, the lame ſhall walke, the blinde ſhall ſee, the deafe ſhall heare, the dumbe ſhall ſpeake, the dead ſhall reuiue, and that with one word, becauſe it is the <hi>Word</hi> that ſpeaketh, yea &amp; without a word, becauſe it is <hi>God</hi> that commaundeth. O ioyfull day!

Her ſoule was as it were diuulſed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from her body, by an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and ſerious contemplation of her Creator; and the ſurrendering her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto him alone, was no leſſe <hi>wrapt</hi> in the bond and tyes of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, then ſhe was <hi>rapt</hi> in admiration of his loue towards her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is that that quencheth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth all the flames of luſt, and exorbitant loue.

So <hi>Elias</hi> in times paſt, after hee had often faſted, and had giuen the fire of zeale reſidence on the golden altar of his heart, was not long after rapt vp into heauen in a fiery Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot.

            <p>And indeed the vnion of ſpirits is more neere and ſtrict then the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and copulation of bodies.

            <p>Come now yee chaſte Matrons, and pure virgins, which hitherto

haue ſcarce defiled your ſelues ſo much as in thought; come I ſay (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the cuſtome of women) and viſite this bleſſed Virgin-mother deliuered of ſo happy an iſſue. Heere is nothing about her vnclean or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous, nothing vnworthy your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nothing that may not become a Virgine. For this bleſſed Infant, was not begotten in luſt, but in entire chaſtitie; <hi>Not by the will of the fleſh, but of the Spirit.</hi> Come therefore, I ſay, yee chaſte maidens and matrons, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>this babe</hi> your <hi>Sauiour</hi> with the <hi>armes</hi> of zeale, apprehend him with the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Deuote your whole liues vnto his ſeruice, and endeauour not ſo much how you may be <hi>fruitful</hi> in bodye, as <hi>faithfull</hi> in ſoule. Come, draw neere, caſt your eyes vpon this bleſſed maide and mother of Chriſt, in whom wee ſee childe-birth not to haue impayred her virginitie, nor her virginitie to haue hindred her childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. O bleſſed virgin, O happy <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie!</hi> Embleme of virginitie, patterne of Modeſtie! For, howſoeuer thou
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15600:21"/>
aboue all other women art crowned with honour and dignitie, in that thou art a mother vnto thy Lord, as thou art his handmaide; yet ſuch is thy pietie and humilitie that thou waxeſt not proud or inſolent hereby. Many were thoſe gracious thoughts that ſhe continually entertained, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were thoſe patheticall eiaculations which ſhe ſent vp vnto heauen. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that had ſo gracious a woman eſpouſed vnto him, as <hi>Marie:</hi> and yet more happy was hee, in that the protection and tuition of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour was deputed vnto him. I doubt not but that hee was ſorry that hee had no fit roome to receiue him, that the place wherein they ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was ſo meane, ſo vngarniſht, ſo vnfurniſht, ſo vnprouided both of <hi>meate and vtenſiles.</hi> How <hi>carefully</hi> did he ponder euery circumſtance? How <hi>cheerefully</hi> did hee acknowledge that <hi>onely faith</hi> muſt <hi>beleeue,</hi> what <hi>onely God</hi> doth <hi>effect?</hi> Now (beloued) ſeeing we are proceeded thus farre, let vs alſo thinke vppon thoſe that came vnto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15600:22"/>
this miracle. Surely they were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſimple Idiots: <hi>There were in the ſame countrey Shepheards abiding in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the field, keeping watch ouer their ſtocks by night.</hi> Kings and Potentates were ignorant of all this, and had no notice of Chriſt his Natiuitie. They ſleepe whiles Chriſt cometh. So ſecret and vnexpected ſhall hee come, when hee ſhall come the ſecond time <hi>as a thiefe in the night.</hi> Now a chiefe thing to bee obſerued in this hiſtorie, is, that the Angels made choyce of Shepheards an innocent and illiterate ſort of men, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt partakers of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed newes of Chriſt his birth. The reaſon was (I coniecture) becauſe they might with more facilitie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue the tydings. For as Wooll that hath receiued the die and tincture of no colour, is capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: ſo theſe bleſſed ſhepheards which were neuer before indued with any kinde of ſecular wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, were more apt ſubiects to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine celeſtiall and tranſcendent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations. The ſureſt meanes to ſore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15600:22"/>
vp into heauen, are the wings of faith: that that ſooneſt <hi>depriueth</hi> vs of thoſe wings, and <hi>depraueth</hi> our affections, is nothing elſe but an inſolent preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an eleuated conceit of our owne vnderſtandings. O how hard a matter would it haue bene to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any of that Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (I meane the Ethnicke opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Philoſophers) to haue beleeued that the Soueraign of the whole world ſhould be borne man on earth? O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee that wiſedome, which in the myſterie of our ſaluation, hath exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded humane wiſedome! For they that were neuer guiltie of any learning &amp; extraordinarie knowledge, they that could not diſpute, and could not but belieue, were the prime and firſt that were acquainted with a matter of ſo great conſequence.</p>
            <p>The great Clerkes and Scholers of the world, who examined all by the <hi>Touchſtone of reaſon,</hi> who euer prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>vnderſtanding before beliefe,</hi> were vtterly diſcarded, and Heardmen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whoſe plaineſſe of ſimplicitie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15600:23"/>
was a great cauſe of their mature and ſpeedy proficiency: <hi>Unto you is borne this day in the City of Dauid, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2, 10.</note> 
               <hi>which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Firſt of of all, they learne that Chriſt is borne, and then vnto them. What follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? It is ſaid (verſe 16) That <hi>they came with haſte, and found Mary and Ioſeph, and the Babe lying in a manger.</hi> Theſe ſhepheards found that good ſhepheard, which was reſolued to lay downe his life for his ſheepe. They finde that vniuerſall ſhepheard, that ſhepheard, whoſe ſheepefold is of no leſſe extent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole earth. They finde that ſhepherd, which hereafter <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> ſhall ſeuer the ſheepe from the goates. Nay, they come vnto that ſheepe, or rather vnto that <hi>immaculate Lambe of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> 
               <hi>God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> They come vnto the Lambe, but vnto ſuch a <hi>Lambe,</hi> as was alſo <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda,</hi> Who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he then lay in the manger, yet not long after hee was aduanced vnto his throne.</p>
            <p>Hence (Beloued) may we collect
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15600:23"/>
how much God fauoureth holy and modeſt ſimplicitie, and diſalloweth all nice and ſcrupulous ſubtiltie. The firſt that heard the voyce of the Angel, were the ſhepheards; the firſt that heard the report of the good newes, were no more then ſhepheards. And yet notwithſtanding, euen theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards were farre more happy then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who hauing the third time bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the dores of <hi>Ianus,</hi> and appeaſed all tumultuous garboiles of warre and ſedition, which were then raging and predominant, both on ſea and land; yet knew not that Bleſſed, bleſſed peace and reconciliation which was wrought betweene God and man. Go too therefore yee bleſſed ſhepheards, vnto whom the good tidings were fully ſignified; you that were neuer ambitious of ſoueraignety, or a blaſt of fame; you that neuer ſtudyed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring ſophiſtrie of Monkes and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor how to coine the copper Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſmes of the fallacious Ieſuites; you can neyther deceyue, nor this day bee deceyued, becauſe yee belieue onely

what hath beene deliuered vnto you from the mouth of God: Goe, I ſay, and relate vnto your friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance what Chriſt hath done for man.

For now you ſee the beloued <hi>Emanuel</hi> hath preſented himſelfe vnto the world: now are the former ages renued again. Now are all things poſſeſſed with ioy and gladnes. O what ſugred pſalms &amp; celeſtial odes were written by <hi>Dauid</hi> concerning Chriſt repreſented vnto him onely in the dim glaſſe of tipes &amp; figures? why ſhould not we that liue in theſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times honor him with our prime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours?

Now if you deſire I ſhould ſpecific vnto you thoſe that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto our Sauiour, I ſhall eaſilie accompliſh your deſire. There was firſt a Quire of Angels, and they ſang his birth-ſong.

There were the rude and vnlearned, the ſhepheards. All which if we compare them together, we ſhal finde betwixt them a great diſparitie: who notwithſtanding were all equall, and not one inferiour vnto an other: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f we conſider them as they all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and adored the new borne Infant, as they all ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto him, as they all celebrated the day of his Natiuitie. Would yee how vnderſtand what virgin was at the birth of Chriſt? I may anſwer you that a virgin was a chiefe agent, or rather a patient in the myſterie. Such a Virgin as brought forth her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, beeing notwithſtanding no leſſe

a virgine then a mother, and more a mother then hee was a ſonne: for in reſpect of his Diuinity, he was her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as onely in regard of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he was her Sonne. So that Chriſt was not onely <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne, but alſo <hi>Dauids</hi> Lord: and not onely the Son of man, but alſo the Father of man; not onely of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo the Father of <hi>Abraham;</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe no leſſe the promiſer of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> then the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. O bleſſed and happie day! on which hee that from euerlaſting hath had, and hath his throne in heauen, deſcended euen to the ſocietie of men This day is the day of our Marriage, of our affinitie, of our reſtauration, of our reunition vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Hell. On this day, hee that is the eternall God, and ſtill remaining what hee was, for our ſakes became what hee was not. On this day, he that without a Body was eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, by the aſſumption of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſeemed to limit and confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto place; that we might obtain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15600:27"/>
that happineſſe by grace, which hee had by the right of his nature.</p>
            <p>O happy day much wiſhed, long expected! the abrogation of the Law, the period of all propheſies, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpell, yea the Goſpell it ſelfe: The Goſpell which was firſt proclaymed from heauen, and after publiſhed on earth, to the end that there might not bee wanting <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>confirme</hi> it, nor <hi>faith</hi> in men to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> it.</p>
            <p>O how ſweet is the remembrance of that day! how comfortable both to men and Angels!</p>
            <p>True it is, that wee cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue this Myſterie; and yet wee reioyce in it. True it is, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diue into the depth and profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and what though we cannot? Haue not holy men that haue totallie deuoted themſelues vnto the exerciſes of religion and piety, beene as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as we are? If yee beleeue me not, let mee entreate you to caſt your eyes vpon olde <hi>Simeon,</hi> who, howſoeuer the Scribes and Phariſes were buzzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15600:28"/>
and could not behold the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe;</hi> yet hee foreſaw him <note place="margin">Mal. 4.</note> long before hee came. And when hee ſaw that hee was come, O how was hee tranſported with ioy! How was he carried away vvith the ſtreame and torrent of ouerflowing gladnes? O with what zeale of heart, with what ſwiftneſſe of foot did he flye vnto his Sauiour, ſo long expected, and now at length exhibited? how earneſtly did hee embrace him, not onely with the armes of his <hi>body,</hi> but alſo of his <hi>affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> How willing was hee to pay his tribute vnto nature? How deſirous to ſhake hands with the world, and its emptie vanities, and to reſign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the hands of God? With how relenting a ſoule, with what ſweet ſhowers of teares in the inſtant before his death, did hee warble out his Swan-like funerall ſong? Now beſides holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> may we behold many of the ſacred retinue, as firſt of all <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> a continuall ſpectator and obſeruer of the myſterie. Beſides, <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> there was <hi>Iohn</hi> the forerunner
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15600:28"/>
of Chriſt, and a Preacher in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: And beſides thoſe, many holy women more <hi>religious</hi> then <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, beſides the Women, there were the Apoſtles of Chriſt, who were inſtructed with diuine wiſdome by the <hi>inſpiration</hi> of the holy Spirite, not by <hi>anticipation</hi> of <hi>ſecular knowledge,</hi> which wee commonly tearme the <hi>Handmaid vnto Diuinity.</hi> Neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Apoſtles ſtood bleſſed <hi>Peter,</hi> and not farre off were the glorious Angels, who though they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly endued with varietie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet now they could neither ſing nor ſay any thing, but <hi>Glorie be to God on high, and on earth, peace.</hi> Alas, it was not their ambition to purchaſe vnto themſelues a blaſte of fame, and applauſe of the World. Their chiefeſt intent was to prayſe him who was then borne.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore ſooth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his learning, and multiplicitie of knowledge. For this day is a day whereon wee ought with modeſty to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15600:29"/>
confeſſe our ignorance. This day belongeth chiefly vnto the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and vnto thoſe that are but punies in the Schoole of Chriſt. On this day the Wiſdome of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to deſcend below its moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated &amp; tranſcendent pitch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. On this day the Word of God vouchſafed to ſpeake as inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately as man in his childhood and infancy.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore take on, or thinke himſelfe diſgraced, in that hee is not furniſht with the abilities of nature, or not garniſht with the rules and precepts of art; ſeeing that God, that hee might diſappoint thoſe that were well ſeene in the points of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, made choyce to diſcloſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto thoſe that were but meane and ſimple. It ſhall therefore bee beſt for vs, not to ſoare too high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the myſteries of God, leſt at laſt, we flag and flye low with a broken pinion. Let vs, beloued, rather ſettle and reſt our ſelues in a ſober and ſafe ignorance, which will not onely not

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15600:31"/>
and inueſt vs with the glory of a better Kingdome, was, not without the hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour and amazement both of heauen and earth, moſt barbarouſly ſlaine and put to death by thoſe, for whoſe ſake he came into the world; by thoſe, to whom hee had often ſent his Legates and Ambaſſadours; by thoſe, whoſe ſaluation he had reſolued to purchaſe by the effuſion of his moſt precious bloud.</p>
            <p>Such is the weight and grauity of this theame and argument, which by my future diſcourſe I determine to purſue, that it may eaſily inaudience the Hearer, and procure in him ready and fauourable attention (a thing that Oratours vſually entreate in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme of their Orations.) And therfore for my part I will not bee ſo prodigal of my breath or vnneceſſary paines, as to importune you to heare me: for I am well aſſured that you expect not the enchanting flouriſhes, or ſugred blandiſhments of Rhetoricke, being ſolely contented to entertaine a bare Diſcourſe vpon the <hi>Paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour;</hi>

            <p>For if wee duly conſider all thoſe tragicall Scenes, and dolefull paſſages of his life, euen from his <hi>cratch</hi> vnto his <hi>croſſe;</hi> wee ſhall finde them to haue beene nothing elſe but a <hi>Mappe</hi> of miſerie, or a <hi>ſea</hi> of calamitie. For hee was no ſooner borne, but hee endured the ſharpeneſſe of a bloudy circumciſion: he was no ſooner cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but by and by he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the ſlaughter; hee had no ſooner publiſhed his heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but forth with hee was accuſed of ſedition, impiety, blaſphemie, fury; and not onely ſo, but hee was tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med euen a Diuell, and that of thoſe, whome aboue all the Nations of the world hee had vouchſafed to ſtile his <hi>peculiar people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whither ſoeuer I caſt mine eyes, I can behold nothing but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and reproches, and pouerty, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15600:32"/>
hunger, and thirſt, and weakeneſſe, &amp; wearineſſe; ſo that it ſeemeth, that our bleſſed Sauiour vpon his Croſſe made vp the full meaſure of that griefe and anguiſh, with which hee laboured &amp; was perplexed all his life long, &amp; then to haue ſucked out euen the very dregges of that bitter cuppe, which hee had but formerly taſted. Inſomuch that when wee meditate vpon thoſe many troubles and torments, with which he was voluntarily afflicted, to the end that hee might <hi>pacifie his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath, and ſatisfie his Fathers iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:</hi> we may well imagine, and bee aſcertained, that he alone is the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute embleme &amp; patterne of patience and perſeuerance.</p>
            <p>The ſtrict Stoickes that ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues in their obdurate <hi>indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> came very ſhort of him.

            </p>
            <p>After that our Sauiour had ſent vp many frequent and feruent eiaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto God the Father, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of his deare &amp; diſtreſſed Church; (for whoſe ſake no leſſe <hi>willingly,</hi> then <hi>valiantly</hi> he endured the weight of ſo many grieuous afflictions;) by and by after, hauing retired himſelfe into a ſhady priuate garden, hee was moſt impetuouſly affronted by <hi>Iudas,</hi> and a barbarous troupe of Souldiers.

bloud.

            <p>As for the reſt of our Sauiour his dependences, thoſe, I meane, whom he had eyther peculiarly inſtructed, or any way releeued, eyther by reſtoring of their ſight, or by ſtaying the fluxe of a bloudy and menſtruous iſſue; or by reuniting, and as it were, cemen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting the crazed members of thoſe that had beene poſſeſſed with a ſhiuering palſie. All thoſe, I ſay (whereof the multitude was almoſt infinite) baſely hide their heads, and withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cleane away.</p>
            <p>Thus was our bleſſed Sauiour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by thoſe that ſhould haue reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued and ſupported him.

How contemptuouſly doe they ſtrike him? enquiring of him, whether hee can tell <hi>who it was that did ſtrike him?</hi> and not onely ſo, but alſo by the iniurious commaund of the High-Prieſt, hee himſelfe being the High-Prieſt of all mankind, is diſgracefully whipped. The <hi>ignorant and arrogant</hi> Phariſes, and Doctors of the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully accuſe the authour and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of the Law. <hi>Herod</hi> with his officious glozing Courtiers and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices deride his ſilence, and that they may the more expoſe him to laughter, they chaunge his garment. The Souldiers that had embrued their blades in the bloud of Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15600:34"/>
moſt impiouſly batter and buffet him. And not onely ſo, but they alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their filthy foame vpon his moſt glorious face. And that they may heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and yet adde more maturity vnto their ful blowne impietie, they ſet a crowne of thornes vpon that head of his; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as in a casket) all the Iewels of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome and knowledge were inſhrined. There was not ſcarſe any part of his whole body, that was not either expoſed to reproach, or tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by griefe. His head pierced with thornes, beaten with fiſts, bruiſed with ſtaues; his face beſlimed with ſpittle, his cheekes ſwelled out with blowes, his tongue and palate offended with diſtaſtefull vineger and gall, his eares ſurcharged with loades of diſgracefull contumelies. How thinke you did Chriſt behaue himſelfe in this caſe?

ſpeake ſomething for himſelfe, and yet (maugre all their furie and exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations) he replyes not ſo much as a word vnto them. Why doeſt thou O Infidell, enquire the reaſon and cauſe of this patient ſilence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? Why doeſt thou after his death recrucifie him againe? Let me but aske thus much of thee? To whom ſhould Chriſt haue returned an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere? To <hi>Pilate?</hi> Alas hee knew but little in the ſtate of the queſtion. To the Iewes? No, they were his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. What ſhould he haue anſwered? Hee had already made knowne vnto them that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> This was the onely motiue and impulſiue cauſe why he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uented. This was that that his Aduerſaries ſo earneſtly purſued; ſhould he haue denyed him ſelfe to haue beene the <hi>Sonne of God?</hi> No. That hee would not, hee could not doe. Truth cannot lye.</p>
            <p>Thus much he had both intimated and profeſſed. As for his allegiance vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which they would haue induced him to haue denyed, it was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15600:35"/>
to no purpoſe, to make any mention of that. For alas, it was not his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſit vpon the throne, and to be placed in the <hi>honour-point</hi> of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdome; it was not that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. No, he came into the world for no ſuch purpoſe. Hee rather came that hee might gather together his Church, diſperſed and driuen to and fro vpon the ſurface of the earth, that he might, as it were, reedifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed race of mankind; that he might ſaue his people by his <hi>bloud,</hi> and by his <hi>word;</hi> by his <hi>miracles,</hi> and by his <hi>oracles.</hi> The obdurate and peruerſe Iewes were ignorant of this, &amp; much more the Romanes. They knew not what he meant by the deſtroying of the Temple, or by the repayring of it in three dayes. And therefore they are with no leſſe <hi>fury</hi> then <hi>blindnes</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againſt him; who after they had laſhed him almoſt vnto death, &amp; moſt cruelly diuided thoſe azure channels of his bloud, they bring him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like being ouerflowne with gore, and moſt diſdainefully expoſe him to the

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him that was the <hi>fayrest among men, being both white and ruddie, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand. His head is as the moſt fine golde, his lackes buſhie &amp; blacke as a Rauen: His eyes are the eyes of doues by the riuers of waters, waſhed with milke, and fitly ſet: His cheekes as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers; his lips like Lillies, dropping ſweet ſmelling myrrhe.</hi> Hee that was thus ſet out, and embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with ſo many gracefull orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lyeth now disfigured with wounds, weltring and panting in a crimſon riuer of his owne bloud.

And that that was moſt lamentable &amp; grieuous vnto him, he was ſo captiuated, as that he had not means to wipe away either his bloud or his Teares, that trickled downe all about his precious bodie.</p>

All which, mee thinke, might eaſily ſoften and intenerate a flintie heart, and yet the Iewes were nothing moued at it. Who being tranſported with furie and madneſſe, they now goe about to depriue him of life and all. And that they may make his griefe paralell to his diſgrace, they charge his weary ſhoulders with the weight of his burdenſome croſſe. And not onely ſo, but they appoint their malepert officious Sergeants to attend him, and giue in charge, that if he pace it ſlowly, or falter vnder his carriage, they ſhould with bloudy ſcourges force him on amaine.</p>

Our Sauiour being brought to this grieuous ſtreight and exigent, his ſtrength fainting, his heart panting, his voyce fayling and euen <hi>drops</hi> doe I ſay? nay, <hi>flouds</hi> of water and bloud ſpringing from all the pores and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his body, doth notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vouchſafe to direct his deiected countenance and languiſhing eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs miſerable and moſt vnthankeful caitifes, that neyther ſympathize with him in his calamity, nor ſo much as remember, that hee himſelfe ſtood in the vantguard of the battell, and with his helmet of <hi>Patience</hi> ſheltred vs from the gunneſhot of his Fathers indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

When I created thee of the duſt of the earth, I made thee like vnto my ſelfe. But thou by the allurement &amp; inſtigation of the Diuell, diddeſt moſt diſobediently deſire to be like vnto

mee, in what was not fitte thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and ſo becameſt like vnto the Deuill, that arch-lyer of the world, the patronizer and abettour of thy ambitious enterpriſe. Thou, ſinfull as thou art, haſt almoſt razed out the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred impreſſe of my Diuinity, ſet with mine owne finger in the chryſtall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thy ſoule; and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I ſo much diſparaged my ſelfe, as to take vpon me the forme &amp; ſhape of thine abiect and contemptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For thy fleſh I aſſumed, and yet not its impurity; but, as it were, in its prime integrity, refined and purged from that droſſe and menſtruous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which reſided in it. And yet for al this I affected no ſtate or pompe in my <hi>comming</hi> vnto thee; howſoeuer the Fathers and Patriarks in the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and infancie of the World lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for it; and the Prophets after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> often mentioned it. <hi>Moſes</hi> did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it, <hi>Dauid</hi> did did fore ſing it, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did foreſay it. The Euangelicall Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> did moſt plainely and punctually expreſſe it, hauing then no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15600:38"/>
other meanes to relieue the diſcon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late mindes of the Iewes, but onely by aſſuring them of my <hi>comming.</hi> But when I came, I found my entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not ſquaring to my expectation. Where I looked for <hi>amity,</hi> I found <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> I receyued hatred for my good will; and for caſting out of Diuels, I was accounted one for my labour. O ſenſeleſſe ingratitude! Thus was my <hi>humilitie no leſſe miſconceyued,</hi> then my <hi>maiesty vnconceiued!</hi> and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it was my dayly endeauour to doe good vnto all men. Eyther I cured the bleeding wounds of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conſcience with the balme of conſolation; or I reclaimed the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſinner, and brought him againe vnto my folde; or I gaue eyes vnto the blind, or feer to the lame, or ſpeech to the dumbe, or health to the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or bread to the hungrie: and, if at any time bread were wanting, there neuer wanted a myracle to ſupplie it. If a mother lamented the death of her onely ſonne, eyther I reſtored life to the dead, or conſolation to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15600:39"/>
If any woman wanted wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I gaue her better then ſhe thought, <hi>Euen the water of life.</hi> I abhorred not <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> ſo much as <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> I was familiarly conuerſant with all men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now therefore, O Inhabitants of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and men of Iudah, Iudge I pray</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 34.</note> 
               <hi>you betwixt me and my Vineyard. What could haue been done more vnto my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard that I haue not done vnto it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I looked it ſhould haue brought foorth grapes, beought it foorth thornes, with which now the Temples of my head are wounded?</hi> Wherefore, when I looked for <hi>Wine,</hi> brought it foorth <hi>vinegar</hi> to offend my taſte? Why had ſhee nothing but myrrhe and gall to quench the thirſt of her drooping Lord? Theſe and the like dolefull complaints, the Iewes had both heard and read; they had noted and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all the holy actions of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> whiles he breathed vpon this Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of earth. They had often heard him teaching in the <hi>Temple,</hi> teaching in the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> teaching vpon the <hi>Mount,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:15600:39"/>
teaching in the <hi>high-wayes</hi> and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-fares. His goodneſſe would not ſuffer him to conceale or masque vs any thing in darkneſſe and ſilence: that might make any way to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the hearer. For now the time was come, wherein God had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to diſpell the thicke fogges of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from the mindes of his people, and clearely to inſtruct them in the myſteries of his truth. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but he had alſo decreede by one ſole <hi>Hilaſticall and propitiatorie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> to purge and expiate the ſinnes of the whole world. This was that pure and vnblemiſhed oblation, free from all ſtaines of corruption and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>Thus much euen the very aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> could not but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, who continually yeelded vnto him honor &amp; regard ſutable vnto his perſon. For indeed nothing was done in vaine, nothing by chance or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, nothing without the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hand of him that was afflicted. Who as he ſtood bound, and in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15600:40"/>
hands and power of others, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, hee himſelfe <hi>diſpoſeth</hi> whatſoeuer he <hi>ſuffereth.</hi> O the hidden ſecreſie and prouidence of God! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer appellation or title the Church doth ſeriouſly giue vnto Chriſt, the ſame doe the Iewes attribute vnto him by way of mockerie and illuſion. The prophane Souldier derideth our <hi>Lord and Sauiour,</hi> and yet in the mean time he adoreth him, bowing his knees vnto him, <hi>Unto whom euery knee ſhall bow.</hi> He denyeth Chriſt to bee a King, and yet by and by, he crowneth him. After hee had crowned him, hee gaue him a reede for a ſcepter; and that nothing might be wanting, they put a purple garment vpon him, the chiefe ornament of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Laſtly, whiles rhe people play vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, and contemne him, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they confeſſe him to be a Prophet; for by that name they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him.</p>
            <p>Thus the enemies of Chriſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be both God, a King, and a Prophet. But by what meanes, I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15600:40"/>
wonder came the Romanes to know thus much of our Sauiour? Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſay no more, it was the will and wiſdome of God ſo to diſpoſe. It was alſo by his iuſt permiſſion, that the falſe <hi>accuſation</hi> of Chriſt, who was truth it ſelfe: and the iniurious <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of Chriſt, who was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency it ſelfe, ſhould bee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the deſperate and voluntarie death of that deboſht Stigmaticke <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who had formerly engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to betray his Lord and Maſter with a <hi>kiſſe.</hi> O how was that <hi>candide Diuell,</hi> that <hi>varniſht hypocriſie,</hi> that <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a friend,</hi> that <hi>coppergilt Apoſtle</hi> tortured in ſoule by the racke of his raging conſcience? How earneſtly did hee deſire to ſet a period to a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous</hi> baſe <hi>life,</hi> by an <hi>infamous</hi> and miſerable <hi>death? Pontius Pilate,</hi> vnto whom the iudgement and arbitrating of the cauſe was aſſigned, had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times witneſſed &amp; auerred, that our <hi>Sauiour</hi> had not deſerued any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all: And that he might the better confirme his aſſertion, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15600:41"/>
to cleare himſelfe from the aſperſion and imputation of iniuſtice, by waſhing his hands in the viewe of the multitude. By and by after hee conſtantly affirmeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was no ſeducer of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi> who had formerly <hi>derided our Sauiours ſilence,</hi> dareth not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> being one of the chiefe Senators, retires himſelfe into his priuate chamber, and will not bee ſeene at the Bench, leſt perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he ſhould bee forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine ſomething contrary vnto his conſcience.</p>
            <p>The malicious Iewes, although they ſuborne falſe witneſſes againſt our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> yet notwithſtanding they teſtifie publikely before the Iudge, that he is not guilty of any crime. The ſame Iewes that exclaimed againſt him as againſt a ſeditious perſon, doe now ſtile him their King by that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon his croſſe, whereon hee was adiudged to die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Prieſt, by enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15600:41"/>
propheſieth of Chriſt, whom hee perſecuteth; &amp; with a loude voice both accuſeth and abſolueth him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the myſterie of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to wit, that it was neceſſary that one ſhould dye for the people.</p>
            <p>The laſt and worſt of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours aduerſaries, was the Diuell, who although hee earneſtly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeauoured by all aſſayes to vexe and trouble our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> yet (as the Ancients coniecture) hee could not but incite <hi>Pilates</hi> wife to tell him, that ſurely the man that was thus malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, accuſed and condemned, was a iuſt and righteous man, who although at length he ſuffered death vpon his croſſe, yet hee ſuffered it not as an <hi>impious</hi> and infamous malefactor, but as a <hi>glorious conquerour.</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together with his whole family &amp; Court of Heauen, ſtood and behelde the pangs and paſſion of his beloued Sonne, on whoſe ſhoulders hee had layed the weight of the puniſhment which euery one of vs in our owne perſons ſhould moſt deſeruedly haue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15600:42"/>
endured. God, who is tearmed of the Prophets, a deuouring fire, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing torrent of wrath, as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as a rough ſtorme of hayle, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous as a tempeſtuous guſt of wind maketh our <hi>Sauiour</hi> the onely butte to receiue the ſhafts of his fury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Who lying thus wounded and pierced with the ſharpeneſſe of his extreame agonie, (in reſpect of which all thoſe tortures inuented by tyrants, all thoſe maſſacres and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the holy Martyres, were but dreames and loue-trickes) is forced not to a duell or ſingle combat, but to encounter a multitude and throng of aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the which hee was to conquer the Diuell, that olde <hi>Hydra,</hi> and arch-enemie of mankind. Who as hee had beene the cauſe of the <hi>firſt Adams expulſion,</hi> ſo doth hee now attempt no leſſe to inthrall and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and to caſt him into vtter darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place he was to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh death, that had a long time ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15600:42"/>
ouer all mankind. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour being to enter the liſts with theſe furious Antagoniſts, was publikely brought along to an infamous place, where all wicked perſons were put to death, which place the people that liued thereabout, called it <hi>Golgotha, a place of dead mens ſculs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why hee was to conflict in this place, was (as wee may imagine) that hee might giue death the foyle, euen in its ſtrongeſt hold, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it had ſo long triumphed, and erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many trophees of its victorie; that, where the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had beene interred, euen there by the force of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſharpeneſſe &amp; ſting of death might be rebated.</p>
            <p>And yet, howſoeuer death was there conquered, yet not without the death of the conquerour: for euen there Chriſt himſelfe was nayled to his croſſe, in the view both of men and Angels. Who although he was brought into that lamentable ſtraight and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, although hee lay groueling and gaſping vnder the heauy burden, both
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15600:43"/>
of the <hi>pangs</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> and the <hi>paines</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the wrath of his Father; yet notwithſtanding the loue hee bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, was euen then no leſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire then euer it was. For euen then I ſay, hee ſaued the theefe at the croſſe, and prayed for his enemies. By and by after, he ſurrendred his bleſſed Soule into the hands of God.</p>

            <p>That face that vpon Mount <hi>Horeb</hi> the people could not behold without aſtoniſhment, nor the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with horrour and amazement, the wicked Iewes defiled it with ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and bruiſed it with ſtaues. And not onely ſo, but they euen killed the Lord of Hoſts, whoſe name is <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah.</hi> O fanaticke and furious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants, how could yee dare to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Sonne,</hi> whoſe <hi>Name</hi> yee could not vtter without trembling? O ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and ſottiſh impietie, no farther to bee remembred, then deteſted! O peruerſe and wicked generation, how are your rebellious hearts wrapt in the filme of ignorance? See yee not all the creatures of the world ſtanding agaſt at the ſight of your cruelty? See yee not the <hi>earth ſhaken,</hi> the <hi>rocks rent a ſunder, the graues opened?</hi> See ye not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15600:44"/>
the glorious beauty of the Sunne maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued with prodigious fogges, as defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your diſmall fact, and not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to behold the ſadde eſtate and diſtreſſe of its Creatour? Alas, why ſtand yee gazing vp towards heauen? why ſtand yee wondring to ſee the brightneſſe and luſtre of the day tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an abortiue night?</p>
            <p>Here is no defect of nature, no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie or vſuall Eclipſe of the Sunne. This vnexpected darkeneſſe cannot be excuſed, eyther by the head or taile of the Dragon, vnleſſe yee meane that old Dragon the Diuell, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement yee haue cut off your owne hopes, and the life of the bleſſed ſeede of the woman. And therefore becauſe yee deſtroyed him in whom there was both <hi>light and life,</hi> yee are now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Egyptian and palpable darkeneſſe; darkneſſe not cauſed by the <hi>courſe of time,</hi> but by your owne <hi>iniquity.</hi> Darkeneſſe accompanied with feare and horrour.</p>
            <p>This is that yee haue read in <hi>Eſay, The windowes and cataractes of Heauen</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:15600:45"/>
               <hi>are opened, the foundation of the earth are ſhaken. The earth ſhall reele to and fro as a drunkard, and ſhall bee remoued like a cottage.</hi> And all this ſhall come to paſſe, becauſe yee haue ſlaine him, who <hi>commaundeth the Sunne, and it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, who ſealeth vp the starres as vnder a ſignet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The earth acknowledged him its <hi>Creatour;</hi> the rockes that claue aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confeſſed him to be <hi>God;</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> who after the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ceremoniall Law, and the diſanulling of all ſuperſtitions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, placed his <hi>true worſhip</hi> in the <hi>ſpirit of man,</hi> and his <hi>chiefeſt Temple</hi> in <hi>the ſoule of man.</hi> Now beſides this, not onely the rending of the body of the Temple, but alſo of the temple of his body, plainely manifeſteth that all ſacrifices ended in that one <hi>ſelf-ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> being both the <hi>aboliſhment &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi> of all oblations whatſoeuer. This Sacrifice was the moſt <hi>Hilasticall and propitiatory of all others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſacrifice was a moſt perfect and abſolute <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> for it was totally
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15600:45"/>
conſumed by the flames of Chriſts fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uent loue vnto man. And as it was burnt, ſo it ſent vp a moſt ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto the noſtrils of God. This ſacrifice conſiſted of the pureſt meale, neyther was it euer ſowred with the leauen of any iniquity. Part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was offered vnto God vpon the Croſſe, and part was reſerued for the Prieſts, that is, for all vs, that thereby wee might bee nouriſhed to eternall life.</p>
            <p>By this was the wrath of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and our peace procured. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was there ſuch a ſacrifice as this before offered, that could ſo fully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the diſpleaſure of God concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt man, whoſe ſinne was ſo hainous and notorious, inſomuch that eyther the <hi>Son of God</hi> was to dye once for man, or man eternally. But if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture any man be ſo incredulous as to demaund, how Chriſt beeing the Sonne of God could ſuffer, ſeing that the Deitie is not ſubiect vnto paſſion; hee may bee fully reſolued by the Church, whoſe aſſertion is, that Chriſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15600:46"/>
ſuffered not in reſpect of his <hi>diuine nature,</hi> but <hi>his humane.</hi> For though the Deity was in the <hi>Sufferer,</hi> yet was it not in the <hi>ſuffering;</hi> though it was in the <hi>body of Chriſts paſsion,</hi> yet was it not in the <hi>paſſion of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> ſo that the Humanity onely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the Deity onely ſuſtayned it, and made it able to endure the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts of its impetuous aduerſaries. The impotency of the one required the omnipotency of the other.</p>
            <p>When I thinke vpon my <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Humanity,</hi> then mee thinke, I ſee him faultering vnder the burden of his Croſſe; When I thinke vpon his Deitie, then me thinke, I ſee him wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the Galleries of Heauen. When I thinke vpon his Humanity, then mee thinke I ſee him lying in the duſt, and weltring in his owne gore: When I thinke vpon his <hi>Deity,</hi> then mee thinke I ſee him flying vpon the winges of the glorious Seraphims. Oh how different are theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt! And yet howſoeuer
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15600:46"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> betwixt them bee ſo great, and the diſparity ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet notwithſtanding in him are they both combined. For although he be not <hi>one nature,</hi> yet is a <hi>one in Perſon,</hi> one Chriſt, one Mediator, one Redeemer, one Sauiour. For euen as the body and ſoule of man being two diuers things, doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding conſtitute one man: So the <hi>Deitie and humanitie</hi> of Chriſt, albeit they be two diuers natures, yet they make vp one perſon. Chriſt in regard of his humanity, died: in reſpect of his Deitie, he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained entire, vntouched, impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, invulnerable. This was that, that rowſed vp the interred carcaſes from their graues, (for many of the Saints that ſlept, aroſe, and came into the holy City, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto many.) This was that that rent the veile of the Temple. This was that, that as it were, ſealed vp the Sunne-beames vnder a Signet of Cimmerian clouds. This was that that cauſed that generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaſſation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15600:47"/>
of the earth. This was that that made the <hi>Centurion</hi> auerie, (maugre all the peoples vehement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the true and eſſentiall Sonne of God. It was the <hi>fleſh</hi> that tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, that ſtood ſo affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appaled at the grimme viſage of death.</p>
            <p>It was the <hi>fleſh</hi> that would haue hindered the Word, and haue fore ſlowed the purchaſe of our eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. It was the <hi>fleſh</hi> that ſuffered vpon the Croſſe; and it was the <hi>Deity</hi> that triumphed ouer the bitterneſſe of death. It was the <hi>fleſh</hi> that was the ſacrifice; It was the <hi>Deity</hi> that was the Prieſt that ſacrificed it. It was the <hi>fleſh</hi> that in the anguiſh of its paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on groned and breathed out this ſad and dolefull complaint, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> And yet howſoeuer the <hi>fleſh</hi> was thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and afflicted, yet its vnion with the <hi>Deity</hi> remayned ſtill entire. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it poſſibly bee caſt off or forſaken by that, vnto which the links and ligaments of loue had ſo ſtrictly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15600:47"/>
obliged it. O that our dull and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> were ſo illuminated, our <hi>zeale and affections</hi> ſo ſeruent, as truly to <hi>conceiue the Maiesty,</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to <hi>embrace the humility of our Sauiour!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that wee could ſufficiently meditate vpon the <hi>grieuous wounds,</hi> that hee <hi>ſuffered;</hi> vpon the <hi>gracious words</hi> that hee <hi>vttered!</hi> If we reuolue all the Annales and records of time; wee ſhall neuer finde his paralell, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man that ſpake as hee ſpake, that ſuffered as he ſuffered: Neuer any man that ſo <hi>loued his friends,</hi> that ſo <hi>pittied his foes;</hi> neuer any ſo kind to the religious, ſo mercifull euen to Publicans and Sinners. Who a little before hee dranke the bitter cuppe of his paſſion, miniſtred a ſweet cordiall of conſolation vnto the theefe that was to ſuffer with him: <hi>To day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> Thus was that miſerable ſinner acquited from the death of the ſoule, although hee ſuffered the death of the body. Thus was hee by the power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15600:48"/>
of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> of a <hi>malefactor,</hi> made a <hi>martyr.</hi> Surely ſo ſtrange and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a conuerſion could not but bee immediately wrought by the efficacie of Chriſts Deitie: which euen in this act ſhewed its intenſiue &amp; ſuperlatiue loue towards that <hi>Fleſh</hi> of ours, which it aſſumed.</p>
            <p>Oh bleſſed and happie day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our fraile &amp; forlorne <hi>Fleſh</hi> was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that nature which was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obnoxious to Corruption, nor ſubiect vnto Paſſion!</p>
            <p>But, Oh, more bleſſed and happie day was that, whereon our <hi>Fleſh</hi> being ioyned to the Deitie, ſo died in Chriſt, as that wee not ſuffering death, were notwithſtanding reſtored vnto life.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>CHRIST tooke</hi> vpon him our <hi>nature</hi> in the wombe, ſo hee <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke</hi> our <hi>death</hi> vpon the Croſſe. For whatſoeuer he ſuffered as man, he ſuffered for man: from whom he can be no more ſeparated or divulſed, then from his <hi>Deitie,</hi> with which he ioyned our humanitie, that he might ſaue and ſecure it from the hazzard of eternall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15600:48"/>
death and damnation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Oh infinite loue! Oh incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible mercie! Oh bleſſed &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie day, wherein the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the <hi>Leuiathan</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the vaſt <hi>Behemoth</hi> ouerturned, the powers of Hell ſubdued, the Graue conquered, the ſting of Death reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Oh bleſſed and happie day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force and guilt of Sinne was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the world, and the ſinner taken vp into heauen. O bleſſed and happy day, wherein by our Sauiours paſſion, the gates of heauen were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; wherein it ſo came to paſſe, that wee that were once exiled and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the <hi>celeſtiall Paradiſe,</hi> may now againe bee freely therein inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reimpatriated.</p>
            <p>Now there is no Cherubim to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, no flaming ſword to affright vs. Now may wee all bee eaſily admitted, and bee made free deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of that <hi>heauenly Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let not our impenitent inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and inſolent impenitency bee the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15600:49"/>
cauſe of our excluſion.</p>
            <p>Let vs conſider that the incredulous and proud Phariſes that challenged vnto themſelues ſo much purity and piety, were the firſt that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, their Synagogue neglected, and euen theeues &amp; malefactors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them.</p>
            <p>And this was that that ſo diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Diuell, when hee ſaw thoſe that had beene his ſlaues and vaſſals to bee reſcued and abſolued from death, by one that was condemned to death; when hee ſaw that Chriſt was more powerfull in his death then euer any Emperour was in his rule and ſoueraignety; when he ſaw not from <hi>ſtones,</hi> but from the <hi>gallowes,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from hell it ſelfe, children rayſed vp vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When hee ſaw the Sonne of God after his <hi>buffets and his bonds,</hi> laſt of all, euen in his death, to erect the glorious building and edifice of his Church; when hee ſaw that bleſſed inheritance of Chriſt being but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle part and moytie of Mankind, ſtill
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15600:49"/>
to <hi>flouriſh as the Palme-tree</hi> vnder the burden and weight of its afflictions: when hee ſaw the Church of Chriſt, which was <hi>created by his power,</hi> now <hi>redeemed by his bloud,</hi> vnited by his Apoſtles, inſtructed by his Prophets, comforted by his Euangeliſts, and freede from that heauy yoake of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, with which it had beene long oppreſſed: When hee ſaw it, howſoeuer diuided in body, yet combined in ſpirit; <hi>Hauing nothing, and yet poſſeſsing all things in Christ,</hi> which is all in all. In whoſe <hi>paſſion</hi> it gloryed, whoſe <hi>patience</hi> it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
            <p>Which Church of his, although it ſeeme to wither by the heate of perſecution, yet doth it ſtill grow &amp; waxe greene by the dew of grace, and ſappe of conſolation.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the Saints on earth are frequently perplexed with variety of exquiſite torments; and yet theſe are not of force &amp; validity to diuert their zealous and conſtant reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15600:50"/>
to ſeparate them from their grand-Captaine Chriſt Ieſus, whom they follow, not as beeing confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their purpoſes by the irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable peruerſeneſſe of the Stoickes; nor as beeing induced thereunto by the Sophiſtrie of Logicke, or by the inchantments of Rhetoricke; but as it were, beeing bound by oath, and deepely engaged vnto their Sauiour: by whoſe bloud they are refreſhed, by whoſe fleſh they are nouriſhed, by whoſe Spirit they are reuiued, by whoſe promiſes they are inuited, by whoſe precepts they are directed. The chiefeſt ſcope they ayme at, is, that they may bee one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is one with God.</p>
            <p>For thou ſweet <hi>Sauiour</hi> art our head, and wee thy members: Thou our ſhepheard, and wee thy ſheepe, thou the Vine, and we thy branches. By thy death wee liue, by thy life are we rayſed from death.</p>
            <p>And although wee are here ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and mixed with the world, yet
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15600:50"/>
our cogitations and our conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in heauen, whither our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour is gone before.</p>
            <p>Oh that wee could follow him, that wee could waft our ſelues vnto that Hauen of ioy; vnto that ſecure rode of felicity.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing that as yet wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow thee (ſweet Ieſu) with our bodies, yet wee purſue thee with our deſires, with our ſighes, with our affections, with our teares.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>interim,</hi> whiles wee heere ſuruiuing, ſeriouſly ponder thoſe tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent afflictions of thine, which for our ſakes, and yet not for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, thou ſufferedſt vpon thy Croſſe; whiles we meditate vpon thoſe griefes and torments which were as propaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vnto thy paſſion, how are we rapt into admiration of thy loue? Then doe wee abandon all our fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and friuolous cogitations, then doe wee diſcard all our ambitious <hi>Babel</hi> building thoughts; then do wee diſclaime the inſolent ſelfe-conceites
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15600:51"/>
of our owne abilities, then doe wee deepely lament our ſupine and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid negligence; then doe we grieue that wee haue beene ſo prodigall of our precious houres, and that we haue not embarqued our ſelues in thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which moſt of all procure our ſafety and indemnity.</p>
            <p>Then are our eyes become foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of teares; then cry wee out and ſay; O Lord, thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt ledde captiuity captiue. Then crie wee out, O Lord, what is man, that thou art ſo mindefull of him, or the Sonne of man that thou ſo regardeſt him? Oh good <hi>IESU,</hi> what is man, that thou ſo regardeſt him? <hi>Thou haſt cloathed mee with skinne and fleſh, and haſt fenced mee with bones and ſinewes,</hi> ſayth <hi>Iob,</hi> Chapter 10 11. <hi>Remember, I beſeech thee, that thou haſt made me as the clay, and wilt bring mee into the duſt. Haſt thou not powred mee out as milke, and crudled mee as cheeſe?</hi> Chapter 10. ver. 9. and 10. <hi>Am I not to bee conſumed as a</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:15600:51"/>
               <hi>rotten thing, and as a garment that is moth-eaten?</hi> How then can it be that I, being of ſo abiect and corruptible a conſtitution, ſhould bee ſaued from death, by the death of the Lord of life? O ſtrange and admirable loue! as farre beyond comprehenſion, as end and meaſure. I haue ſinned, &amp; thou (ſweet Ieſu) haſt ſuffered; nay, and I haue alſo ſuffered in thee, which ſufferedſt for me.</p>
            <p>Thus by thee am I lyable neither to death nor puniſhment. My na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which I had corrupted, thou haſt refined; that that happineſſe might re-accrew vnto mee which I had loſt by the fall of my firſt parents. What now therefore ſhall I ſay? How ſhall I ſufficiently eyther admire thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or prayſe thy goodneſſe? Thou that art infinite, thou that art neyther confined to time or place, thou that art ſubiect neyther to death or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, didſt out of thy moſt entire and intenſiue loue vnto vs, cloathe thy ſelfe with our fraile fleſh incident to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15600:52"/>
both. Which fleſh of ours (maugre the Diuels malice and malignity) thou haſt highlie exalted it, and placed it aboue the Angels, the Archangels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the glorious Hierarchies of Heauen, euen at the right hand of thy Father, where is the fulneſſe of ioy and pleaſures for euer more. But before thou couldſt aſcend vnto that verticall point and <hi>Meridian</hi> of thy glorie, with what maſſie loades of calamities wert thou oppreſſed?</p>
            <p>What Hunger, what Thirſt, what Nakednes, what Iniuryes, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilings, what Spittings, what Stripes, what Wounds, what contumelyes, what diſgraces, what Death, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying didſt thou moſt mildely and patiently endure for vs!</p>
            <p>And therfore, <hi>Oh ſweete IESU,</hi> giue vs grace, that as thou dyedſt for vs, ſo wee may liue heere to thee, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with thee. Graunt wee beſeech thee, that thy Paſſion may be our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Meditation.</p>
            <p>Oh let vs alwayes reflect our Eyes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15600:52"/>
vpon thee, and let thy ſufferings take a deepe impreſſion both in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories and in our affections.</p>
            <p>And graunt <hi>Oh ſweete Sauiour,</hi> that wee may put, not the bodily fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger with <hi>Thomas,</hi> but euen the finger of Faith into thy ſide, and into thy wounds, and with the hand of Faith apprehend thy merites.</p>
            <p>Graunt that we may crucifie all the inordinate Luſts of the Fleſh, all our wanton and Laſciuious cogitations, and that wee may be like thee in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that we may be like thee in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
