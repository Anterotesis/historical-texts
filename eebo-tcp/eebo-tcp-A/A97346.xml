            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN publishing this Essay of my Poeme, there is this great disaduantage against me; that it commeth out at this time, when Verses are wholly deduc't to Chambers, and nothing esteem'd in this Iunatique Age, but what is kept in Cabinets, and must only passe by Transcription; In such a season, when the Idle Humerous world must heare of nothing, that either sauors of Antiquity, or may awake it to seeke after more, then dull and slothfull ignorance may easily reach vnto: These, I say, make much against me; and especially in a Poeme, from any example, either of Ancient, or Modern, that haue proued in this kind: whose vnusuall tract may perhaps seeme difficult, to the female Sex; yea, and I feare, to some that think theselues not meanly learned, being not rightly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Muses: such I meane, as had rather read the fantasies of forraine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, then to see the Rarities &amp; Historie of their owne Country deliuered by a true natiue Muse. Then, whosoeuer thou be, possest with such stupidity &amp; dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that, rather then thou wilt take paines to search into ancient and noble things, choosest to remaine in the thicke fogges and mists of ignorance, as neere the common Lay-stall of a Citie; refusing to walke forth into the <hi>Tempe</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the Muses, where through most delightfull Groues the Angellique harmony of Birds shall steale thee to the top of an easie hill, where in artificiall caues, cut out of the most naturall Rock, thou shalt see the ancient people of this Ile deliuered thee in their liuely images: from whose height thou <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> behold both the old and later times, as in thy prospect, lying farrevnder thee; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaying thee downe by a soule-pleasing Descent through delicate embrodered Meadowes, often veined with gentle gliding Brooks; in which thou maist fully view the dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streames; which shall lead thee, to most pleasant Downes, where harmlesse Shepheards are, some exercising their pipes, some singing rounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, to their gazing flocks: If as, I say, thou hadst rather, (because it asks thy labour) remaine, where thou wert, then straine thy selfe to walke forth with the Muses; the fault proceeds from thy idlenesse, not from any want in my industrie. And to any that shall demand wherfore hauing promised this Poeme of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Iland so many yeeres, I now publish only this part of it; I plainly answere, that many times I had determined with my selfe, to haue left it off, and haue neglected my papers sometimes two yeeres to gether, finding the times since his Maiesties happy comming in, to fall so heauily vpon my distressed fortunes, after my zealous soule had labored so long in that, which with the general happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the kingdom, seem'd not then impossible somewhat also to haue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me. But I instantly saw all my long nourisht hopes euen buried aliue before my face: so vncertaine (in this world) be the ends of our cleerest endeuors. And what euer is herein that tastes of a free spirit, I thankfully confesse it to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continuall bounty of my truly Noble friend Sir <hi>Walter Aston;</hi> which hath
<pb facs="tcp:22434:6"/>
giuen me the best of those howres, whose leasure hath effected this which I now publish. Sundry other Songs I haue also, though yet not so perfect that I dare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to publique censure; and the rest I determine to go forward with, God enabling me, may I find means to assist my endeuour. Now Reader, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderstanding of my Poeme, thou hast three especiall helps; First the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to direct thee still, where thou art, and through what Shires the Muse makes her iourney, and what she chiefly handles in the Song thereto belonging. Next, the Map, liuely delineating to thee, euery Mountaine, Forrest, Riuer, and Valley; expressing in their sundry postures; their loues, delights, and naturall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations. Then hast thou the illustration of this learned Gentleman, my friend, to explaine euery hard matter of history, that, lying farre from the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reading, may (without question) seem difficult vnto thee. Thus wishing thee thy hearts desire, and committing my Poeme to thy charitable censure, I take my leaue.</p>

               <hi>TO haue you without difficulty vnderstand, how in this my intended progresse, through these vnited kingdomes of great</hi> Britaine, <hi>I haue placed your (and I must confesse) my loued</hi> Wales, <hi>you shall perceiue, that after the three first Songs, beginning with our French Ilands,</hi> Iernsey, <hi>and</hi> Iersey, <hi>with the rest; and perfecting in those first three the suruay of these sixe our most Westerne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> Cornwall, Deuon, Dorset, Hamp, Wilt, <hi>and</hi> Summerset; <hi>I then make ouer</hi> Seuerne <hi>into</hi> Wales, <hi>not farre from the midst of her Broad side that lieth against</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>I tearme it her Broad side, because it lieth from</hi> Shrewsbury, <hi>stil along with</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerne, <hi>till she lastly turne sea.

               <hi>Speaking of seauen Books; you shall vnderstand that I continew</hi> Wales <hi>through soma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; beginning in the fourth Song (where the nymphes of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>contena for the Ile of</hi> Lundy) <hi>and ending in the tenth; Striuing, as my much loued (the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)</hi> Humfrey Floyd, <hi>in his description of</hi> Cambria <hi>to</hi> Abraham Ortelius, <hi>to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her auncient bounds,</hi> Seuerne, <hi>and</hi> Dee, <hi>and therefore haue included the parts of those three English Shiers of</hi> Gloster, Worster, <hi>and</hi> Sallop, <hi>that lie on the west of</hi> Seuerne, <hi>within their ancient mother</hi> Wales: <hi>In which if I haue not done her right, the want is in my ability, not in my loue.

            <p>PErmit mee thus much of these Notes to My Friend. What the Verse oft, with allusion, as supposing a full knowing Reader, lets slip; or in winding steps of Personating Fictions (as some times) so infolds, that suddaine conceipt cannot abstract a Forme of the clothed Truth, I haue, as I might, <hi>Illustrated. Breuity,</hi> and <hi>Plainenes</hi> (as the one endur'd the Other) I haue ioyned; purposely auoyding frequent commixture of different language; and, whensoeuer it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, eyther the Page or Margine (specially for <hi>Gentlewomens</hi> sake) summarily interprets it, except where Interpretation aides not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not very Prodigall of my Historicall Faith, after <hi>Explanation,</hi> I oft aduenture on <hi>Examination,</hi> and <hi>Censure.</hi> The Author, in Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of <hi>first Inhabitants, Name, State,</hi> and <hi>Monarchique succession</hi> in this Isle, followes <hi>Geffrey ap Arthur, Polychronicon, Matthew</hi> of <hi>West minster,</hi> and such more. Of their Traditions, for that one so much controuerted, and by <hi>Cambro-Britons</hi> still maintayned, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Troian Brute,</hi> I haue (but as an Aduocat for the Muse) argued; disclaiming in it, if alledg'd for my own Opinion. In most of the rest, vpon weighing the Reporters credit, Comparison with more perswading authority, and <hi>Synchronisme</hi> (the best Touch-stone in this kind of Triall) I leaue note of Suspicion, or adde coniecturall Amendment: as, for particular examples, among other, in <hi>Brennus</hi> mistooke by all Writers of later time, sollowing <hi>Iustins</hi> Epitome of <hi>Trogus</hi> ill conceiu'd; in <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Swaphams</hi> Story of K. <hi>Wulphers</hi> murdring his Children; in <hi>Rollo</hi> first D. of <hi>Normandy</hi> his time; none of them yet rectified (although the first hath been aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on) by any that I haue seene; and such more. And indeed my Iealousie hath oft vext me with particular inquisition of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer occurrs, bearing not a marke of most apparant Truth, euer since I found so intollerable Antichronismes, incredible reports, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> impostures, as well from Ignorance as assum'd liberty of Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in some of our Ancients; and red also such palpable Fauxeties, of our Nation, thrust into the World by Later Time: as (to giue a tast) that of <hi>Randall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <l>More sundry formes of feare then thought imagine could.</l>
                  <l>One looks vpon his friend with sad and heauy cheere,</l>
                  <l>Who seemes in this distresse a part with him to beare:</l>

                  <l>One hauing climb'd some roofe, the concourse to discry,</l>
                  <l>From thence vpon the earth deiects his humble eye,</l>

                  <l>Some danger them amongst which lurkt vpon the ground.</l>
                  <l>One stands with fixed eyes, as though he were agast:</l>
                  <l>Another sadly comes, as though his hopes were past.</l>
                  <l>This harkneth with his friend, as though with him to breake</l>
                  <l>Of some intended act. Whilst they together speake,</l>
                  <l>Another standeth neere to listen what they say,</l>
                  <l>Or what should be the end of this so doubtfull day.</l>
                  <l>One great and generall face the gathered people seeme:</l>
                  <l>So that the perfect'st sight beholding could not deeme</l>

                  <l>Vpon the heads of two, whose cheekes were ioynd so neere</l>
                  <l>As if together growne, a third his chin doth rest:</l>
                  <l>Another lookes or'e his: and others, hardly prest,</l>
                  <l>Lookt vnder-neath their armes. Thus, whilst in crowds they throng</l>
                  <l>(Led by the King himselfe) the Champion comes along;</l>
                  <l>A man well strooke in yeeres, in homely Palmers gray,</l>
                  <l>And in his hand his staffe, his reuerent steps to stay,</l>
                  <l>Holding a comly pase: which at his passing by,</l>

                  <l>Compassion mixt with feare, distrust and courage, bred.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Then <hi>Colebrond</hi> for the <hi>Danes</hi> came forth in irefull red;</l>
                  <l>Before him (from the Campe) an Ensigne first display'd</l>
                  <l>Amidst a guard of gleaues: then sumptuously array'd</l>
                  <l>Were twenty gallant youths, that to the warlike sound</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Danish</hi> brazen Drums, with many a loftie bound,</l>
                  <l>Come with their Countries march, as they to <hi>Mars</hi> should dance.</l>
                  <l>Thus, forward to the fight, both Champions them advance:</l>
                  <l>And each without respect doth resolutely chuse</l>
                  <l>The weapon that he brought, nor doth his foes refuse.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Dane</hi> prepares his Axe, that pond'rous was to feele,</l>
                  <l>VVhose squares were layd with plates, and riuited with steele,</l>
                  <l>And armed downe along with pykes; whose hardned poynts</l>
                  <l>(Forc't with the weapons weight) had power to teare the ioynts</l>
                  <l>Of Curas or of Mayle, or what-so-ere they tooke:</l>
                  <l>Which caus'd him at the Knight disdainfully to looke.</l>

                  <l>VVhen our stout Palmer soone (vnknowne for valiant <hi>Guy</hi>)</l>
                  <l>The cord from his straight loynes doth presently vntie,</l>
                  <l>Puts off his Palmers weede vnto his trusse, which bore</l>
                  <l>The staines of ancient Armes, but show'd it had before</l>
                  <l>Beene costly cloth of Gold; and off his hood he threw:</l>
                  <l>Out of his Hermits staffe his two-hand sword hee drew</l>
                  <l>(The vnsuspected sheath which long to it had beene)</l>
                  <l>Which till that instant time the people had not seene;</l>
                  <l>A sword so often try'd. Then to himselfe, quoth hee,</l>

                  <l>Encounters him againe with equall power and spight:</l>
                  <l>Whereas, betwixt them two, might easely haue been seene</l>
                  <l>Such blowes, in publique throngs as vsed had they been,</l>
                  <l>Of many there the least might many men haue slaine:</l>
                  <l>Which none but they could strike, nor none but they sustaine;</l>
                  <l>The most relentlesse eye that had the power to awe,</l>
                  <l>And so great wonder bred in those the Fight that saw,</l>
                  <l>As verily they thought, that Nature vntill then</l>
                  <l>Had purposely reseru'd the vtmost power of men,</l>

                  <l>Vpon the reuerent brow: immediatly from whence</l>
                  <l>The blood dropt softly downe, as if the wound had sense</l>

                  <l>The <hi>English</hi> at the noise, wext all so wan with seare,</l>
                  <l>As though They lost the blood their aged Champion shed:</l>
                  <l>Yet were not these so pale, but th'other were as red;</l>
                  <l>As though the blood that fell, vpon their cheekes had staid.</l>

                  <l>Here <hi>Guy,</hi> his better spirits recalling to his ayde,</l>

                  <l>An other desperate stroke: which <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> takes</l>
                  <l>Vndauntedly aloft; and followed with a blowe</l>
                  <l>Vpon his shorter ribs, that the excessiue flowe</l>
                  <l>Stream'd vp vnto his hilts: the wound so gap't withall,</l>
                  <l>As though it meant to say, Behold your Champions fall</l>
                  <l>By this proud Palmers hand. Such claps againe and cryes</l>
                  <l>The ioyfull <hi>English</hi> gaue as cleft the very skies.</l>
                  <l>VVhich comming on along from these that were without,</l>
                  <l>When those within the Towne receiu'd this cheerfull shout,</l>
                  <l>They answer'd them with like; as those their ioy that knew.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then with such eager blowes each other they pursue,</l>
                  <l>As euery offer made, should threaten imminent death;</l>
                  <l>Vntill, through heat and toyle both hardly drawing breath,</l>
                  <l>They desperatly doe close. Looke how two Boares, being set</l>
                  <l>Together side to side, their threatning tusks doe whet,</l>
                  <l>And with their gnashing teeth their angry foame doe bite,</l>
                  <l>Whilst still they shouldring seeke, each other where to smite:</l>
                  <l>Thus stood those irefull Knights; till flying back, at length</l>

                  <l>That whilst his weapons poynt fell wel-neere to the ground,</l>

                  <l>When downeward went his head, and vp his heeles he threw;</l>

Their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are the Archbishop and the Abbot. Vpon an appointed day they meete all at</hi> Swanescomb, <hi>and harbouring themselues in the woods, with Boughes in euery mans hand, they incompasse his way. The next day, the Duke comming by</hi> Swanescomb, <hi>seemed to see with amazement, as it were a wood approching towards him, the</hi> Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <hi>men at the sound of a Trumpet take themselues to Armes, when presently the Archbishop and Abbot were sent to the Duke and saluted him with these words: Behold, Sir Duke, the</hi> Kentish <hi>men come to meet you, willing to receiue you as their Liege Lord, vpon that condition, that they may for euer enioy their ancient Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Laws vsed among their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
