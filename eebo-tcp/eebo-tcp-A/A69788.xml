            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>HAving neither a Genius, nor a Talent for Hiſtory, much leſs for Politicks, and having paſſed but a very ſmall time at the late King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Court, I can neither promiſe the Criticks, nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, that Politeneſs of Stile, nor thoſe exact Rules and Circumſtances of Hiſtory they generally expect, and are accuſtom'd to meet with in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ions of this nature. For the Memoirs I collected, and the Remarks I made in that Nation, as well as in other Foreign Countries, were firſt intended for my own Curioſity; until being come ſome few Years ago from my Travels into <hi>England,</hi> and finding there had not been yet publiſh'd in our Tongue any Account of this vaſt neighbouring Kingdom, I was often diſcours'd, chiefly during this laſt Election, about the Conſtitution of that Country, and was deſir'd to communicate to the Publick what I knew of it. This gave me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reviſe my Memoirs, and to conſider that if they were put into good order, they might perhaps be of ſome uſe, becauſe the Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Poland</hi> is in ſome reſpect like that of ours. But the firſt Year I came over, I ſpent
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:52719:3"/>
ſome Months at <hi>Oxford</hi> to publiſh a ſmall Latin Treatiſe of Phyſical Matters, and to communicate to the Ingenious Gentlemen there what ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight I was thought to have in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and in the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> The Summer following I made ſome Chymical and Anatomical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations at <hi>Cambridg.</hi> Theſe two laſt Winters I have been much taken up here in Town in trying a great many Chymical and Anatomical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, and in publiſhing my Treatiſe <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina Myſtica;</hi> and beſides, being buſied in my other Occupations in the Practice of Phyſick, to which I have entirely applied my ſelf of late, as being more ſutable to my Temper and Profeſſion than Hiſtorical ones, I neither could take any Delight, nor have any Leiſure to write over, or to put into due method the Memoirs I brought from <hi>Poland:</hi> ſo that the Publick is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Savage;</hi> for without his help this Account of <hi>Poland</hi> could not doubtleſs have thus appear'd theſe ſeveral Years.</p>
                  <p>I hope Ingenuous and Candid Perſons will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Faults and Defects they will undoubtedly meet with in this Hiſtorical Relation; ſince what I deſign'd only to do at my own leiſure in ſome Years, I have diſpatch'd with too much Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation in few Months, to ſatisfy the Curioſity of People during the late Election in <hi>Poland,</hi> who long'd to ſee ſome Account of that Kingdom publiſh'd. Wherefore I neither deſerve nor deſire any other Reputation by it, than that being the firſt that has given any Hiſtory of that Country in our Language, I give occaſion to others that may travel after me in <hi>Poland,</hi> to give a more ſatisfactory Account thereof.</p>

I admire our Engliſh Gentry, who travel into <hi>Germany,</hi> have never the Curioſity to go either from <hi>Berlin</hi> through <hi>Pruſſia</hi> or <hi>Poſnania</hi> to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> or from <hi>Vienna</hi> through <hi>Sileſia</hi> to <hi>Cracow.</hi> They may with eaſe perform this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in three Months time, and not think their time loſt; for tho there are not ſo many Rarities to be ſeen, nor that Conveniency of travelling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For theſe ſixty or ſeventy Years paſt, the <hi>Poles</hi> have taken a Humour to travel, and have of late refin'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves extreamly, having had French Queens and French Factions reigning amongst them during the four laſt Reigns ſucceſſively; which has produc'd this good Effect, contrary to the private Deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> that not only the rough Temper of the <hi>Poles</hi> is made more polite, and their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour more civil, but likewiſe their Judgment improv'd, and they themſelves rendred more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing their own Intereſt, and more wary than formerly of a Deſpotic Power, which their Kings of late, aſſiſted by the <hi>French,</hi> have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to introduce: for the <hi>Poles</hi> are now ſenſible that the French King, who is abſolute at home, and well known to be ambitious enough to enlarge his Conqueſts abroad, has juſt reaſon to think that it would have been caſier for him to manage his Intereſt againſt the Empire with a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was likewiſe abſolute, than it is now with one who entirely depends on the uncertain Reſolutions of a free Parliament: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:52719:4"/>
let a King of <hi>Poland</hi> be ever ſo Deſpotic, his Kingdom being poor, he will always want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney either to ſatisfy his Pleaſure, or to gratify his Ambition, and will ſcarcely ever be proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fifty thouſand <hi>Louis-d'Or's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Poles are not only watchful againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Factions of <hi>France,</hi> but likewiſe they begin to conſider the unhappy Condition of their inſlaved Neighbours, the <hi>Muſcovites, Swedes, Danes, Germans</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who groan under the heavy Yoke of the unlimited Power of their Soveraigns. Theſe viſible Examples make them ſo very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Kings, and ſo extream fond of their Liberty, that they will not only always keep their Crown elective, but likewiſe oblige their new King to enlarge their Privileges, which are at this time more ample than ever they have been before. And it is not to be imagin'd that the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will become Deſpotic as the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> did; becauſe in <hi>Denmark</hi> the King, Clergy and common People being kept under by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Power of the Nobility, join'd together, and ſoon brought the Nobility to declare the King Abſolute, chooſing rather to be under one Maſter than under ſeveral petty Tyrants. But in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both Gentry and Clergy, who are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and powerful, have a joint Intereſt to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the King's Power, and to keep the Common People in ſubjection, who are ſtupidly pleas'd with, or rather inſenſible of their Slavery. And the Notion of Liberty is ſo inbred with the Poliſh Gentry, that if they ſhould ſuſpect that their King did aim at making any Breach upon their Laws, they not only think themſelves no longer oblig'd to pay him Allegiance, but likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:52719:5"/>
to invade their Privileges, as they apprehended the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and perhaps <hi>John III</hi>'s Children would have done.</p>
                  <p>When I came firſt into this Nation, my chief Deſign was to converſe with Phyſicians, and other Naturaliſts, to improve my Knowledg in the Practice of Phyſick, and in Natural Hiſtory: But finding little here to ſatisfy my Curioſity in theſe Matters, that I might not loſe my Labour in travelling in ſo remote a Country, I reſolv'd to look into their Chronicles, to inform my ſelf of the Origin of the Monarchy; of the Succeſſion, and Remarkable Actions of all its Kings; of its Geography, and its Products; and to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Antient and Preſent State of that vaſt Kingdom. Which I have done with as much Care and Accuracy as I could well compaſs in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>People perhaps will admire how I could pretend to give an Account of ſo large and Antient a Kingdom, not having been in it a full Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month. I own this were no ſmall preſumption in me, had I undertaken to give a compleat Hiſtory thereof; but as I only relate briefly either what I have gather'd from the beſt Poliſh Authors, learned from the moſt Intelligent Natives, or obſerv'd my ſelf, I hope the Publick will have no ill Thoughts of me for this Attempt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Writers of the Poliſh Hiſtory, like moſt other Hiſtorians, were credulous and ſuperſtitious, and have fill'd their Writings with a great many Romantio and almoſt fabulous Stories, which I have omitted, tho I have inſerted ſome, as the <hi>golden Tooth,</hi> the <hi>devouring Dragon, Popiel</hi>'s being eaten by <hi>Rats,</hi> and ſome others; not with a
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:52719:5"/>
deſign to make the Publick believe them, or that I believ'd 'em my ſelf, but only to ſhew how the Ignorance of ſome, and the unfair Relations of others, have impos'd upon the World in all Ages.</p>
                  <p>I knew ſomething of the Conſtitution of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before I went thither, having formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſeveral Gentlemen of that Country at <hi>Paris,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined me in ſome meaſure to travel with ſome of them from thence into that Kingdom. Beſides, I came out of <hi>Poland</hi> with the Electoreſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> the King's Daughter, in Company with ſeveral Natives thereof, who attended her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from <hi>Warſaw</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> In this long Journey I had likewiſe opportunity to inform my ſelf further of the preſent State of that Country. So that I have not only collected this imperfect Account, which I have ventur'd to give of it, during the little time I reſided at the King's Court, but likewiſe before I came thither, and ſince I left it.</p>
                  <p>I did not at firſt deſign this Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould ſwell to ſo great a Bulk, nor that chiefly the Geographical Part ſhould be ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly long, but thought to reduce the whole to the narrow compaſs of one Volume; until Mr. <hi>S</hi>— conſidering the Inconveniency of too ſmall an Epitome, enlarg'd the Geography of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of the Great Dutchy of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi> to make the Relation of them both more exact, and more ſatisfactory to ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to compare the Towns and Provinces with the Map.</p>

This Maxim has hitherto prov'd very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the <hi>Poles</hi> for enlarging their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and maintaining their Privileges; and might well have extended their Dominions beyond thoſe of any State in <hi>Europe,</hi> had their other Conſtitutions been as well grounded, or as exactly obſerved: For tho the <hi>Poles</hi> have been conſtantly moleſted by their Neighbours, the <hi>Suedes, Moſcovites, Tartars, Turks, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and their Kingdom been ſeveral times reduc'd to Extremities, burnt and plunder'd by frequent Incurſions, put into Convulſions and Deſolations, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their People been carry'd away into<note place="margin">Policy of its Kings.</note> Captivity; yet by the prudent Conduct and Courage of their Kings, through a deſire of gaining the Affection of their Subjects by ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Country zealouſly, to the end their Fame and Merits might raiſe their Children to the Throne after their deaths, the <hi>Poles</hi> have not only always oppos'd, but likewiſe repuls'd the exorbitant Force of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: They have alſo by degrees enlarg'd their Country by vaſt Conqueſts, and render'd it ſeveral times the moſt formidable of any Kingdom in <hi>Europe:</hi> They have likewiſe never ſubmitted to any Foreign Power, no not even to the <hi>Romans</hi> by force: They have alſo hitherto inviolably maintain'd their Liberties, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and peculiar manner of Government, againſt all the Attempts, both of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, or the Cabals form'd either by themſelves or their Kings at home: and I believe I may ſay to their great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are the only Nation in the World who have kept the longeſt Succeſſion

                     <p>Tho, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have ſaid the <hi>Poles</hi> have never excluded their Kings Children, yet muſt it be underſtood that their Crown has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in the ſame Family, by reaſon that from time to time the Royal Line has fail'd; and therefore they have conſequently been oblig'd to elect Princes out of other Families; but ſtill I may very well affirm, that there has never been any Stranger choſen, except in the preſent Election, where the preceding King had any Iſſue ſurviving.</p>

This, my Lord, the vigilant Court of <hi>France</hi> and wiſe Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> have long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, and therefore of late, have ſent into that Kingdom none but their moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Stateſmen.</p>
                     <p>The Eſteem the Court of <hi>Poland</hi> profeſs'd for your Lordſhip's Memory was freſh enough in my time to convince me, that you were throughly acquainted with the Genius and Conſtitution of that Nation; Two things Publick Miniſters ought chiefly to be vers'd in, and which are the Rules they generally go by in their Miniſtry, to compaſs more effectually their Deſigns. It would therefore, my Lord, appear vain in me to preſume to tell you any thing <hi>New</hi> as to the preſent State of that Kingdom, ſince, by converſing with your Lordſhip, I have learn'd ſome Particulars of that Country I knew nothing of before.

But nevertheleſs, the Pride of the latter of theſe Competitors had not better effect than the Promiſes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Gentry were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient at the tediouſneſs of the <hi>Diet,</hi> and at<note place="margin">Heats ariſe;</note> length were ready to go together by the Ears; when <hi>Opalinski</hi> Palatin of <hi>Kaliſch,</hi> to appeaſe the Diſorder, made an elegant Speech, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it was meer Madneſs for them to cut one anothers Throats about chooſing of Princes which they never ſaw, and that it would be more prudent to reject them both, their Birth and Alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> being ſufficient to merit their Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And proceeding in his Harangue, he put them in mind that the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding they perſiſted to make choice of a Prince out of it, might in all probability ſerve them as it had formerly done the Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> and that therefore it was not only unſafe, but alſo contrary to the Conſtitutions of their Kingdom to have any thing to do with them. Hereupon the Tumults began ſomething to abate, which gave
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52719:83"/>
him encouragement to go on and ſhew, that formerly, when Heats grew high, a Native, meaning <hi>Piaſtus,</hi> had been choſen, who govern'd the Kingdom ſo prudently, that even at 120 Years of Age his Death was regretted. Theſe<note place="margin">Appeas'd by a Speech.</note> Precautions (continued he) our Fore-fathers had againſt the Ambition, Envy or Avarice of ſuch as pretended to the Crown: Let us therefore (quoth he) leave the Duke of <hi>Neuburg</hi> to govern his ſmall Eſtate and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Family; and let the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> exhauſt his Treaſures to recover his Paternal Dominions.

                     <p>King <hi>Michael</hi> being dead was ſucceeded by <hi>John Sobieski</hi> the late King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was Captain of the Guards, and Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to King <hi>John Caſimir.</hi> Whilſt he had theſe Employments he marry'd Prince <hi>Zamoski</hi>'s Widow, who had 10000 Rix Dollars left her for a Jointure, by the contrivance and management of King <hi>Caſimir</hi> and his Queen, to whom ſhe was then Lady of the Bed-Chamber. At this Juncture <hi>Sobieski</hi>'s own Eſtate was not 2000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> a Year: But however, the King promis'd to advance him after he had marry'd this Lady, which he accordingly perform'd, and I may ſay that it was through the means of this Marriage that <hi>Sobieski</hi> was gradually promoted to the Supreme Dignity of the Crown.</p>
                     <p>Thus, my Lord, I have given as ſhort and exact an Account of the memorable Actions of the fourth Claſs of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> as

my Incapacity, and the Precipitation with which it was publiſh'd, would allow. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put an end to this Letter, I muſt beg your Grace's leave to take notice, that the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> tho always Elective, yet has been ſucceſſively in the ſame Family from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, or at leaſt from Father to Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other Relation, from the Year 830 to the Year 1674, which is from <hi>Piaſtus</hi> his Reign to the Election of the late King <hi>John Sobieski,</hi> except only the five Months that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> reign'd, I mean <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> who was kill'd by a Monk. To evince this, your Grace may be pleas'd to underſtand, that the laſt of the Family of <hi>Piaſtus</hi> in a direct Line was the Princeſs <hi>Hedwigis,</hi> who marry'd <hi>Jagello,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Lithuania.</hi> His Male Race by her reign'd to <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Second's time, of whoſe two Daughters, one was marry'd to King <hi>Stephen Batori</hi> his Succeſſor, and the other was Mother to <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. who with his Sons were ſucceſſively elected to the Throne to the time of King <hi>Michael Wieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowiski;</hi> who, tho he was not lineally deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Jagello,</hi> yet came laterally from the Race of <hi>Koributh Jagello</hi>'s Brother: So that it is evident that the <hi>Poles</hi> have reconcil'd a free Election of their Kings with an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion of the ſame for 844 Years; as likewiſe that they have never excluded the deceaſed King's Son, nor ever elected any <hi>German</hi> Prince to the Throne before this laſt Election of the Elector of <hi>Saxony, Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Auguſtus,</hi> now King of <hi>Poland.</hi> But as it is lawful for all Governments to alter their Conſtitutions at often as they find it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> after having been baffled at <hi>Slotskow,</hi> march'd directly towards <hi>Leopol,</hi> where the King's Army lay within a Mile of the Town. That way the Enemy was to approach, there was an Aſcent of about three hundred Paces, when one was to deſcend again by a very narrow Way, amidſt a Wood that had lately been cut down. At the foot of this Hill there was a Plain, through which the <hi>Tartars</hi> muſt neceſſarily paſs to come at the <hi>Poles.</hi> Here the King poſted his Brother-in-Law Duke <hi>Radzivil</hi> with ſome Troops for Guard of the Paſs on the Right-hand of his Camp. And General <hi>Kariski</hi> on the Left, caus'd ſeveral Cannon to be planted on a Hill, whence they might annoy the Enemy in the Plain. He alſo caus'd the Wood on each ſide the narrow Way to be well lin'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies of Musketeers. After which his Majeſty order'd ſome Troops of Horſe to advance into the Plain to oppoſe the Enemy, who about four in the Afternoon appear'd in ſuch Numbers, that they almoſt cover'd the Ground. In the mean time the King from a Hill obſerv'd their Motions: After which with his uſual Air of Gallantry, common to him in time of Action, at the Head of the remaining part of his ſmall Army he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Plain, encouraging his Souldiers, by telling them that he came there with full

Reſolution either to conquer, or die. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,<note place="margin">A Battle.</note> repeating thrice the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he briskly advanc'd towards the Enemy. The Fight began with great Fury on both ſides; the King omitting nothing either as to Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or Conduct, but performing both the part of a moſt prudent General and a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier, by his Example inſpiring all the reſt of his Officers, inſomuch that with this ſmall handful of Men he forc'd Multitudes of the Enemy to fly before Night, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them incredible Numbers ſlain upon the place.</p>
                     <p>The King would gladly have purſu'd the Enemy, but that the Night prevented; and that he fear'd likewiſe, leſt the <hi>Cham</hi> might come up to their Aſſiſtance. In this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Victory, the greateſt perhaps that has been known in any Age, the King had not actually with him much above five thouſand Men, the reſt having been left to ſecure the City of <hi>Leopol</hi> and the Paſſes. With this ſmall Party, to defeat by downright Fighting an Army of threeſcore thouſand Men, has more of <hi>Prodigy</hi> than <hi>Probability</hi> in it; yet ſo great was the Fright and Conſternation of theſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> that they fled in one Night as many Leagues as they had march'd in three Days before.</p>
                     <p>But here this Diſpute did not end, for the <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Iſmael Baſſa,</hi> to ſhew they were not diſmay'd at this ill Succeſs, reſolv'd to march againſt the King; and in order thereto, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Body of two thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> out to attack a Caſtle near <hi>Brzeziani,</hi> wherein were only ſixty <hi>Poles,</hi> who defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

ſo bravely, that they repuls'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with great Loſs.</p>
                     <p>Soon after a Body of ten thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> advancing ſomewhat near the City of <hi>Leopol,</hi> the King ſent out the Lord <hi>Harkownisky</hi> with a good Squadron of Horſe againſt them, who after a brisk Engagement forc'd them to take to their Heels, leaving Thouſands of their Companions dead upon the Spot. In this Action there were ſeveral brave <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the King being again ioin'd by the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> by which his Army amounted to fifteen thouſand Men, march'd to ſeek out the Enemy, tho by a modeſt computation they might be reckon'd ſeven times as many.

Subſtance, tho an indiviſible Spirit, can ever be in two places at the ſame time; beſides, the Soul can't be but where it does think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every one finds by Experience, that his Thought is not in his Hands nor Feet, but is conſcious to himſelf that his Thought is in his Head, and that conſequently the Soul muſt be only in the Brain, which is the Seat of Senſation, and the Origin of all the Nerves, which are the Organs of Perception and Motion. </hi>Father<hi> Vota </hi>being alarm'd at this Doctrine, which ſeem'd altogether new in that part of<hi> Europe, </hi>ſaid,<hi> That if the Soul was only in the Head, the reſt of the Body would be dead, ſince the receiv'd Opinion was, that the Soul was the Life of the whole Body, and that to enliven the whole Body, the Soul muſt be wholly preſent in every part of it. </hi>This drew on a longer Diſpute than I expected; for I anſwer'd,<hi> That the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul was not the Life of the Body, but the Blood only and the Animal Spirits, and that this Blood and Spirits circulated equally all over the Body, and gave it its natural Heat and Motion, which is properly its Life: and that this Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood and Spirits could not poſſibly depend on the Rational Soul, becauſe it was an involuntary Motion formed by the Mechanic Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body, and by the natural Impulſe of the Heart, which is the </hi>Primum Mobile<hi> of the whole Machine; and that tho they all held not only in </hi>Poland,<hi> but in other Countries, that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul perform'd every minute Action in the Body, yet this Opinion was irreconcilable with the free Will of the Mind, which they all admitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſince they allow that whatever the Soul does, not only it is conſcious of it, but likewiſe does it freely without being neceſſitated thereto; when as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52719:103"/>
it is evidently obvious to every one, that the vital Motions in our Bodies, I mean the Motion of the Heart, and that of Reſpiration, with the Periſtaltic Motion of the Stomach and Guts, are perform'd naturally with ſuch Mechaniſm that the Soul can't ſtop them; no nor as much as haſten or retard them, and that the Soul is not at all conſcious of them; for if we think of any Object, or not think at all, as when we are aſleep, or in an Apoplex, thoſe vital Motions go on equally the ſame.</hi>

                     <p>The Biſhop of<hi> Poſnania, </hi>who was bred up in his Youth a Phyſician, ſeem'd to ſpeak in favour of this Opinion, as did likewiſe ſome others of the Company; which made the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit very angry, inſomuch that he acquainted them in a kind of Paſſion,<hi> That neither the King nor they ought to hearken to any Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the receiv'd Opinion of the Church; that it might have been a pernicious Diſcourſe had it been publick: for </hi>(ſays he)<hi> if the Soul be not in all the Body, and if it does not animate the Body and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all its vital Functions, it would be of no uſe, and conſequently we ſhould live like other Animals. </hi>I anſwer'd him,<hi> That doubtleſs the Operations of Life were perform'd by the ſame Mechaniſm in us as they were in Brutes, ſince we have the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans with them, as likewiſe the ſame Fluids to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven us: That the Prerogatives of the Soul are not leſs for its not being preſent to every Action of the Body; for the Soul, tho it is not the cauſe of ſpontaneous or vital Motion in us, yet it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all voluntary Actions, as ſpeaking, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all other free Motions of the Body; it receiv'd all Impreſſions from the five Senſes; it forms to it ſelf all Ideas of ambient Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: it reaſons upon them, to know what's moſt

other Preſents. Afterwards we ſet forwards on our Journey, and were entertain'd for twelve days together in the Elector's Country; it's uſual with him to defray the Charges of all Princes while they are within the limits of the Marquiſate of <hi>Brandenburg:</hi> But when the Princeſs of <hi>Poland</hi> went out of it into the other Territories of his Electoral Highneſs, ſhe bore her own Expences; the chief Towns notwithſtanding, as <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> and <hi>Menden,</hi> entertain'd her, as did likewiſe the Elector of <hi>Hanover,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Heidelſheim,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> for we paſt through ſome Skirts of their Territories.</p>
                     <p>I muſt take notice to your Lordſhip, that paſſing through a part of the Elector of <hi>Hanover</hi>'s Country, we receiv'd News that Count <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> a <hi>Swede,</hi> thought to have been familiar with the Princeſs of <hi>Hanover,</hi> the Elector's Daughter-in-law, was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with at that Court, and never heard of ſince.

having ſpent about half an hour with her in Compliments, he turn'd to the Embaſſador and to the reſt of the Company, and thank'd us all for the Trouble and Fatigue of ſo long a Journey; then he and the Princeſs with the Embaſſador and Embaſſadreſs withdrew into another Room, where they paſt about an hour and an half. In the mean time a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Elector's Retinue came in, ſo that the Court was very numerous at Nine of the Clock at Night; and thus the Elector paſt till Ten of the Clock, then went to ſup abroad, and immediately after Supper came to wait on the Princeſs again, and about One of the Clock in the Morning he left her and went to Bed to his Inn. He came to her the next Morning to make his Court, and to deſire her Conſent that the Marriage might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated that Night, which being according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, he ſent a Courier after Midnight to the King his Father-in-law, to acquaint him therewith. The next Morning there was a rich Hungarian Sute of Clothes given him to wear that day from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> valued at 30000 Rix Dollars; it was a long Coat of Crimſon Velvet, the Button-holes ſet with Claſps of Maſſy Gold, and a Waſtcoat of Cloth of Gold ſet with Diamond Buttons, and a Girdle of fine Turky Leather wrought with Gold, with maſſy Gold Claſps likewiſe ſet with Jewels, a Scimiter with the Handle richly adorn'd with Diamonds and Rubies, and an Emerald Ring of great Value, with a rich Zibelin Muff.

and moſt of the Retinue return'd back into <hi>Poland;</hi> for by the Articles of Marriage no body was to ſtay with her except two Pages, two Women, and a ſhe Dwarf. The Elector's Guards and Coaches were on the other ſide of the River to receive the Princeſs: She went through <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Mecklin,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where we arriv'd, after two Months Journey, on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi> I need not acquaint your Lordſhip with all the Preparations made here by his Highneſs for the Reception of his Electoreſs, nor of the Preſents he gave to her Retinue, nor the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> and <hi>Comedies</hi> purpoſely made for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of her Marriage; I will only ſay, that I never ſaw a genteeler Court, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Order, more Formalities, more variety of Dreſſes, nor the Punctilio's of Honour and Courteſy more ſtrictly obſerv'd. There were great Rejoicings all the firſt Week, until the Court receiv'd the unwelcome News of the Death of our late Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Sometime afterwards, having left the Care of the Princeſs's Health to Monſieur <hi>Piſtorini</hi> the Elector's Phyſician, I took my Leave of her Highneſs, and went for <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence I arriv'd at <hi>London</hi> in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 1694/5.</p>

I examined the Princeſs's Diſeaſe, and found it was an Ague fomented by an Abſceſs in the Liver, which made her vomit up all that ſhe took; I thought her Caſe very deſperate, tho her ordinary Phyſicians made no account of it, thinking it was only an Ague which the conſtant uſe of Jeſuits Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would infallibly cure. I diſcover'd they were not acquainted with the inward Cauſe of her Diſeaſe, being not vers'd in Anatomy; wherefore I deſir'd that moſt of the Learned Gentlemen at Court would be preſent to hear their Reaſons and mine. Dr. <hi>Jonas,</hi> who ſpoke firſt, gave his Opinion that there was no fear; and that ſhe ſhould perſiſt only in the uſe of the Bark, with which they had cram'd her for three Months before; all the reſt follow'd his Opinion. I ſpoke laſt, and ſumm'd up all their Arguments, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with her Diſtemper, and declar'd againſt their Method, and intimated that I believ'd ſhe could not live long let them change their Method ever ſo much for the better. This alarm'd the whole Court in a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52719:112"/>
quarter of an hour. The Phyſicians aſſur'd the contrary, and urged that I was a Stranger to the Climate, and to the Princeſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Diſeaſe; and they promiſed in a little time, tho ſome of them began to be diſſident, to ſet her upon her Legs again: notwithſtanding ſhe grew worſe and worſe every day, and died in a Month's time in the 62<hi>d</hi> Year of her Age. The Queen order'd her to be open'd, and three Biſhops were preſent, but none of the Phyſicians would come but my ſelf; we found not only an Abſceſs in her Liver, but likewiſe a great many ſquare Stones like Dice in her Gall, Bladder, and other Stones in one of her Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, beſides a great deal of Gravel in her Liver, which grated and crumbled its whole Subſtance into putrid Matter.</p>

                                 <p>HIS Majeſty's Feet, Legs, and Thighs, as likewiſe the lower Part of his Belly, have been conſiderably ſwell'd for a good while. Theſe Swellings have daily encreas'd ſince they began this Summer, notwithſtanding the moſt effectual Remedies, both Inward and Outward, which have been made uſe of to prevent their Progreſs, and to diſcuſs them. When theſe Tumors are preſs'd with one's Finger, they do not pit, for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as hard as Iron, and as heavy as Lead. When his Majeſty walks, he imagins he has a great Weight ty'd to his Legs. The hardneſs of theſe Tumours cannot be ſoftned: Nevertheleſs, when the ſwoln Parts are rubb'd a little with a hot Cloth, they ſeem immediately to be abated and

eas'd; but ſoon after they return to their former condition. The Colour of the Swellings is not pale, but reddiſh, ſomething enclining to Purple.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The King's Death.</note> A Week after I receiv'd this Letter, news came that this Prince was dead, as I could not but reaſonably expect he would be, labouring under ſo rare and dangerous a Diſeaſe, being a Dropſy turn'd into a <hi>Schirrus,</hi> or into a hard and inſenſible Tumor. Caſes of this nature, <hi>my Lord,</hi> are very ſeldom ſeen. I have ſpoke lately with ſome old Practitioners in Phyſick that had never met with any; for my part, I have never obſerv'd any Diſeaſe like it; and I was at firſt ſurpriz'd that the King's Legs, that us'd to pit an Inch deep when I was at his Court, ſhould become ſo very hard and ſo heavy afterwards; but conſidering that in our Maſs of Blood there is, even naturally, a great deal of earthy Parts or Dregs, and that theſe Lees may, by way of Sediment, fall into the Legs, and that their Weight and Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can hinder them from aſcending to the Heart with the circulating Fluids, I rather admir'd why Caſes of this nature do not more frequently happen, particularly in old and <hi>Plethoric</hi> People, as the King was. Theſe hard Swellings of his Legs hinder'd the Blood to circulate downwards, and ſo drove up all the Humours to the Head; which oppreſſing and overflowing the Brain, caus'd an Apoplexy, of which he died the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> fifteen days after the date of my Letter, in the Year 1696, in the ſixty ſixth Year of his Age, and the 22d of his Reign. He was the oldeſt King
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52719:114"/>
then in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> He kept his Subjects in great Awe, and the greateſt Noblemen paid him all the Reſpect imaginable; they never us'd at Court to eat with him at his Table. He din'd always in Publick, and the Great Men waited upon him, ſerv'd him with drink, and none of his Subjects ever cover'd themſelves in his Preſence. And I admir'd to ſee the Perſons that abus'd him in the Parliament-houſe, and ſpoke to him with all freedom when he ſat on the Throne, pay him ſo great a Submiſſion and Reſpect every-where elſe. But the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Member of that Parliament is ſuch, that <hi>he can ſpeak what he thinks, and think what he pleaſes,</hi> without any Fear of the King.</p>

laſt the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> unexpectedly came to the Frontiers of <hi>Poland</hi> with 8000 Men, and declar'd himſelf Candidate, having a twelve-month before privately abjur'd his Religion to qualify himſelf for this Crown, which procur'd him the Intereſt of the Pope and Clergy. So that at length no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Party appear'd but for him, the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and Prince <hi>James.</hi> The Cardinal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, with a great Number of the Palatins, ſupported with all their Intereſt the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> having for ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I obſerv'd when I was in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, given a great Character of his Merit and Valour, which made the King of <hi>France</hi> believe that he would undoubtedly carry that Crown againſt all Oppoſers; as it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he would have done, had he been in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as near the Place of Election as the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Saxony</hi> was: For on the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> being the day of Election, the <hi>Diet</hi> drew out into the Field, and he had that day more Votes than either the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> or Prince <hi>James;</hi> which the Primate obſerving, went with his Party, and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd him King: but the two other Parties knowing this could not be legally done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the univerſal Conſent of the <hi>Diet,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt it as Illegal; and Prince <hi>James</hi> perceiving his Party to be the weakeſt, and having always been in the Intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as being marry'd to the Empreſs and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Siſter, reſign'd all his Intereſt to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was likewiſe ſupported by the Emperour. Theſe two Parties being thus united into one,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52719:115"/>
were more numerous than that of the Prince of <hi>Conti:</hi> Wherefore coming next day into the field, they got the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia,</hi> after the Primate had refus'd it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim</p>

                        </note> following, which did extreamly facilitate the good Succeſs he has ſince had in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For tho the Primate and many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſons did inſiſt on the pretended Legality of their Election; tho the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> himſelf came in Perſon to <hi>Dantzic</hi> with a Fleet, vaſt Sums of Money, and ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Troops; tho the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador Monſieur <hi>de Polignac</hi> had manag'd a good part of the Army, and a great many of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with great Art and Policy; tho the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> threatned an Invaſion to ſupport his Election; and tho the <hi>Hungarians</hi> made an Inſurrection in their Country, to divert the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52719:116"/>
                        <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces: yet the <hi>Poles</hi> ſeeing the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was actually Crown'd; that he was in poſſeſſion of the Metropolis <hi>Cracow,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Town in <hi>Poland;</hi> that 8000 of his diſciplin'd Troops were in the Kingdom; that the major part of the Army had declar'd for him, and that the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> threatned an Invaſion if they perſiſted to ſupport the Prince of <hi>Conti;</hi> they thought it more adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quit his Intereſt than to give occaſion for a Civil War: for I have often heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them ſay, <hi>That Kings were eaſy enough to be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding Blood for any; and that they were eaſily depos'd if they uſurp'd any greater Authority than the Laws allow'd.</hi> And therefore they think it more prudent, after having ſufficiently emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd the Candidates Pockets, to declare for the firſt of them that joins his Party, and appears in Arms, ſince he is deem'd qualify'd, than to expoſe their Country to ruin and devaſtation, by adhering to an illegal Election, of which the ſucceſs is always doubtful: for by their Conſtitution no Election can be really lawful, nor any Law can be legally made without the univerſal Conſent of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of both States, <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> aſſembl'd in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> having full Intelligence of the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Poland,</hi> did not think it politick to conſide any longer in the Promiſes of the Great Men, who in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are naturally ſickle, and biaſs'd more to their own Intereſt than any Inclination they have to ſerve any Prince; for they have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion of Princes than of Tools to raiſe their own Fortune by. Wherefore this Prince
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52719:116"/>
foreſeeing no probability of ſucceſs, the Town of <hi>Dantzic</hi> having declar'd for the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> he thought it more prudent timely to quit his Pretenſions by ſailing back into <hi>France,</hi> than to expoſe his Reputation by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd to retire when the New King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was more confirm'd, as it is look'd upon to be at preſent.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Frederick Auguſtus</hi> the IId, being thus left in ſole Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, is likely to reſtore the decaying State thereof; for having large hereditary Dominions of his own, out of which he can have both Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and being likewiſe naturally animated with a martial Spirit, and moreover King over a moſt Warlike Nation, which is at preſent in league againſt the Infidels with the Emperour, <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> Pope and <hi>Venetians:</hi> He has opportunity ſufficient to enlarge that Kingdom, and extend it to its antient Bounds the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, by retaking <hi>Caminiec</hi> and the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I may here take notice that this is the firſt time the <hi>Poles</hi> have elected a <hi>German</hi> Prince, and likewiſe the firſt that they have excluded their King's Son; for from the Year 550, when this Monarchy began, to this preſent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the King's Children have been always choſen, and the Crown, tho elective, has been in the ſame Family ſucceſſively for above eight hundred Years. But hereafter it is likely to prove otherwiſe, for the Gentry of <hi>Poland</hi> are ſo jealous of their own Kings, and ſo covetous to be enrich'd by foreign Princes, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably henceforward they will chooſe no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Beſides, the Pope will undoubtedly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52719:117"/>
uſe his utmoſt Authority and Intereſt in that Kingdom to get Proteſtant Princes elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For when I was formerly at <hi>Rome,</hi> I heard the Politicians ſay, that the beſt method to make the Proteſtant Princes of the North Roman Catholicks, was to elect them ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> So that if the Pope ſees that the preſent King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Children are confirm'd in the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he will doubtleſs after his Death make the ſame Endeavours to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to that Throne either the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> or the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Hanover,</hi> as he has done in favour of the Elector of <hi>Saxony;</hi> who has been elected to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> not ſo much by the Power of his Wealth and Credit in the Kingdom, as by the Influence of the Clergy, privately inſtigated by the Authority of the Pope. This I gather from a Letter ſent me laſt Summer from <hi>Warſaw</hi> by my Friend Baron <hi>Scarlati,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary at that Court from the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I have given you as large an Account of <hi>John</hi> the IIId's Life, and of what paſs'd remarkable at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in my time, as we need perhaps know of ſo remote a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or I could my ſelf learn in ſo ſhort a time as I had the honour to reſide at that Prince's Court; where I was ſo much taken up in the Practice of Phyſick, that I had neither Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity nor Time to make all the Political Remarks, which another perhaps that had nothing elſe to do but to converſe with Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Ladies, might have leiſurely done.</p>

It lies in the midſt of ſeveral little Hills environ'd with a ſtrong double Wall, and a very deep Ditch. The City it ſelf, it muſt be confeſs'd, it but ſmall, yet nevertheleſs exceeding beautiful and well-built, its Edifices being for the moſt part of Free-ſtone. Among the publick Structures, the moſt conſiderable is the Caſtle rais'd upon a ſmall Eminence between the Rivers <hi>Varta</hi> and <hi>Proſna.</hi> It is generally provided with all ſorts of Ammunition, and wants for neither Strength nor Beauty. The reſt of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edifices may juſtly claim the like Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho the moſt ſtately lie on the other ſide the River <hi>Varta</hi> in the Suburbs, which are very large. Here is the Cathedral Church with a College of Prebends, and the Biſhop's Palace ſituate among the Marſhes. This Pile of Building is commonly call'd <hi>Valiſovia,</hi> and built ſo ſtrong, that like the Town, it is able to withſtand a Siege. <hi>John Lubranſcius,</hi> a Biſhop of this See, founded here a College to be viſited by that of <hi>Cracow,</hi> and which was afterwards very much augmented and beautify'd by <hi>Adam Conarius</hi> his Succeſſor, and farther enrich'd by one <hi>Roſraſevius</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral noble Gifts: So that now the Jeſuits have a College in the City, where Learning is greatly encourag'd. Yet this alſo in the Suburbs does not want for noble Youth, who daily flock thither to be inſtructed by the Lectures of Mathematicks and Law. Theſe Suburbs are all ſurrounded by a Moraſs and a great Lake. They are frequently laid under
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52719:123"/>
water by the overflowing of the <hi>Varta,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſometimes with the neighbouring Villages for ſeveral Miles together, the tops of the Houſes are only to be ſeen. This Inundation likewiſe often extends to the Town it ſelf, notwithſtanding its high Walls, in a manner that Boats have been known to ſwim about the Streets: But this laſts not long, for the Waters commonly retire in two or three days at fartheſt. There are three very famous Fairs kept in this City, whither the <hi>Germans,</hi> both Traders and Gentry, come in great Numbers. The firſt of theſe is kept about the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> and laſts a Month. The ſecond at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues five Weeks; and the laſt at <hi>Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> which is for the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants of this City are generally <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> tho vaſt Numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> live alſo among them. The Government is executed by a <hi>Staroſta,</hi> choſen yearly out of the <hi>Schipins,</hi> or Aldermen, who, as long as this Office laſts, enjoys alſo the Title of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Great</hi> POLAND.</p>

The Revenue of this Mine amounts to about eight hundred thouſand Timfs or <hi>Poliſh Florins</hi> annually, which makes about 400000 French Livres, whereof 50000 go to the King, 10000 to the Queen, and ſome thouſands more to the Officers of the Crown, and the Miners and other Labourers; yet over and above all this, the Proprietor is oblig'd to make a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preſent to all the Cities and Towns of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and more particularly to their <hi>Staroſtas.</hi> A Cobler about the Year 1548, firſt found out this Mine, who digging a Well near this Place, perceiv'd a Fountain with a thin Wall of Salt in the middle of it; which breaking, and not knowing what to make of, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Owners of the Land, who were then the Family of <hi>Morſtin;</hi> who digging deeper, by reaſon they did not meet with much Salt near the Surface, found it in ſo great Quantity, that they have not been able to exhauſt it during the Space of 150 Years. The Miners ſay, that the Lumps of Salt weigh a great deal leſs in the Mine than when taken out, which I have not ſeen confirm'd. There are four ſorts of Salt in the Mine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is extream hard and rocky, like Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Another leſs hard, and clearer. A third brittle and ſofter, as alſo white and pure. All theſe three ſorts are brackiſh, when the fourth only is ſomewhat freſher. In theſe Mines you ſhall have on one ſide a ſtream of ſalt Water, and on the other one of freſh. There are ſome places in theſe Mines where you can't work, becauſe you dare not carry a Candle for fear of ſetting the Vapours on fire, which

are always Nitrous, and eaſily ſuſceptible of Flame.</p>

It was built by the Knights of the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Order in the Year 1223, who likewiſe fortified it againſt the Irruptions of the Heathen <hi>Pruſſians;</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deſalza,</hi> Maſter of that Order, gave Laws and Conſtitutions for its Government. This City ſuffer'd much Damage during the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Invaſion, and is now very thin of Inhabitants; inſomuch that the Epiſcopal See, ſubject to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> has been for ſome time remov'd to the neighbouring Town of <hi>Colmenſee.</hi> It has in it very fair Churches, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with many valuable Ornaments and precious Offerings.</p>

However this City at preſent is the faireſt and beſt built of any in Royal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Streets being much broader, and Houſes more ſtately than at <hi>Dantzic.</hi> It was very much beautiſied by one of its Burgermaſters <hi>Henry Stwband</hi> in the Year 1609, who built a ſmall Univerſity here, and endow'd it with a conſiderable Revenue. He likewiſe founded an Hoſpital, and a Publick Library, where two of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Epiſtles are preſerv'd written upon Tables of Wax, and a Town-houſe built in the middle of the Market-place. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants revolted from the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order in the Year 1454, and put themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Poland.</hi>

                           <hi>Kiow,</hi> or <hi>Kiouf,</hi> according to the Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Inhabitants, an antient, large, and very populous City, fortify'd with ſtrong Paliſado's, a Caſtle, Trench, and ſome other Regular Works, and ſituate on the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> or <hi>Nieper.</hi> The old <hi>Kiow</hi> was built on a Hill a little beyond the River, where are ſtill to be ſeen the Ruins of many Arches, high Walls, Churches, and Burying-places of divers Kings with Greek Inſcriptions. Of theſe Churches, two remain in tolerable good Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of St. <hi>Sophia</hi> and St. <hi>Michael.</hi> The Walls of the former are lin'd with curious <hi>Moſaic</hi> Work, and the <hi>Dome</hi> conſiſts of Earthen Pots, well cemented and fill'd with Mortar. St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Church is chiefly remarkable for its gilded Roof. The Burying-places of the antient great Men of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> were in ſeveral Caves near this City, ſome of which are ſaid to extend into the Borders of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> above eighty Miles in length. The Bodies here are

preſerv'd whole and entire, eſpecially thoſe of two certain Princes, which are dreſt in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Habits, and have been not long ſince ſhewn to Travellers by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Monks. The Place where theſe Sepulchers are made is of a ſandy Stone, very dry, and ſeems to be of the ſame Nature with the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Rome. Kiow</hi> was heretofore an exceeding large City, as may appear from the Ruins of the Walls, which extend themſelves above eight Miles in compaſs. It is ſaid to have been firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Prince nam'd <hi>Kius,</hi> in the Year of Chriſt 861, and then conſtituted Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Tauro-Scythia.</hi> Next it became the Seat of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire, and was afterwards govern'd by its own Princes. It was ſtorm'd and pillag'd by the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the Year 1615, and has ever ſince declin'd from its primitive Grandeur. It has been often taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken within the Space of thirty Years, but now remains wholly in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Ozar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> to whom it was lately pawn'd by the <hi>Coſacks.</hi> The Epiſcopal See of <hi>Kiow</hi> is ſubject to the Metropolitan of <hi>Leopol.</hi> Here reſides the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Archbiſhop, ſupream over all of the ſame Perſuaſion throughout <hi>Poland.</hi> Here are divers <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Churches, and a great many Monaſteries, &amp;c.</p>

This Province takes its Name from its Situation, which is low and marſhy; the word <hi>Samogitz</hi> in the Language of this Country denoting as much. It abounds with Lakes and inacceſſible Mountains, yet affords great quantities of Honey, purer than that either of <hi>Lithuania</hi> or <hi>Livonia,</hi> and breeds Horſes which are very much admir'd for their Swiftneſs. The ordinary People here live in<note place="margin">Manners of the People.</note> Cottages for the moſt part ſeated near Lakes or Rivers, and cover'd either with Thatch or Boards. They plough the Ground not with Iron but Wood, tho the Soil be moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fat and ſtiff; which Cuſtom they are addicted to even to Superſtition: for when a certain <hi>Staroſta</hi> of that Country thought to introduce Iron Plowſhares among them, and the Seaſon not happening to prove as kind as uſual, they attributed all the cauſe to this change of Inſtrument; whereupon they were permitted to return to their old way for fear of an Inſurrection.

Nay, even at this day in many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> the poor Peaſants, altho they profeſs Chriſtianity, yet keep Adders in their Houſes, to which they pay a more than ordinary Veneration, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that ſome great Miſchief would befal them if theſe Idols ſhould come to any harm. To be more particular with this Country, your Lordſhip may underſtand that their Houſes (except only thoſe of the Gentry) are built low and long-ways, with an Hearth in the middle, and but one Room, which ſerves not only for themſelves but their Cattel. The better ſort drink out of Horn Cups, and eat out of Wooden Platters.

                     <p>Among theſe Brothers, <hi>Olgerdus</hi> and <hi>Keijſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> being moſt vex'd to ſee their younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jauunutus</hi> ſo highly promoted, conſpir'd together, after their Father's Death, to drive him out of <hi>Vilna;</hi> for the execution of which, they fix'd a certain time: but <hi>Olgerdus</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening then to be abſent on ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſion, was forc'd to fail of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.

                        <hi>Olgerdus</hi> dying in the Year 1381, <hi>Jagello</hi> aſcended his Throne with conſent of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Keijſtutus.</hi> This Duke had a favourite Courtier, one <hi>Voidilus,</hi> a Man of an obſcure Deſcent, and whom he had rais'd from his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to be his Secretary and prime Miniſter. This Perſon he affected ſo dearly, that he gave him his Siſter in Marriage, which was highly diſpleaſing to his Uncle, who proteſted earneſtly againſt it: whereupon this ſubtle Upſtart, fearing leſt <hi>Keijſtutus</hi> might one day or other put him out of favour with his Prince, he prevail'd with <hi>Jagello</hi> to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Uncle as his Enemy, and to proceed againſt him accordingly; which <hi>Jagello,</hi> being young, was eaſily perſuaded to do: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clapping up a ſecret Truce with the <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic</hi> Knights, with whom he was before in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52719:175"/>
War, he made all imaginable Preparations againſt his Uncle: which <hi>Keijſtutus</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of, was immediately alarm'd at, till his Son <hi>Vitoldus</hi> quieted his Suſpicions, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him that <hi>Jagello</hi> would never attempt any ſuch thing: but at length <hi>Jagello</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> of <hi>Polocz,</hi> which were then his Uncle's Subjects, his deſign was paſt all doubt; and therefore <hi>Keijſtutus</hi> got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what Forces he could upon ſo ſhort a Warning, and invaded his Nephew's Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, where he took <hi>Vilna,</hi> and would have proceeded, had it not been for his Son <hi>Vitol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> who ſtill continu'd <hi>Jagello</hi>'s Friend. But afterwards <hi>Keijſtutus</hi> being buſy'd in ſubduing the Traitor <hi>Koributh Jagello,</hi> not only retook <hi>Vilna,</hi> but alſo beſieg'd and gain'd <hi>Troki</hi> by Treachery; which <hi>Keijſtutus</hi> marching to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, he, together with his Son <hi>Vitoldus,</hi> was betray'd into <hi>Jagello</hi>'s hands by means of his Brother <hi>Skergelo,</hi> who pretended to bring theſe two Princes amicably together; but <hi>Jagello</hi> having once got his Uncle into his Clutches, detain'd him, and threw him into Chains, and afterwards order'd him to be ſtrangled in his Priſon at <hi>Kreva.</hi> His Couſin German <hi>Vitoldus</hi> he ungratefully kept a long while in Bonds at <hi>Vilna;</hi> who afterwards being remov'd to <hi>Kreva,</hi> and a time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Death, eſcap'd by means of his Wife, who always having free Acceſs to him, by exchanging Habits with one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, got her Husband away in her own. Hence he fled to his Kinſman <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Maſovia;</hi> but not thinking himſelf ſecure there, he afterwards went into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> where
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52719:175"/>
at firſt he was reprov'd by the Knights of the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Order for having recourſe to them only in time of Adverſity; but afterwards he was more courteouſly receiv'd, and promis'd their Aſſiſtance to re-eſtabliſh him in his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dominions. Whereupon, together with the <hi>Samogitians,</hi> who favour'd <hi>Vitoldus</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, they made an Inroad into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and took <hi>Troki;</hi> but they were afterwards nevertheleſs forc'd to ſurrender it. At length <hi>Jagello</hi> by ſecret Meſſages, recall'd his Kinſman out of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> and upon his Promiſe to be faithful to him, ſettled him in his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Eſtate. A little while after this, the Throne of <hi>Poland</hi> becoming vacant by <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Death, <hi>Jagello</hi> was invited thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accept that Crown under certain Conditions, which may appear more at large in his Life among thoſe Kings.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Jagello</hi> was thus abſent in <hi>Poland</hi> with great Numbers of his Subjects, who went to wait on him into that Kingdom, the Great Maſters of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Livonia</hi> finding a fit opportunity, enter'd <hi>Lithuania,</hi> deſtroying with Fire and Sword as far as the Caſtle of <hi>Lucom</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> which alſo they took, and having furniſh'd with all neceſſary Defence, plac'd in it <hi>Andrew Jagello</hi>'s Brother, upon whoſe Requeſt this Expedition had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. About the ſame time <hi>Swetoſlaus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> invaded <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and took <hi>Mſciſlaw</hi> and ſeveral other Places by force; both which Actions <hi>Jagello</hi> being ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of, immediately diſpatch'd away his Brother <hi>Skirgelo,</hi> and Kinſman <hi>Vitoldus,</hi> into <hi>Lithuania;</hi> who finding the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Army
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52719:176"/>
retir'd, forthwith laid Siege to the Caſtle of <hi>Lucom;</hi> which having taken, they proceeded to <hi>Mſciſlaw,</hi> which they likewiſe took, and kill'd <hi>Swetoſlaus,</hi> who was in poſſeſſion of it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards having recover'd all the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Dominions which had ſided with Duke <hi>Andrew,</hi> they made him Priſoner; and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into <hi>Poland,</hi> he was order'd by his Brother <hi>Jagello</hi> to be caſt into a noiſom Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, whence, upon the requeſt of the good-natur'd <hi>Vitoldus,</hi> he was not long after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Jagello</hi>'s Death, tho there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Great Dukes of <hi>Lithuania;</hi> yet ſeeing they were Tributary to the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> it ſelf was afterwards united to <hi>Poland</hi> under one Form of Government, I need not inſiſt any longer upon the Succeſſion of its Dukes, ſince what paſt remarkable in their Time, is comprehended in the Hiſtory of the Kings of the <hi>Jagellonic</hi> Family, who reign'd in <hi>Poland</hi> from <hi>Jagello</hi>'s time to the late King <hi>Michael Wieſnowiski;</hi> therefore I will proceed to enter upon the Geographical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this great Dutchy.</p>

The Houſes of this City are generally low and mean, being moſt built with Wood, except ſome belonging to the Gentry, others to Foreign Merchants, and ſeveral publick Edifices, which are all either of Stone or Brick. Of the two Caſtles, that on a Hill is very antient, and almoſt ruin'd; but the other is a Pile of beautiful modern Architecture.

They likewiſe believ'd Serpents to be Gods, which were their <hi>Lares,</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Deities, and therefore each Family kept one in their Houſe, to which they daily ſacrificed Milk, Fowls, and the like; and one of which if they happen'd at any time to offend, they look'd upon it to be an <hi>Omen</hi> of Deſtruction to their whole Progeny. They had alſo a ſet time appointed for a Solemn Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, being about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> when together with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they feaſted riotouſly for three days, in like manner as we have ſaid before in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogitia.</hi> Upon their return from the Wars they were wont to ſacrifice one of the chief of their Captives with all their Booty to the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52719:184"/>
Fire. They us'd to burn their Dead with all their richeſt Ornaments on, which they wore whilſt living, together with one of their moſt faithful Servants, their Horſes, Arms, Dogs, &amp;c. whilſt all their Relations and Friends brought Milk, Honey, Beer, and the like, and merrily feaſted and danc'd about their Funeral-Pile to Muſick of various kinds.</p>

From henceforward the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> have for the major part continued Chriſtians, tho there are yet ſome Idolaters among them of different Beliefs towards the Frontiers of

There are alſo in this Great Dutchy about thirty thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> with liberty of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd this Privilege for ſome hundreds of Years, on condition that they ſhall ſend every Year twelve hundred Men to the Wars againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> Theſe Mahometans call their Churches <hi>Meczets.</hi>

There was one kept in a Convent in my time who was taken among them, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in my Latin<note n="*" place="bottom">Evangel.

at length, being taught to ſtand upright, by clapping up his Body againſt a Wall, and holding him after the manner that Dogs are taught to beg; and being by little and little accuſtom'd to eat at Table, he after ſome time became indifferently tame, and began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Mind with a hoarſe and unhuman Tone; but being ask'd concerning his courſe of Life in the Woods, he could not give much better account of it, than we can do of our Actions in the Cradle.</p>
                     <p>Upon this occaſion I was aſſur'd by the King himſelf, ſeveral Senators and other Great Men of that Kingdom; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is the common and undiſputed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that Children are oftentimes nouriſh'd and brought up by Bears in theſe Parts.

                              <p>
                                 <hi>I</hi> Shall endeavour partly to ſatisfy your Requeſt, and to give you an Account of a Boy that I ſaw at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in the Year <hi>1661,</hi> who had been brought up by Bears. Coming to this City of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with deſign to be Preſent at the Election of a King after <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who had Abdicated the Crown, I enquir'd what was worth ſeeing in or about this Place: whereupon I was inform'd, among other things, that there was in the Suburbs of this City (which go towards King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s Palace) in a Nunnery, a certain Male Child, who had been brought up among Bears, and who had been taken ſome time before at a Bear-hunting. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Information I went immediately to that place to ſatisfy my Curioſity, where I found the aforeſaid Boy playing under the Pent-houſe before the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery Gate. His Age, as well as I remember, I gueſs'd to be about twelve or thirteen. As ſoon as I came near him he leap'd towards me as if ſurpriz'd and pleas'd with my Habit. Firſt, be caught one of my Silver Buttons in his hand with a great deal of eagerneſs, which he held up to his Noſe to ſmell;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52719:188"/>
Afterwards he leap'd all of a ſudden into a Corner, where he made a ſtrange ſort of Noiſe not unlike to Howling. I went into the Houſe, where a Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant inform'd me more particularly of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his being taken. But having not with me the Book wherein I wrot my Obſervations in my Travels, I cannot poſſibly give you an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. This Maid call'd the Boy in, and ſhow'd him a good large piece of Bread; which when he ſaw, he immediately leap'd upon a Bench that was joyn'd to the Wall of the Room, where he walk'd about upon all-four: After which, he rais'd himſelf upright with a great Spring, and took the Bread in his two Hands, put it up to his Noſe, and afterwards leap'd off from the Bench upon the Ground, making the ſame odd ſort of Noiſe as before. I was told that he was not yet brought to ſpeak, but that they hop'd in a ſhort time he would, having his Hearing good. He had ſome Scars on his Face, which were commonly thought to be Scratches of the Bears.</p>
                              <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> you have all that I can remember of a Curioſity, which I ſaw ſo long time ſince; the Truth of which no body ought to queſtion, ſince there are ſeveral parallel Examples in Hiſtory; and I have been inform'd in this Country, that whenas the <hi>Tartars</hi> make frequent Incurſions there, which they perform with ſuch extraordinary Swiftneſs, that they can over-run great part of the Country in a very ſhort time, their Horſes being able to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel a whole Day together without drawing Bit; being arriv'd at the propos'd Place, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately quarter themſelves in a great Circle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it were in a Net, they take all that come within their Clutches, and carry them into Slavery.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52719:189"/>
So that either the Men or Women finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus enſnar'd, and endeavouring to eſcape, have oftentimes not leiſure to take care of their Infants, and therefore probably this Boy might have been left behind after the like manner, and found and born away by the Bears; Of which there are a great Number both in <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I am ſorry, <hi>Sir,</hi> I cannot give you a more ſatisfactory Account of this matter, but I hope this will ſuffice for a Teſtimony of my good Will, and to aſſure you that I am,</p>

                     <p>For another Confirmation of this Matter of fact, I have the Teſtimony of an authentic Author, <hi>M. Chriſtopher Hartknoch</hi> of <hi>Paſſenheim</hi> in Ducal-<hi>Pruſſia,</hi> who writ two Books of the State of <hi>Poland.</hi> He ſays, that during the Reign of King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> in the Year 1669, there hapned an Accident which perhaps might hardly be credited by Poſterity; which was, that there were then two Boys found by a Company of Soldiers among the Bears in the Woods near <hi>Grodna;</hi> one of which, as ſoon as he ſaw the Bears aſſaulted, fled into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Moraſs, whilſt the other endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe to eſcape, was taken by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52719:189"/>
and brought to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> where he was afterwards chriſten'd by the Name of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> He was about twelve or thirteen years old, as might be gueſt by his height, but his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were altogether beſtial; for he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed upon raw Fleſh, wild Honey, Crab-Apples, and ſuch like Dainties which Bears are us'd to feaſt with, but alſo went, like them, upon all-four. After his Baptiſm he was not taught to go upright without a great deal of difficulty, and there was leſs hopes of ever making him learn the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Language, for he always continu'd to expreſs his Mind in a kind of Bear-like Tone. Some time after King <hi>Caſimir</hi> made a Preſent of him to <hi>Peter Adam Opalinski,</hi> Vice-Chamberlain of <hi>Poſnan,</hi> by whom he was employ'd in the Offices of his Kitchin, as to carry Wood, Water, &amp;c. but yet could he never be brought to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his native Wildneſs, which he retain'd to his dying-day; for he would often go into the Woods amongſt the Bears, and freely keep company with them without any fear, or harm done him, being, as was ſuppos'd, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg'd for their Foſterling.</p>
                     <p>I might here, <hi>Sir,</hi> give you ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accounts of this Nature, which I had related to me when I was in <hi>Poland;</hi> and I am told Mr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> a Parliament-man, has formerly ſeen ſome other Examples of this kind in that Kingdom; but by what I have already mention'd, I believe you will be ſufficiently convinc'd, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> is not ſo fabulous as it
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52719:190"/>
is generally conjectured to be, and as I thought my ſelf it was before I had been in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for conſidering that Brutes (ſince Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Divines will allow them no Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Souls) breed up their Young meerly out of a Natural Inſtinct or Sympathy, which I need not deſcribe here, I ſee no Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility why they may not likewiſe bring up thoſe of another Kind, as we have ſeveral Inſtances daily. But I will not inſiſt longer upon theſe Philoſophical Matters, nor examin here whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examples of this nature refute or eſtabliſh innate Ideas, as I have done in my <hi>Medicina Myſtica,</hi> but will conclude,</p>

                     <p>WE have here ſome Account of the accurate Courſe of the Chymical and Anatomical Lectures which you perform'd laſt Spring at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and of your new method of explaining the Virtues of Medicines there, with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Improvement of all that had the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſſiſt at them.

                     <p>WHatever you are pleaſed to ſay in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me or my Book, I muſt wholly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to your Civility, and will return no other Compliment to you for it, but that I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſerve your good Opinion. I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to your Correſpondent in <hi>Oxon</hi> for the advantagious Character he gives of me; and I aſſure you that I have not met with better Diſcipline, nor with Perſons more univerſally learned in any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Method or Scheme I obſerved at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to lead the Proficients in Phyſick, and other ingenious Gentlemen there into the Knowledg of the Fabrick, natural Functions, and Diſtempers of the Human Body, as likewiſe into the Knowledg of the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> to cure the ſame Diſeaſes, it is as follows.</p>
                     <p>I conſider'd Man, in the firſt place, as a Being compounded of Spirit and Matter: But ſeeing it is only the laſt of theſe Parts wherein our Faculty is concern'd, I took a ſtricter veiw of the Human Body, and find the Structure of it like that of moſt other Animals. But to have any accurate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Man, we muſt not only have a diſtinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his conſtituent Parts, but likewiſe of all the external Bodies which any way affect him, or contribute to his Preſervation. Since therefore he cannot live without Earth to tread upon, Air to breath, Animals and Vegitables to feed upon, Sun and Stars to afford him Warmth and Light, &amp;c.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52719:193"/>
we muſt by conſequence examine the Syſtem and Elements of the World, and particularly as they concur to the Preſervation or Deſtruction of Man. We muſt be very well acquainted with the nature of the three mixt Bodies of our Globe, <hi>viz.</hi> Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, before we can give any tolerable Account of the Generation, Nouriſhment, Health, Diſeaſes, or Death of Man; before we can diſcover the admirable Fabrick and Contexture, the Mechanick and Hydraulical Actions, Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, the various Operations of Medicines, and an infinite number of other ſurprizing <hi>Phoenomena</hi> in the Human Body.</p>
                     <p>The beſt Method therefore, I preſume, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Analytically</hi> from the previous Examination of all the known Parts of the great World, to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Enquiries into the Microcoſm. Now the firſt ſtep to this Method, is a good Inſight by Chymical Experiments into the Nature, more eſpecially the Figuration and Qualities of the Principles of mixt Bodies, and chiefly of the Blood: For the want of ſuch a Diſcovery (which is not impoſſible) has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been a great Obſtruction to the Improvement of Natural Philoſophy, and the Practice of Phyſick. It is plain to me, that a Man void of all Prejudice, and who conſiders that all the Operations of Bodies are perform'd by natural Cauſes without Miracles, may be eaſily convinc'd that the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, and the true uſe of Applications to cure them, can be render'd very intelligible; ſo that vulgar Axiom, <hi>That there's no certainty in Phyſick,</hi> will be found moſt erroneous.</p>
                     <p>I don't, <hi>Sir,</hi> pretend to have diſcover'd this juſt Method, which I hold neceſſary to lead us into the abſtruſe Secrets of Nature; but I would fain hope that the following Scheme, which is that I obſerv'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> may approach it in ſome degree; which Method, tho it may be call'd altogether new, may perhaps be a juſt Model for others to imitate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the true Theory and Practice of Phyſick, which rightly conſider'd are one and the ſame thing.</p>

You ſee, <hi>Sir,</hi> that after having examin'd the different Parts of the World, and the Elements of Bodies by Chymiſtry, I have divided the Human Body into ſolid and fluid Parts. Before I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the ſolid Parts in particular, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by way of Chymiſtry, to be acquainted with all the Humours, and ſpecially with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Motions of the Blood, which is the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of the whole Machine; for which purpoſe it is fit to know how by Digeſtion the Meat becomes Chyle, the Chyle becomes Blood, how the Blood becomes Fleſh and Bone, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how it muſt be continually repaired by Aliment; how the Heart is put in motion to communicate the ſame to the Blood; how the Blood expelled by the Heart, after having been rarefied by the Air in the Lungs, is convey'd by Arterial Tubes to all the Parts of the Body, and from theſe Parts is brought back again by the Veins to the Heart. To know why this Blood is carried to all the Parts, and what Alteration it receives in them, we muſt by ocular Inſpection ſee the different Structure of all the Parts of the Body, and firſt follow the Blood to the Brain, to generate Animal Spirits, which Spirits furniſh the Soul with Ideas in the Brain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd through the Nerves to all the Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they are the Cauſes of Motion in the Muſcles, and of Senſe in the five Organs, which convey the Impreſſion of exteriour Bodies to the Soul. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Blood into the Liver, where it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges its Bilious Juice; and into all other Glands, where it leaves ſome ſuperfluous Humonr, into the Spleen, where its Motion is moderated; into the Reins, where it leaves its ſerous Particles; into the Teſticles, where is ſtrained from it a glutinous oily Subſtance called <hi>Seed.</hi> In ſhort, after knowing Man in himſelf, I examine the natural Ways which he uſes to propagate his Kind, in begetting another by way of Generation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:52719:196"/>
Man, as I ſaid before, is made of two Subſtances, Soul and Body. The Soul preſerves the Body by Reaſon, and governs it by voluntary Motion. The Body furniſhes the Soul with <hi>Ideas</hi> of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Beings. The Life of Man is the Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between Soul and Body; but the Life of the Body is the natural Motion of the Blood and Spl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Ceſſation of which Motion is Death. The ſolid Parts of the Body have no Motion (or Life) of their own, but ſuch as they borrow from the Blood and Spirits. The Blood and Spirits have none neither, but ſuch as they are allowed by the general Laws of Nature eſtabliſh'd by a Supreme Being. To maintain this mutual Correſpondence and Dependance between Soul and Body, all the Organs, Springs and Humours of the body, muſt be in their due Diſpoſition; for the Death of the Body is properly the loſs of this Diſpoſition, and not the Separation of the Soul, as is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd: for the Body is dead before the Soul is gone out of it; and the going out of the Soul is but the Ceſſation of its Correſpondence with the Body for want of Motion in the latter. This Diſpoſition is diſordered or ruined by Diſeaſes, all which Diſeaſes have their firſt Seat in the Blood, from whence they are communicated to the ſolid Parts; and the ſolid Parts being affected, they reciprocally inſect the Blood. But tho the Blood was never infected, and Man never ſick, yet he ſhould die of courſe, by the Relaxation and Attrition of his ſolid Parts, from the long and continual Circulation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours through them, which we call <hi>Old Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what relates to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> or the Account I have given of the Virtue and due Application of inward Medicines in the Practice of Phyſick, I ſhould likewiſe give you a <hi>Series</hi> of the different Subjects I treated of, as I have in my Plan of the <hi>Animal Oeconomy;</hi> but finding it too tedious, and needleſs, I will only mention in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52719:196"/>
that <hi>all inward Diſeaſes have their firſt Seat in the Maſs of Blood,</hi> that they are cauſed by a <hi>Ferment</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> hid in it, which deriv'd its Origin from ſome outward Cauſes: That <hi>there are no Specific Medicines for any part of the Body,</hi> as for the Head, Heart, Liver, Stomach, Spleen, but that they muſt all operate upon the whole Maſs of Blood; that conſequently <hi>outward Applications can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avail much for inward Diſtempers,</hi> that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines muſt be carried in a convenient Vehicle through the Blood to the place where the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lies, and that then they either carry its Cauſe out of the Body by Evacuation, or change the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it within by altering the Maſs of Blood.</p>
                  <p>I may therefore reaſonably divide all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica,</hi> deſcribed by ſo many voluminous Authors, only into two Claſſes of Medicines, <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating</hi> and <hi>Alterating.</hi> I did not ſo much talk of thoſe Remedies that evacuate only from ſome parts of the Body, as <hi>Bleeding, Clyſters, Leeches, Iſſues, Bliſters, Setons, Gargles, Snuſh,</hi> and the like, for they can hardly ever cure any inward Diſeaſe; but of ſuch as evacuate the Morbific Matter from the whole Maſs of Blood by the five general ways, <hi>Stool, Vomit, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Sweat</hi> and <hi>Salivation;</hi> where, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to occult or precarious Qualities, I reduced to the Principles of Chymiſtry and Reaſon, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Operations of <hi>Purgatives, Emetics, Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, Diaphoretics<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Antimony and Mercury, of Venereal and other Diſeaſes,</hi> as likewiſe the Nature and Uſefulneſs of <hi>Baths,</hi> and other <hi>Mineral Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe examin'd and endeavour'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Nature and different Effects of <hi>Alterating Medicaments,</hi> which operate in the Maſs of Blood without any Evacuation, ſuch as <hi>ſweeten the Blood</hi> when ſowr, <hi>that thin it</hi> when groſs and thick, <hi>that haſten its too ſlow Circulation, that ſtop its too rapid Motion,</hi> as in Fevers; <hi>that cool the Blood, that heat it, and raiſe the Spirits,</hi> as Cordials; <hi>that calm the Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Narcotics; that ſtrengthen the Tone of the</hi>

                  <p>It would, <hi>Sir,</hi> be too prolix and needleſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you all that can be ſaid in this nice and weighty Subject, which includes in a manner the whole Machine of the Univerſe, which requires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years fervent Application for any one to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a tolerable Knowledge of, and which coſt me ſome Months Labour to demonſtrate at <hi>Oxford</hi> what ſmall Inſight I was thought to have in it: Yet ſtill I am not unwilling to comply with your Deſires, and to ſpare ſome time from my other Buſineſs here, to communicate what I know of theſe Matters to any Perſons of both Univerſities, or to ſuch other ingenious Gentlemen as have a Curioſity for things of this Nature. And I ſhall take care that all be perform'd in ſuch a decent and creditable manner, as may be for the Benefit and Satisfaction of others, as well as my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reputation.

                  <p>IT is upon all hands acknowledg'd, that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of Men of Learning and Worth is of great benefit towards acquiring not only the Knowledg of Men and Manners, but of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too. But of all the Advantages to be reap'd from their Converſation, that of correcting our Prejudices or Miſtakes, and of ſetting us in the right way is the moſt valuable. I ſhould be too diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, Sir, if I ſhould not concur with the Publick, in juſtly allowing you to be as diſcerning a Judg as you are a true Friend. The World is convinc'd of the firſt by your ſhewing your ſelf ſo great a Maſter as well of the <hi>Laws of Nature and Nations,</hi> as of thoſe of your own Country; and none that have the Honour to know you can be ignorant of your Sincerity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d Zeal, in correcting the Errors and Overſights of your Friends. To whom then ſhould I more allowably communicate my Deſigns? After begging your Pardon therefore for the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of numbring my ſelf with your Friends, I
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52719:198"/>
muſt tell you, that being deſir'd by ſeveral, and willing my ſelf, not to conceal the ſmall Inſight I was thought to have in Anatomy, Chymiſtry, and the other parts of Phyſick; I thought firſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to borrow from ſome Antient or Modern Authors the moſt eaſy and compendious Method, for the benefit of my Auditors. But I was fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of my Expectations; for after having examined the voluminous Works of moſt Writers in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I did not find it altogether fit to follow their Method, nor ſafe to eſpouſe their Opinions. But the beſt courſe, I think, is to pick the beſt out of each, eſpecially what relates to Matters of Fact, applying their Obſervations to my own Deſign, and taking Reaſon and Experience to be my ſureſt Guides. But ſeeing ſeveral Perſons either out of Malice or Raſhneſs, have very induſtriouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented my Undertaking; I ſhall now give a larger Account of it than formerly, as well to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my Friends, as for my own Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign therefore, Sir, is to find a ſhort, eaſy, and clear Method, to be acquainted with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, Functions, Tempers, and Diſeaſes of the Human Body: For which purpoſe I muſt not only know Man in himſelf, but muſt alſo know all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are about him, and concur to his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Deſtruction. For as I cannot underſtand all that belong to my Finger, without I underſtand my whole Body, which ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es to nouriſh and move it; ſo I cannot underſtand my Body without I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole Univerſe: And as I cannot reaſonably know any one Diſtemper of my Body, without I know the general Sources of all Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; ſo I cannot methodically cure any one Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per without I underſtand the Rules of curing all Diſtempers: Which ſhews that Quacks, and other ignorant Pretenders, may not preſume to have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Cures for any one Diſtemper whatſoever. Since therefore it is neceſſary to have a general view of the whole Univerſe to be competently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52719:198"/>
with Man, the firſt thing we muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine is Matter, which is the general Principle of all Bodies, or rather all Bodies are Matter.</p>
                  <p>Matter is the only thing, in my mind, that we have any clear Notion of, if we have of any. We conceive very well that an Atom has at leaſt ſix Sides or Surfaces, of which one is nearer the Eaſt than the Weſt, another nearer the South than the North, and another nearer the Zenith than the Nadir: conſequently between all the ſix Surfaces we conceive a <hi>Space</hi> or <hi>Extenſion,</hi> which we call <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> tho never ſo little; and ſince we conſider a real <hi>Space</hi> between them, we can men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally divide it into ſeveral leſſer Spaces, and each leſſer Space into as many other leſſer ones as we pleaſe; ſo that every minute Particle will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diviſible. Beſides, the diſtance between the ſix Sides of the Atom is ſo filled up and occupied by the Atom or its Extenſion, that it is impenetrable by any other Extenſion whatſoever. By an Atom I mean the minuteſt part in a Body actually divided from others, and ſtill diviſible in it ſelf. Then the Properties of Matter will be Diviſibility and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrability.</p>
                  <p>There is no eſſential Difference between one piece of Matter and another, ſince all Matter is extended, diviſible and impenetrable. But ſince the Machine of the World is form'd of different Bodies, and all Bodies form'd of Matter, we muſt derive their difference at leaſt from the Accidents of Matter: We find then that one part of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be different from another, but in Bulk, Motion or Figure; and according as it differs from others in one or more of theſe Qualities, they will conſtitute different Bodies: By theſe three Qualities of Matter we can give a general account of the different parts of the World, as the <hi>Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Fluid,</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial Bodies.</hi> We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Stars and Planets, the Air, the Earth, and the Water, are made of three different ſorts
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52719:199"/>
of Matter. The <hi>Atoms</hi> of the firſt <hi>Matter</hi> have a leſſer Bulk and more Motion than all the reſt. The <hi>Atoms</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Matter</hi> are probably ſpherical, have as little Bulk as the firſt, and leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The <hi>Atoms</hi> of the third <hi>Matter</hi> are of an irregular Figure, but have greater Bulk, and have none, or a ſlower Motion than all the reſt. We may lawfully ſuppoſe all the <hi>Stars</hi> to be made up of the firſt <hi>Matter:</hi> The <hi>Aetherial Fluid,</hi> or the <hi>Heavens</hi> of the ſecond, and the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Bodies</hi> to be made of the third. For the Parts of the firſt being extream ſubtile, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rapid, muſt be fluid and thin enough to paſs through the Pores and Inteſtices of all other Bodies, and leave no Vacuities; and influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the ſame way as the <hi>Sun</hi> does, by keeping the Air in a perpetual Fluidity, and by producing Fermentations in the Ground in ſuch ſolid Bodies as have no invincible Reſiſtance in their Parts. The Parts of the ſecond Matter being likewiſe ſubtile, round, and conſequently agitated perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by the Subtilty and Rapidity of the firſt Matter which paſs through it, muſt form a <hi>Fluid</hi> and <hi>Tranſparent Extenſion,</hi> as the <hi>Expanſum</hi> or the <hi>Heavens</hi> are. The Parts of the third Element be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more bulky, more irregular, and having no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt an inconſiderable one, muſt form groſs, irregular, ſolid, opaque, and ſenſible Bodies, ſuch as we ſee the Planets and Terreſtrial Bodies to be. The two firſt <hi>Matters</hi> which I made mention of, are exterior <hi>Agents,</hi> which Nature, or God makes uſe of rather to influence a Motion into Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Bodies, than to enter into their Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contrary to <hi>Monſier des Cartes.</hi> So this laſt Element of the World, is that which I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider moſt, being the only thing that our Faculty is concern'd in, becauſe it conſtitutes Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals, which are the three Things that I deſign chiefly to examine, becauſe they furniſh us with Aliments and Remedies, and are the Cauſes of moſt Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:52719:199"/>
Tho we find an innumerable variety of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Bodies, and this variety depending upon the difference of their <hi>Atoms,</hi> yet by tracing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the particular Effects of theſe <hi>Atoms,</hi> and by ſeveral Experiments of Chymiſtry, I can reduce all parts of Bodies to four only, <hi>viz.</hi> Atoms of <hi>Earth,</hi> Atoms of <hi>Water,</hi> Atoms of <hi>Salt,</hi> and Atoms of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> But when, for Example, I am to give Rhubarb, Jeſuits Powder, or any other Remedy to a Patient, to be ſure of its Effects, and due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, it is not enough to know that it is made of <hi>Earth, Water, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but alſo I muſt know what <hi>Earth, Water, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Oil</hi> themſelves are: Beſides, I am to know their Proportion, and which of them predominates in it; which Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians neglecting to diſcover, have left the Practice of Phyſick very obſcure, and will ever continue ſo, until they give themſelves the trouble to examine with more Exactneſs and Nicety the Nature (I mean the Figure) and Effects of the Principles of the Blood, and of all Remedies likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>I know that the Chymiſts will immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they have with a great deal of Toil and Labour, not only ſeparated from mixt Bodies the before mentioned four Principles, but alſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Nature; for they confidently tell us, that the nature of Earth is to be porous, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb Water, Salt and Oil; that the nature of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to diſſolve Salt; of Sulphur to be inflammable; and of Salt to prick, and be diſſolved by Water. But they need not take ſo much pains to tell us of a thing that every body knows without the leaſt inſight in Chymiſtry. A Country-man knows that a Pot full of Aſhes will ſoak a great deal of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any other fluid Body: That Water diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves Sugar and Salt; that Oil burns, and Salt pricks the Tongue. This is not anſwering the Queſtion, for they take the Effects of thoſe Elements for their Nature. To ſay that Earth abſorbs, that Water diſſolves Salt, that Oil takes flame, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52719:200"/>
that Salt bites, is to tell me only what theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are capable of doing, not what they really are in themſelves. If being asked by a Perſon, <hi>What is Man?</hi> I ſhould anſwer, that he is <hi>a reaſonable Animal,</hi> or an <hi>Animal capable of Reaſon;</hi> he ſhould not doubtleſs be ſatisfied with my Anſwer, becauſe I tell him what Man can do, not what he is, ſince he exiſts before he can reaſon. I deſire to know what is the particular Figure, the Specifick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and the inward Nature of <hi>Earth,</hi> that makes it produce an Effect different to that of <hi>Water;</hi> and of <hi>Salt,</hi> to produce a different Effect to that of <hi>Oil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Until therefore we are more intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the different Bulk, Texture, and Figure, which are the ground of the Virmes and Qualities of all theſe Elements, we can give no ſatisfactory Account of their Effects; and we muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uncertain as to the Operation of a Remedy, which has any of 'em predominating in it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it will be a difficult matter to determine the different bulk and figure of the Atoms of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>à priori,</hi> as they term it; for they are ſo ſmall and imperceptible, that we cannot diſcern any of 'em even with the moſt refin'd Microſcopes: Yet I do not deſpair, but by calculating and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up all the Effects and Proprieties of each of 'em by Reaſon, I may diſcover at leaſt <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> as they call it, their different Bulk and Figure, which are the only primary Qualities they differ in. For it is plain to me, that when I conſider that a drop of <hi>Water is inſipid, tranſparent, eaſily evaporated, that it penetrates moſt Bodies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves all Salts;</hi> I can reaſonably determine the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Bulk of its Particles that are ſutable to theſe <hi>Phenomena.</hi> I can ſay as much of a ſpoonful of <hi>Earth,</hi> when I obſerve that <hi>it is ſpongy, ſolid, poroud, friable, opaque, inſipid;</hi> that <hi>it ſinks in Water;</hi> that <hi>it cannot be raiſed by Fire in Diſtillation;</hi> that <hi>it is the Matrix and Support of the reſt of the Principles of any mixt Body.</hi> Likewiſe of <hi>Oil</hi> or
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52719:200"/>
                     <hi>Sulphur,</hi> when I find <hi>it is fluid, inſipid, ropy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable, extreamly penetrating, and immiſcible with Water;</hi> I can gueſs the Nature or Texture of Parts, which is capable of ſuch Effects. When I ſee that an <hi>Acid Salt is always of its own nature, fluid, ſharp, tranſparent, penetrating; that it diſſolves ſolid Bodies, and coagulates ſulphureous ones,</hi> as Blood, Milk, &amp;c. When I conſider that <hi>an Alkali Salt is always of its own nature ſolid, white, porous, friable, ſharp, diſſolvable by Water, eaſily movable;</hi> that <hi>it fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Acids, abſorbs them, and diſſolves ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Bodies;</hi> I can reaſonably conjecture the Figure that renders both Salts capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch different, nay contrary Effects; which I endeavour to perform in the Chymical and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Experiments, which I make at preſent in my Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Library, which his Grace, out of his wonted Inclination to ſerve the Publick, has been pleaſed to give me the uſe of for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>After having examin'd the nature of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Atoms of <hi>Matter,</hi> I trace their Effects and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, all which I find are perform'd by <hi>Motion,</hi> which is the only <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all things, and which has no other <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf (that I know) but the pure <hi>Will</hi> of the Deity. For a Body cannot be moved without it receives all its Motion from another Body that is in motion; which Motion this ſecond Body receiv'd from a third, that was put in motion by a fourth, and this fourth by a fifth. So tracing backward to the Creation the ſucceſſive <hi>Tranſit</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> from one Body to another, we muſt come to a firſt Motion of Bodies, which flowed immediately from the Creator. A Body cannot loſe its Motion without communicating it all to another Body; conſequently there muſt be the ſame quantity of Motion now in the World as was in the beginning. For no Motion can be loſt, and no new Motion can be produced. By examining the Laws and Occaſions of <hi>Motion,</hi> I
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52719:201"/>
conſider the Nature, Conditions, and Effects of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> which is the chiefeſt and moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Motion in Nature; by the means of which are formed ſo many different Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals of the different Proportion, different Situation, and different Application of our four Elements, <hi>Earth, Water, Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur.</hi> But my chief Deſign is to ſhew how the different Parts of Man's Body, which is the principal Subject of this <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> are made of them: For out of his <hi>Bones,</hi> his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> his <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and even his <hi>Blood</hi> and other <hi>Humours,</hi> I draw in more or leſs quantity, firſt <hi>Water,</hi> then <hi>Volatil Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> afterwards an inflammable <hi>Oil;</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the <hi>Earth,</hi> out of which I draw by <hi>Water</hi> a <hi>fixt Salt.</hi> I do not only examine the Nature and Proportion of the four eſſential Principles of our Body, but alſo, what is more neceſſary, I deſign by Anatomy to demonſtrate to the Eye the Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Texture, and Uſe of its ſolid, ſenſible and integrant Parts, as <hi>Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Muſcles, Membranes, Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Lymphatic Veſſels,</hi> and <hi>Glands;</hi> all which I find to be formed of vaſcular Fibres of the ſame kind: for I do not ſee that the Fibres of a <hi>Muſcle</hi> differ from them of a <hi>Tendon,</hi> nor the Fibres of a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> from them of a <hi>Ligament,</hi> nor them of a Cartilage from the Fibres of a Bone, nor the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of any part, as for their Structure, from the Fibres of all the parts. I confeſs the Fibres of ſome parts of the Body are more ſtrictly united together than others, which makes the Compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Parts, and the Limberneſs of others; ſo all parts differ from one another, only in a ſtricter or looſer Union of their Fibres; ſince we find by Experience, that Fleſh becomes as hard as Bone, and Bone as ſoft as Fleſh: For we frequently diſcover in diſſecting dead Bodies, that the Center of the Heart, which is naturally fleſhy, that the <hi>Aorta</hi> near the Heart, that <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and <hi>Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:52719:201"/>
turn to ſolid Bone; we obſerve likewiſe that Bones in the Rickets, and by Monſieur <hi>Papin</hi>'s way of boiling them, become as pliable as the Fleſh of Muſcles.</p>
                  <p>Before I ſhew the Parts of the Body, I ſhall firſt examine the Humours, and chiefly the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Texture, Fluidity, Circulation, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Blood, the Seat of the different Conſtitutions and Diſtempers of Mankind. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I ſhall conſider how the Blood is repaired by Digeſtion and Chyle; how it is rarefied by the Air in the Lungs, how it furniſheth Animal Spirits in the Brain for motion in the Muſcles, and Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the five Organs: What Alteration it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in the Liver, in all Lymphatick Glands, in the Spleen, Kidnies, and in the Parts of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how it nouriſheth ſo many different Parts of the Body at the ſame time, as the ſame Water ſeeds ſeveral thouſands of different Plants in the ſame Garden; and how after ſome Periods of Years the Springs of the ſolid Parts muſt be worn out, the Vigor of the Body decay, old Age muſt come on, and be neceſſarily followed by Death; where I muſt examine the Laws of the Union, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and Separation of the Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>You have here, Sir, a ſhort Extract of my Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Oeconomy, by which you may perceive that my Deſign in it, is, by diſſecting many Animals, (as they ſhall beſt ſerve my purpoſe) and by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Experiments of Chymiſtry, to diſcover and explain the <hi>Fabrick, Springs, Humours, and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Organical Bodies,</hi> but chiefly of the <hi>Human,</hi> which, I hope, will conſiderably facilitate the Practice of Phyſick, and ſatisfy the Enquiries of the Curious. But thoſe Gentlemen do me an Injury, who give it out that this is a bare Courſe of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy. Truly that were a mean and uſeleſs Buſineſs: for, as I have often hinted, I am of opinion that Anatomy can never be well underſtood without not only Chymiſtry, but a tolerable Inſight into the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52719:202"/>
other parts of Natural Philoſophy; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I comprehend them all together, to ſhew their mutual dependance, and how they contribute to the knowledg of one another, which is perhaps a Method not commonly followed. Tho ſeveral may be more capable of it, yet none can be more willing to communicate it to the Publick than I am.</p>
                  <p>As for what other Perſons have taught or aſſerted in I hyſick, I am not to conſider their Authority, or the number of their Followers, but how well they have performed what they pretended to. Without this liberty, there would be no hopes of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any further progreſs in Phyſick, nor no other Labour be neceſſary to attain it, but much Reading and a happy Memory. It would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for us to be at the Pains and Expences of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling into foreign and remote Countries, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with learned and experienc'd Perſons, to learn their different Methods and Maxims of curing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, to obſerve a great variety of Diſtempers and Symptoms in infectious Hoſpitals, to open ſo many dead Carcaſes, and to try a great number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, if the Dictates of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> or any other Author, were infallible Rules for us to follow in the Practice of Phyſick. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Experience and Reaſon are our only Guides, no Body is to take it amiſs if I cenſure ſuch as wrote before me, with as much Juſtice as they did their Predeceſſors; for I'm ſworn to no Maſter.</p>
                  <p>You know, Sir, that the Place and Time are moſt convenient, and I hope you may give us often the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Company, and according to your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Candor, both do me Juſtice to your curious Friends, and, where I ſpeak amiſs, convince me of it, in which you will oblige,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Should be proud to meet with ſome occaſion to give you a Teſtimony of my Reſpect and Gratitude, and to ſhew you how ſenſible I am of the Happineſs of having been educated in my Youth by ſo learned a Maſter: I am ſorry the diſtance between us, and the difficulty of Carriage gives me no opportunity of ſending you the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you heard of concerning <hi>the Suſpenſions of the Laws of Nature.</hi> I can only at preſent promiſe to give you a general Idea of my Deſign in that Book, and of the occaſion that put me upon examining theſe Matters. I have been preſent often at ſome Diſputes about ſupernatural Effects, in which ſome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that there could have never been any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: and laſt Year I happen'd to be accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingag'd againſt the Objections of ſome Perſons, who pretended they could not conceive either the poſſibility, or the manner of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:52719:203"/>
Theſe Objections I looked upon as weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſeeming to imply, That either a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being cou'd do nothing but what their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties were capable to comprehend; or, that there was a neceſſity, that, to convince Unbelievers, to confirm ſome important Truth, or to bring about ſome other great or weighty End, it were requiſite that the Deity ſhould not only work an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ſurprizing Effect, but alſo ſhew them the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> how it was perform'd. We freely own'd, That ſuch Operations as are look'd upon ſupernatural, cannot be perform'd by the ſtated Laws of Nature, but immediately by a Supream Power, for ſome great Deſign.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer, as being undeniably true, they could not but admit: and tho where the Relaters were of an undoubted Credit and Veracity, they could not but believe thoſe Performances were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural; yet, for their clearer Satisfaction, they deſir'd my further Thoughts concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of ſuch Supernatural Effects.</p>
                  <p>This being above my Sphere, which reaches no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or Nature in its ordinary Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein, however, I find Matter more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to imploy my Time and Thoughts, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I plainly ſee the Exiſtence, and can never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire the conſtant Providence of a Deity; yet being willing to comply with their Deſires, I promiſed I would give them what Satisfaction I could therein.</p>
                  <p>This, indeed, was not the firſt time the very ſame Difficulties had been propoſed in my hearing; for I had formerly diſcourſed with others, both in this and other Countries, upon the ſame Subject, and had ſome Years ago drawn up a rude Scheme of an Eſſay towards the clearing of this Point. But if this, or the like occaſion, had not put me upon reviewing this Paper, I might never have given my ſelf, or any body elſe, the trouble of reading it. But having thus unwarily engag'd my ſelf, I reſolved
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52719:203"/>
to reviſe this Deſign, and to give thoſe Perſons a ſight of it: This I did accordingly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhew'd it to ſome Friends.</p>
                  <p>They owned the Notions I advanced, and the ways of Explication I propoſed were new to them, and might be ſo to others; and tho they were not, nor could be convinc'd that theſe were the very ways the Supream Power proceeded in the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Operations, yet they ſeemed inclinable to imagine, that upon theſe Principles ſupernatural Effects, and the Operations of them, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable by ſuch as know any thing of the Nature and Laws of Motion.</p>
                  <p>This Communication of my Thoughts gave oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to others to diſcourſe with me about them, and to deſire that if I did intend to publiſh them, I would in the mean time give them, at leaſt, the general Heads of my Deſign.</p>
                  <p>This I was willing to have been excuſed in, as having not digeſted them into that Order I might at laſt publiſh them in, and was willing to reſerve to my ſelf a Power of making what Additions or Retrenchments I ſhould afterwards think fit to make; but the Plan of the Eſſay happening not to be fully repreſented, and afterwards being worſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and commented upon, I at laſt reſolv'd to publiſh it as ſoon as I could, ſeeing Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly reported things I never thought of.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign therefore, Sir, is to endeavour to make it no longer a Difficulty to conceive, and make evident by Reaſon, and the Principles of Phyſick, I mean the Principles of Nature, all the ſupernatural Effects authentically delivered to us concerning Bodies chiefly, but particularly the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: I mean, ſuppoſing thoſe Effects to be true Matters of Fact, and all Matters of Fact, as well Natural as Supernatural, to be immediate Effects of a Supream Being, which muſt be granted; it is as eaſy to conceive the manner how this Infinite Power may be apply'd to Bodies, to work ſupernatural
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52719:204"/>
Effects, as to produce the common <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature. By this I hope to convince our <hi>Scepticks,</hi> the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who muſt give their Aſſent, when they have the ſame evident Reaſon to conceive the Poſſibility, and conſequently to believe the Truth of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Effects, that are authentically related, as they have to conceive that Straw can burn in a flaming Fire.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation I go upon, is the Structure of the Human Body, which I have often taken to pieces by Anatomy, and reſolv'd into its eſſential Elements, or minute Particles by Chymiſtry: for I find it as neceſſary to be acquainted with its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, to give an Account of the miraculous States it is ſuppoſed to have been in ſupernaturally, as it is to explain the natural Effects commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in it. For want of a ſufficient Inſight in this matter, ſeveral Divines of the latter Ages have given very groſs Ideas of the ſupernatural Effects they have pretended to explain; and in ſeveral places where I have been, I ſaw them, either through Ignorance, or for Intereſt, give out for Miracles, <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that were only ſurprizing Effects of Natural Cauſes, which has given ſo great an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> and increaſe of <hi>Deiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having laid down for my Baſis the Structure of the Human Body, as far as I could diſcover from my Senſes, Anatomy, Fire, Microſcopes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I proceed to examine, and endeavour to explain the different ways its natural State is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have been ſupernaturally alter'd by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power: For, finding that the Human Body is all Matter, and that all this Matter is nothing but a Union of Particles with Bulk, Figure, and reſpective Situation, I thought that all the Alterations that could ſupernaturally happen to this Bulk, Figure, or situation, could be conceiv'd. But before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon thoſe nice Subjects, I find it firſt neceſſary to enquire into the <hi>Cauſe, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe Motion is the only true Cauſe of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52719:204"/>
                     <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> and the Suſpenſions of the Laws of this Motion, are the only Cauſes of all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Effects. I conceive the Laws of Motion can be ſuſpended three different ways; and by one or more of thoſe Laws of <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> it is as eaſy to ſolve clearly all ſupernatural Effects, as it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the moſt evident Effects of Natural Cauſes by the common Laws of Motion.</p>
                  <p>Tho I mention, that all ſupernatural Effects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can be eaſily reduc'd to ſome of the three Laws of Suſpenſion of Motion, notwithſtanding I do not deſign to ſpeak of them all in particular, but of ſuch only as are moſt in diſpute among the Learned: Yet any underſtanding Man may eaſily make his Application, and reſolve all other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Effects into one or other of 'em.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Suſpenſion of the Laws of Motion,</hi> I do not mean that theſe Laws are changed or abrogated, but only that their Courſe is ſtopt, while an Effect is produc'd by the immediate Action of the Deity, without any Influence of theirs, for ſome particular end: and it cannot be denied but that the Supream Legiſlator, who made firſt the Laws, may ſuſpend them when he pleaſes; and in that ſtate of Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion produce of himſelf alone, without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, the ſame Effects, which are wont to be produced only by the ſame Laws put in Execution. So that tho a Body, for Example, of a hundred Pound Weight, by the eſtabliſhed Laws of Motion muſt be moved by another that has ſeveral degrees of Motion, yet an Infinite Power may of himſelf, either move it without the Concurrence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body, or hinder its being moved by any other Body of what weight ſoever, tho put into the moſt rapid Motion; as if combuſtible Matter ſhould be in a flaming Fire without burning.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe my Deſign in that Book is to explain all the ſupernatural States that our Body is ſuppoſed to have been put into; and ſince its being in two places at once, is the State the moſt diſputed and doubted
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52719:205"/>
of, I thought it convenient to examine the Reaſons of thoſe that aſſert it capable of being in ſeveral places at once, to ſee whether they are reconcileable with our Senſes, and with the Nature and Structure of a Human Body, which is the chief thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd. I find it impoſtible to conceive that a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body can be in two places at the ſame time, after the manner they have hitherto deſcrib'd, ſince <hi>the ſame Human Body can never be in two places at once, with the ſame Bulk, and with the ſame quantity of Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that conſidering the Diviſibility of Matter, the Structure of the Human Body, the ſmalneſs of the firſt <hi>Stamina</hi> of the <hi>Embryo</hi> and <hi>Foetus,</hi> and the Principles and Mechaniſm of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have thought of one particular way, different from all that has ever been ſaid upon this Subject, by which I may conceive, that tho the ſelf-ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Particles of <hi>Matter</hi> can never be in two places at once, yet a Human Body, tho not the rational Soul, can be multiplied by an Infinite Power: But ſince we have no evident Proof, or Experience, that any Human Body has ever been thus multiplied; and becauſe from conceiving the poſlibility of it, it is thought People may perhaps hereafter take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to draw ſeveral Conſequences that may be liable to dangerous Conſtructions, and lead into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Speculations, I was adviſed, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to decline treating of this Subject, having no mind to meddle with <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> being not my Province. Wherefore I have endeavour'd only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> explain thoſe ſupernatural Effects that moſt People agree upon, ſubmitting my Judgment to greater Capacities: For I had no other Deſign in that Book, but to enquire how far we may look into, and confirm <hi>Supernatural Effects,</hi> thoſe chiefly that r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>te to Organical Bodies, by the Principles of <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, the Learned and Judicious Gentlemen of your Gown can have no reaſon to complain that I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52719:205"/>
have invaded their Province, or encroached upon their Prerogatives: For I do not undertake to prove that there were ever any ſupernatural Effects produced, that matter I think belongs entirely to Divines to make evident from authentick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; I only endeavour to demonſtrate the Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of them, and if there were ever any, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> with which we may conceive how they might have been perform'd: This is not doing any Prejudice to your Profeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I have that Reſpect to the Church, and that Deference to the Clergy, that I did nothing in this matter without the Advice and Approbation of thoſe of them that are in the higheſt Station: And they own'd, that tho this Subject had never been yet handled by any Phyſician, nor indeed by any Divine that I know of, yet it was only a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's buſineſs to treat of, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Natural Philoſophy and Phyſick. For ſince it is on all ſides acknowledged, that miraculous Effects are above Natural Cauſes, no People can better judg whether any Effect is really ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than thoſe that make it their Buſineſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to know how far the Activity of Natural Cauſes can reach. For Phyſicians may find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that what the wilful Miſtakes of ſome, and the Ignorance of others take for ſupernatural, is the viſible Effect of a Natural Cauſe, as I obſerv'd once at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome Years ſince: paſſing by chance through the <hi>Strada del Popolo,</hi> I ſaw a multitude of People hurrying a Man to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Chappel, which belongs to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadors; they told me that he was poſſeſs'd with the Devil, and that they, were carrying him to be exorcis'd: I crowded thro the Throng into the Church, and felt the Man's Pulſe; I found him in a Fever, making hideous Grimaces and Motions with his Face, Eyes, Tongue, and all his Limbs, which were nothing elſe but a fit of Convulſive Motions all over his Body, occaſion'd by diſorder of his Blood and Spirits, being a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52719:206"/>
Perſon. The Clergy and People began very devoutly to fright the pretended Devil out of him, and in a little time his diſorderly Motions ceaſed, which, as they thought to be the miraculous Effect of their Prayers, I attributed to the natural abatement and uſual ceſſation of ſuch Fits.</p>
                  <p>Every underſtanding Naturaliſt knows that an able Chymiſt can work ſuch ſurprizing Effects in his Art as may very eaſily paſs for Miracles with ſuch as are unacquainted how far the force of Natural Cauſes can extend. It would ſeem to 'em very aſtoniſhing to ſee two Liquors, that are cold of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ferment, boil, and become very hot, without any viſible Cauſe to put them in motion: To ſee <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> diſſolve Maſſy Gold, <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> diſſolve Silver, Iron, Mercury, and moſt other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; to ſee the <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> and the <hi>Oil of Cloves,</hi> which ſeparately are very quiet, turn into a burning Flame when mixed together; to ſee tranſparent Liquors when mixed, turn red, green, white, and into all ſorts of Colours. I ſay nothing of the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> of the ſurprizing Effects of the, <hi>Air Pump,</hi> of the <hi>Elaſticity of the Air,</hi> of the Magnet, nor of an infinite number of other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature: which tho they may be common, yet they are not the leſs ſurprizing, becauſe their Cauſe is as hid from thoſe that do not, and even to thoſe that do ſtudy Nature, as that of ſupernatural Effects is to thoſe Naturaliſts who trace Natural Cauſes to their higheſt Sphere of Activity. I do not doubt but that if the <hi>Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that are ſent from the Weſtern Churches to convert the Pagans of the Eaſtern Nations, were as well vers'd in <hi>Anatomy</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> as they are in the Tenets of the Chriſtian Religion, and in the Mathematicks; and that if they did but dazel the Eyes of theſe ignorant People with a great many curious and uſeful Experiments in theſe two funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Branches of Phyſick, they would perhaps make as deep Impreſſions upon their Minds, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52719:206"/>
give them as convincing Teſtimonies of the Power and Legality of their Miſſion, as they can at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by the ſpiritual or indelible Character, they ſay is inherent in them by virtue of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Tenth knew well the Effects Chymiſtry artfully applied might produce in the minds of ignorant People, when he ſecured the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the famous Italian <hi>Signor Borri,</hi> who about five and thirty Years ago by his Skill in Chymiſtry did work ſeveral extraordinary Cures on Diſeaſes in <hi>Germany,</hi> and gain'd ſuch univerſal Reputation all over the Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, that (as it was reported of him) he thought he had Credit and Opportunity ſufficient to invent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate a new Religion, by making his ſurprizing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in Chymiſtry paſs for Miracles; which he might eaſily have done, ſince Chymiſtry being then in its Minority, was not much known in the World. But the Pope foreſeeing the ill Conſequence ſuch a Deſign might produce, gave timely Orders to his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to deſire the preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to get him ſeiz'd; which being accordingly done, he was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> on condition nevertheleſs that his Life ſhould be ſafe, here he lived in <hi>Caſtello St. Angelo</hi> for ſeveral Years, where I ſaw him, and his curious Laboratory for Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry allowed him for his Diverſion; no body was admitted to diſcourſe him without ſpecial leave, for fear, I ſuppoſe, he ſhould inform the World either of his pretended new Doctrine, or of the Injuſtice he might intimate that was done to him. He died lately in this cloſe Confinement ſince I have been at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you as ſuccinct and comprehenſive an Account of my Deſign in that Book as I could well expreſs in ſo few Lines, by which you will believe perhaps that I have done nothing in treating of thoſe Matters, but what
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52719:207"/>
belongs peculiarly to one of my Profeſſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amine; and tho I do not pretend to have explain'd this nice Subject with that Satisfaction the Publick might perhaps expect, yet I hope that having been the firſt Perſon that has ever handled it after this manner, no body will blame me for having at leaſt given occaſion to others to examine it better after me, and to give a more ſatisfactory Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it. I conceive the Subject I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to treat of in that Book is nice as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, wherein the Principles of Phyſick, the Experiments of Chymiſtry, and the Anatomy of the Humane Body are philoſophically made uſe of as a Foundation to illuſtrate the Metaphyſical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have given of theſe Supernatural Effects, which perhaps makes it not ſo much univerſally underſtood as I deſign'd; however I am reſolv'd not to meddle any more with Matters of this kind, but to apply my ſelf entirely to the Practice of Phyſick. I am,</p>
