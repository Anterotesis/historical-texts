            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none conſidering, that the Righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the ninth Verſe of the former Chapter the Holy Prophet threatneth a fearful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was like to fall on the <hi>Jews,</hi> he calls for the wild Beaſts of the Field and the Foreſt to come and devour, meaning the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93823:3"/>
which ſhould be Executioners of the Lord's Judgments; and becauſe the Lord is Righteous in all his Ways, and Holy in all his Works, he ſhews what Cauſes would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to inflict ſuch a heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his People, as to give them up to be devoured by the Beaſts of the Field and the Foreſt, ſuch ſavage Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Cauſe is ſet down at large in the reſt of the Verſe to the end of the Chapter: Even the Blindneſs, Idleneſs, Covetouſneſs, and Security of their Watchmen, who ſhould have taught the Fear of the Lord; the neglect of their Duty being a ſpecial Occaſion of the Peoples Sin, is alledged as the Firſt Cauſe of God's Judgments threatned.</p>
            <p>The Second Cauſe was in the Common People, ſet down in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter: Even their careleſs neglect, in not regarding nor conſidering the Death of the Righteous, when many of them were taken away to warn them of ſome ſtrange Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come; yet they laid it not to Heart nor conſidered, but continued and proceeded in their Sins, drinking, and filling themſelves with Wine and ſtrong Drink, and Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promiſing themſelves happy Days, as it is the manner of the Wicked to be moſt

ſecure when Judgment is neareſt unto them, as we have Example in <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5. he was among his Concubines and his Cups, when the Hand wrote his Doom over againſt the Candleſtick, <hi>Mene mene tekel upharſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The Righteous periſheth.</q>
            <p>Theſe are the Words of the Holy and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet, lamenting the Spiritual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> chiding and reproving them for their great Stupidity and Spiritual Lethargy.</p>
            <p>Wherein we have, Firſt, The Perſons that dyed, who are deſcribed by two excellent Properties: 1. Righteous before God; 2. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful towards Men. Secondly, The Manner of their Death, ſet forth by two Terms; <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, are taken away.</hi> The Sin of careleſs People, by two Phraſes; <hi>not laying to heart, nor conſidering the death of the Righteous.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the final Cauſe or ſpecial End for which they dye and are taken away, and that is, to prevent future Evils.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Perſons, here are two great Problems to be reſolved, hard Queſtions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93823:4"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> I. How can any Man be Righteous? The Scripture ſaith, <hi>There is none Righteous, no not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. How do the Righteous periſh? <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the Righteous, the way of the Ungodly ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. There is a Legal Righteouſneſs, ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was righteous in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, being created after God's Image: This Righteouſneſs is forfeited and loſt, ſo by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all are corrupt and unrighteous: <hi>There is none Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. There is an Evangelical Righteouſneſs, and this is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Righteouſneſs of Imputation, when the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to the Believer, and received of him by Faith: <hi>Chriſt is made of God to be unto us Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>Jehova tſidkenu,</hi> Jer. 23.6. <hi>He was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>ult.</hi> As Chriſt was made Sin for us, not by the infuſion of Sin into his Perſon, but by imputation of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93823:4"/>
Sins unto him: So we are made righteous before God, not by any Righteouſneſs inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us, but by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Believers are righteous by Sanctification, when by the Spirit of Chriſt the Mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, the Heart is mollified, the Will is rectified, the Affections ſanctified, and the whole courſe of their Life is reformed, the habits of Grace planted in them, they are partakers of the Divine Nature; ſo that as before they liked, loved, and lived in Sin, now they abhor and avoid Sin and all the occaſions of it: <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. This doth not make us perfectly Righteous, but imperfectly; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but before Men. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that are Righteous thus by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification, are alſo merciful, paſſively and actively: Paſſively, that is, firſt in nature and order, ſuch as Gad received into Mercy and Favour; hence they are called Veſſels of Mercy prepared unto Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. they are truly Righteous before God, whom he hath received into Mercy in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their Sins. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. Actively, for ſuch as ſhew mercy unto others; theſe two are always found together in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93823:5"/>
as our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall receive mercy.</hi> They have obtained pardoning Mercy, and ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain crowning mercy: He which receiveth mercy of the Lord will ſhew mercy unto Men.</p>
            <p>Queſt. II. <hi>How doth the Righteous periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not in Soul, for that is immortal, and cannot periſh by any means, but doth live out of the Body as well, or more truly than in the Body: This <hi>Solomon</hi> taught, <hi>Eccleſiast.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The ſpirit returns to God that gave it</hi>; this St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth, <hi>To be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt:</hi> Phil. 1.23. and <hi>Lazarus</hi> enjoyed at his Death, being carried by the Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom: <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and this <hi>John</hi> ſaw in a Viſion, <hi>Revelat.</hi> 6.9. performed to the Saints, he ſaw the Souls under the Altar. Neither doth he periſh in Body, for the Body of a Righteous Man hath ſtill a Being in the ſight of God, and remains a Member of Chriſt's Myſtical Body: This Union betwixt Chriſt and the Faithful is not of Souls only, but alſo of Bodies; the Bodies of Saints do not finally and totally periſh, their Duſt in the Grave is precious in God's ſight, they only ſleep in Jeſus, and by the power of Jeſus ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93823:5"/>
be raiſed again glorious Bodies. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing periſheth of a Righteous Man in Death finally and totally, but Sin. They pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in appearance, according to the Opinion of the World and the Judgment of Fleſh and Blood. The proper meaning of this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, They dye, depart hence, and are no more ſeen, their place knoweth them no more; or, as the other Word is added exegetically, they are taken away or gathered to God and his Chriſt, to Angels and Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> The Righteous and Godly Man muſt dye as well as others, but the Death of the Righteous is not hurtful but beneficial, no loſs, but great gain and advantage.</p>
            <p>Of this Leſſon we ſee two Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Righteous Man who is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically Righteous, as being juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his Spirit, muſt dye, and go down into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Death and Darkneſs, and the Houſe of Rottenneſs, as well as others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Death of the Righteous is not hurtful, but beneficial; no loſs, but gain.</p>
            <p>Of the Firſt; <hi>Death is the way of all the world</hi> Joſh. 23.14. <hi>The way of all the earth,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93823:6"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> 1 King. 2.2. It is the end of all Men, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.2. and the Righteous muſt walk and paſs this way, and come to this end before they come to their everlaſting Home, as well as others: <hi>The wiſe man dyeth as well as the fool,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.16. yea in this reſpect the condition of the Children of Men and the condition of Beaſts are alike, <hi>As the one dyeth, ſo dieth the other.</hi> Eccleſ. 3.19. No marvel if the condition of all Men be alike, High and Low, Rich and Poor, Wiſe and Unwiſe, Learned and Ignorant, Righteous Unrighteous, Godly and Prophane, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mors impudens,</hi> it fears no colours, ſpares neither great nor good: <hi>Abel</hi> dyed, whoſe Perſon and Sacrifice God accepted, as well as <hi>Cain</hi> whoſe Perſon and Sacrifice God rejected. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all the Faithful, and the Friend of God, <hi>Iſaac, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Joſeph,</hi> all the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Evangeliſts, and Holy Men of God paid this Tribute, and all muſt pay: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Statutum est,</hi> there is the neceſſity; <hi>Omnibus,</hi> there is the Univerſality of dying; there is a Statute Law for both, Enacted in the Court of Heaven, which no Mortal can Repeal. As ſure as we are born to live, ſo ſure are we born to dye; <hi>Naſci &amp; denaſci ordo rerum est.</hi> I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93823:6"/>
need not travel far for many more Examples or Proofs of this, only turn your Eyes to that doleful Object and ſad Spectacle of Mortality under that black Vail, then conclude of this neceſſity: For if Art, and Learned Skill and Induſtry of Phyſick could have continued him, if Strength of Body could have preſerved him, if Wiſdom and rare Gifts of Mind, if Temperance in Diet, if Chaſtneſs of Life, if a concurrence of all excellent Virtues, if Piety and the Power of Godlineſs, the Life of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, if the Wiſhes of Men, yea of a whole Nation, if the Prayers and Tears of the Godly, if any thing could have prevailed for him to give him any Priviledge againſt Deaths Arreſt; blackneſs and darkneſs had not at this time covered that Earthly Tabernacle wherein lately lodged ſo Heavenly a Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why ſhould this be ſo, hath not Chriſt died for the Righteous, why then ſhould they dye? Death is the Wages of Sin, hath not Chriſt ſuffered for all their Sins, wherefore ſhould they dye?</p>

            <p>This Death Chriſt by his Death hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and freed the Righteous from; but not from the firſt Death, which is the ſeparation of Soul and Body: He hath only changed the nature and uſe of the firſt Death, he hath taken away the ſting and venom of it , all the evil and hurt of it: Of a Puniſhment for Sin, he hath made it a Paſſage into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; of a Curſe, he hath turned it into a Bleſſing; it did at firſt deprive Men of good, but now it putteth the Righteous into the poſſeſſion of all good. The Righteous muſt dye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ratio</hi> 1. To accompliſh the Decree, and to prove the truth of God, who ſaid, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof,</hi> morte morieris, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> Gen. 2.17. As they who are adjudged and condemned to dye are dead in Law, albeit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93823:7"/>
they be kept in Priſon, and not preſently Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; ſo our firſt Parents, though they did not immediately dye, were ſubject to Death by the deſert of Sin, and ſo in them all their Poſterity. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>
            <p>Now that the Decree of God might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and his Truth kept inviolate and ſtand with his Mercy, Man, yea the Righteous Man muſt dye the firſt Death.</p>
            <p>If Man ſhould dye no manner of Death, how could the Truth of God appear? and if that Death due to Sin had been inflicted on Man, how ſhould the Mercy of God have been manifeſted?</p>
            <p>This Controverſie God in his wonderful Wiſdom hath reconciled thus, <hi>Piat mors bona, &amp; habet utraque quod petit</hi>; in changing the curſed nature of Death, and making that Temporal which was Eternal, doth his Mercy appear; and in the diſſolution of Man's Body into Duſt for a time, doth his Truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Branch</hi> 2. The Death of the Righteous is not hurtful but beneficial, no loſs, but great gain and advantage.</p>
            <p>This will appear, 1. By the Phraſes which the Holy Ghoſt uſeth to deſcribe the Death of the Righteous: <hi>It is a ſleeping in Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon. 4. <hi>A reſting in hope,</hi> Pſalm 16. <hi>A putting off an earthly tabernacle,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.14. A falling of a corn of Wheat into the ground, that it may ſpring up more glorious; a ſowing in God's Acre. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.24.</p>
            <p>It is a gathering of them to their Fathers:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of their Bodies from a place of care and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93823:9"/>
labour, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Of their Souls, from the Body to God, to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; from an Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and Houſe of Clay, to an Houſe not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens: from Men to Angels; from Sinners to Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous; from Enemies to their beſt Friends; from the Vale of the ſhadow of Death to the Land of the Living; from the Church Militant to the Church Triumphant; from Earth to Heaven, whither they are gathered, as the Apoſtle teacheth at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> the City of the Living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; to an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of Angels, to God the Judge of all, and the Spirits of juſt Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will yet evidently appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Evils from which the Righteous are freed by Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Good which comes unto them in Death, the Bleſſed Eſtate they ſhall then enter into, and ſo continue to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, they ſhall be freed, 1. From
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93823:9"/>
all Evils, corporal and temporal, Sickneſſes Diſeaſes, Aches, Pains, Griefs, Toyl, Labour Croſſes and Loſſes, Troubles and Perſecutions which God's Children, as long as they live here are ſubject unto. The Diſciple of Chriſt muſt take up his Croſs; <hi>Through much tribulation we must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.22.</p>
            <p>We muſt look for Afflictions ſo long as Life laſteth, but Death makes an end of them all: Life and Trouble are Twins which were born together: <hi>Job</hi> 5.7. <hi>Man is born unto trouble, as the ſparks fly upward</hi>; and muſt dye together, as <hi>John</hi> heard it by a Voice from Heaven , <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 14. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord for they reſt from their labours:</hi> All labour in their Actions, and dolour in their Paſſions are ended; then <hi>ſhall God wipe away all tears from their eyes. Revelat.</hi> 21.4.</p>
            <p>Again, they are often taken away to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome extraordinary Evils to come, as in the Text: So <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. was put in his Grave in peace, that he might not ſee the evil that God did bring upon his Land: So <hi>Luther</hi> was taken away not long before that miſerable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity which the Lord brought upon <hi>Germany,</hi> for their contempt of the Goſpel. <hi>Augustine</hi> died before the taking of <hi>Hippo; Paraeus</hi> before

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faelix Nepotianus qui haec non videt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> of his Friend <hi>Nepotianus: Jerom</hi> lived in a calamitous time, and he counted his Friend happy, that he died before he ſaw thoſe Cala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Righteous, by death are freed from Spiritual Evils; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Aſſaults of the Devil; our Life here is a continual Warfare, the Church is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, and we muſt fight as the Lord's Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and that not againſt Fleſh and Blood, for then one Man's Sword would be as long as anothers, and one Man's Skin as thick as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but againſt Principalities, Powers, Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, Spiritual Wickedneſſes, Lambs againſt roaring Lions, Men againſt Devils, and not for a Natural or Temporal, but for a Spiritual and Eternal Life; not for an Earthly, but for a Heavenly Crown and Kingdom: And in this War there is no time of Truce, if the Devil be overcome one time, he will ſuddenly, and none knows how ſoon, give a freſh Aſſault, but Death ends the Battel; not as among Earthly Warriours, when the one dieth in the Fight the other getteth the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93823:10"/>
upper hand; but in this Fight the Devil hath not the Victory by the death of the Faithful, but the Faithful at the end get a full and final Conqueſt, and aſcend into Heaven, there to triumph; the Devil cannot aſſault them there, he may compaſs the Earth, but he cannot enter within the Liſts of Heaven, he never came thither to aſſault any ſince he was caſt out; though he tempted <hi>Adam</hi> in the Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and got him to be thruſt out, yet can he not tempt any in the Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is no ſmall evil to the Righteous to live and converſe among the Wicked, to ſee the Land diſhonour God; as juſt <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed with the filthy converſation of the Wicked, <hi>Dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, he vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day at their unlawful deeds:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. He which is truly grieved for Sin in himſelf, will be alſo grieved for Sin in others; ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that I am conſtrained to dwell in Meſech, and in the tents of Kedar</hi>; barbarous and profane People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that did neither know God, nor fear, nor love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſerve him. Now this World is full of ſcandalous Sinners, that if a Man would not

                  </gap>f the World,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. But Death frees the Righteous from this evil, for it taketh them out of the World, that they ſhall not behold either the Sins which Men commit againſt God, or the evils which God doth bring upon them; yea Death doth carry them into Heaven, to the Society of the Holy Angels and the Spirits of Juſt Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which ſin not at all, but do the Will of God in all perfection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Evil from which the Righteous are freed in Death is the practice of Sin here, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth not:</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. <hi>In many things we ſin all.</hi> Jam. 3.2. As the Wicked ſin in all things, ſo the Righteous, yea all the Righteous ſin in many things, and nothing is ſo grievous to the true Chriſtian as Sin, it is as the Thorn, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. or barbed head of an Arrow in the tender Fleſh, a Splinter under the Nail, it woundeth in the piercing in, and woundeth in the taking out; he will cry with St. <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But Death deſtroyeth Sin, this is a Myſtery of Grace, Sin brought in Death, and Death drives out Sin: After Death the Righteous ſhall be perfectly ſanctified, and made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93823:11"/>
like the Angels to do the Will of the Lord readily, willingly, chearfully, delightfully, and conſtantly. At firſt Death was inflicted as a puniſhment for Sin, but now it is uſed as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> means to ſtop the courſe of Sin: <hi>Tunc dictum eſt homini, morieris ſi peccaveris, nunc dicitur, morer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Sin is the Mother, and Death is the Daughter, and the Daughter ſhall become the deſtroyer of her own Mother: Unto the Chriſtian Death is a perfect mortification of all his earthly members, and the deſtruction of the whole Body of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Good which Death brings to the Righteous Man is manifold; 1. It brings him into the preſence of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; our Father, Redeemer, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, an immediate communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Sacred Trinity. 2. The Beatifical Viſion of God, <hi>To ſee his face,</hi> Rev. 22.4. <hi>To ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. 3. Union with God. 4. Fruition of God, and that for the manner, immediately, all means ceaſing; for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, fully, enjoy God in all, and all in God; for time, eternally, for ever with the Lord, and reign for ever and ever; <hi>Revelat.</hi> 22.5. for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Uſus</hi> 1. In that Death cannot be avoided, we ſhould learn to prepare and wait for it, to have our Loins girded, as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and our Staves in our Hands, ready to take our Journey from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan:</hi> as Fowls deſirous to fly, ſtretch out their Wings, ſo ſhould we, being deſirous to be with the Lord, ſtretch out our Affections towards Heaven. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was in the Door of his Tent when the Angel appeared unto him, and <hi>Elijah</hi> in the mouth of the Cave when the Lord appeared unto him; ſo we ſhould be ready to come out of the Cave and Tabernacle of our Body when the Lord appeareth unto us by his Meſſenger, <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let our Lamps be trimmed, our Lights burning, and always watching, as our Lord commandeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.42. <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come:</hi> And

holy <hi>Job</hi> practiſed, <hi>Job</hi> 14. <hi>All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look to your Faith that it be unfeigned, the Faith of God's Elect; to Conſcience, that it be pure, undefiled, void of offence towards God and Man; to Converſation, that it be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel, that is, holy, and in Heaven: a good Life will ſit us for a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death, and a comfortable Death will aſſure us of a joyful Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſus</hi> 2. Death to the Righteous is not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, therefore not to be feared; but is beneficial, therefore to be deſired: Unto the gracious Chriſtian, whoſe Conſcience is purged from dead Works, Death ſhall neither be fearful nor bitter; <hi>Acerbitas non mortis ſed culpae,</hi> The bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not in Death, but in Sin: as a Serpent wanting a Sting may hiſs, but cannot hurt, a Man may take it in Hand and put it in his Boſom; ſo the Righteous Man may welcome and embrace Death, and be ſure it will never hurt him: it is not the death of the Man, but of Sin in the Man, it is not the deſtruction but the abſolution of the Chriſtian; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Body is the abſolution of the Soul. So then not Death it ſelf, but the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Death is terrible; for ſince it tranſlates

            <p>The ſeparation of the Soul from God, that is Death; but the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body is only the ſhadow of Death: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as are dead, not in Soul, but in the Fleſh, are not ſaid to be properly dead, but to be covered with the ſhadow of Death. The Righteous Man who is Evangelically Righteous hath no cauſe to fear Death, but with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt: Let <hi>him</hi> only fear Death who is unwilling to go to Chriſt. It is true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>The day of a mans death</hi> (that is, a Righteous Man's death) <hi>is better than the day of his birth: Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. The day of a Godly Man's Birth is the beginning of his Miſery, but the day of his Death is the end of his Miſery, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into endleſs Glory and Bliſs.</p>

               <hi>Uſus</hi> 3. Conſolation as to the Death of our Righteous Friends. It cannot be denied, but that we ought in a ſpecial manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and lay to Heart the Death of our

Righteous Friends that are near and dear unto us, of whom we have good grounds to be perſwaded that they ſleep in Jeſus, and dye in the Lord; for it may be they were taken from us becauſe we were not worthy of them, and the Mercies we received from God in and by them, and were not thankful unto God for them; or that we gloried, were proud of them, and truſted too much in them, made Fleſh our Arm. We muſt conſider whether God hath deprived us of them as a puniſhment of our Sins and Unthankfulneſs, as the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> ſaid unto the Prophet, <hi>O man of God! art thou come to call my ſins to remembrance?</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.18. In this reſpect we have cauſe to mourn, and lay to Heart the Death of our Righteous Friends.</p>
            <p>We of this Place have cauſe indeed to mourn, droop, hang down our Heads like Bulruſhes, to weep, yea to weep if it were poſſible Rivers of Tears, till we can weep no more, with <hi>David,</hi> becauſe our Honourable deareſt Lord and beſt Friend to all of us is not: But that this may be guided with Wiſdom, and that we be not ſwallowed up of Sorrow, let us rightly underſtand where he is not: He is not in a Priſon, but in a Palace of freedom and enlargement; he is not in the Sea toſſed

Oh then! <hi>Pereat contriſtatio ubi eſt tanta conſolatio</hi>; Forget we our Sadneſs in the midſt of ſuch Joys, and let theſe Conſolations allay the bitterneſs of our Grief, and dry up in part the Fountain of our Tears.</p>
            <p>Farther conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Gain: Ballance that (whereof you you have heard before) with our Loſs; and then our Loſs (though exceeding great) will hold no weight.</p>

It is impudent; Sinners of this Generation cannot bluſh, they declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> they hide it not. 4. Incorrigible; we have been ſtricken, but we have not grieved; we have been conſumed, but refuſed to receive Correction, we have made our Faces harder than a Rock, we have refuſed to return. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p>We may therefore juſtly fear ſome ſtrange future Evils, when the Harveſt is ripe the ſharp Sickle will be thruſt in, and the Earth will be reaped; and when the Grapes are fully ripe, the Vine of the Earth ſhall be gathered and caſt into the great Wine-preſs of the Wrath of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14.</p>
