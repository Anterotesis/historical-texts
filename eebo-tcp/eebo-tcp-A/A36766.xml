            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE
OF THE
TRANSLATOR,
With a Parallel,
Of Poetry and Painting.</head>
                  <p>IT may be reasonably expected, that I shou'd
say something on my own behalf, in respect
to my present Undertaking. First, then,
the Reader may be pleas'd to know, that it was
not of my own choice that I undertook this
Work. Many of our most Skillfull Painters,
and other Artists, were pleas'd to recommend
<hi>this Authour</hi> to me, as one who perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Rules of Painting; who gave the best
and most concise Instructions for Performance,
and the surest to inform the Judgment of all who
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:54218:4"/>
lov'd this noble Art. That they who before were
rather fond of it, than knowingly admir'd it,
might defend their Inclination by their Reason:
that they might understand those Excellencies
which they blindly valu'd, so as not to be farther
impos'd on by bad Pieces, and to know when
Nature was well imitated by the most able Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
'Tis true indeed, and they acknowledge
it, that beside the Rules which are given in this
Treatise, or which can be given in any other,
that to make a perfect Judgment of good Pictures,
and to value them more or less when compar'd
with one another, there is farther requir'd a long
conversation with the best Pieces, which are not
very frequent either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England;</hi> yet
some we have, not onely from the hands of
<hi>Holbein, Rubens,</hi> and <hi>Vandyck,</hi> (one of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
for History-painting, and the other two
for Portraits,) but of many <hi>Flemish-Masters,</hi> and
those not inconsiderable, though for Design, not
equal to the <hi>Italians.</hi> And of these latter also,
we are not unfurnish'd with some Pieces of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,
Titian, Correggio, Michael Angelo</hi> and others.
But to return to my own undertaking of this
Translation, I freely own, that I thought my
self uncapable of performing it, either to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
or my own Credit. Not but that I
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:54218:4"/>
understood the <hi>Original Latine,</hi> and the <hi>French Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
perhaps as well as most <hi>Englishmen;</hi> But I
was not sufficiently vers'd in the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Art:</hi>
And therefore thought that many of those persons
who put this honourable task on me, were more
able to perform it themselves, as undoubtedly
they were. But they assuring me of their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in correcting my faults where I spoke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
I was encourag'd to attempt it; that
I might not be wanting in what I cou'd, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the desires of so many Gentlemen who were
willing to give the world this usefull Work. They
have effectually perform'd their promise to me;
and I have been as carefull on my side, to take
their advice in all things; so that the Reader may
assure himself of a tolerable Translation. Not
Elegant, for I propos'd not that to my self: but
familiar, clear and instructive. In any of which
parts, if I have fail'd, the fault lies wholly at my
door. In this one particular onely I must beg
the Readers pardon. The <hi>Prose Translation</hi> of
the <hi>Poem</hi> is not free from Poetical Expressions,
and I dare not promise that some of them are not
fustian, or at least highly metaphorical; but this
being a fault in the first digestion (that is, the
<hi>Original Latine</hi>) was not to be remedy'd in the
second (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Translation.</hi> And I may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:54218:5"/>
say, that whoever had attempted it, must
have fallen into the same inconvenience; or a
much greater, that of a false Version. When I
undertook this Work, I was already ingag'd in
the Translation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> from whom I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
onely two months, and am now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that which I ought to understand better.
In the mean time I beg the Readers pardon, for
entertaining him so long with my self: 'Tis an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
part of ill manners in all <hi>Authours,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in all Mankind, to trouble others with
their business; and I was so sensible of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
that I had not now committed it, unless
some concernments of the <hi>Readers</hi> had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with my own. But I know not, while I
am attoning for one Error, if I am not
falling into another: for I have been importun'd
to say something farther of <hi>this Art;</hi> and to make
some <hi>Observations</hi> on it in relation to the <hi>likeness</hi>
and <hi>agreement</hi> which it has with <hi>Poetry</hi> its Sister.
But before I proceed, it will not be amiss, if I
copy from <hi>Bellori</hi> (a most ingenious Authour,
yet living) some part of his <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Painter,</hi>
which cannot be unpleasing, at least to such who
are conversant in the Philosophy of <hi>Plato.</hi> And
to avoid tediousness, I will not translate the whole
Discourse, but take and leave as I find occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="v" facs="tcp:54218:5"/>God Almighty, in the Fabrique of the Universe,
first contemplated himself, and reflected on his own
Excellencies; from which he drew, and constituted
those first Forms, which are call'd Idea's. So that
every Species which was afterwards express'd was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from that first Idea, forming that wonderfull
contexture of all created Beings. But the Coelestial
Bodies above the Moon being incorruptible, and not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to change, remain'd for ever fair, and in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
order: On the contrary, all things which are sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
are subject to change, to deformity, and to decay.
And though Nature always intends a consummate beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in her productions, yet through the inequality of the
Matter, the Forms are alter'd; and in particular,
Humane Beauty suffers alteration for the worse, as
we see to our mortification, in the deformities, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportions
which are in us. For which reason the
Artfull Painter and the Sculptour, imitating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Maker, form to themselves as well as they are
able, a Model of the Superiour Beauties; and reflecting
on them endeavour to correct and amend the common
Nature; and to represent it as it was first created
without fault, either in Colour or in Lineament.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Idea,</hi> which we may call the Goddess of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and of Sculpture, descends upon the Marble and the
Cloth, and becomes the Original of those Arts; and
being measur'd by the Compass of the Intellect, is it
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:54218:6"/>
self the Measure of the performing Hand; and being
an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>mated by the Imagination, infuses Life into the
Image. The <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi> and the <hi>Sculptour,</hi>
is undoubtedly that perfect and excellent Example of
the Mind; by imitation of which imagin'd form, all
things are represented which fall under humane sight:
Such is the Definition which is made by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his
Book of the <hi>Oratour</hi> to <hi>Brutus.</hi> "As therefore in
Forms and Figures there is somewhat which is Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and Perfect, to which imagin'd <hi>Species</hi> all
things are referr'd by Imitation which are the Objects
of Sight, in like manner we behold the <hi>Species</hi> of
Eloquence in our Minds, the Effigies, or actual
Image of which we seek in the Organs of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This is likewise confirm'd by <hi>Proclus</hi> in the
Dialogue of <hi>Plato</hi> call'd <hi>Timaeus:</hi> If, says he,
you take a Man, as he is made by Nature, and
compare him with another who is the effect of Art;
the work of Nature will always appear the less beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
because Art is more accurate than Nature."
But <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> who from the choice which he made of
Five Virgins drew that wonderfull Picture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi>
which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Oratour</hi> beforemention'd,
sets before us as the most perfect Example of Beauty,
at the same time admonishes a Painter, to contemplate
the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the most Natural Forms; and to make a
judicious choice of several Bodies, all of them the most
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:54218:6"/>
Elegant which he can find. By which we may plainly
understand that he thought it impossible to find in any
one Body all those Perfections which he sought for the
accomplishment of a <hi>Helena,</hi> because Nature in any
individual person makes nothing that is perfect in all its
parts. For this reason <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> also says,
that the Image which is taken by a Painter from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bodies produces a Beauty, which it is impossible to
find in any single Natural Body, approaching to the
perfection of the fairest Statues. Thus <hi>Nature</hi> on
this account is so much inferiour to <hi>Art,</hi> that those
Artists who propose to themselves onely the imitation and
likeness of such or such a particular person, without
election of those <hi>Idea</hi>'s before-mention'd, have often
been reproach'd for that omission: <hi>Demetrius</hi> was
tax'd for being too Natural; <hi>Dionysius</hi> was also
blam'd for drawing Men like us, and was commonly
call'd' <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, a <hi>Painter of Men.</hi>
In our times <hi>Michael Angelo da Caravaggio,</hi> was
esteem'd too Natural. He drew persons as they were;
and <hi>Bambovio,</hi> and most of the Dutch Painters have
drawn the worst likeness. <hi>Lysippus</hi> of old, upbraided
the common sort of <hi>Sculptours,</hi> for making Men such
as they were found in Nature; and boasted of himself
that he made them as they ought to be: which is a
Precept of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> given as well to <hi>Poets</hi> as to
<hi>Painters. Phidias</hi> rais'd an admiration even to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:54218:7"/>
in those who beheld his <hi>Statues,</hi> with
the Forms, which he gave to his <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes;</hi>
by imitating the <hi>Idea</hi> rather than <hi>Nature.</hi> And <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
speaking of him affirms, that figuring <hi>Jupiter</hi>
and <hi>Pallas,</hi> he did not contemplate any Object from
whence he took the likeness, but consider'd in his own
mind a great and admirable form of Beauty, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Image in his Soul, he directed the operation
of his Hand. <hi>Seneca</hi> also seems to wonder, that
<hi>Phidias</hi> having never beheld either <hi>Jove</hi> or <hi>Pallas,</hi>
yet cou'd conceive their divine Images in his Mind.
<hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> says the same in other words,
that the fancy more instructs the <hi>Painter</hi> than the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for the last makes onely the things which it sees,
but the first makes also the things which it never
sees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leon Battista Alberti</hi> tells us, that we ought not
so much to love the likeness as the beauty, and to choose
from the fairest Bodies severally the fairest Parts.
<hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> instructs the Painter to form this
<hi>Idea</hi> to himself: And <hi>Raphael,</hi> the greatest of all
modern Masters, writes thus to <hi>Castiglione,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his <hi>Galatea:</hi> "To paint a Fair one, 'tis necessary
for me to see many Fair ones; but because there is so
great a scarcity of lovely Women, I am constrain'd to
make use of one certain <hi>Idea,</hi> which I have form'd to
my self in my own fancy." <hi>Guido Reni</hi> sending to
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:54218:7"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> his <hi>St.</hi> Michael which he had painted for the
Church of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> at the same time wrote to
<hi>Monsignor Massano,</hi> who was <hi>Maestro di Casa</hi>
(or Steward of the House) to Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi>
in this manner. I wish I had the wings of an <hi>Angel,</hi>
to have ascended into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and there to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the Forms of those beatify'd Spirits, from which I
might have copy'd my <hi>Archangel:</hi> But not being able
to mount so high, it was in vain for me to search his
resemblance here below: so that I was forc'd to make an
Introspection, into my own mind, and into that <hi>Idea</hi>
of Beauty, which I have form'd in my own imagination.
I have likewise created there the contrary <hi>Idea</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and ugliness; but I leave the consideration of
it, till I paint the <hi>Devil:</hi> and in the mean time shun
the very thought of it as much as possibly I can, and
am even endeavouring to blot it wholly out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.
There was not any Lady in all Antiquity,
who was Mistress of so much Beauty as was to be
found in the <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Gnidus,</hi> made by <hi>Praxiteles,</hi>
or the <hi>Minerva</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Phydias;</hi> which was
therefore call'd the <hi>Beautifull Form.</hi> Neither is there
any Man of the present Age, equal in the strength,
proportion, and knitting of his Limbs, to the <hi>Hercules</hi>
of <hi>Farnese,</hi> made by <hi>Glicon:</hi> Or any Woman who can
justly be compar'd with the <hi>Medicean Venus</hi> of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi>
And upon this account, the noblest <hi>Poets</hi>
                     <pb n="x" facs="tcp:54218:8"/>
and the best <hi>Oratours,</hi> when they desir'd to celebrate
any extraordinary Beauty, are forc'd to have recourse
to <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> and to draw their Persons
and Faces into Comparison. <hi>Ovid</hi> endeavouring to
express the Beauty of <hi>Cillarus,</hi> the fairest of the
<hi>Centaures,</hi> celebrates him as next in perfection, to the
most admirable <hi>Statues.</hi>

                     <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:54218:8"/>The <hi>Idea</hi> of this Beauty, is indeed various, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the several forms which the <hi>Painter</hi> or <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptour</hi>
wou'd describe: As one in Strength, another in
Magnanimity; and sometimes it consists in Chearfulness,
and sometimes in Delicacy; and is always diversify'd by
the Sex and Age.</p>
                  <p>The Beauty of <hi>Jove</hi> is one, and that of <hi>Juno</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> are perfect Beauties,
though of different kinds; for Beauty is onely that
which makes all things as they are in their proper and
perfect Nature; which the best <hi>Painters</hi> always choose
by contemplating the Forms of each. We ought farther
to consider, that a Picture being the representation of
a humane action, the <hi>Painter</hi> ought to retain in his
mind, the Examples of all Affections, and Passions, as
a <hi>Poet</hi> preserves the <hi>Idea</hi> of an Angry man, of one
who is fearfull, sad or merry, and so of all the rest.
For 'tis impossible to express that with the Hand, which
never enter'd into the Imagination. In this manner as
I have rudely and briefly shewn you, <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptours,</hi>
choosing the most elegant natural Beauties, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
the <hi>Idea,</hi> and advance their <hi>Art,</hi> even above
<hi>Nature</hi> it self, in her individual productions, which is
the utmost mastery of humane performance.</p>
                  <p>From hence arises that astonishment, and almost ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is paid by the Knowing to those divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> From hence <hi>Phydias, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus,</hi>
                     <pb n="xij" facs="tcp:54218:9"/>
and other noble <hi>Sculptours,</hi> are still held in
veneration; and <hi>Apelles, Zeuxis, Protogenes,</hi> and
other admirable <hi>Painters,</hi> though their Works are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
are and will be eternally admir'd; who all of
them drew after the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Perfection; which are
the Miracles of Nature, the Providence of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the Exemplars of the Mind, the Light of
the Fancy; the Sun which from its rising, inspir'd the
Statue of <hi>Memnon,</hi> and the fire which warm'd into
life the Image of <hi>Prometheus:</hi> 'Tis this which causes
the <hi>Graces,</hi> and the <hi>Loves</hi> to take up their habitations
in the hardest <hi>Marble,</hi> and to subsist in the emptiness
of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Shadows.</hi> But since the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
is as far inferiour to that of <hi>Painting,</hi> as the
force of Words is to the Sight; I must here break off
abruptly, and having conducted the <hi>Reader</hi> as it were to
a secret Walk, there leave him in the midst of Silence to
contemplate those <hi>Idea's;</hi> which I have onely sketch'd,
and which every man must finish for himself.</p>
                  <p>In these pompous Expressions, or such as these
the <hi>Italian</hi> has given you his <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Painter;</hi> and
though I cannot much commend the Style, I
must needs say there is somewhat in the Matter:
<hi>Plato</hi> himself is accustom'd to write loftily, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,
as the <hi>Critiques</hi> tell us, the manner of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
but surely that inimitable Poet, had not so
much of Smoke in his writing, though not less of
<pb n="xiij" facs="tcp:54218:9"/>
Fire. But in short, this is the present <hi>Genius</hi> of
<hi>Italy.</hi> What <hi>Philostratus</hi> tells us in the <hi>Proem</hi> of his
<hi>Figures</hi> is somewhat plainer; and therefore I will
translate it almost word for word. "<hi>He who
will rightly govern the</hi> Art <hi>of</hi> Painting, <hi>ought of
necessity first to understand Humane Nature. He
ought likewise to be endued with a</hi> Genius <hi>to express
the signs of their Passions whom he represents; and
to make the dumb as it were to speak: He must
yet further understand what is contain'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Cheeks, in the temperament of the
Eyes, in the naturalness (if I may so call it) of the
Eye-brows: and in short whatsoever belongs to the
Mind and Thought. He who throughly possesses all
these things will obtain the whole. And the Hand
will exquisitely represent the action of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
person. If it happen that he be either mad, or
angry, melancholique, or chearfull, a sprightly Youth,
or a languishing Lover; in one word, he will be able
to paint whatsoever is proportionable to any one.
And even in all this there is a sweet errour without
causing any shame. For the Eyes and Minds of
the beholders being fasten'd on Objects which have no
real Being, as if they were truly Existent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
induc'd by them to believe them so, what pleasure
is it not capable of giving? The Ancients, and
other Wise Men, have written many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:54218:10"/>
the</hi> Symmetry <hi>which is in the</hi> Art <hi>of</hi> Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>constituting as it were some certain</hi> Laws <hi>for
the proportion of every Member, not thinking it
possible for a</hi> Painter <hi>to undertake the expression of
those motions which are in the Mind, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
Harmony in the natural measure. For
that which is out of its own kind and measure, is
not receiv'd from Nature, whose motion is always
right. On a serious consideration of this matter it
will be found, That the</hi> Art <hi>of</hi> Painting <hi>has a
wonderfull affinity with that of</hi> Poetry; <hi>and that
there is betwixt them a certain common Imagination.
For as the</hi> Poets <hi>introduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>and all those things which are either Majestical, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or Delightfull, in like manner the</hi> Painters, <hi>by
the virtue of their Out-lines, Colours, Lights and
Shadows, represent the same Things and Persons
in their Pictures.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Thus, as <hi>Convoy Ships</hi> either accompany, or
shou'd accompany their <hi>Merchants</hi> till they may
prosecute the rest of their Voyage without danger,
so <hi>Philostratus</hi> has brought me thus far on my
way, and I can now sail on without him. He
has begun to speak of the great relation betwixt
<hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> and thither the greatest part
of this Discourse by my promise was directed.
I have not ingag'd my self to any perfect Method,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:54218:10"/>
neither am I loaded with a full Cargo. 'Tis
sufficient if I bring a Sample of some Goods in
this Voyage. It will be easie for others to add
more when the Commerce is settled. For a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi>
twice as large as this of <hi>Painting</hi> cou'd not
contain all that might be said on the <hi>Parallel</hi> of
these two <hi>Sister Arts.</hi> I will take my rise from
<hi>Bellori</hi> before I proceed to the <hi>Authour of this
Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The business of his <hi>Preface</hi> is to prove, that a
learned <hi>Painter</hi> shou'd form to himself an <hi>Idea</hi> of
perfect Nature. This Image he is to set before
his Mind in all his Undertakings, and to draw
from thence as from a Store-house, the Beauties
which are to enter into his Work; thereby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
Nature from what actually she is in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
to what she ought to be, and what she
was created. Now as this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> is of
little use in <hi>Portraits</hi> (or the resemblances of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons) so neither is it in the Characters
of <hi>Comedy,</hi> and <hi>Tragedy;</hi> which are never to be
made perfect, but always to be drawn with some
specks of frailty and deficience; such as they have
been described to us in <hi>History,</hi> if they were real
<hi>Characters;</hi> or such as the <hi>Poet</hi> began to shew them
at their first appearance, if they were onely ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
(or imaginary.) The perfection of such
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:54218:11"/>
                     <hi>Stage-characters</hi> consists chiefly in their likeness to
the deficient faulty Nature, which is their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Onely, as it is observ'd more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
in such cases<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> there will always be found a
better likeness, and a worse; and the better is
constantly to be chosen: I mean in <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
which represents the Figures of the highest form
amongst Mankind. Thus in <hi>Portraits,</hi> the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
will not take that side of the Face which has
some notorious blemish in it; but either draw it
in profile (as <hi>Apelles</hi> did <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who had lost
one of his Eyes) or else shadow the more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
side. For an ingenious flattery is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to the Professours of <hi>both Arts;</hi> so long as
the likeness is not destroy'd. 'Tis true that all
manner of Imperfections must not be taken away
from the <hi>Characters,</hi> and the reason is, that there
may be left some grounds of pity for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
We can never be griev'd for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
who are thoroughly wicked, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
justly call'd their calamities on themselves.
Such Men are the natural Objects of our hatred,
not of our commiseration. If on the other side
their Characters were wholly perfect, (such as for
Example, the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Martyr</hi> in a
<hi>Play,</hi>) his, or her misfortunes, wou'd produce
impious thoughts in the Beholders: they wou'd
<pb n="xvij" facs="tcp:54218:11"/>
accuse the <hi>Heavens</hi> of injustice, and think of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>Religion,</hi> where Piety was so ill requited.
I say the greater part wou'd be tempted so to do,
I say not that they ought: and the consequence is
too dangerous for the practice. In this I have
accus'd my self for my own St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> but let
truth prevail. <hi>Sophocles</hi> has taken the just medium
in his <hi>Oedipus.</hi> He is somewhat arrogant at his
first entrance; and is too inquisitive through the
whole <hi>Tragedy:</hi> Yet these Imperfections being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
by great Vertues, they hinder not our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
for his miseries; neither yet can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that horrour which the nature of his Crimes
have excited in us. Such in <hi>Painting</hi> are the <hi>Warts</hi>
and <hi>Moles,</hi> which adding a likeness to the Face,
are not therefore to be omitted. But these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no loathing in us. But how far to proceed,
and where to stop, is left to the judgment of the
<hi>Poet</hi> and the <hi>Painter.</hi> In <hi>Comedy</hi> there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more of the worse likeness to be taken. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that is often to produce laughter; which is
occasion'd by the sight of some deformity: but
for this I referr the <hi>Reader</hi> to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> 'Tis a
sharp manner of Instruction for the Vulgar who
are never well amended, till they are more than
sufficiently expos'd. That I may return to the
beginning of this Remark, concerning perfect
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:54218:12"/>
                     <hi>Idea's,</hi> I have onely this to say, that the <hi>Parallel</hi> is
often true in <hi>Epique-Poetry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heroes</hi> of the <hi>Poets</hi> are to be drawn accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Rule. There is scarce a frailty to be
left in the best of them; any more than is to be
found in a <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> And if <hi>Aeneas</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
weeps, it is not in bemoaning his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
but those which his people undergo. If
this be an Imperfection, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> when he
was incarnate shed tears of Compassion over <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
And <hi>Lentulus</hi> describes him often weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but never laughing; so that <hi>Virgil</hi> is justify'd
even from the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> I have but one
word more, which for once I will anticipate
from the <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Book.</hi> Though it must be
an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> from which both the <hi>Epique
Poet,</hi> and the <hi>History Painter</hi> draws; yet all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are not suitable to all Subjects: But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one must be design'd according to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Beauty which is proper to him. An <hi>Apollo</hi>
must be distinguish'd from a <hi>Iupiter,</hi> a <hi>Pallas</hi>
from a <hi>Venus:</hi> and so in <hi>Poetry</hi> an <hi>Aeneas</hi> from
any other <hi>Heroe:</hi> for <hi>Piety</hi> is his chief <hi>Perfection.
Homer</hi>'s <hi>Achilles</hi> is a kind of Exception to this Rule:
but then he is not a perfect <hi>Heroe,</hi> nor so intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Poet.</hi> All his <hi>Gods</hi> had somewhat of
humane imperfection; for which he has been
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:54218:12"/>
tax'd by <hi>Plato,</hi> as an Imitatour of what was bad.
But <hi>Virgil</hi> observ'd his fault, and mended it.
Yet <hi>Achilles</hi> was perfect in the strength of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the vigour of his Mind. Had he been
less passionate, or less revengefull, the <hi>Poet</hi> well
foresaw that <hi>Hector</hi> had been kill'd, and <hi>Troy</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at the first assault; which had destroy'd the
beautifull contrivance of his <hi>Iliads,</hi> and the moral
of preventing Discord amongst Confederate
Princes, which was his principal intention. For
the <hi>Moral</hi> (as <hi>Bossu</hi> observes) is the first business
of the <hi>Poet,</hi> as being the ground-work of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
This being form'd, he contrives such
a <hi>Design,</hi> or <hi>Fable,</hi> as may be most suitable to
the <hi>Moral.</hi> After this he begins to think of the
Persons, whom he is to employ in carrying on
his <hi>Design:</hi> and gives them the <hi>Manners,</hi> which
are most proper to their several <hi>Characters.</hi> The
thoughts and words are the last parts, which give
Beauty and Colouring to the Piece. When I say,
that the <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Heroe</hi> ought to be good in
perfection, I contradict not the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manby</hi>'s
opinion, in that admirable Verse, where
speaking of a perfect Character, he calls it <hi>A Fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Monster, which the World ne'er knew.</hi> For <hi>that
Excellent Critique,</hi> intended onely to speak of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique
Characters,</hi> and not of <hi>Epique.</hi> Thus at

please the Mind.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Parallel</hi> of the <hi>Arts</hi>
holds true: with this difference, That the Principal
end of <hi>Painting</hi> is to <hi>please;</hi> and the chief design
of <hi>Poetry</hi> is to <hi>instruct.</hi> In this the <hi>latter</hi> seems to
have the advantage of the <hi>former.</hi> But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>Artists</hi> themselves on both sides, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their aims are the very same: they wou'd both
make sure of pleasing, and that in preference to
instruction. Next, the means of this pleasure is
by Deceipt. One imposes on the Sight, and the
other on the Understanding. <hi>Fiction</hi> is of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of <hi>Poetry</hi> as well as of <hi>Painting;</hi> there is a
resemblance in one, of Humane Bodies, Things and
Actions which are not real, and in the other, of
a true Story by a Fiction. And as all Stories are
not proper Subjects for an <hi>Epique Poem,</hi> or a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi>
so neither are they for a noble <hi>Picture.</hi> The
Subjects both of the one, and of the other, ought
to have nothing of immoral, low, or filthy in
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:54218:13"/>
them; but this being treated at large in the <hi>Book it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self,</hi>
I wave it to avoid repetition. Onely I must
add, that though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Catullus, Ovid</hi> and others were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
opinion, that the Subject of <hi>Poets,</hi> and even
their thoughts and expressions might be loose, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
their lives were chast and holy, yet there are
no such licences permitted in <hi>that Art</hi> any more than
in <hi>Painting,</hi> to design and colour obscene Nudities.
<hi>Vita proba est,</hi> is no excuse, for it will scarcely be
admitted, that either a <hi>Poet</hi> or a <hi>Painter</hi> can be
chast, who give us the contrary examples in their
<hi>Writings</hi> and their <hi>Pictures.</hi> We see nothing of
this kind in <hi>Virgil:</hi> that which comes the nearest
to it, is the <hi>adventure of the Cave,</hi> where <hi>Dido</hi> and
<hi>Aeneas</hi> were driven by the Storm: Yet even there
the <hi>Poet</hi> pretends a Marriage before the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and <hi>Iuno</hi> her self was present at it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any expression in that Story, which a
<hi>Roman Matron</hi> might not reade without a blush.
Besides the <hi>Poet</hi> passes it over as hastily as he can,
as if he were afraid of staying in the Cave with
the two Lovers, and of being a witness to their
Actions. Now I suppose that a <hi>Painter</hi> wou'd
not be much commended, who shou'd pick out
this Cavern from the whole <hi>Eneids,</hi> when there is
not another in the Work. He had better leave
them in their obscurity, than let in a flash of
<pb n="xxij" facs="tcp:54218:14"/>
Lightning to clear the natural darkness of the
place, by which he must discover himself as much
as them. The <hi>Altar-Pieces,</hi> and holy Decorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Painting,</hi> show <hi>that Art</hi> may be apply'd
to better uses, as well as <hi>Poetry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And amongst many other instances, the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesian
Gallery,</hi> painted by <hi>Hannibal Carracci,</hi> is a
sufficient witness yet remaining: the whole Work
being morally instructive, and particularly the
<hi>Herculis Bivium,</hi> which is a perfect <hi>Triumph of
Vertue over Vice,</hi> as it is wonderfully well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by the ingenious <hi>Bellori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have onely told the <hi>Reader</hi> what
ought not to be the subject of a <hi>Picture</hi> or of a
<hi>Poem:</hi> what it ought to be on either side; our
<hi>Author</hi> tells us: it must in general be great and
noble: and in this, the <hi>Parallel</hi> is exactly true.
The subject of a <hi>Poet</hi> either in <hi>Tragedy</hi> or in an
<hi>Epique Poem</hi> is a great action of some illustrious
Hero. 'Tis the same in <hi>Painting;</hi> not every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor every person is considerable enough to
enter into the Cloth. It must be the Anger of
an <hi>Achilles,</hi> the Piety of an <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Sacrifice
of an <hi>Iphigenia</hi> (for <hi>Heroins</hi> as well as <hi>Heroes</hi> are
comprehended in the Rule;) but the <hi>Parallel</hi> is
more compleat in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> than in an <hi>Epique
Poem.</hi> For as a <hi>Tragedy</hi> may be made out of
<pb n="xxiij" facs="tcp:54218:14"/>
many particular <hi>Episodes</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> or of <hi>Virgil,</hi> so
may a noble <hi>Picture</hi> be design'd out of this or
that particular Story in either <hi>Author. History</hi> is
also fruitfull of designs both for the <hi>Painter</hi> and
the <hi>Tragique Poet: Curtius</hi> throwing himself into
a <hi>Gulph,</hi> and the two <hi>Decii</hi> sacrificing themselves
for the safety of their Country, are subjects for <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>
and <hi>Picture.</hi> Such is <hi>Scipio</hi> restoring the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Bride,</hi> whom he either lov'd or may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos'd
to love, by which he gain'd the Hearts of
a great Nation, to interess themselves for <hi>Rome</hi>
against <hi>Carthage:</hi> These are all but particular
Pieces in <hi>Livy</hi>'s History; and yet are full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Subjects for the <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Pencil.</hi> Now the
reason of this is evident. <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Picture</hi> are
more narrowly circumscrib'd by the <hi>Mechanick
Rules</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> than the <hi>Epique Poem.</hi>
The time of this last is left indefinite. 'Tis true,
<hi>Homer</hi> took up onely the space of eight and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days for his <hi>Iliads;</hi> but whether <hi>Virgil</hi>'s action
was comprehended in a year or somewhat more,
is not determin'd by <hi>Bossu. Homer</hi> made the place
of his action <hi>Troy,</hi> and the <hi>Grecian Camp</hi> besieging
it. <hi>Virgil</hi> introduces his <hi>Aeneas,</hi> sometimes in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
sometimes in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and other times at <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
before he brings him to <hi>Laurentum;</hi> and even
after that, he wanders again to the Kingdom of
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:54218:15"/>
                     <hi>Evander</hi> and some parts of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to finish the War by the death of <hi>Turnus.</hi>
But <hi>Tragedy</hi> according to the Practice of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi>
was always confin'd within the compass of
24 hours, and seldom takes up so much time.
As for the place of it, it was always one, and
that not in a larger Sence; as for example, A
whole City or two or three several Houses in it;
but the Market or some other publick place, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the <hi>Chorus</hi> and all the Actours. Which
establish'd Law of theirs, I have not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to examine in this place, because I cannot
do it without digression from my subject, though
it seems too strict at the first appearance because
it excludes all secret Intrigues, which are the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>modern Stage:</hi> for nothing can be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on with Privacy, when the <hi>Chorus</hi> is suppos'd
to be always present. But to proceed, I must
say this to the advantage of <hi>Painting,</hi> even above
<hi>Tragedy,</hi> that what this last represents in the space
of many Hours, the former shows us in one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Action, the Passion, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of so many Persons as are contain'd in a
<hi>Picture,</hi> are to be discern'd at once, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an Eye; at least they would be so, if the
Sight could travel over so many different Objects
all at once, or the Mind could digest them all at
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:54218:15"/>
the same instant or point of time. Thus in the
famous Picture of <hi>Poussin,</hi> which represents the
<hi>Institution of the Blessed Sacrament,</hi> you see our
Saviour and <hi>his twelve Disciples,</hi> all concurring
in the same action, after different manners, and
in different postures, onely the manners of <hi>Iudas</hi>
are distinguish'd from the rest. Here is but one
indivisible point of time observ'd: but one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perform'd by so many Persons, in one Room
and at the same Table: yet the Eye cannot
comprehend at once the whole Object, nor the
Mind follow it so fast; 'tis consider'd at leisure,
and seen by intervals. Such are the Subjects of
Noble <hi>Pictures:</hi> and such are onely to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by <hi>Noble Hands.</hi> There are other parts
of Nature, which are meaner, and yet are the
Subjects both of <hi>Painters,</hi> and of Poets.</p>
                  <p>For to proceed in the <hi>Parallel,</hi> as <hi>Comedy</hi> is a
representation of Humane Life, in inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and low Subjects, and by that means creeps
into the nature of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and is a kind of <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
a Shrub belonging to the species of <hi>Cedar,</hi> so
is the painting of <hi>Clowns,</hi> the representation of a
<hi>Dutch Kermis,</hi> the brutal sport of <hi>Snick or Snee,</hi>
and a thousand other things of this mean inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a kind of <hi>Picture,</hi> which belongs to Nature,
but of the lowest form. Such is a <hi>Lazar</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:54218:16"/>
to a <hi>Venus;</hi> both are drawn in Humane
Figures: they have Faces alike, though not like
Faces. There is yet a lower sort of <hi>Poetry</hi> and
<hi>Painting,</hi> which is out of Nature. For a <hi>Farce</hi> is
that in <hi>Poetry,</hi> which <hi>Grotesque</hi> is in a <hi>Picture.</hi> The
Persons, and Action of a <hi>Farce</hi> are all unnatural,
and the Manners false, that is, inconsisting with
the characters of Mankind. <hi>Grotesque-painting</hi> is the
just resemblance of <hi>this;</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> begins his
<hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> by describing such a Figure; with
a Man's Head, a Horse's Neck, the Wings of a
Bird, and a Fishes Tail; parts of different species
jumbled together, according to the mad imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the <hi>Dawber;</hi> and the end of all this, as
he tells you afterward, to cause Laughter. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Monster</hi> in a <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> for the <hi>Mob</hi> to
gape at for their two-pence. Laughter is indeed
the propriety of a Man, but just enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him from his elder Brother, with four
Legs. 'Tis a kind of Bastard-pleasure too, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in at the Eyes of the vulgar gazers, and at
the Ears of the beastly Audience. <hi>Church-Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
use it to divert the honest <hi>Countryman</hi> at Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers, and keep his Eyes open at a heavy
<hi>Sermon.</hi> And Farce-Scriblers make use of the
same noble invention to entertain <hi>Citizens, Country-Gentlemen,</hi>
and <hi>Covent-Garden Fops.</hi> If they are
<pb n="xxvij" facs="tcp:54218:16"/>
merry, all goes well on the <hi>Poet</hi>'s side. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort goe thither too, but in despair of Sense,
and the just Images of Nature, which are the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
pleasures of the Mind. But the <hi>Authour</hi>
can give the Stage no better than what was given
him by Nature: and the <hi>Actors</hi> must represent
such things, as they are capable to perform, and
by which both they and the <hi>Scribbler</hi> may get their
living. After all, 'tis a good thing to laugh at
any rate, and if a straw can tickle a man, 'tis an
instrument of happiness. Beasts can weep when
they suffer, but they cannot laugh. And as
Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> observes in his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibert,
'Tis the wisdom of a Government to permit
Plays</hi> (he might have added Farces) <hi>as 'tis the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Carter to put Bells upon his Horses, to
make them carry their Burthens chearfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already shewn, that one main end of
<hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Painting</hi> is to please, and have said
something of the kinds of both, and of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in which they bear a great resemblance to
each other. I must now consider them, as they
are great and noble <hi>Arts;</hi> and as they are <hi>Arts,</hi>
they must have <hi>Rules</hi> which may direct them to
their common end.</p>
                  <p>To all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> but more particularly
to these may be apply'd what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> says of
<pb n="xxviij" facs="tcp:54218:17"/>
Physick, as I find him cited by an eminent French
Critique. <hi>"Medicine has long subsisted in the
World. The Principles of it are certain, and it
has a certain way; by both which there has been
found in the course of many Ages, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of things, the experience of which has confirm'd
its usefulness and goodness. All that is wanting to
the perfection of this Art, will undoubtedly be found,
if able Men, and such as are instructed in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rules will make a farther enquiry into it, and
endeavour to arrive at that, which is hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
by that which is already known. But all,
who having rejected the Ancient Rules, and taken
the opposite ways, yet boast themselves to be Masters
of this Art, do but deceive others, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
deceiv'd; for that is absolutely impossible."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is notoriously true in <hi>these two Arts:</hi> for
the way to please being to imitate Nature; both
the <hi>Poets</hi> and the <hi>Painters,</hi> in Ancient times, and
in the best Ages, have study'd her: and from
the practice of <hi>both these Arts,</hi> the Rules have been
drawn, by which we are instructed how to please,
and to compass that end which they obtain'd, by
following their Example. For Nature is still
the same in all Ages, and can never be contrary
to her self. Thus from the practice of <hi>Aeschylus,
Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides, Aristotle</hi> drew his Rules
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:54218:17"/>
for <hi>Tragedy;</hi> and <hi>Philostratus</hi> for <hi>Painting.</hi> Thus
amongst the <hi>Moderns,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>
by studying the Precepts of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
<hi>Horace,</hi> and having the Example of the <hi>Grecian
Poets</hi> before their Eyes, have given us the Rules
of <hi>Modern Tragedy:</hi> and thus the <hi>Critiques</hi> of the
same Countries, in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi> have given
the Precepts of perfecting <hi>that Art.</hi> 'Tis true that
<hi>Poetry</hi> has one advantage over <hi>Painting</hi> in these
last Ages, that we have still the remaining Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
both of the <hi>Greek and Latine Poets:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Painters</hi> have nothing left them from <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
Protogenes, Parrhasius, Xeuxis</hi> and the rest,
but onely the testimonies which are given of their
incomparable Works. But instead of this, they
have some of their best <hi>Statues, Bass-Relievo's,
Columns, Obilisques,</hi> &amp;c. which were sav'd out of
the common ruine, and are still preserv'd in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
and by well distinguishing what is proper to
<hi>Sculpture,</hi> and what to <hi>Painting,</hi> and what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them <hi>both,</hi> they have judiciously repair'd
that loss. And the great <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and
others, having succeeded to the times of Barbarism
and Ignorance, the knowledge of <hi>Painting</hi> is now
arriv'd to a supreme perfection, though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it is much declin'd in the present Age.
The greatest Age for <hi>Poetry</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>
                     <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:54218:18"/>
was certainly that of <hi>Augustus Caesar;</hi> and yet we
are told that <hi>Painting</hi> was then at its lowest Ebb,
and perhaps <hi>Sculpture</hi> was also declining at the
same time. In the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and some
who succeeded him, <hi>Poetry</hi> was but meanly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,
but <hi>Painting</hi> eminently flourish'd. I am
not here to give the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>two Arts;</hi> how
they were both in a manner extinguish'd, by the
Irruption of the barbarous Nations, and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
about the times of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the First; though I might
observe, that neither <hi>Ariosto,</hi> nor any of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
Poets</hi> ever arriv'd at the Excellency of
<hi>Raphael, Titian,</hi> and the rest in <hi>Painting.</hi> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
at this time, or lately in many Countries, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry</hi>
is better practis'd than her <hi>Sister-Art.</hi> To what
height the Magnificence and Encouragement of the
present <hi>King of France</hi> may carry <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
is uncertain, but by what he has done, before
the War in which he is ingag'd, we may expect
what he will do after the happy Conclusion of a
Peace, which is the Prayer and Wish of all those
who have not an interest to prolong the miseries
of <hi>Europe.</hi> For'tis most certain, as our <hi>Author</hi>
amongst others has observ'd, That Reward is the
Spur of Vertue, as well in all good Arts, as in all
laudable Attempts: and Emulation which is the
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:54218:18"/>
other Spur, will never be wanting either amongst
<hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Painters,</hi> when particular Rewards and
Prizes are propos'd to the best deservers. But to
return from this digression, though it was almost
necessary; all the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi> are methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
concisely, and yet clearly deliver'd in <hi>this
present Treatise</hi> which I have translated. <hi>Bossu</hi>
has not given more exact <hi>Rules</hi> for the <hi>Epique Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi>
nor Dacier for <hi>Tragedy</hi> in his late excellent
<hi>Translation of Aristotle</hi> and his notes upon him,
than our <hi>Fresnoy</hi> has made for <hi>Painting;</hi> with the
<hi>Parallel</hi> of which I must resume my Discourse,
following my <hi>Author</hi>'s Text, though with more
brevity than I intended, because <hi>Virgil</hi> calls me.
<hi>The principal and most important parts of Painting,</hi> is
to know what <hi>is most beautifull in Nature, and most
proper for that Art:</hi> that which is the most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is the most noble Subject: so in <hi>Poetry, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>
is more beautifull than <hi>Comedy;</hi> because, as
I said, the Persons are greater whom the <hi>Poet</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs,
and consequently the instructions of more
benefit to Mankind: the action is likewise great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more noble, and thence is deriv'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more noble Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>To imitate Nature well in whatsoever Subject,
is the perfection of <hi>both Arts;</hi> and that <hi>Picture</hi>
and that <hi>Poem</hi> which comes nearest to the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="xxxij" facs="tcp:54218:19"/>
of Nature is the best. But it follows not,
that what pleases most in either kind is therefore
good; but what ought to please. Our deprav'd
Appetites, and ignorance of the Arts, mislead our
Judgments, and cause us often to take that for
true imitation of Nature, which has no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Nature in it. To inform our Judgments,
and to reform our Tasts, <hi>Rules</hi> were invented,
that by them we might discern when Nature was
imitated, and how nearly. I have been forc'd
to recapitulate these things, because Mankind is
not more liable to deceit, than it is willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in a pleasing error strengthen'd by a long
habitude. The imitation of nature is therefore
justly constituted as the general, and indeed the
onely <hi>Rule</hi> of pleasing both in <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Aristotle</hi> tells us, that imitation pleases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it affords matter for a Reasoner to enquire
into the truth or falshood of Imitation, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
its likeness or unlikeness with the Original.
But by this Rule, every Speculation in Nature,
whose truth falls under the enquiry of a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>
must produce the same delight which is not
true; I should rather assign another reason. Truth
is the Object of our Understanding as Good is
of our Will: And the Understanding can no
more be delighted with a Lye, than the Will can
<pb n="xxxiij" facs="tcp:54218:19"/>
choose an apparent Evil. As Truth is the end
of all our Speculations, so the discovery of it is
the pleasure of them. And since a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Nature gives us pleasure, a lively imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, either in <hi>Poetry</hi> or <hi>Painting,</hi> must of
necessity produce a much greater. For <hi>both</hi> these
<hi>Arts</hi> as I said before, are not onely true imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature, but of the best Nature, of that
which is wrought up to a nobler pitch. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
us with Images more perfect than the Life in
any individual: and we have the pleasure to see
all the scatter'd Beauties of Nature united by a
<hi>happy Chymistry,</hi> without its deformities or faults.
They are imitations of the passions which always
move, and therefore consequently please: for
without motion there can be no delight; which
cannot be consider'd, but as an active passion.
When we view these Elevated <hi>Idea's</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
the result of that view is Admiration, which is
always the cause of Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>This foregoing Remark, which gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why imitation pleases; was sent me by Mr.
<hi>Walter Moyle,</hi> a most ingenious young Gentleman,
conversant in all the Studies of Humanity, much
above his years. He had also furnish'd me (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my request) with all the particular
passages in <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> which are us'd
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:54218:20"/>
by them to explain the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> by that of
<hi>Painting:</hi> which if ever I have time to retouch
this <hi>Essay,</hi> shall be inserted in their places. Having
thus shewn that Imitation pleases, and why it
pleases in <hi>both these Arts,</hi> it follows that some
<hi>Rules</hi> of Imitation are necessary to obtain the
end: for without <hi>Rules</hi> there can be no <hi>Art;</hi> any
more than there can be a <hi>House</hi> without a <hi>Door</hi> to
conduct you into it. The principal parts of
<hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> next follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Invention</hi> is the first part, and absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to them both: yet no <hi>Rule</hi> ever was or ever
can be given how to compass it. A happy <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
is the gift of Nature: it depends on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

Without <hi>Invention</hi> a <hi>Painter</hi> is but a <hi>Copier,</hi> and a
<hi>Poet</hi> but a <hi>Plagiary</hi> of others. <hi>Both</hi> are allow'd
sometimes to <hi>copy</hi> and <hi>translate;</hi> but as our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
tells you that is not the best part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:54218:20"/>
                     <hi>Imitatours are but a Servile kind of Cattle,</hi>
says the <hi>Poet;</hi> or at best, the Keepers of Cattle
for other men; they have nothing which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
their own; that is a sufficient mortification
for me while I am translating <hi>Virgil.</hi> But to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
the best Authour is a kind of praise, if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it as I ought. As a <hi>Copy</hi> after <hi>Raphael</hi> is
more to be commended, than an <hi>Original</hi> of any
indifferent <hi>Painter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this head of <hi>Invention</hi> is plac'd the <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Work,</hi> to put all things in a beautifull
order and harmony; that the whole may be of a
piece. The <hi>Compositions</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi> shou'd be
conformable to the Text of <hi>Ancient Authours,</hi> to
the Customs, and the Times. And this is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same in <hi>Poetry; Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> are to
be our guides in the <hi>Epique; Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
in <hi>Tragedy:</hi> in all things we are to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Customs, and the Times of those Persons
and Things which we represent. Not to make
new <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Drama,</hi> as <hi>Lopez de Vega</hi> has
attempted unsuccessfully to do; but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to follow our Masters, who understood Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
better than we. But if the Story which we
treat be modern, we are to vary the Customs,
according to the Time and the Country where
the Scene of Action lies: for this is still to imitate
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:54218:21"/>
Nature, which is always the same, though in a
different dress.</p>
                  <p>As in the Composition of a <hi>Picture,</hi> the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is to take care that nothing enter into it, which
is not proper, or convenient to the Subject; so
likewise is the <hi>Poet</hi> to reject all incidents which
are foreign to his <hi>Poem,</hi> and are naturally no parts
of it: they are <hi>Wenns,</hi> and other <hi>Excrescences,</hi>
which belong not to the Body, but deform it.
no person, no incident in the <hi>Piece,</hi> or in the
<hi>Play,</hi> but must be of use to carry on the <hi>main
Design.</hi> All things else are like six fingers to the
hand; when Nature which is superfluous in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
can do her work with five. A <hi>Painter</hi> must
reject all trifling Ornaments, so must a <hi>Poet</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
all tedious, and unnecessary Descriptions.
A Robe which is too heavy, is less an Ornament
than a Burthen.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Poetry Horace</hi> calls these things, <hi>Versus ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
rerum, nugaeque canorae;</hi> these are also the
<hi>lucus &amp; ara Dianae,</hi> which he mentions in the
same <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi> But since there must be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
both in <hi>Painting and Poetry,</hi> if they are
not necessary, they must at least be decent: that
is, in their due place, and but moderately us'd.
The <hi>Painter</hi> is not to take so much pains about
the Drapery as about the Face, where the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="xxxvij" facs="tcp:54218:21"/>
resemblance lies: neither is the <hi>Poet</hi> who is
working up a passion, to make <hi>similes</hi> which will
certainly make it languish. My <hi>Montezuma</hi> dies
with a fine one in his mouth: but it is ambitious
and out of season. When there are more Figures
in a Picture than are necessary, or at least orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
our <hi>Authour</hi> calls them <hi>Figures to be lett:</hi>
because the Picture has no use of them. So I have
seen in some <hi>modern Plays</hi> above twenty <hi>Actours;</hi>
when the Action has not requir'd half the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
In the principal Figures of a <hi>Picture,</hi> the
<hi>Painter</hi> is to employ the sinews of his Art, for in
them consists the principal beauty of his Work.
<hi>Our Authour</hi> saves me the comparison with <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
for he says that herein he is to imitate the <hi>Tragique
Poet,</hi> who employs his utmost force in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wherein consists the height and beauty of the
Action. <hi>Du Fresnoy,</hi> whom I follow, makes <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
or <hi>Drawing</hi> the second part of <hi>Painting:</hi> But
the Rules which he gives concerning the <hi>Posture of
the Figures,</hi> are almost wholly proper to <hi>that Art;</hi>
and admit not any <hi>comparison</hi> that I know with
<hi>Poetry.</hi> The <hi>Posture of a Poetique Figure</hi> is as I
conceive, the <hi>Description</hi> of his <hi>Heroes</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of such or such an Action: as of <hi>Achilles</hi>
just in the act of killing <hi>Hector:</hi> or of <hi>Aeneas</hi> who
has <hi>Turnus</hi> under him. Both the <hi>Poet</hi> and the
<pb n="xxxviij" facs="tcp:54218:22"/>
                     <hi>Painter</hi> vary the <hi>Postures</hi> according to the Action,
or Passion which they represent of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But all must be great and gracefull in them.
The same <hi>Aeneas</hi> must be drawn a Suppliant
to <hi>Dido</hi> with respect in his Gestures, and humility
in his Eyes: But when he is forc'd in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to kill <hi>Lausus,</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> shows him compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate,
and tempering the severity of his looks
with a reluctance to the Action, which he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perform. He has pity on his Beauty, and
his Youth; and is loath to destroy such a Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of Nature. He considers <hi>Lausus</hi> rescuing
his Father at the hazard of his own life; as an
Image of himself when he took <hi>Anchises</hi> on his
Shoulders, and bore him safe through the rage of
the Fire, and the opposition of his Enemies. And
therefore in the posture of a retiring Man, who
avoids the Combat, he stretches out his Arm in
sign of peace, with his right Foot drawn a little
back, and his Breast bending inward, more like
an Oratour than a Souldier; and seems to disswade
the Young man from pulling on his destiny, by
attempting more than he was able to perform:
take the passage as I have thus translated it.
<q>
                        <l>Shouts of Applause ran ringing through the Field,</l>
                        <l>To see the Son, the vanquish'd Father shield:</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:54218:22"/>All, fir'd with noble Emulation, strive;</l>
                        <l>And with a storm of Darts to distance drive</l>
                        <l>The <hi>Trojan</hi> Chief; who held at Bay, from far</l>
                        <l>On his <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Orb, sustain'd the War.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Aeneas</hi> thus'o erwhelm'd on every side,</l>
                        <l>Their first Assault undaunted did abide;</l>
                        <l>And thus to <hi>Lausus,</hi> loud with friendly threatning cry'd,</l>
                        <l>Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage</l>
                        <l>In rash attempts beyond thy tender Age,</l>
                        <l>Betray'd by pious love?</l>
                     </q>
And afterwards.
<q>
                        <l>He griev'd, he wept, the Sight an Image brought</l>
                        <l>Of his own Filial Love; a sadly pleasing thought.</l>
                     </q>
But beside the Outlines of the Posture, the <hi>Design</hi>
of the <hi>Picture</hi> comprehends in the next place the
forms of Faces which are to be different: and so
in a <hi>Poem,</hi> or a <hi>Play,</hi> must the several <hi>Characters</hi>
of the Persons be distinguish'd from each other.
I knew a <hi>Poet,</hi> whom out of respect I will not
name, who being too witty himself, cou'd draw
nothing but Wits in a <hi>Comedy</hi> of his: even his
Fools were infected with the Disease of <hi>their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</hi>
They overflow'd with smart Reperties,
and were only distinguish'd from the intended
Wits by being call'd <hi>Coxcombs;</hi> though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
not so scandalous a Name. Another, who
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:54218:23"/>
had a great <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Tragedy,</hi> following the fury
of his natural temper, made every Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
too in his <hi>Plays</hi> stark raging mad: there was
not a sober person to be had for love or money.
All was tempestuous and blustering; Heaven and
Earth were coming together at every word; a
meer Hurrican from the beginning to the end,
and every Actour seem'd to be hastning on the
Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let every Member be made for its own Head,</hi> says
our <hi>Authour,</hi> not a wither'd Hand to a young
Face. So in the Persons of a <hi>Play,</hi> whatsoever is
said or done by any of them, must be consistent
with the manners which the <hi>Poet</hi> has given them
distinctly: and even the Habits must be proper
to the degrees, and humours of the Persons as
well as in a <hi>Picture.</hi> He who enter'd in the first
Act, a Young man like <hi>Pericles</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
must not be in danger in the fifth Act, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Incest with his Daughter: nor an Usurer,
without great probability and causes of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
be turn'd into a <hi>Cutting Moorcraft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not satisfy'd that the comparison betwixt
the <hi>two Arts</hi> in the last <hi>Paragraph</hi> is altogether so
just as it might have been; but I am sure of this
which follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xli" facs="tcp:54218:23"/>
                     <hi>The principal Figure of the Subject must appear in
the midst of the Picture, under the principal Light to
distinguish it from the rest which are onely its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</hi>
Thus in a <hi>Tragedy</hi> or an <hi>Epique Poem,</hi> the
<hi>Hero</hi> of the <hi>Piece</hi> must be advanc'd foremost to
the view of the <hi>Reader</hi> or <hi>Spectator;</hi> He must
out-shine the rest of all the <hi>Characters;</hi> He must
appear the <hi>Prince</hi> of them, like the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican
System,</hi> encompass'd with the less noble
<hi>Planets.</hi> Because the <hi>Hero</hi> is the Centre of the
main Action; all the Lines from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
tend to him alone: He is the chief object of
Pity in the <hi>Drama,</hi> and of <hi>Admiration</hi> in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique
Poem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in a Picture, besides the principal Figures
which compose it, and are plac'd in the midst
of it, there are less Grouppes or Knots of Figures
dispos'd at proper distances, which are parts of
the Piece, and seem to carry on the same Design
in a more inferiour manner. So in <hi>Epique Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
there are <hi>Episodes,</hi> and a <hi>Chorus</hi> in <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
which are Members of the Action, as growing
out of it, not inserted into it. Such in the <hi>ninth
Book</hi> of the <hi>Eneids</hi> is the Episode of <hi>Nisus</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryalus:</hi>
the adventure belongs to them alone; they
alone are the Objects of Compassion and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but their business which they carry on,
<pb n="xlij" facs="tcp:54218:24"/>
is the general Concernment of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp,
then beleaguer'd by <hi>Turnus</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> as
the <hi>Christians</hi> were lately by the <hi>Turks.</hi> They
were to advertise the chief Hero of the Distresses
of his Subjects occasion'd by his Absence, to crave
his Succour, and sollicite him to hasten his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Tragedy was at first nothing but
a <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Singers,</hi> afterwards one <hi>Actor</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd,
which was the <hi>Poet</hi> himself, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the people with a discourse in Verse, betwixt
the Pauses of the Singing. This succeeding with
the People, more <hi>Actors</hi> were added to make the
variety the greater; and in process of time, the
<hi>Chorus</hi> onely sung betwixt the <hi>Acts;</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphaeus,</hi>
or Chief of them spoke for the rest, as an
<hi>Actor</hi> concern'd in the business of the <hi>Play.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Tragedy</hi> was perfected by degrees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arriv'd at that Perfection, the Painters might
probably take the hint from thence, of adding
Grouppes to their <hi>Pictures.</hi> But as a good <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
may be without a Grouppe; so a good <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>
may subsist without a <hi>Chorus:</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any reasons which have been given by <hi>Dacier</hi>
to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Racine</hi> has indeed us'd it in his <hi>Esther,</hi>
but not that he found any necessity of it, as
<pb n="xliij" facs="tcp:54218:24"/>
the <hi>French Critique</hi> would insinuate. The <hi>Chorus</hi>
at St. <hi>Cyr,</hi> was onely to give the young Ladies an
occasion of entertaining the <hi>King</hi> with vocal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and of commending their own Voices. The
<hi>Play</hi> it self was never intended for the publick
<hi>Stage,</hi> nor without disparagement to the learned
<hi>Author,</hi> could possibly have succeeded there, and
much less the Translation of it here. Mr. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly,</hi>
when we read it together was of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this, or rather I of his; for it becomes me
so to speak of so excellent a <hi>Poet,</hi> and so great a
<hi>Iudge.</hi> But since I am in this place, as <hi>Virgil</hi> says,
<hi>Spatiis exclusus iniquis;</hi> that is, shorten'd in my
time, I will give no other reason, than that it is
impracticable on our <hi>Stage.</hi> A new <hi>Theatre</hi>
much more ample and much deeper must be
made for that purpose, besides the cost of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forty or fifty Habits, which is an expence
too large, to be supply'd by a <hi>Company of Actors.</hi>
'Tis true, I should not be sorry to see a <hi>Chorus</hi>
on a <hi>Theatre,</hi> more than as large and as deep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as ours, built and adorn'd at a <hi>King</hi>'s
Charges, and on that condition, and another,
which is, That my Hands were not bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, as now they are; I should not despair
of making such a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> as might be both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
and delightfull, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:54218:25"/>To make a <hi>Sketch,</hi> or a more perfect <hi>Model</hi> of
a <hi>Picture,</hi> is in the Language of <hi>Poets,</hi> to draw
up the <hi>Scenary</hi> of a <hi>Play,</hi> and the reason is the
same for both; to guide the Undertaking, and
to preserve the Remembrance of such things,
whose Natures are difficult to retain.</p>
                  <p>To avoid Absurdities and Incongruities, is the
same Law establish'd for both <hi>Arts.</hi> The Painter is
not to paint a Cloud at the Bottom of a <hi>Picture,</hi>
but in the uppermost parts: nor the <hi>Poet</hi> to place
what is proper to the end or middle in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a <hi>Poem.</hi> I might enlarge on this, but
there are few <hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Painters,</hi> who can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to sin so grosly against the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi>
and of <hi>Art.</hi> I remember onely one <hi>Play,</hi> and
for once I will call it by its name, <hi>The Slighted
Maid:</hi> where there is nothing in the <hi>First Act,</hi> but
what might have been said or done in the <hi>Fifth;</hi>
nor any thing in the <hi>Midst,</hi> which might not have
been plac'd as well in the <hi>Beginning</hi> or the <hi>End.</hi> To
express the Passions which are seated in the Heart
by outward Signs, is one great Precept of the
<hi>Painters,</hi> and very difficult to perform. In <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
the same Passions and Motions of the Mind
are to be express'd; and in this consists the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Difficulty, as well as the Excellency of <hi>that
Art.</hi> This, says my <hi>Author,</hi> is the Gift of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
                     <pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:54218:25"/>
and to speak in the same <hi>Heathen Language,</hi>
we call it the Gift of our <hi>Apollo:</hi> not to be obtain'd
by Pains or Study, if we are not born to it. For
the Motions which are studied are never so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as those which break out in the height of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Passion. Mr. <hi>Otway</hi> possess'd this part as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
as any of the <hi>Ancients</hi> or <hi>Moderns.</hi> I will
not defend every thing in his <hi>Venice preserv'd;</hi> but
I must bear this testimony to his Memory, That
the <hi>Passions</hi> are truly touch'd in it, though perhaps
there is somewhat to be desir'd both in the Grounds
of them, and in the Height and Elegance of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but <hi>Nature</hi> is there which is the greatest Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Passions,</hi> says our Author, <hi>we must have
a very great regard to the quality of the Persons who
are actually possess'd with them.</hi> The Joy of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
for the news of a Victory, must not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
like the Ecstasy of a <hi>Harlequin</hi> on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of a Letter from his Mistress; this is so
much the same in <hi>both the Arts,</hi> that it is no longer
a <hi>Comparison.</hi> What he says of <hi>Face-painting,</hi> or
the <hi>Protrait</hi> of any one particular Person; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the likeness is also as applicable to <hi>Poetry.</hi>
In the <hi>character</hi> of an <hi>Hero,</hi> as well as in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Figure, there is a better or worse likeness to
be taken; the better is a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> if it be not
false, and the worse is a <hi>Libel: Sophocles.</hi> says <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
                     <pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:54218:26"/>
always drew men as they ought to be, that
is better than they were; another, whose name I
have forgotten, drew them worse than naturally
they were. <hi>Euripides</hi> alter'd nothing in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
but made them such as they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>History, Epique Poetry</hi> or <hi>Tradition.</hi> Of
the three, the draught of <hi>Sophocles</hi> is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by <hi>Aristotle.</hi> I have follow'd it in that
part of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> which I writ, though perhaps I
have made him too good a man. But my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> though they are
favourable to them, have nothing of outrageous
<hi>Panegyrick,</hi> their Passions were their own, and
such as were given them by <hi>History,</hi> onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
of them were cast into <hi>Shadows,</hi> that they
might be Objects of Compassion; whereas if
I had chosen a <hi>Noon-day Light</hi> for them, somewhat
must have been discover'd, which would rather
have mov'd our Hatred than our Pity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gothique</hi> manner, and the barbarous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are to be avoided in a <hi>Picture,</hi> are
just the same with those in an ill order'd <hi>Play.</hi> For
example, our <hi>English Tragicomedy</hi> must be confess'd
to be wholly <hi>Gothique,</hi> notwithstanding the Success
which it has found upon our <hi>Theatre,</hi> and in the
<hi>Pastor Fido</hi> of <hi>Guarini;</hi> even though <hi>Corisca</hi> and
the Satyr contribute somewhat to the main Action.

Du Fresnoy</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Figures of the

their Face and Bodies all turn'd the same way; but
must contrast each other by their several positions.</hi> Thus
in a <hi>Play,</hi> some characters must be rais'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
other; and to set them off the better, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old Maxim, <hi>Contraria juxta se po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita,

the Usurer is set to confront the Prodigal. Thus

                  </p>
                  <p>I am now come, though with the omission of
many <hi>Likenesses,</hi> to the third Part of <hi>Painting,</hi>
which is call'd the <hi>Cromatique</hi> or <hi>Colouring. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi>
and all that belongs to words, is that in
a <hi>Poem,</hi> which <hi>Colouring</hi> is in a <hi>Picture.</hi> The
<hi>Colours</hi> well chosen in their proper places, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Lights and Shadows which belong
to them, lighten the Design, and make it pleasing
<pb n="xlviij" facs="tcp:54218:27"/>
to the Eye. The Words, the Expressions, the
Tropes and Figures, the Versification, and all
the other Elegancies of Sound, as Cadences,
Turns of Words upon the Thought, and many
other things which are all parts of expression,
perform exactly the same Office both in <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique</hi>
and <hi>Epique Poetry.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> calls Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring,
<hi>Lena Sororis,</hi> in plain English, <hi>The Bawd
of her Sister</hi> the <hi>Design</hi> or <hi>Drawing:</hi> she cloaths,
she dresses her up, she paints her, she makes her
appear more lovely than naturally she is, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
for the <hi>Design,</hi> and makes Lovers for her.
For the <hi>Design</hi> of it self, is onely so many naked
lines. Thus in <hi>Poetry,</hi> the <hi>Expression</hi> is that
which charms the <hi>Reader,</hi> and beautifies the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which is onely the <hi>Out-lines</hi> of the Fables.
'Tis true, the <hi>Design</hi> must of it self be good; if
it be vicious or (in one word) unpleasing, the
cost of <hi>Colouring</hi> is thrown away upon it. 'Tis
an ugly woman in a rich Habit set out with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
nothing can become her: but granting the
<hi>Design</hi> to be moderately good, 'tis like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Complexion with indifferent Features; the
white and red well mingled on the Face, make
what was before but passable, appear beautifull.
<hi>Operum Colores</hi> is the very word which <hi>Horace</hi> uses,
to signify Words and elegant Expressions, of which
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:54218:27"/>
he himself was so great a Master in his <hi>Odes.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Ancients, Zeuxis</hi> was most famous
for his <hi>Colouring.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Moderns, Titian</hi>
and <hi>Correggio.</hi> Of the two <hi>Ancient Epique Poets,</hi>
who have so far excell'd all the <hi>Moderns,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
and <hi>Design</hi> were the particular Talents of
<hi>Homer. Virgil</hi> must yield to him in both, for
the <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Latine</hi> was borrowed from the
<hi>Grecian:</hi> But the <hi>dictio Virgiliana,</hi> the expression
of <hi>Virgil;</hi> his <hi>Colouring</hi> was incomparably the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in that I have always endeavour'd to
copy him. Most of the <hi>Pedants</hi> I know main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the contrary, and will have <hi>Homer</hi> excell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in this part. But of all people, as they are
the most ill manner'd, so they are the worst
Judges; even of words which are their Province,
they seldom know more than the <hi>Grammatical</hi>
construction, unless they are born with a <hi>Poetical
Genius;</hi> which is a rare Portion amongst them.
Yet some I know may stand excepted; and such
I honour. <hi>Virgil</hi> is so exact in every word, that
none can be chang'd but for a worse: nor any
one remov'd from its place, but the harmony will
be alter'd. He pretends sometimes to trip; but
'tis onely to make you think him in danger of a
fall, when he is most secure. Like a skilfull
dancer on the Ropes (if you will pardon the
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:54218:28"/>
meanness of the similitude) who slips willingly
and makes a seeming stumble, that you may
think him in great hazard of breaking his neck;
while at the same time he is onely giving you a
proof of his dexterity. My late Lord <hi>Roscomon</hi> was
often pleas'd with this reflection, and with the
examples of it in this admirable <hi>Author.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not leisure to run through the whole
<hi>Comparison</hi> of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> with <hi>Tropes</hi> and
<hi>Figures;</hi> yet I cannot but take notice of <hi>Metaphors,</hi>
which like them have power to lessen or greaten
any thing. <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>glowing Colours</hi> are the just
resemblances of <hi>bold Metaphors,</hi> but both must be
judiciously apply'd; for there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
daring and fool-hardiness. <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
often ventur'd them too far, our <hi>Virgil</hi> never.
But the great defect of the <hi>Pharsalia</hi> and the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais</hi>
was in the <hi>Design;</hi> if that had been more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
we might have forgiven many of their bold
strokes in the <hi>Colouring;</hi> or at least excus'd them:
yet some of them are such as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> or <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
could not have defended. <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he could
have seen the first Verses of the <hi>Sylvae,</hi> would have
thought <hi>Statius</hi> mad in his sustian Description of
the <hi>Statue</hi> on the <hi>brazen Horse.</hi> But <hi>that Poet</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a Foam at his setting out, even before the
Motion of the Race had warm'd him. The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:54218:28"/>
of <hi>Virgil,</hi> whom he read it seems to little
purpose, might have shown him the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt,
<hi>Arma virum<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> tonanti Progeniem.</hi> But <hi>Virgil</hi>
knew how to rise by degrees in his expressions:
<hi>Statius</hi> was in his towring heights at the first stretch
of his Pinions. The description of his running
Horse just starting in the Funeral Games for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemorus,</hi>
though the Verses are wonderfully fine,
are the true Image of their Author.
<q>
                        <l>Stare adeo nescit, pereunt vestigia mille</l>
                        <l>Ante fugam; absentem<expan>
                              <am>

                     </q>
Which would cost me an hour, if I had the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to translate them, there is so much of Beauty
in the Original. <hi>Virgil,</hi> as he better knew his
<hi>Colours,</hi> so he knew better how and where to place
them. In as much hast as I am, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
giving one example. 'Tis said of him,
That he read the <hi>Second, Fourth</hi> and <hi>Sixth Books</hi>
of his <hi>Aeneids</hi> to <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> In the <hi>Sixth,</hi>
(which we are sure he read, because we know
<hi>Octavia</hi> was present, who rewarded him so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
for the twenty Verses which were made in
honour of her deceas'd Son <hi>Marcellus</hi>) in this sixth
Book I say, the <hi>Poet</hi> speaking of <hi>Misenus</hi> the
Trumpeter, says,
<q>
                        <pb n="lij" facs="tcp:54218:29"/>
                        <l>—Quo non praestantior alter,</l>
                        <l>Aere ciere viros,—</l>
                     </q>
And broke off in the <hi>Hemystick</hi> or midst of the
Verse: but in the very reading siez'd as it were
with a <hi>divine Fury,</hi> he made up the latter part of
the <hi>Hemystick,</hi> with these following words;
<q>—Martem<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> accendere cantu.</q>
How <hi>warm,</hi> nay how <hi>glowing a Colouring</hi> is this!
In the beginning of the Verse, the word <hi>Aes,</hi> or
Brass, was taken for a Trumpet, because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stument
was made of that Metal, which of it self
was fine; but in the latter end, which was made
<hi>ex tempore,</hi> you see three Metaphors, <hi>Martemque,
—accendere,—cantu.</hi> Good Heavens! how the
plain sence is rais'd by the Beauty of the words.
But this was Happiness, the former might be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judgment: this was the <hi>curiosa felicitas,</hi> which
<hi>Petronius</hi> attributes to <hi>Horace;</hi> 'tis the Pencil thrown
luckily full upon the Horses mouth to express the
Foam which the <hi>Painter</hi> with all his skill could
not perform without it. These hits of words a
true <hi>Poet</hi> often finds, as I may say, without
seeking: but he knows their value when he finds
them, and is infinitely pleas'd. A <hi>bad Poet</hi> may
<pb n="liij" facs="tcp:54218:29"/>
sometimes light on them, but he discerns not a
<hi>Diamond</hi> from a <hi>Bristol <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>stone;</hi> and would have
been of the <hi>Cocks</hi> mind in <hi>Aesop,</hi> a <hi>Grain of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
would have pleas'd him better than the <hi>Iewel.</hi>
The <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> which belongs to <hi>Colouring,</hi>
put me in mind of that Verse in <hi>Horace, Hoc a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
obscurum, vult hoc sub luce videri:</hi> some parts
of a <hi>Poem</hi> require to be amply written, and with
all the force and elegance of Words: others must
be cast into Shadows; that is, pass'd over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or but faintly touch'd. This belongs
wholly to the Judgment of the <hi>Poet</hi> and the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
The most beautifull parts of the <hi>Picture</hi> and
the <hi>Poem</hi> must be the most finish'd, the Colours
and Words most chosen; many things in both
which are not deserving of this care, must be shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
off; content with vulgar expressions and those
very short, and left as in a shadow to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the <hi>Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have the Proverb, <hi>manum de tabulâ,</hi> from
the <hi>Painters;</hi> which signifies, to know when to
give over, and to lay by the Pencil. Both <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Virgil</hi> practis'd this <hi>Precept</hi> wonderfully
well, but <hi>Virgil</hi> the better of the two. <hi>Homer</hi>
knew that when <hi>Hector</hi> was slain, <hi>Troy</hi> was as
good as already taken; therefore he concludes his
Action there. For what follows in the Funerals
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:54218:30"/>
of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the redemption of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is not (properly speaking) a part of the main
<hi>Action.</hi> But <hi>Virgil</hi> concludes with the death of
<hi>Turnus:</hi> sor after that difficulty was remov'd, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
might marry and establish the Trojans when
he pleas'd. <hi>This Rule</hi> I had before my Eyes in the
conclusion of the <hi>Spanish Fryar,</hi> when the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was made, that the King was living, which
was the knot of the <hi>Play</hi> unty'd, the rest is shut
up in the compass of some few lines, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then hinder'd the Happiness of <hi>Torismond</hi> and
<hi>Leonora.</hi> The faults of that <hi>Drama</hi> are in the
kind of it, which is <hi>Tragi comedy.</hi> But it was
given to the people; and I never writ any thing
for my self but <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Remark</hi> I must acknowledge is not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the <hi>Colouring</hi> as the <hi>Design;</hi> but it will hold
for both. As the words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are evidently shown
to be the cloathing of the Thought, in the same
sense as Colours are the cloathing of the Design,
so the <hi>Painter</hi> and the <hi>Poet</hi> ought to judge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
when the Colouring and Expressions are
perfect, and then to think their work is truly
finish'd. <hi>Apelles</hi> said of <hi>Protogenes, That he
knew not when to give over.</hi> A work may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
as well as under-wrought: too much
Labour often takes away the Spirit by adding to
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:54218:30"/>
the polishing; so that there remains nothing but a
dull correctness, a piece without any considerable
Faults, but with few Beauties; for when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are drawn off, there is nothing but a <hi>caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum.
Statius</hi> never thought an expression could
be bold enough; and if a bolder could be found
he rejected the first. <hi>Virgil</hi> had Judgment enough
to know daring was necessary; but he knew the
difference betwixt a <hi>glowing Colour</hi> and a <hi>glaring:</hi>
as when he compar'd the shocking of the Fleets
at <hi>Actium</hi> to the justling of <hi>Islands</hi> rent from their
Foundations, and meeting in the <hi>Ocean.</hi> He knew
the comparison was forc'd beyond Nature and
rais'd too high: he therefore softens the <hi>Metaphor</hi>
with a <hi>Credas.</hi> You would almost believe, that
Mountains or Islands rush'd against each other.

when I tell them, how short a time it cost
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:54218:31"/>
me, may make me the same answer, which my

a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> said it was written in three weeks;
How the Devil could he be so long about it? For
that <hi>Poem</hi> was infamously bad; and I doubt this
<hi>Parallel</hi> is little better; and then the shortness of
the time is so far from being a Commendation,
that it is scarcely an Excuse. But if I have really
drawn a Portrait to the Knees, or an half length
with a tolerable Likeness, then I may plead with
some Justice for my self, that the rest is left to
the Imagination. Let some better Artist pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himself of a deeper Canvas, and taking these
hints which I have given, set the Figure on its
Legs, and finish it in the <hi>Invention, Design</hi> and
<hi>Colouring.</hi>

PREFACE
OF THE
French Author.</head>
                  <p>AMong all the beautiful and delightful
<hi>Arts,</hi> that of <hi>Painting</hi> has always
found the most <hi>Lovers;</hi> the number
of them almost including all <hi>Mankind.</hi>
Of whom great multitudes are daily found, who
value themselves on the knowledge of it; either
because they keep company with <hi>Painters,</hi> or that
they have seen good <hi>Pieces;</hi> or lastly, because
their <hi>Gusto</hi> is naturally good. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that <hi>Knowledge</hi> of theirs (if we may
so call it) is so very superficial, and so ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it is impossible for them to describe in
what consists the beauty of those Works which they
admire, or the faults which are in the greatest
<pb n="lviij" facs="tcp:54218:32"/>
part of those which they condemn: and truly 'tis
not hard to find, that this proceeds from no other
cause, than that they are not furnish'd with <hi>Rules</hi>
by which to judge, nor have any solid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are as so many Lights set up to clear
their understanding and lead them to an entire
and certain knowledge. I think it superfluous
to prove that this is necessary to the knowledge of
<hi>Painting.</hi> 'Tis sufficient, that <hi>Painting</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
for an <hi>Art;</hi> for that being granted
it follows without dispute, that no <hi>Arts</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their <hi>Precepts.</hi> I shall satisfy my self with
telling you, that this little <hi>Treatise</hi> will furnish
you with infallible Rules of judging truly: since
they are not onely founded upon right <hi>Reason</hi>
but upon the best <hi>Pieces</hi> of the best <hi>Masters,</hi> which
our <hi>Author</hi> hath carefully examin'd during the
space of more than thirty years; and on which he
has made all the reflections which are necessary to
render this <hi>Treatise</hi> worthy of Posterity: which
though little in bulk, yet contains most judicious
Remarks, and suffers nothing to escape that is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to the Subject which it handles. If you
will please to read it with attention, you will
find it capable of giving the most nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
sort of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> not onely to the <hi>Lovers,</hi>
but even to the Professors of that <hi>Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="lix" facs="tcp:54218:32"/>It would be too long to tell you the particular
advantages which it has above all the <hi>Books</hi>
which hath appear'd before it in this kind: you
need onely to read it, and that will convince you
of this truth. All that I will allow my self to say,
is onely this, That there is not a word in it, which
carries not its weight; whereas in all others,
there are two considerable faults which lie open
to the sight, (<hi>viz</hi>) That <hi>saying too much, they
always say too little.</hi> I assure my self, that the
<hi>Reader</hi> will own 'tis a work of general profit, to
the <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> for their instruction how
to judge exactly; and with Knowledge of the Cause,
which they are to judge. And to the <hi>Painters</hi>
themselves, by removing their difficulties, that
they may work with pleasure; because they may
be in some manner certain that their Productions
are good. 'Tis to be used like <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Liquours,</hi> the less you drink of it at a time
'tis with the greater pleasure: <hi>read</hi> it often, and
but little at once, that you may digest it better;
and dwell particularly on those passages which
you find mark'd with an <hi>Asterism</hi>* For the
observations which follow such a <hi>Note,</hi> will give
you a clearer Light, on the matter which is there
treated. You will find them by the <hi>Numbers</hi>
which are on the side of the <hi>Translation,</hi> from five
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:54218:33"/>
to five <hi>Veres;</hi> by searching for the like <hi>Number</hi>
in the <hi>Remarks</hi> which are at the end of it, and
which are distinguish'd from each other by this
note ¶. You will find in the latter <hi>Pages</hi> of this
<hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> on those
<hi>Painters,</hi> who have acquir'd the greatest Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the World. Amongst whom, he was not
willing to comprehend those who are now living:
They are undoubtedly his, as being found among
his <hi>Papers</hi> written in his own hand.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Prose Translation</hi> which you will
find on the other side of the <hi>Latine Poem,</hi> I must
inform you on what occasion, and in what manner
it was perform'd. The <hi>Love</hi> which I had for <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
and the pleasure which I found in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of that noble <hi>Art,</hi> at my leisure hours, gave
me the desire of being acquainted with the late
Mr. <hi>du FRESNOY;</hi> who was generally reputed
to have a through <hi>knowledge</hi> of it. Our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
at length proceeded to that degree of
<hi>Intimacy;</hi> that he intrusted me with his <hi>Poem,</hi>
which he believ'd me capable both of <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
and <hi>translating;</hi> and accordingly desir'd
me to undertake it. The truth is, that we had
convers'd so often on that <hi>Subject,</hi> and he had
communicated his Thoughts of it so fully to me;
that I had not the least remaining difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:54218:33"/>
it. I undertook therefore to <hi>translate</hi> it,
and imploy'd my self in it with Pleasure, Care,
and Assiduity; after which, I put it into his
hands, and he alter'd in it what he pleas'd, till

gave his <hi>Consent</hi> that it should be publish'd:
but his <hi>Death</hi> preventing that <hi>Design,</hi> I thought
it a wrong to his <hi>Memory,</hi> to deprive Mankind
any longer of this <hi>Translation,</hi> which I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm to be done according to the true sence of
the <hi>Author,</hi> and to his liking: Since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
has given great <hi>Testimonies</hi> of his <hi>Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to many of his Friends, and they who were
acquainted with him, know his humour to be such,
that he wou'd never constrain himself so far, as to
<hi>commend</hi> what he did not really <hi>approve.</hi> I
thought my self oblig'd to say thus much, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the faithfulness of my <hi>Work,</hi> to those
who understand not the <hi>Latine:</hi> for as to those
who are conversant in both the <hi>tongues,</hi> I leave
them to make their own <hi>judgment</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remarks</hi> which I have added to his <hi>work,</hi>
are also wholly conformable to his <hi>opinions;</hi> and
I am certain that he wou'd not have disapprov'd
them. I have endeavour'd in them to <hi>explain</hi>
some of the most <hi>obscure passages,</hi> and those
which are most <hi>necessary</hi> to be <hi>understood;</hi> and

also to the narrowest compass I was able, that I
might not tire the patience of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and
that they might be read by all persons. But if it
happens, that they are not to the <hi>tast</hi> of some
<hi>Readers</hi> (as doubtless it will so fall out) I leave
them entirely to their own discretion, and shall
not be displeas'd that <hi>another hand</hi> shou'd suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

them, that in reading what I have written, they
will bring no particular <hi>gusto</hi> along with them,

                     </head>
                     <p>*PAinting and Poesy are two Sisters, which
are so like in all things,<note place="margin">The Passages which you see mark'd with an Asterism * are more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply explain'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</note> that they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
lend to each other both their
Name and Office. One is call'd a
dumb Poesy, and the other a speaking Picture.
The Poets have never said any thing but what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
they believ'd wou'd please the Ears. And it has
been the constant endeavour of the Painters to
give pleasure to the Eyes. In short, those things
which the Poets have thought unworthy of their
Pens, the Painters have judg'd to be unworthy
of their Pencils. * For both of them, that they
might contribute all within their power to the
sacred Honours of Religion, have rais'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
to Heaven, and, having found a free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into the Palace of Iove himself, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
the sight and conversation of the Gods;
whose Majesty they observe, and contemplate
the wonders of their Discourse; in order to relate
them to Mankind; whom at the same time they
inspire with those Coelestial flames, which shine
so gloriously in their Works. From Heaven they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54218:37"/>
take their passage through the world; and are
neither sparing of their pains nor of their study to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> collect whatsoever they find worthy of them.
* They dive (as I may say) into all past Ages;
and search their Histories, for Subjects which are
proper for their use: with care avoiding to treat
of any but those which, by their nobleness, or by
some remarkable accident, have deserv'd to be
consecrated to Eternity; whether on the Seas, or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Earth, or in the Heavens. And by this their
care and study it comes to pass, that the glory
of Heroes is not extinguish'd with their lives:
and that those admirable works, those prodigies
of skill, which even yet are the objects of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
are still preserv'd. *So much these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Arts have been always honour'd: and such
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> authority they preserve amongst Mankind. It
will not here be necessary to implore the succour
of Apollo, and the Muses: for the gracefulness of
the Discourse, or for the Cadence of the Verses:
which containing only Precepts, have not so
much need of Ornament, as of Perspicuity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> I pretend not in this Treatise to tye the hands
of Artists, whose skill consists only in a certain
practice, or manner which they have affected;
and made of it as it were a Common Road.
Neither wou'd I stifle the Genius by a jumbled
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54218:38"/>
heap of Rules: nor extinguish the fire of a vein
which is lively and abundant. But rather to
make this my business, that Art being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the knowledge of things, may at length
pass into Nature by slow degrees; and so in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
of time may be sublim'd into a pure Genius
which is capable of choosing judiciously what is
true; and of distinguishing betwixt the beauties
of Nature, and that which is low and mean in
her; and that this Original Genius by long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and customs, may perfectly possess all the
Rules and Secrets of that Art.</p>
                     <p>* The principal and most important part of
Painting,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Precept I.</hi> Of what is Beautifull.</note> is to find out and thoroughly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what Nature has made most beautifull,
and most proper to this Art; * and that a choice
of it may be made according to the gust and
manner of the Ancients, * without which all is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
nothing but a blind, and rash barbarity; which
rejects what is most beautifull, and seems with an
audacious insolence to despise an Art, of which
it is wholly ignorant; which has occasion'd
these words of the Ancients: <hi>That no man is so bold,
so rash, and so overweening of his own works, as an
ill Painter, and a bad Poet, who are not conscious to
themselves of their own Ignorance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54218:39"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>* We love what we understand; we desire
what we love; we pursue the enjoyment of those
things which we desire; and arrive at last to the
possession of what we have pursu'd, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
persist in our Design. In the mean time,
we ought not to expect that blind Fortune shou'd
infallibly throw into our hands those Beauties:
For though we may light by chance on some
which are true and natural, yet they may prove
either not to be decent or not to be ornamental.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Because it is not sufficient to imitate Nature in
every circumstance, dully, and as it were literally,
and meanly; but it becomes a Painter to take
what is most beautifull, * as being the Soveraign
Judge of his own Art; and that by the progress
which he has made, he may understand how to
correct his errours, and * permit no transient
Beauties to escape his observation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>* In the same manner, that bare practice,<note place="margin">Of Theory, and Practice.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of the Lights of Art, is always subject to
fall into a precipice like a blind Traveller, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> being able to produce any thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to a solid reputation: So the speculative
part of Painting, without the assistance of manual
operation, can never attain to that perfection
which is its object: But sloathfully languishes as
in a Prison: for it was not with his Tongue that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54218:40"/>
                        <hi>Apelles</hi> perform'd his Noble Works. Therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/>
though there are many things in Painting, of
which no precise rules are to be given (* because
the greatest Beauties cannot always be express'd
for want of terms) yet I shall not omit to give
some Precepts which I have selected from among
the most considerable which we have receiv'd
from Nature, that exact School-mistress, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
examin'd her most secret recesses, as well as
* those Master pieces of Antiquity, which were
the first Examples of this Art: And, 'tis by this
means that the mind, and the natural disposition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/>
are to be cultivated; and that Science perfects
Genius, * and also moderates that fury of the
fancy, which cannot contain it self within the
bounds of Reason; but often carries a man into
dangerous extremes: <hi>For there is a mean in all
things; and a certain measure, wherein the good and
the beautifull consist; and out of which they never
can depart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being premis'd, the next thing is to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
choice of * a Subject beautifull and noble;<note place="margin">Concerning the Subject.</note>
which being of it self capable of all the charms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/>
and graces, that Colours, and the elegance of
Design can possibly give, shall afterwards afford,
to a perfect and consummate Art, an ample field
of matter wherein to expatiate it self; to exert all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54218:41"/>
its power, and to produce somewhat to the sight
which is excellent, judicious, * and well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd;
and at the same time proper to instruct,
and to enlighten the Understanding.</p>
                     <p>Thus at length I enter into the Subject-matter
of my Discourse; and at first find only a bare
strain'd Canvass: * on which the whole Machine
(as it may be call'd) of the Picture is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
and the imagination of a powerfull, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> easy Genius; * which is what we properly call
<hi>Invention.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>* INVENTION is a kind of Muse,<note place="margin">Invention the first part of Painting.</note>
which being possess'd of the other advantages
common to her Sisters; and being warm'd by
the fire of <hi>Apollo,</hi> is rais'd higher than the rest,
and shines with a more glorious, and brighter
flame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>* 'Tis the business of a Painter,<note place="margin">The Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the whole Work.</note> in his choice

are to enter into the whole; taking from each of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="80"/> them, that which will most conduce to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a beautifull Effect.</p>
                     <p>

                        </gap>orces of her Art in the main
Action.</p>
                     <p>* This part of Painting, so rarely met with,
and so difficult to be found, is neither to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by pains or study, nor by the Precepts or
Counsels of any Master. For they alone who
have been inspir'd at their birth with some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Heavenly fire * which was stollen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="90"/>
by <hi>Prometheus,</hi> are capable of receiving so divine
a present. As the Proverb tells us, * <hi>that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
not to every one to see</hi> Corinth.</p>
                     <p>Painting first appear'd in <hi>Egypt:</hi> but wholly
different from the truth, till having travell'd into
<hi>Greece,</hi> and being cultivated by the Study, and
sublime Genius of that Nation, *it arriv'd at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="95"/>
length to that height of perfection, that it seem'd
to surpass even Original nature.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the Academies, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by the rare Genius of those Great men,
these four are reckon'd as the principal: namely,
the <hi>Athenian School,</hi> that of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> that of <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
and that of <hi>Corinth.</hi> These were little different
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54218:43"/>
from each other, onely in the <hi>manner</hi> of their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="100"/> work; as it may be seen by the <hi>Ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
which are the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Beauty,</hi> and to which
succeeding Ages have nothing that is equal:
* Though they are not very much inferiour
either in Science, or in the manner of their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>* A Posture therefore must be chosen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their gusto:<note place="margin">Design, the second part of Painting.</note> * The Parts of it must be
great * and large, * unequal in their position,
so that those which are before must contrast (or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="105"/> oppose) those others which are hindermost, and
all of them be equally balanc'd on their Centre.</p>
                     <p>* The Parts must have their out-lines in waves
resembling flames, or the gliding of a Snake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground: They must be smooth, they
must be great, they must be almost imperceptible
to the touch, and even, without either Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="110"/> or Cavities. They must be drawn from far,
and without breaks, to avoid the multiplicity of
lines. Let the Muscles be well inserted and
bound together * according to the knowledge of
them which is given us by <hi>Anatomy.</hi> Let them
be * design'd after the manner of the <hi>Grecians:</hi>
and let them appear but little, according to
what we see in the <hi>Ancient Figures.</hi> In fine, * let
there be a perfect relation betwixt the parts and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54218:44"/>
the whole, that they may be entirely of a piece.</p>
                     <p>Let the part which produces another part, be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="115"/>
more strong than that which it produces; and
let the whole be seen by one point of Sight.
* Though Perspective cannot be call'd a certain
rule or a finishing of the Picture, yet it is a great
Succour and Relief to Art, and facilitates the means
of Execution; Yet frequently falling into Errors,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="120"/>
and making us behold things under a false Aspect;
for Bodies are not always represented according
to the Geometrical plane, but such as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the Sight.</p>
                     <p>Neither the Shape of Faces, nor the Age,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> nor
the Colour ought to be alike in all Figures,<note place="margin">Variety in the Figures.</note> any
more than the Hair: because Men are as different <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="125"/>
from each other, as the Regions in which they

never fail; 'tis but letting some weeks pass over
your Head, or at least some days, without looking

discover to you the faults, and beauties; yet
suffer not your self to be carried away by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

                     <p>* The qualities requisite to form an excellent

<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> possess'd powerfully the part of

crown'd Heads, whom they have led in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
and those other glorious Events which
Fortune has caus'd in all ages, even with more

He is also almost single in the great

so well the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Masses,</hi> and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

The laborious and diligent <hi>Annibal Carracci,</hi> has <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="535"/>

a receiv'd truth, that the Arts have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
relation to each other. "<hi>There is
no Art</hi> (said <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Treatise of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
<hi>which is not either the Father or the near Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation

respect to human life, have a kind of Alliance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, and hold each other (as we may
say) by the hand.</hi>" But those Arts which are the
nearest related, and claim the most ancient Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
with each other, are <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Poetry;</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:54218:75"/>
and whosoever shall throughly examine them, will
find them so much resembling one another, that
he cannot take them for less than <hi>Sisters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They both follow the same bent, and suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
rather to be carry'd away, than led by their
secret Inclinations, which are so many seeds of
the Divinity. "There <hi>is a God within us</hi> (says
<hi>Ovid</hi> in the beginning of his Sixth Book <hi>de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis,</hi>
there speaking of the Poets) <hi>who by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
warms us.</hi> And <hi>Suidas</hi> says, <hi>That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Sculptor</hi> Phidias, <hi>and</hi> Zeuxis <hi>that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Painter, were both of them transported by the
same Enthusiasm, which gave life to all their works.</hi>"
They both of them aim at the same end, which
is Imitation. Both of them excite our Passions;
and we suffer our selves willingly to be deceiv'd,
both by the one, and by the other; our Eyes and
Souls are so fixt to them, that we are ready to
persuade our selves that the painted Bodies breath,
and that the Fictions are Truths. Both of them
are set on fire by the great Actions of Heroes;
and both endeavour to eternize them: Both of
them in short, are supported by the strength of
their Imagination, and avail themselves of those
licences, which <hi>Apollo</hi> has equally bestow'd on
them, and with which their <hi>Genius</hi> has inspir'd
them.

Gregory <hi>of</hi> Nice,</hi> after having made a long and
beautifull Description of <hi>Abraham</hi> sacrificing
his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> says these words, "<hi>I have often
cast my eyes upon a Picture, which represents this

Tears. So well did the Picture represent
the thing it self, even as if the Action were then

Arts have been always honour'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The greatest
Lords, whole Cities and their Magistrates of Old</hi> (says
<hi>Pliny</hi> lib. 35.) <hi>took it for an honour to obtain a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
from the hands of those great Ancient Painters.</hi>
But this Honour is much fallen of late amongst

to this in the tenth Chapter of his <hi>35th.</hi>
Book tells us farther (speaking of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the
Master of <hi>Apelles) That it was by the authority of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,
<hi>that first at</hi> Sicyon, <hi>and afterwards thro'
all</hi> Greece, <hi>the young Gentlemen learn'd before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to design upon Tablets of Boxen-wood; and
that the first place among all the Liberal Arts was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Painting.</hi> And that which makes it evident,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54218:77"/>
that they were very knowing in this Art, is the
love and esteem which they had for Painters.
<hi>Demetrius</hi> gave high testimonies of this when he
besieg'd the City of <hi>Rhodes:</hi> For he was pleas'd
to employ some part of that time, which he ow'd
to the care of his Arms, in visiting <hi>Protogenes,</hi> who
was then drawing the Picture of <hi>Ialisus. This <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisus,</hi>
,</hi> (says <hi>Pliny) hinder'd King</hi> Demetrius <hi>from
taking</hi> Rhodes, <hi>out of fear, lest he should burn the
Pictures; and not being able to fire the Town on any
other side, he was pleas'd rather to spare the Painting,
than to take the Victory which was already in his hands.
Protogenes</hi> at that time had his Work-house in a
Garden out of the Town, and very near the
Camp of the Enemies, where he was daily fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
those Pieces which he had already begun;
the noise of Soldiers not being capable of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
his studies. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> causing him
to be brought into his Presence, and asking him
what made him so bold as to work in the midst
of Enemies: He answer'd the King, <hi>That he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the War which he made, was against the</hi> Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<hi>and not against the Arts.</hi> This oblig'd <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi>
to appoint him Guards for his Security, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinitely pleas'd that he could preserve that
hand, which by this means he sav'd from the
barbarity and insolence of Soldiers. <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54218:77"/>
had no greater pleasure, than when he was in the
painting room of <hi>Apelles,</hi> where he commonly was
found. And that Painter once receiv'd from him a
sensible Testimony of Love and Esteem which that
Monarch had for him: for having caus'd him to
paint naked (by reason of her admirable beauty)
one of his Concubines call'd <hi>Campaspe,</hi> who had
the greatest share in his affections, and perceiving
that <hi>Apelles</hi> was wounded with the same fatal dart
of Beauty, he made a present of her to him. In
that age so great a deference was pay'd to <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that they who had any Mastery in that Art,
never painted on any thing but what was porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from one place to another, and what could
be secur'd from burning. They took a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
care, says <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the place above-cited, not
to paint any thing against a Wall, which could
onely belong to one Master, and must always
remain in the same place; and for that reason
could not be remov'd in case of an accidental
Fire. Men were not suffer'd to keep a Picture,
as it were in Prison, on the Walls: It dwelt in
common in all Cities, and the <hi>Painter</hi> himself
was respected, as a <hi>Common Good to all the World.</hi>
See this <hi>Excellent Author,</hi> and you shall find that
the <hi>10th.</hi> Chapter of his <hi>35th.</hi> Book is fill'd with
the <hi>praises of this Art, and with the Honours which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54218:78"/>
were ascrib'd to it.</hi> You will there find that it was
not permitted to any but those of noble Blood
to profess it. <hi>Francis the First,</hi> as <hi>Vasari</hi> tells us,
was in love with Painting to that degree, that he
allur'd out of <hi>Italy</hi> all the best Masters, that this Art
might flourish in his own Kingdom. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> who after having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for some time in <hi>France,</hi> died at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi>
in the Arms of that great King, who could not
behold his death, without shedding Tears over
him. <hi>Charles the Fifth</hi> has adorn'd <hi>Spain</hi> with the
noblest Pictures which are now remaining in the
World. <hi>Ridolphi</hi> in his life of <hi>Titian,</hi> says, <hi>that
Emperor one day took up a Pencil, which fell from the
hand of that Artist, who was then drawing his Picture,
and upon the Compliment which</hi> Titian <hi>made him on
that occasion, he said these words,</hi> Titian <hi>has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to be serv'd by</hi> Caesar. And in the same life
'tis remarkable, <hi>That the Emperour valued himself
not so much in subjecting Kingdoms and Provinces,
as that he had been thrice made immortal by the hand of</hi>
Titian. If you will but take the pains to read this
famous life in <hi>Ridolphi,</hi> you will there see the relation
of all those honours which he receiv'd from <hi>Charles
the Fifth.</hi> It would take up too much time here to
recount all the particulars: I will onely observe
that the greatest Lords who compos'd the Court
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54218:78"/>
of that Emperour, not being able to refrain
from some marks of Jealousy, upon the preference
which he made of the Person, and Conversation
of <hi>Titian,</hi> to that of all his other Courtiers; he
freely told them, <hi>That he could never want a Court
or Courtiers, but he could not have</hi> Titian <hi>always with
him.</hi> Accordingly he heap'd Riches on him, and
whensoever he sent him Money, which, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
speaking, was a great Summ, he always did
it with this obliging Testimony, <hi>That his design
was not to pay him the value of his Pictures, because
they were above any price.</hi> After the example of the
Worthies of Antiquity, who bought the rarest
Pictures with Bushels of Gold, without counting
the weight or the number of the pieces, <hi>In nummo
aureo, mensurâ accepit, non numero,</hi> says <hi>Pliny,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Apelles. Quinctilian</hi> inferrs from hence,
<hi>that there is nothing more noble than the Art of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
because other things for the most part are
Merchandice, and bought at certain Rates; most
things for this very reason, (says he) are vile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a price, <hi>Pleraque hoc ipso possunt
videri vilia, quod pretium habent:</hi> see the <hi>34th. 35th.</hi>
and <hi>36th.</hi> Books of <hi>Pliny.</hi> Many great persons
have lov'd it with an extream Passion, and have
exercis'd themselves in it with delight. Amongst
others, <hi>Lelius Fabius,</hi> one of those famous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:54218:79"/>
who, as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates, after he had tasted
painting and had practis'd it, would be call'd
<hi>Fabius Pictor:</hi> as also <hi>Turpilius <hi>a</hi> Roman</hi> Knight;
<hi>Labco Praetor &amp; Consul, Quintus Pedius,</hi> the Poets
<hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius; Socrates, Plato, Metrodorus,
Pirrho, Commodus, Nero, Vespasian, Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Antoninus,</hi> and many other Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
who thought it not below their Majesty
to employ some part of their time in this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Art.</p>

                     <hi>The principal and most important part of Painting,
is to find out and thoroughly to understand what Nature
hath made most beautifull and most proper to this Art,</hi>
&amp;c. Observe here the rock on which the greatest
part of the <hi>Flemish</hi> Painters have split: most of
that Nation know how to imitate Nature, at least
as well as the Painters of other Countries, but
they make a bad choice in Nature it self; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be, that they have not seen the Ancient
pieces to find those beauties; or that a happy
Genius, and the beautifull Nature is not of the
growth of their Country. And to confess the
truth, that which is naturally beautifull is so very
rare, that it is discover'd by few persons; 'tis
difficult to make a choice of it, and to form to
our selves such an Idea of it, as may serve us for a
Model.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54218:79"/>
                     <note place="margin">¶39.</note>
                     <hi>And that a choice of it may be made according to
the gust and manner of the Ancients,</hi> &amp;c. That is
to say, according to the <hi>Statues,</hi> the <hi>Basso Relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's,</hi>
and the other <hi>Ancient Pieces,</hi> as well of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
as of the <hi>Romans; Ancient</hi> (or <hi>Antique</hi>) is that
which has been made from the time of <hi>Alexander
the Great,</hi> till that of <hi>Phocas;</hi> during whose Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
the Arts were ruin'd by War. These <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
works</hi> from their beginning have been the <hi>rule
of Beauty;</hi> and in effect, the <hi>Authors</hi> of them
have been so carefull to give them that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is still to be observ'd in them, that
they made use not onely of one single Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they form'd them, but of many, from which
they took the most regular parts to compose
from them a beautifull whole. "<hi>The Sculptors,</hi>
says <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> in his <hi>7th.</hi> Dissertation,
<hi>with admirable Artifice chose out of many Bodies
those parts which appear'd to them the most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and out of that diversity made but one Statue:
But this mixture is made with so much prudence
and propriety, that they seem to have taken but one
onely perfect Beauty. And let us not imagine that
we can ever find one natural Beauty which can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with Statues, that Art which has always some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more perfect than Nature.</hi>" 'Tis also to be
presum'd, that in the choice which they made of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54218:80"/>
those parts, they follow'd the opinion of the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,</hi>
who at that time were very capable of
instructing them in the rules of Beauty: Since
Beauty and Health ordinarily follow each other.
"<hi>For Beauty,</hi> says <hi>Galen, is nothing else but a just
Accord and mutual Harmony of the Members, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
by a healthfull constitution. And men,</hi>
said the same Author, <hi>commend a certain Statue
of</hi> Polycletus, <hi>which they call the rule, and which
deserves that name for having so perfect an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all its parts, and a proportion so exact, that
it is not possible to find a fault in it.</hi>" From what
I have quoted, we may conclude, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Pieces are truly beautifull, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Beauties of Nature; and that Nature
will ever be beautifull which resembles those Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Antiquity. 'Tis now evident upon what
account none have presum'd to contest the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of those Ancient Pieces, and that on the
contrary, they have always been quoted as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of the most perfect Beauty. <hi>Ovid</hi> in the <hi>12th.</hi>
Book of his <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> where he describes <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larus,</hi>
the most beautifull of all the <hi>Centaures,</hi> says,
<hi>That he had so great a Vivacity in his Countenance, his
Neck, his Shoulders, his Hands and Stomach were
so fair, that it is certain the manly part of him was
as beautifull as the most celebrated Statues.</hi> And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54218:80"/>
                     <hi>Philostratus</hi> in his <hi>Heroiqnes,</hi> speaking of <hi>Protesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
and praising the beauty of his face, says,
<hi>"That the form of his Nose was square, as if it had
been of a Statue;"</hi> and in another place speaking
of <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> he says, "<hi>That his beauty had gain'd
the affections of all the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and that it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
so nearly the beauty of a Statue, that one might
have taken him for</hi> Apollo." Afterwards also
speaking of the Beauty of <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and of his
likeness to his Father <hi>Achilles,</hi> he says, <hi>"That in
beauty, his Father had the same advantage over
him, as Statues have over the beauty of living
Men."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ought to be understood of the <hi>fairest
Statues,</hi> for amongst the multitude of Sculptors
which were in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> 'tis impossible but
some of them must have been bad work-men, or
rather less good: for though their works were
much inferiour to the Artists of the first form, yet
somewhat of greatness is to be seen in them, and
somewhat of harmonious in the distribution of their
parts, which makes it evident; that at this time
they wrought on Common Principles, and that
every one of them avail'd himself of those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
according to his Capacity and Genius. Those
Statues were the greatest Ornaments of <hi>Greece;</hi> we
need onely open the Book of <hi>Pausanias</hi> to find
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54218:81"/>
the prodigious quantity of them, whether within
or without their Temples, or in the crossing of
Streets, or in the Squares and publique Places, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Fields, or on the Tombs, Statues were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the <hi>Muses,</hi> to the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> to <hi>Heroes,</hi> to great
<hi>Captains,</hi> to <hi>Magistrates, Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Poets:</hi>
In short, they were set up to all those who had
made themselves eminent either in defence of their
Country, or for any noble action which deserv'd
a recompence; for it was the most ordinary and
most authentique way, both amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans,</hi> thus to testifie their gratitude. The
<hi>Romans</hi> when they had conquer'd <hi>Graecia,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
from thence, not onely their most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Statues, but also brought along with them the
most excellent of their Sculptors, who instructed
others in their Art, and have left to posterity the
immortal Examples of their knowledge, which
we see confirm'd by those curious <hi>Statues,</hi> those
<hi>Vases,</hi> those <hi>Basso-Relievo's,</hi> and those beautifull
<hi>Columns</hi> call'd by the names of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine:</hi>
They are those Beauties which out Author
proposes to us for our <hi>Models.</hi> And as the true
Fountains of Science, out of which both <hi>Painters</hi>
and <hi>Statuaries</hi> are bound to draw for their own
use, without amusing themselves with dipping in
streams which are often muddy, at least troubled;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54218:81"/>
I mean the manner of their Masters, after whom
they creep, and from whom they are unwilling
to depart, either through negligence, or through
the meanness of their Genius. "<hi>It belongs onely to
heavy minds,</hi> says Cicero, <hi>to spend their time on
streams, without searching for the Springs from
whence their materials flow in all manner of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance."</hi>

                     <note place="margin">¶40.</note> 
                     <hi>Without which all is nothing, but a blind and rash
barbarity,</hi> &amp;c. All that has nothing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
gust, is call'd a <hi>barbarous</hi> or <hi>Gothique</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which is not conducted by any rule, but
onely follows a wretched fancy, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that is noble: we are here to observe,
that <hi>Painters</hi> are not oblig'd to follow the <hi>Antique</hi>
as exactly as the <hi>Sculptors,</hi> for then their Picture
would favour too strongly of the <hi>Statue,</hi> and
would seem to be without Motion. Many Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and some of the ablest amongst them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
they do well, and taking that Precept
in too literal a Sence, have fallen thereby into great
inconveniencies; it therefore becomes the Painters
to make use of those Ancient Patterns with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to accommodate the Nature to them in
such a manner, that their Figures which must
seem to live, may rather appear to be <hi>Models for
the Antique, than the Antique a Model for their figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54218:82"/>
It appears that <hi>Raphael</hi> made a perfect use of
this conduct, and that the <hi>Lombard School</hi> have
not precisely search'd into this Precept, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to learn from thence how to make a
good choice of the Nature, and to give a certain
grace and nobleness to all their works, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and confus'd Idea, which they had of what
is beautifull; as for the rest, they are sufficiently
licentious, excepting onely <hi>Titian,</hi> who, of all
the <hi>Lombards</hi> has preserv'd the greatest purity in
his works. This barbarous manner of which I
spoke, has been in great vogue from the year 611
to 1450. They who have restor'd Painting in
<hi>Germany,</hi> (not having seen any of those fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Antiquity) have retain'd much of that
barbarous manner. Amongst others <hi>Lucas van
Leyden,</hi> a very laborious man, who with his
Scholars has infected almost all <hi>Europe</hi> with his
<hi>designs for Tapestry,</hi> which by the ignorant are
call'd <hi>Ancient Hangings,</hi> (a greater honour than
they deserve:) these I say are esteem'd beautifull
by the greatest part of the World. I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that I am amaz'd at so gross a stupidity,
and that we of the <hi>French Nation</hi> should have so
barbarous a Tast, as to take for beautifull those
flat, childish and insipid Tapestries. <hi>Albert Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
that famous <hi>German,</hi> who was contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54218:82"/>
to that <hi>Lucas,</hi> has had the like misfortune to
fall into that absurd manner, because he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen any thing that was beautifull. Observe
what <hi>Vasari</hi> tells us in the life of <hi>Marc Antonio (Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>'s
Graver) having first commended <hi>Albert</hi>
for his skill in graving, and his other Talents:
"<hi>And in truth,</hi> says he, <hi>if this, so excellent, so exact,
and so universal a Man, had been born in</hi> Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,
<hi>as he was in</hi> Germany, <hi>and had form'd his
studies according to those beautifull pieces which are
seen at</hi> Rome, <hi>as the rest of us have done, he had
prov'd the best Painter of all</hi> Italy, <hi>as he was the

and <hi>Sovereign</hi> of it, which is no easie matter.
Those of that profession are so seldom endow'd
with that supreme Capacity, that few of them
arrive to be good Judges of Painting: and I
should many times make more account of their
judgment, who are men of Sence, and yet have
never touch'd a Pencil, than of the opinion which
is given by the greatest part of Painters. <hi>All

And as it would be ridiculous to grow old in the
study of every necessary thing, in an Art which
comprehends so many several parts; so on the

Men</hi> do just like the <hi>Squirrel,</hi> who is perpetually
turning the Wheel in her Cage; she runs apace
and wearies her self with her continual Motion,
and yet gets no ground. <hi>'Tis not enough for doing
well to walk apace,</hi> says Quinctilian, <hi>but it is enough
for walking apace to do well.</hi> 'Tis a bad excuse to say,
I was but a little while about it: That gracefull
Easiness, that celestial Fire which animates the
work, proceeds not so much from having often
done the like, as from having well understood
what we have done. See what I shall farther
say, in the <hi>51st. Rule,</hi> which concerns easiness.
Others there are who believe the Precepts and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
to be of absolute necessity, but as they
were ill instructed, and what they knew rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangl'd
than clear'd their understanding, so they
oftentimes stop short; and if they perform a work,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tis not without Anxiety and Pain. And in truth,
they are so much the more worthy of Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
because their intentions are right, and if they
advance not in knowledge as far as others, and
are sometimes cast behind, yet they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54218:84"/>
upon some sort of reason; for 'tis belonging to
good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ence, not to go over fast when we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
our selves to be out of the way, or even
where we doubt which way we ought to take.
Others on the contrary, being well instructed in
good Maximes, and in the rules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Art, after having
done fine things yet spoil them all by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make them better, which is a kind of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-doing,
and are so intoxicated with their work
and with an earnest desire of being above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they suffer themselves to be deceiv'd
with the appearance of an imaginary good. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles
<hi>one day admiring the prodigious Labour which
he saw in a Picture of</hi> Protogenes,<note place="margin">Pliny 35. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and knowing
how much sweat it must have cost him, said, That</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes
<hi>and himself were of equal strength; nay, that
he yielded to him in some parts of Painting, but in this
he surpass'd him, that</hi> Protogenes <hi>never knew when
he had done well, and could never hold his hand; he
also added in the nature of a Precept, that he wish'd all
Painters would imprint this lesson deeply in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that with over-straining and earnestness of finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Pieces they often did them more harm than
good.<note place="margin">10. 3.</note> There are some (says</hi> Quinctilian) <hi>who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
satisfie themselves, never are contented with their
first Notions and Expressions, but are continually chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all, till nothing remains of their first Ideas. Others
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54218:85"/>
there are</hi> (continues he,) <hi>who dare never trust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor resolve on any thing, and who being as it
were intangl'd in their own Genius, imagine it to be a
laudable correctness, when they form difficulties to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their own work. And to speak the truth, 'tis
hard to discern whether of the two is in the greatest Error;
he who is enamour'd of all he does, or he whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own can please. For it has happen'd to
young Men, and often even to those of the greatest
Wit, to waste their Spirits, and to consume themselves
with Anxiety and Pain of their own giving, so far as
even to doze upon their work with too much eagerness
of doing well; I will now tell you how a reasonable man
ought to carry himself on this occasion: 'Tis certain
that we ought to use our best endeavour to give the
last Perfection to our works; yet it is always to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that we attempt no more than what is in the
compass of our Genius, and according to our Vein: for
to make a true Progress, I grant that diligence and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are both requisite, but this study ought to have no
mixture, either of Self-opinion, Obstinacy, or Anxiety;
for which reason, if it blows a happy Gale we must set up
all our Sails, though in so doing it sometimes happens that
we follow those Motions where our natural heat is more
powerfull than our care and our correctness, provided
we abuse not this licence, and suffer not our selves to
be deceiv'd by it, for all our productions cannot fail to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54218:85"/>
please us at the moment of their Birth, as being new
to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because the greatest Beauties cannot always be experss'd
for want of terms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶61.</note> &amp;c. I have learn'd from the mouth
of Monsieur <hi>du Fresnoy,</hi> that he had oftentimes
heard <hi>Guido</hi> say, <hi>That no man could give a rule of
the greatest Beauties, and that the knowledge of them
was so abstruse, that there was no manner of speaking
which could express them.</hi> This comes just to what
<hi>Quinctilian says,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Declam. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That things incredible wanted words
to express them: for some of them are too great and
too much elevated to be comprehended by human discourse.</hi>
From hence it proceeds that the best Iudges when
they admire a noble Picture, seem to be fasten'd
to it; and when they come to themselves you
would say they had lost the use of Speech.</p>

                     <hi>A subject beautifull and noble,</hi> &amp;c. Painting is
not onely pleasing and divertising, but is also a
kind of Memorial of those things which Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has had the most beautifull and the noble in their
kinds, re-placing the History before our Eyes;
as if the thing at that time were effectually in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
even so far that beholding the Pictures
wherein those noble deeds are represented, we
find our selves stung with a desire of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhat which is like that Action there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
as if we were reading it in the History.
The Beauty of the subject inspires us with Love
and Admiration for the Pictures. As the fair
mixture causes us to enter into the subject which
it imitates and imprints it the more deeply into
our Imagination and our Memory: these are two
Chains which are interlink'd, which contain,
and are at the same time contain'd, and whose
matter is equally precious and estimable.</p>

parts, of which we are to foresee the agreement

                     <hi>Which is what we properly call Invention,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">¶75.</note> Our
Author establishes three parts of Painting,
the INVENTION, the DESIGN or
DRAWING, and the COLOURING,
which in some places he also calls the CRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATIQUE.
Many Authors who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54218:87"/>
of Painting, multiply the parts according to
their pleasure; and without giving you or my
self the trouble of discussing this matter, I will
onely tell you, that all the parts of Painting which
others have nam'd, are reducible into these three
which are mention'd by our Author.</p>
                  <p>For which reason, I esteem this division to
be the justest: and as these <hi>three parts</hi> are <hi>Essential</hi>
to <hi>Painting,</hi> so no man can be truly call'd a
<hi>Painter</hi> who does not posses them all together: In
the same manner that we cannot give the name
of <hi>Man</hi> to any Creature which is not compos'd
of <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which are the three
parts necessarily constituent of a <hi>Man.</hi> How there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can they pretend to the Quality of Painters,
who can onely copy and purloyn the works of
others who therein employ their whole industry,
and with that onely Talent would pass for able
Painters. And do not tell me that many great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
have done this; for I can easily answer you that
it had been their better course, to have abstain'd
from <hi>so doing;</hi> that they have not thereby done
themselves much honour, and that copying was
not the best part of their reputation. Let us then
conclude that all Painters ought to acquire this
part of Excellence; not to do it, is to want cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and not dare to shew themselves. 'Tis to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54218:87"/>
creep and grovel on the ground, 'tis to deserve
this just reproach, <hi>O imitatores servum pecus:</hi> 'Tis
with <hi>Painters,</hi> in reference to their productions,
as it is with <hi>Orators.</hi> A good beginning is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
costly to both: much sweat and labour is
requir'd, but 'tis better to expose our works and
leave them liable to censure for fifteen years, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>n
to blush for them at the end of fifty. On this
account 'tis necessary for a Painter to begin early
to do somewhat of his own, and to accustom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to it by continual excercise; for so long as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to raise himself, he fears falling, he shall
be always on the ground. See the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>

would have a Painter furnish himself sufficiently
and in truth, there is no man, though his under
standing be very mean who knows not and who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54218:88"/>
finds not of himself how much Learning is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to animate his Genius, and to compleat it.
And the reason of this is, that they who have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
have not onely seen and learn'd many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things in their course of studies, but that
also they have acquir'd by that exercise a great
Facility of profiting themselves by reading good
Authors. They who will make profession of
Painting, must heap up treasures out of their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and there will find many wonderfull means
of raising themselves above others, who can onely
creep upon the ground, or if they elevate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
'tis onely to fall from a higher place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they serve themselves of other Men's Wings,
neither understanding their Use nor Vertue: 'Tis
true that it is not the present Mode for a Painter
to be so knowing: and if any of them in these
times be found to have either a great Wit or much
Learning, the multitude would not fail to say,
that it was great pity, and that the Youth might
have come to somewhat in the practical part, or
it may be in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or in the Families of
some Noble-men. So wretch'd is the Destiny of
Painting in these later ages. By Learning 'tis
not so much the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine

there is this danger in them, that they almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
corrupt the truth of History.</p>
                  <p>There are also other Books which a Painter
may use upon some particular occasions and
onely when he wants them: Such are,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mythology</hi> of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Images</hi> of the Gods.</p>

                  <p>Thus it is necessary, that they who are desirous
of a name in Painting, should read at leisure times
these Books with diligence, and make their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of such things as they find for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in them, and of which they believe they may
sometime or other have occasion; let the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
be employ'd in this reading, and let them

Moderns have written of it with small suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
taking a large compass without coming di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the point, and talking much without

themselves successfully enough. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<hi>Paulo Lomazzo,</hi> whose Book is good for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part, but whose discourse is too diffusive and
very tiresome. <hi>Iohn Baptist Armenini, Franciscus

rather invite you than to his Book; we are not to
forget what Monsieur <hi>Felebien</hi> has written of the
Picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> by the hand of Monsieur
<hi>Le Brun:</hi> besides that the work it self is very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
the Foundations which he establishes for
the making of a good Picture are wonderfully so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
Thus I have given you very near the <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

&amp;c.<note place="margin">¶77.</note> See here the <hi>most important Precept</hi> of
all those which relate to <hi>Painting.</hi> It belongs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54218:91"/>
either from <hi>Learning,</hi> or from <hi>Physick,</hi> or
from the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or in short, from <hi>other
Arts,</hi> for it is sufficient to have a natural Wit and
Learning to make that which we call in Painting
a good Invention, for the design we must have
some insight into <hi>Anatomy,</hi> to make Buildings, and
other things in <hi>Perspective,</hi> we must have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>other Arts,</hi> will bring
in their <hi>Quota</hi>'s to furnish out the matter of a good
Picture; but for the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> or ordering of the
whole together, none but onely the Painter can
understand it, because the end of the Artist is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
to deceive the Eyes, which he can never
accomplish if this part be wanting to him. A
Picture may make an ill effect, though the <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it be truly understood, the <hi>Design</hi> of it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and the Colours of it the most beautifull and
fine that can be employ'd in it. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
we may behold other Pictures ill invented,
ill design'd and painted with the most common
Colours, which shall make a very good effect,
and which shall more pleasingly deceive; <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>This Precept is properly the use and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the rest; for which reason it requires
much judgment. You are therefore, in such
manner to foresee things, that your Picture may
be painted in your Head: <hi>i. e.</hi> before it come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Canvas. <hi>When</hi> Manander (says a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Authour)<note place="margin">Comm. vetus.</note> 
                     <hi>had order'd the Scenes of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
he held it to be, in a manner, already made;
though he had not begun the first Verse of it.</hi> 'Tis an
undoubted truth, that they who are endu'd with
this foresight, work with incredible pleasure and
facility; others on the contrary are perpetually
changing and rechanging their work, which when
it is ended leaves them but anxiety for all their
pains. It seems to me that these sorts of Pictures
remind us of those old <hi>Gothique</hi> Castles, made at
several times, and which hold together onely as
it were by Rags and Patches.</p>
                  <p>It may be inferr'd from that which I have said,
that the <hi>Invention</hi> and the <hi>Disposition</hi> are two several
and distinct parts in effect, though the last of
them depends upon the first, and that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
'tis comprehended under it: yet we are to take
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54218:92"/>
take great care that we do not confound them.
The <hi>Invention</hi> simply finds out the subjects, and
makes a choice of them suitable to the History
which we treat; and the <hi>Disposition</hi> distributes
those things which are thus found each to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place, and accommodates the Figures and the
Grouppes in particular, and the <hi>Tout Ensemble</hi>
(or whole together) of the Picture in general:
so that this <hi>Oeconomy</hi> produces the same effect in
relation <hi>to the Eyes,</hi> as a <hi>Consort of Musick</hi> to the
<hi>Ears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one thing of great consequence to be
observ'd in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the whole work, which
is, that at the first Sight we may be given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the quality of the subject: and that the
Picture at the first Glance of the Eye, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
us with the principal passion of it: <hi>for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
if the subject, which you have undertaken
to treat be of joy, 'tis necessary that every thing
which enters into your Picture should contribute
to that Passion, so that the Beholders shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
be mov'd with it. If the Subject be
mournfull, let every thing in it have a stroke of
sadness; and so of the other Passion and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let your Compositions be conformable to the Text of

This was in the time of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and
lasted even to <hi>Augustus;</hi> under whose reign Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fell to great decay. But under the Emperors,
<hi>Domitian, Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> it appear'd in its
primitive lustre, which lasted to the time of <hi>Phocas</hi>
the Emperor, when vices prevailing over the
Arts, and War being kindled through all <hi>Europe,</hi>
and especially in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> (occasion'd by the
irruption of the <hi>Hunns,</hi>) Painting was totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd.
And if some few in the succeeding
Ages strain'd themselves to revive it, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in finding out the most glaring, gawdy and
costly Colours, than in imitating the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Simplicity of those illustrious Painters who
preceded them. At length, in the fourteenth
Century, some there were who began to set it
again on foot. And it may truly be said, that
about the end of the fifteenth Age, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our Sixteenth it appear'd in much
Splendor by means of many knowing Men in all
parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were in perfect possession of it.
Since those happy times which were so fruitfull of
the noble Arts, we have also had some knowing
Painters but very few in number, because of the
little inclination which Sovereign Princes have
had for Painting: but thanks to the zeal of our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54218:94"/>
Great Monarch, and to the care of his first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
Monsieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> we may shortly behold
it more flourishing than ever.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">¶103.</note> &amp;c. This is the second part of Painting,
which is call'd <hi>Design or Drawing;</hi> as the Ancients
haue sought as much as possible whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to the making of a perfect Body, so they
haue diligently examin'd in what consists the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of good postures, as their works sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

so great as to exceed a just proportion. But he means
that in noble posture, the greatest parts of the
Body ought to appear foremost rather than the
less, for which reason in another passage he vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
forbids the foreshortinings, because they
make the parts appear little, though of themselves
they are great.</p>

such as is most commonly the <hi>Nature</hi> which

before must contrast or oppose those others which are him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost,
and all of them be equally balanc'd on their
Centre,</hi> &amp;c. The Motions are never natural,
when the Members are not equally balanc'd on
their Centre: and these Members cannot be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
on their Centre in an equality of weight,
but they must contrast each other. A Man who
dances on the Rope, makes a manifest Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of this Truth. The Body is a weight
balanc'd on its Feet, as upon two <hi>Pivots,</hi> And
though one of the Feet most commonly bears the
weight, yet we see that the whole weight rests
<hi>Centrally</hi> upon it. Insomuch, that if, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
one Arms is stretched out, it must of necessity
be either that the other Arm, or the Leg be cast
backward, or the Body somewhat bow'd on the
opposite Side, so as to make an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> and
be in a Situation which is unforc'd. It may be,
though seldom (if it be not in old Men) that
the Feet bear equally; and for that time half the
weight is equally distributed on each Foot. You
ought to make use of the same Prudence, if one
Foot bear three parts in four of the Burthen, and
that the other Foot bore the remaining part. This
in general is what may be said of the Balance, and
the Libration of the Body. In particular, there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54218:95"/>
may many things be said which are very usefull
and curious, of which you may satisfie your
selves in <hi>Leonardo da Vinci.</hi> He has done wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
well on that subject, and one may truly say
that the <hi>Ponderation,</hi> is the best and soundest part
of all his <hi>Book of Painting.</hi> It begins at the <hi>181st.</hi>
Chapter, and concludes at the <hi>273d.</hi> I would also
advise you to read <hi>Paulo Lomazzo</hi> in his <hi>6th. Book,
Chapter 4th. Del moto del Corpo humano,</hi> that is, the
motions of a human Body. You will there find
many things of great profit; for what concerns
the Contrast, I will onely say in general, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gives so much grace and life to Figures. See
the <hi>43d. Precept,</hi> and what I say upon it in the
Remarks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The parts must have their out lines in Waves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Flames,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶107.</note> 
                     <hi>or the gliding of a Snake upon the
ground,</hi> &amp;c. The reason of this proceeds from
the action of the Muscles, which are as so many
Well-buckets; when one of them acts and draws,
'tis necessary that the other must obey; so that the
Muscles which act, drawing always towards their
principle, and those which obey stretching in
length and on the side of their insertion, it must
needs follow that the parts must be design'd in
Waves: but beware lest in giving this form to
the parts you do not break the Bones which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54218:95"/>
them and which always must make them appear firm.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Maxim</hi> is not altogether so general, but
that actions may be found where the masses of the
Muscles are situate one over against another, but
this is not very common. The out-lines which
are in waves, give not only a grace to the Parts,
but also to the whole Body, when it is only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
on one Leg. As we see in the Figures of
<hi>Antinous, Meleager,</hi> the <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> that of
the <hi>Vatican,</hi> the two others of <hi>Borghese,</hi> and that
of <hi>Flora,</hi> of the Goddess <hi>Vesta,</hi> the two <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s of
<hi>Borghese,</hi> and that of <hi>Ludovisio,</hi> and in fine of the
greatest number of the <hi>Ancient Figures,</hi> which are
standing, and which always rest more upon one
Foot than the other. Besides, that the Figures and
their Parts, ought almost always to have a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
and flaming form naturally, these sorts of
out-lines have, I know not what of life and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
motion in them, which very much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the activity of the Flame, and of the Serpent.</p>

                  <p>If you wou'd know the Proportions more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
you may see them in <hi>Paulo Lomazzo:</hi>
'tis good to read them, once at least, and to make

                     <hi>Though Perspective cannot be call'd a certain Rule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶117.</note>
&amp;c. That is to say, purely of it self, without pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and discretion. The greatest part of those,
who understand it, desiring to practise it too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
often make such things as shock the sight,
though they are within the Rules. If all those
great Painters, who have left us such fair Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,
had rigorously observ'd it in their Figures,
they had not wholly found their account in it.
They had indeed made things more regularly
true, but withall very unpleasing. There is great
appearance that the <hi>Architects,</hi> and <hi>Statuaries</hi> of
former times, have not found it to their purpose
always; nor have follow'd the Geometrical Part
so exactly as Perspective ordains. For He who
wou'd imitate the Frontispiece of the <hi>Rotunda</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Perspective, wou'd be grosly deceiv'd;
since the Columns which are at the extremities
have more diameter, than those which are in the
middle. The Cornish of the <hi>Palazzo Farnese,</hi>
which makes so beautifull an effect below, when
view'd more nearly, will be found not to have
its just measures. In the <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Trajan,</hi> we see
that the highest Figures are greater than those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and make an effect quite contrary to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54218:98"/>
increasing according to the measure of
their distance. I know there is a Rule which
teaches a way of making them in that manner;
and which though 'tis to be found in some Books
of Perspective, yet notwithstanding is no <hi>rule</hi> of
<hi>Perspective.</hi> Because 'tis never made use of, but
onely when we find it for our purpose; for if
(<hi>for example</hi>) the Figures which are at the top of
<hi>Trajan</hi>'s <hi>Pillar,</hi> were but as great as those which
are at the bottom, they wou'd not be for all
that against Perspective: and thus we may say,
with more reason, that it is a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Decorum</hi> in
Perspective to ease the sight, and to render ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
more agreeable: 'Tis on this general obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that we may establish in Perspective, the
rules of <hi>Decorum</hi> (or convenience) whensoever
occasion shall offer. We may also see another
Example in the base of the <hi>Farnesian Hercules;</hi>
which is not upon the level, but on an easie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
on the advanc'd part, that the feet of the
Figure may not be hidden from the sight, to the
end that it may appear more pleasing: which the
noble Authors of these things have done, not in
contempt of Geometry and Perspective, but for
the satisfaction of the Eyes, which was the end
they propos'd to themselves in all their works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:54218:99"/>
We must therefore understand <hi>Perspective,</hi> as
a Science which is absolutely necessary; and
which a Painter must not want: Yet without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
our selves so wholly to it, as to become slaves
of it. We are to follow it, when it leads us in a
pleasing way, and that it shows us pleasing things;
but for some time to forsake it, if it lead us
through mire, or to a precipice. Endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that which is aiding to your Art, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
but avoid whatsoever is repugnant to it;
as the 59th <hi>rule</hi> teaches.</p>

                  <p>Mutes having no other way of speaking (or

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54218:99"/>
and their actions, 'tis certain that they do
it in a manner more expressive than those who
have the use of Speech, for which reason the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
which is mute ought to imitate them, so
as to make it self understood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the principal Figure of the Subject,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶129.</note> &amp;c. 'Tis
one of the greatest blemishes of a Picture, not to
give knowledge at the first Sight of the Subject
which it represents. And truly nothing is more
perplexing, than to extinguish as it were, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Figure by the opposition of some others,
which present themselves to us at the first view,
and which carry a greater lustre. An Orator, who
had undertaken to make a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> on <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great,</hi> and who had emply'd the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Figures of his <hi>Rhetorique</hi> in the praise of <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi>
would do quite the contrary to that which
was expected from him; Because it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that he rather took the Horse for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
than the Master. A <hi>Painter</hi> is like an <hi>Orator</hi>
in this. He must dispose his matter in such sort,
that all things may give place to his principal
Subject. And if the other Figures, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it, and are onely as Accessaries there, take
up the chief place, and make themselves most
remarkable, either by the Beauty of their Colours,
or by the Splendour of the Light, which strikes
upon them, they will catch the Sight, they will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54218:100"/>
Stop it short, and not suffer it to go further than
themselves, till after some considerable space of
time to find out that which was not discern'd at
first. The principal Figure in a Picture is like
a king among his Courtiers, whom we ought
to know at the first Glance, and who ought to
dim the Lustre of all his Attendants. Those
Painters who proceed otherwise, do just like those
who in the relation of a story ingage themselves
so foolishly in long digressions, that they are forc'd
to conclude quite another way than they began.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Members be combin'd in the same manner as
the Figures are,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶132.</note> &amp;c. I cannot better compare a
<hi>Grouppe of Figures</hi> than to a <hi>Consort of Voices,</hi>
which supporting themselves all together by their
different parts make a <hi>Harmony,</hi> which pleasing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fills the Ears and flatters them; but if you
come to separate them, and that all the parts are
equally heard as loud as one another, they will
stun you to that degree, that you would fancy
your Ears were torn in pieces. 'Tis the same of
Figures; if you so assemble them, that some of
them sustain the others, and make them appear;
and that all together they make but one entire
Whole, then your Eyes will be fully satisfied:
But if on the contrary, you divide them, your
Eyes will suffer by seeing them <hi>all together</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54218:100"/>
or each of them <hi>in particular. All together,</hi>
because the visual Rays are multiply'd by the
Multiplicity of Objects. <hi>Each of them in particular;</hi>
because, if you six your Sight on one, those
which are about it will strike you and attract
your Eyes to them, which extremely Pains them
in this sort of Separation and Diversity of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
The Eye, for example, is satisfied with
the Sight of one single Grape, and is distracted, if
it carries it self at one view, to look upon many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Grapes which lie Scatter'd on a Table, we
must have the same regard for the Members;
they aggrouppe and contrast each other in the
same manner as the Figures do. Few Painters
have observ'd this Precept as they ought, which
is a most solid Foundation for the Harmony of a
Picture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Figures in the Grouppes ought not to be like each
other in their Motions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶137.</note> &amp;c. Take heed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trast
to do nothing that is extravagant, and let
your Postures be always natural. The Draperies,
and all things that accompany Figures, may
enter into the contrast with the Members, and
with the Figures themselves: And this is what our
Poet Means in these words of his Verses, <hi>Caetera

it. The Reasons which he gave were, first, That
he belive'd there ought not be above three great

That Silence and Majesty were of necessity to be
there, to render it beautifull; and neither the one
nor the other cou'd possibly be in a multitude and

<hi>Precept</hi> is against two sorts of Painters; first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those who are so scrupulously tied to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they can do nothing without her, who
copy her just as they believe they see her, without
adding or retrenching any thing, though never so
little, either for the Nudities or for the Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And secondly, against those who Paint e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing by Practice, without being able to
subject themselves to retouch any thing, or to
examine by the Nature. These last, properly
speaking, are the <hi>Libertines</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> as there
are <hi>Libertines</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> who have no other Law
but the vehemence of their Inclinations which they
are resolv'd not to overcome: and in the Same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Libertines</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> have no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
but a <hi>Rhodomontado Genius,</hi> and very irragu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54218:102"/>
which violently hurries them away. Though
these two sorts of Painters, are both of them in
<hi>vicious Extremes,</hi> yet nevertheless the former sort
seems to be the more supportable; because though
they do not imitate Nature as she is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
by all her Beauties, and her Graces, yet at
least they imitate that Nature, which we know
and daily see. Instead of which the others show
us a wild or salvage Nature, which is not of our
acquaintance, and which seems to be of a quite
new Creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whom you must have always present as a witness
to the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶178.</note> &amp;c. This passage seems to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
well said. The nearer a Picture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the truth, The better it is; and though
the Painter, who is its Author, be the first Judge of
the Beauties which are in it, he is nevertheless ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
not to pronounce it, till he has first consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nature, who is an irreproachable evidence,
and who will frankly, but withall truly tell you
its Defects and Beauties, if you compare it with
her Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And of all other things which discover to us the
Thoughts and inventions of the</hi> Graecians,<note place="margin">¶188.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As
good Books, such as are <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Pausanias;</hi>
the prints which we see of the Antiquities, may
extremely contribute to from our Genius, and to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54218:103"/>
give us great Ideas; in the same manner as the
Writings of good Authors, are capable of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a good Style in those who are desirous of
writing well.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">¶193.</note> &amp;c.
The reason of this is, That there being nothing to
attract the Sight but this onely Figure, the Visual
Rays will not be too much divided by the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Colours and Draperies; but onely take
heed to put in nothing, which shall appear too
sharp or too hard; and be mindfull of the <hi>4th.</hi>
Precept, which says, that two Extremities are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to touch each other either in Colour or in
Light; but that there must be a mean, partaking
of the one and of the other.</p>

and principally in his latter Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And let them follow the order of the parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶196.</note> &amp;c. As
the fairest pieces of Antiquity will show us. And
take heed, that the folds do not only follow the
order of the parts, but that they also mark the
most considerable Muscles; because that those Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
where the drapery and the naked part are
seen both together, are much more gracefull than
the other.</p>

                     <hi>Without sitting too streight upon them,</hi> &amp;c. Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ought not to imitate the Ancients in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance;
the ancient Statuaries ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> their
Draperies of wet Linen, On purpose to make them
sit close and streight to the parts of their Figures,
for doing which they had great reason; and in
following which the Painters would be much in
the wrong: and you shall see upon what grounds
those great Genius's of Antiquity, finding that it
was impossible to imitate with Marble the fineness
of stuffs or garments which is not to be discern'd
but by the Colours, the Reflexes, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the Lights and Shadows, finding it I
say out of their power to dispose of those things,
thought they could not do better nor more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially,
than to make use of such Draperies as
hinder'd not from seeing through their Folds, the
delicacy, of the Flesh, and the purity of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines;
things which truly speaking they possest in
the last perfection, and which in all appearance
were the subject of their chief study. But Painters,
on the contrary, who are to deceive the Sight,
quite otherwise than Statuaries, are bound to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the different sorts of Garments, such as they
naturally seem; and such as Colours, Reflexes,
Lights and Shadows (of all which they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters)
can make them appear: Thus we see that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54218:104"/>
those who have made the nearest imitations of
Nature, have made use of such Stuffs (or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
which are familiar to our Sight, and
these they have imitated with so much Art that
in beholding them we are pleas'd that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us; such were <hi>Titian, Paul Veronese, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toret,
Rubens, Van Dyck,</hi> and the rest of the good
Colourists, who have come nearest to the truth of
Nature: Instead of which, others who have scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously
tied themselves to the practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
in their Draperies, have made their works
crude and dry; and by this means have found
out the lamentable secret how to make their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
harder than even the Marble it self. As <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea
Mantegna,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Perugino</hi> have done,
and <hi>Raphael</hi> also had much of that way in his first
Works, in which we behold many small foldings
often repleited, which look like so many Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
'Tis true these repetitions are seen in the
<hi>Ancient Statues,</hi> and they are very proper there.
Because they who made use of wet Linen, and
close Draperies, to make their Figures look more
tender, reasonably foresaw that the Members
would be too naked, if they left not more than
two or three Folds, scarce appearing such as those
sorts of Draperies afford the Sight, and therefore
have us'd those Repetitions of many Folds, yet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54218:104"/>
in such a manner that the Figures are always
soft and tender, and thereby seem opposite to the
hardness of Marble. Add to this, that in <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
'tis almost impossible that a Figure cloath'd
with course Draperies, can make a good effect on
all the sides; and that in Painting the Draperies
of what kind soever they be, are of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
either to unite the Colours and the Grouppes,
or to give such a ground as one would wish to
unite or to separate, or farther, to produce such
reflections as set off, or for filling void spaces, or
in short for many other advantages, which help
to deceive the Sight, and which are no ways ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to <hi>Sculptors,</hi> since their Work is always
of <hi>Relievo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things may be inferr'd from what I have
said concerning the rule of Draperies. First,
that the <hi>Ancient Sculptors</hi> had reason to cloath
their Figures as we see them. Secondly, that
<hi>Painters</hi> ought to imitate them in the order of their
Folds, but not in their quality nor in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Thirdly, That <hi>Sculptors</hi> are oblig'd to
follow them as much as they can, without desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to imitate unprofitably or improperly the
manners of the Painters, and to make many
ample Folds, which are insufferable hardnesses,
and more like a Rock than a natural Garment.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54218:105"/>
See the <hi>211th. Remark</hi> about the middle of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if the parts be too much distant from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶202.</note>
&amp;c. 'Tis with intent to hinder (as we
have said in the rule of Grouppes) the visual
Rays, from being too much divided, and that
the Eyes may not suffer by looking on so many
objects, which are separated. <hi>Guido</hi> was very
exact in this observation. See in the Text the
end of the <hi>Rule</hi> which relates to Draperies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as the Beauty of the Limbs consists not in the
quantity and rising of the Muscles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶204.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Raphael</hi> in
the beginning of his Painting, has somewhat too
much multiply'd the Folds; because being with
reason charm'd with the graces of the Ancients, he
imitated their Beauties somewhat too regularly;
but having afterwards found that this quantity of
Folds glitter'd too much upon the Limbs, and
took off that Repose and Silence which in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are so friendly to the Eyes; he made use of a
contrary conduct in the works which he painted
afterwards, which was at that time when he began
to understand the effect of Lights, of Grouppes,
and the oppositions of the Lights and Shadows,
so that he wholly chang'd his manner, (this was
about eight years before his death) and though he
always gave a Grace to whatsoever he painted,
yet he made appear in his latter works, a Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54218:105"/>
a Majesty, and a Harmony quite other
than what we see in his first manner: And this
he did by lessening the number of his Folds,
making them more large and more opposing
them, and by making the Masses of the Lights
and Shadows, greater and more disentagl'd.
Take the pains to examine these his different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Prints which we see of that <hi>Great Man.</hi>

                     <hi>their Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ought to be large,</hi> &amp;c. Yet make not your
Draperies so large that they may be big enough
to cloath four or five Figures, as some there are
who follow that method. And take heed that
the folding be natural and so dispos'd, that the Eye
may be directed to discover the Folds from the
beginning of them to the end. By Magistrates,
he means all great and grave Persons, and such
as are advanc'd in age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Ladies or Damsels, light and soft,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶211.</note> &amp;c. By
this name of <hi>Ladies, Maids,</hi> or <hi>Damsels,</hi> he means
all young persons, slender, finely shap'd, aery
and delicate. Such as are <hi>Nymphs,</hi> and <hi>Naiades,</hi>
and <hi>Fountains. Angels</hi> are also comprehended
under this head, whose Drapery should be of
pleasing Colours, and resembling those which
are seen in the Heavens, and chiefly when they
are suspended in the Air. They are only such
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54218:106"/>
sorts of light habits as are subject to be ruffl'd by
the Winds, which can bear many Folds; yet so
that they may be freed from any hardnesses. 'Tis
easie for every one to judge that betwixt the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and those of <hi>young Maids;</hi>
there must be some mediocrity of Folds, such as
are most commonly seen and observ'd, as in the
Draperies of a <hi>Christ,</hi> of a <hi>Madonna,</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi>
a <hi>Queen,</hi> or a <hi>Dutchess,</hi> and of other persons of
Consideration and Majesty; and those also who
are of a middle age with this distinction, that the
Habits must be made more or less rich, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the dignity of the Persons; and that <hi>Cloth
Garments</hi> may be distinguish'd from those of <hi>Silk,
Sattin</hi> from <hi>Velvets, Brocard</hi> from <hi>Embroidery,</hi> and
that in one word the Eye may be deceiv'd by the
truth and the difference of the Stuffs. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
if you please, that the light and tender Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
having been onely given to the Female Sex,
the <hi>Ancient Sculptors</hi> have avoided as much as they
could to cloath the Figures of Men, because they
thought, (as we have formerly said) that in Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Garments could not be well imitated, and
that great Folds made a very bad effect. There
are almost as many examples of this truth, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Ancients there are Statues of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men. I will name only that of <hi>Laocoon,</hi> which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54218:106"/>
according to all probability ought to have been
cloath'd: And in effect what likelihood can
there be, that the Son of a King, and the Priest
of <hi>Apollo</hi> should appear naked in the actual Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Sacrifice. For the Serpents pass'd from
the Isle of <hi>Tenedos</hi> to the <hi>Trojan</hi> Shore, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
<hi>Laocoon</hi> and his Sons while they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
to <hi>Neptune</hi> on the <hi>Sea Shore,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi>
witnesses in the second of his <hi>Eneids.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which, the<note n="*" place="margin">Polydorus, Athenodorus, <hi>and</hi> Agesander, <hi>all</hi> Rhodians.</note> Sculptors who were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of this noble work had well consider'd, that
they could not give Vestments suitable to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Persons represented, without making
as it were a heap of Stones, whose Mass would
rather be like a Rock, than those three admirable
Figures, which will ever be the Admiration of
all Ages. And for this reason of two inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
they judg'd that of Draperies to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
than that which was against the truth it
self.</p>
                  <p>This observation well confirms what I have
said in the <hi>200th. Remark.</hi> It seems to me, that it
deserves you should make some reflection on it;
and to establish it the better in your mind, I will
tell you, that <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> following <hi>this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim,</hi>
has given the <hi>Prophets</hi> which he painted in
the <hi>Chappel</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> such Draperies whose
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54218:107"/>
Folds are large, and whose Garments are course,
instead of which the <hi>Moses,</hi> which he has made
in <hi>Sculpture,</hi> is habited with a Drapery much
more close to the parts and holding more of the
<hi>Ancients.</hi> Nevertheless he is a <hi>Prophet</hi> as well as
those in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> a man of the same quality,
and to whom <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> ought to have given
the same Draperies, if he had not been hinder'd
by those very reasons which have been given
you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Marks or Ensigns of Vertues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶215.</note> &amp;c. That is
to say of the Sciences and Arts. The <hi>Italians</hi>
call a man a <hi>Vertuoso,</hi> who loves the noble Arts,
and is a Critick in them. And amongst our
<hi>French</hi> Painters, the word <hi>Vertueux,</hi> is understood
in the same Signification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But let not the work be too much enrich'd with
Gold or Iewels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶217.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> relates,
That <hi>Apelles having seen a</hi> Helena,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Paedag. cap. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>which a young
Scholar of his had made and adorn'd with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Golden Ornaments and Iewels, said to him, My
good Friend, though thou couldst not make her beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
at least thou hast made her rich.</hi> Besides that,
these glittering things in Painting, as precious
Stones prodigally strew'd over the habits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to each other, because they draw the
Sight to several places at the same time, and that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54218:107"/>
they hinder round Bodies from turning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their due effect; 'tis the very quantity which
often makes us judge that they are false. And be
sides it is to be presum'd, that precious things are
always rare.<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> 
                     <hi>Corinna,</hi> that learned <hi>Theban</hi> Lady,
reproach'd <hi>Pindar,</hi> whom she had five times
overcome in Poetry, that he scatter'd through
all his works the Flowers of <hi>Parnassus</hi> too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally,
saying to him, <hi>That men sow'd with the
Hand, and not with the Sack:</hi> for which reason
a Painter ought to adorn his Vestments with great
discretion. And precious Stones look exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
well, when they are set in those places which
we would make to come out of the Picture; <hi>as
for example,</hi> on a Shoulder, or an Arm to tie
some Drapery, which of it self is of no strong co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring.
They do also perfectly well with white
and other light Colours, which are us'd in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parts or Bodies forward, because Jewels
make a show and glitter through the opposition
of the great Lights in the deep brown, which
meet together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis very expedient to make a model of those things
which we have not in our Sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶220.</note> 
                     <hi>and whose nature is
difficult to be retain'd in the Memory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As for
example,</hi> the Grouppes of many Figures, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
difficult to be long kept, the Figures in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54218:108"/>
the Air, in Ceilings, or much rais'd above the
Sight; and even of Animals, which are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be dispos'd.</p>
                  <p>By this rule we plainly see how necessary it is
for a Painter to know how to <hi>model,</hi> and to have
many Models of soft Wax. <hi>Paul Veronese</hi> had
so good store of them, with so great a quantity of
different sorts, that he would paint a whole histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Composition on a perspective Plan, how
great and how diversified soever it were. <hi>Tinto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
practis'd the same, and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> (as
<hi>Giovan. Bapt. Armenini</hi> relates) made use of it,
for all the Figures of his <hi>day of Iudgment.</hi> 'Tis
not that I would advise any one who would
make any very considerable work, to finish after
these sorts of Models, but they will be of vast use
and advantage to see the Masses of great Lights,
and great Shadows, and the effect of the whole
together. For what remains, you are to have a
<note n="*" place="margin">A Figure made of wood or cork, turning upon joints.</note> Lay-man almost as big as the life, for every
Figure in particular, besides the natural Figure
before you, on which you must also look, and
call it for a witness, which must first confirm the
thing to you, and afterwards to the Spectators as
it is in reality.</p>
                  <p>You may make use of these Models with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
if you set them on a <hi>Perspective Plan,</hi> which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54218:108"/>
will be in the manner of a Table made on purpose.
You may either raise or let it down according to
your convenience; and if you look on your Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
through a hole so contriv'd, that it may be
mov'd up and down, it will serve you for a
point of Sight and a point of Distance, when
you have once fix'd it.</p>
                  <p>The same hole will further serve you to set
your Figures in the Ceiling and dispos'd upon a
Grate of Iron-wire, or supported in the Air by
little Strings rais'd at discretion, or by both ways
together.</p>
                  <p>You may joyn to your Figures what you see
fitting, provided that the whole be proportion'd
to them; and in short what you your self may
judge to be of no greater bigness than theirs. Thus,
in whatsoever you do there will be more of truth
seen, your work it self will give you infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and you will avoid many doubts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
which often hinder you, and chiefly for
what relates to <hi>lineal perspective,</hi> which you will
there infallibly find, provided that you remember
to proportion all things to the greatness of your
Figures and especially the points of Sight and of
Distance; but for what belongs to <hi>aerial perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi>
that not being found, the judgment must
supply it. <hi>Tintoret,</hi> as <hi>Ridolphi</hi> tells us in his life,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54218:109"/>
had made Chambers of Board and Past board,
proportion'd to his Models with Doors and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
through which he distributed on his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
artificial Lights, as much as he thought
reasonable, and often pass'd some part of the night
to consider and observe the effect of his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
His <hi>Models</hi> were of two Foot high.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are to consider the places where we lay the Scene
of the Picture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶221.</note> &amp;c. This is what Monsieur <hi>de
Chambray,</hi> calls, to do things according to <hi>Decorum.</hi>
See what he says of it, in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>that

not sufficient that in the Picture there be nothing
found which is contrary to the place, where the
action which is represented, passes; but we ought
besides, to mark out the place and make it known
to the Spectator by some particular Address,

discovering it, as whether it be <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or

enough to say what this <hi>Grace of Painting</hi> is; 'tis
to be conceiv'd and understood much more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than to be explain'd by words. It proceeds
from the illuminations of an excellent Mind,
which cannot be acquir'd, by which we give a
certain turn to things which makes them pleasing.
A Figure may be design'd with all its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and have all its parts regular, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, shall not be pleasing, if
all those parts are not put together in a certain
manner, which attracts the Eye to them, and
holds it fix'd upon them: For which reason
there is a difference to be made betwixt Grace
and Beauty. And it seems that <hi>Ovid</hi> had a mind
to distinguish them, when he said (speaking of
<hi>Venus</hi>)
<q>
                        <l>Multaque cum formâ gratia mista suit.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>A matchless Grace was with her Beauty mix'd.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Suetonius</hi> speaking of <hi>Nero,</hi> says, he was
rather beautifull than gracefull. <hi>Vultu pulchro,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54218:110"/>
magis quam venusto.</hi> How many fair women do
we see, who please us much less than others, who
have not such beautifull Features? 'Tis by this
grace that <hi>Raphael</hi> has made himself the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
of all the <hi>Italians,</hi> as <hi>Apelles</hi> by the same
means carry'd it above all the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is that in which the greatest difficulty consists,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶233.</note>
&amp;c. For two reasons, both because great study
is to be made as well upon the ancient Beauties and
on noble Pictures, as upon nature it self: and
also because that part depends entirely on the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and seems to be purely the gift of Heaven,
which we have receiv'd at our Birth, upon which
account our Author adds, <hi>Undoubtedly we see but
few, whom in this particular,</hi> Jupiter <hi>has regarded
with a gracious Eye, so that it belongs only to those
elevated Souls, who partake somewhat of Divinity to
work such mighty wonders.</hi> Though they who
have not altogether receiv'd from Heaven this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Gift, cannot acquire it without great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
nevertheless 'tis needfull in my opinion,
that both the one and the other should perfectly
learn the character of every Passion.</p>
                  <p>All the Actions of the <hi>sensitive Appetite</hi> are in
Painting call'd <hi>Passions,</hi> because the Soul is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by them, and because the Body suffers
through them, and is sensibly alter'd. They are
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54218:110"/>
those divers Agitations and different Motions of
the Body in general, and of every one of its parts
in particular, that our excellent Painter ought to
understand, on which he ought to make his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to form to himself a perfect Idea of them.
But it will be proper for us to know in the first
place, that the Philosophers admit eleven, <hi>Love,
Hatred, Desire, Shunning, Ioy, Sadness, Hope,
Despair, Boldness, Fear</hi> and <hi>Anger.</hi> The Painters
have multiply'd them not onely by their different
<hi>Degrees,</hi> but also by their different <hi>Species,</hi> for
they will make, <hi>for example,</hi> six persons in the
same degree of <hi>Fear,</hi> who shall express that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
all of them differently. And 'tis that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Species</hi> which distinguishes those Painters
who are <hi>able Artists,</hi> from those whom we
may call <hi>Mannerists,</hi> and who repeat five or six
times over in the same Picture the same Hairs
of a Head. There are a vast number of other
Passions, which are as the Branches of those which
we have nam'd: we might for example, under
the Notion of Love, comprehend <hi>Grace, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Civility; Caresses, Embraces,</hi> and <hi>Kisses,
Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Sweetness;</hi> and without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whether all these things which Painters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
under the name of <hi>Passions,</hi> can be reduc'd
to those of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> I am of opinion that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54218:111"/>
every one may use them at his pleasure, and that
he may study them after his own manner; the
name makes nothing. One may even make Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Majesty, fierceness, Dissatisfaction, Care, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
Sloathfulness, Envy,</hi> and many other things
like <hi>these.</hi> These <hi>Passions</hi> (as I have said,) ought
to be learnt from the life it self, or to be studied on
the <hi>Ancient Statues</hi> and <hi>excellent Pictures:</hi> we ought
to see, <hi>for example,</hi> all things which belong to
<hi>Sadness,</hi> or serve to express it to design them
carefully, and to imprint in our Memories after
such a manner, as we may distinctly understand
seven or eight kinds of them more or less, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after draw them upon Paper without
any other <hi>Original</hi> than the <hi>Image</hi> which we have
conceiv'd of them. We must be perfect Masters of
them: but above all, we must make sure of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
them throughly. We are to know that it is
such or such a stroke, or such a Shadow stronger
or weaker, which make such or such a <hi>Passion</hi> in
this or that degree. And thus, if any one should
ask you, what makes in Painting the <hi>Majesty</hi> of
a <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Gravity</hi> of a <hi>Hero,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of a
<hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Grief</hi> of a <hi>Madonna,</hi> the <hi>Hope</hi> of the
<hi>good Thief,</hi> the <hi>Despair</hi> of the <hi>bad One,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Beauty</hi> of a <hi>Venus,</hi> and in fine the <hi>Character</hi>
of any <hi>Passion</hi> whatsoever, you may answer posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54218:111"/>
on the spot, and with assurance, that it is
<hi>such a Posture</hi> or <hi>such lines</hi> in the parts of the <hi>Face,</hi>
form'd of <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such a fashion,</hi> or even the one
and the other both together: for the parts of the
Body separately, make known the <hi>Passions</hi> of
the <hi>Soul</hi> or else conjoyntly one with the other.
But of all the <hi>parts</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> is that which gives
the most of <hi>Life,</hi> and the most of <hi>Grace</hi> to the
<hi>Passion,</hi> and which alone contributes more to it,
than all the rest together. The <hi>others separately</hi>
can onely express some certain <hi>Passions,</hi> but the
<hi>Head</hi> expresses <hi>all of them;</hi> nevertheless there are
some which are more particular to it; as, <hi>for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
Humility,</hi> which it expresses by the stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or bending of the <hi>Head. Arrogance,</hi> when it
is lifted, or as we say, toss'd up. <hi>Languishment,</hi>
when we hang it on one side, or lean it upon one
Shoulder. <hi>Obstinacy</hi> (or as the <hi>French</hi> calls it <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniatreté,</hi>)
with a certain stubborn, unruly, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Humour, when 'tis held upright, stiff, and
poiz'd betwixt the Shoulders. And of the rest,
there are many marks more easily conceiv'd than
they can be express'd; as, <hi>Bashfulness, Admiration,
Indignation,</hi> and <hi>Doubt.</hi> 'Tis by the <hi>Head</hi> that
we make known more visibly our <hi>Supplications,</hi>
our <hi>Threatnings,</hi> our <hi>Mildness,</hi> our <hi>Haughtiness,</hi>
our <hi>Love,</hi> our <hi>Hatred,</hi> our <hi>Ioy,</hi> our <hi>Sadness,</hi> our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54218:112"/>
                     <hi>Humility;</hi> in fine, 'tis enough to see the <hi>Face,</hi> and
to understand the <hi>Mind</hi> at half a word. <hi>Blushing
and Paleness</hi> speak to us, as also the mixture of
them both.</p>
                  <p>The parts of the <hi>Face</hi> do all of them contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to expose the Thoughts of our <hi>Hearts;</hi> but
above the rest, the <hi>Eyes,</hi> which are as it were the
two Windows through which the Soul looks
out and shows it self. The <hi>Passions</hi> which they
more particularly express, are <hi>Pleasure, Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Disdain, Severity, Sweetness, Admiration</hi> and
<hi>Anger. Ioy</hi> and <hi>Sadness</hi> may bear their parts, if
they did not more especially proceed from the
<hi>Eye-brows</hi> and the <hi>Mouth.</hi> And the two parts
last nam'd agree more particularly in the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of those two <hi>Passions;</hi> nevertheless if you joyn
the <hi>Eyes</hi> as a third, you will have the Product of
a wonderfull Harmony for all the <hi>Passions</hi> of the
<hi>Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nose</hi> has no Passion which is particular
to it, it onely lends its assistance to the others
before nam'd, by the stretching of the <hi>Nostrils,</hi>
which is as much mark'd in <hi>Ioy,</hi> as it is in <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
And yet it seems that <hi>Scorn</hi> makes us wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
up the <hi>Nose</hi> and stretch the <hi>Nostrils</hi> also, at
the same time, drawing up the <hi>upper Lip</hi> to the
place which is near the corners of the <hi>Mouth.</hi> The
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54218:112"/>
                     <hi>Ancients</hi> made the <hi>Nose</hi> the seat of <hi>Derision; eum
subdolae irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>sioni dicaverunt,</hi> says <hi>Pliny;</hi> that is, they
dedicated the Nose to a cunning sort of Mockery.
We read in the <hi>3d. Satyre</hi> of <hi>Persius, Disce, sed ira
cadat Naso, rugosaque sanna;</hi> Learn; but let your
Anger fall from your Nose and the sneering
Wrinkles be dismounted. And <hi>Philostratus</hi> in
the Picture of <hi>Pan</hi> whom the <hi>Nymphs</hi> had bound,
and scornfully insulted over, says of that God;
"<hi>that before this, he was accustom'd to sleep with
a peaceable Nose, softning in his slumbers the
Wrinkles of it, and the Anger which commonly
mounted to that part; but now his Nostrils were
widen'd to the last degree of Fury.</hi>" For my own
part, I should rather believe that the <hi>Nose</hi> was the
seat of <hi>Wrath</hi> in Beasts than in Mankind, and
that it was unbecoming of any God but onely
<hi>Pan,</hi> who had very much of the Beast in him,
to wrinkle up his <hi>Nose</hi> in <hi>Anger,</hi> like other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
The moving of the <hi>Lips</hi> ought to be but
moderate, if it be in <hi>Conversation,</hi> because we
speak much more by the <hi>Tongue</hi> than by the <hi>Lips:</hi>
And if you make the <hi>Mouth</hi> very open, 'tis one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when you are to express the violence of <hi>Passion,</hi>
and more properly of <hi>Anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what concerns the <hi>Hands,</hi> they are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the <hi>Head,</hi> they are his Weapons and his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54218:113"/>
Auxiliaries; without them the action is weak,
languishing, and half dead, their Motions which
are almost infinite, make innumerable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Is it not by <hi>them,</hi> that we <hi>desire,</hi> that we
<hi>hope,</hi> that we <hi>promise,</hi> that we <hi>call towards us,</hi> and
that we <hi>reject?</hi> besides, <hi>they</hi> are the instruments
of our <hi>Threats,</hi> of our <hi>Petitions,</hi> of the <hi>Horror</hi>
which we show for things, and of the <hi>Praises</hi>
which we give them: By them we <hi>fear,</hi> we <hi>ask
Questions,</hi> we <hi>approve,</hi> and we <hi>refuse,</hi> we show
our <hi>Ioy</hi> and our <hi>Sadness,</hi> our <hi>Doubts,</hi> and our
<hi>Lamentations,</hi> our <hi>Concernments of Pity,</hi> and our
<hi>Admirations.</hi> In short, it may be said, that they
are the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Dumb,</hi> that they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
not a little to the speaking of the <hi>universal
Tongue,</hi> common to all the World, which is that
of <hi>Painting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to tell you how these parts are to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
so as to express the different <hi>Passions,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
no precise <hi>Rules</hi> can be given of it,
both because the task it self is infinite, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every one is left to the Conduct of his own
<hi>Genius,</hi> and to the Fruit of his former Studies;
onely remember to be carefull, that all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your Figures must be natural. "<hi>It seems
to me, says Quinctilian,</hi> speaking of the Passions,
<hi>That this part which is so noble and so great, is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54218:113"/>
not altogether unaccessible, and that an easie way
may be found to it; 'tis to consider nature and to
copy her, for the Spectators are satisfied, when in
artificial things they can discern that nature which
they are accustom'd to behold."</hi> This passage of
<hi>Quinctilian</hi> is perfectly explain'd by the words of
an excellent Master which our Author proposes
to us for a rule: they are these which follow. <hi>That
the studied Motions of the Soul, are never so natural
as those which we see in the transport of a true passion.</hi>
These Motions will better be express'd, and be
much more natural, if we enter into the same
thoughts, become of the same piece, and imagine
our selves to be in the same circumstances with
those whom we would represent. "<hi>For Nature,</hi>
says <hi>Horace</hi> in his Art of Poetry, <hi>disposes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of Mankind to all sorts of Fortunes, sometimes
she makes us contented, sometimes she drives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Choler, and sometimes she so oppresses us with
Grief, that she seems to tread us down and plunge us
into mortal Anxieties; and on all these occasions,
she drives outwards the Motions of the Heart by
the Tongue which is her Interpreter."</hi> Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> let the Painter say by the <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which are her Interpreters. "<hi>What means
have we,</hi> (says <hi>Quinctilian,) to give a Colour to
a thing if we have not the same Colour; 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54218:114"/>
that we our selves should first be touch'd
with a Passion before we endeavour to move others
with it. And how,</hi> continues he, <hi>can we be
touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d, since the Passions are not in our power?
This is the way in my opinion; We must form to our
selves the Visions and Images of absent things, as if
they were in reality before our Eyes; and he who
conceives these Images with the greatest strength of
Imagination, shall possess that part of the Passions
with the most advantage and the greatest ease."</hi> But
we must take care, as I have already said, that
in these visions, the Motions may be natural, for
there are some who imagine they have given abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Light to their Figures, when they have
made them do <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>extravagant Actions,</hi>
which we may more reasonably call the <hi>Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
or <hi>Contorsions of the Body,</hi> than the <hi>Passions of
the Mind;</hi> and by this means often put themselves
to much pains, to find a strong Passion, where
no Passion is requir'd. Add to all that I have
said concerning the Passions, that we are to have
a very serious regard to the quality of the Persons
who are to be express'd in <hi>Passions.</hi> The <hi>Ioy</hi> of a
<hi>King</hi> ought not to resemble that of a <hi>Serving-man.</hi>
And the <hi>Fierceness</hi> of a <hi>private Soldier</hi> must not be
like that of an <hi>Officer.</hi> In these differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
all the <hi>Fineness</hi> and <hi>Delicacy</hi> of the <hi>Passions.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54218:114"/>
Paulo Lomazzo</hi> has written at large on every
<hi>Passion</hi> in particular, in his <hi>second Book,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
you dwell not too long upon it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not to force your Genius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some Reliques of it took Sanctuary under ground,</hi>

&amp;c. All the ancient Painting that was in <hi>Italy</hi>
perish'd in the Invasion of the <hi>Hunns</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi>
excepting those works which were hidden under
ground or there painted, which by reason they
had not been much expos'd to view, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

                     <note place="margin">¶256.</note> &amp;c. The
third and last part of Painting, is call'd the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique</hi>
or Colouring. Its object is <hi>Colour,</hi> for
which reason, Lights and Shadows are therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
comprehended, which are nothing else but
white and brown (or dark,) and by consequence
have their place among the <hi>Colours. Philostratus</hi>
says in his life of <hi>Apollonius, "That it may be truly
call'd Painting which is made only with two Colours,
provided the Lights and Shadows be observ'd in it: for
there we behold the true resemblance of things with
their Beauties; we also see the Passions, though
without other Colours: so much of life may be also
express'd in it, that we may perceive even the very
Bloud: the Colour of the Hair and of the Beard,
are likewise to be discern'd, and we can distinguish
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54218:115"/>
without confusion, the fair from the black, and the
young from the old, the differences betwixt the white
and the flaxen hair; we distinguish with ease betwixt
the</hi> Moors <hi>and the</hi> Indians; <hi>not onely by the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<hi>Noses of the Blacks, their woolly Hair and
their high Iaws, but also by that black Colour which
is natural to them."</hi> We may add to what <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi>
has said, that with two onely Colours,
the Light and the Dark, there is no sort of Stuff
or Habit but may be imitated; we say then,
that the colouring makes its observations on the
Masses or Bodies of the Colours, accompany'd
with Lights and Shadows more or less evident by
degrees of diminution, according to the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
First of a luminous Body; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Sun or a Torch. Secondly, of a diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
or transparent Body, which is betwixt us
and the object, as the Air either pure or thick, or
a red Glass, &amp;c. Thirdly, of a solid Body illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
as a Statue of white Marble, a green
Tree, a black Horse, &amp;c. Fourthly, from his
part, who regards the Body illuminated, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
it either near or at a distance, directly
in a right Angle, or aside in an obtuse Angle, from
the top to the bottom, or from the bottom to the
top. This part in the knowledge which it has
of the vertue of Colours, and the Friendship
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54218:115"/>
which they have with each other, and also their
Antipathies, it comprehends the Strength, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo,
the Briskness, and the Delicacy which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in good Pictures, the management of <hi>Colours,</hi>
and the labour depend also on this last part.</p>

<hi>Drawing,</hi> which is the <hi>second part of Painting;</hi>
which consisting onely of Lines, stands altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in need of the <hi>Colouring</hi> to appear. 'Tis for
this reason, that our Author calls this part her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

<hi>Propositions</hi> to which we ought to agree, that

in the following part of this <hi>Treatise;</hi> they are
all founded on the Sense of <hi>Seeing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which ought to be the most,<note place="margin">¶280.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. See the</hi> Remark
of number 152.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That you may make the Bodies appear enlightned
by the shadows which bound your Sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶283.</note> &amp;c. That
is properly to say, that after the great Lights, there
must be great Shadows, which we call reposes:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54218:116"/>
because in reality the Sight would be tired, if it
were attracted by a Continuity of glittering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
The Lights may serve for a repose to the
Darks, and the Darks to the Lights. I have said in
another place, that a <hi>Grouppe of Figures</hi> ought to
be consider'd, as a <hi>Choir of Musick,</hi> in which the
<hi>Bases</hi> support the <hi>Trebles,</hi> and make them to be
heard with greater pleasure. These reposes are
made two several ways, one of which is <hi>Natural,</hi>
the other <hi>Artificial.</hi> The <hi>Natural</hi> is made by an
extent of Lights or of Shadows; which naturally
and necessarily follow solid Bodies, or the Masses
of solid Bodies aggroupp'd when the Light strikes
upon them. And the <hi>Artificial</hi> consists in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Colours, which the Painter gives to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things, such as pleases him; and composes
them in such a manner, that they do no injury
to the objects which are near them. A Drapery,
<hi>for example,</hi> which is made yellow or red on
some certain place, in another place may be
brown, and will be more suitable to it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the effect requir'd. We are to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as much as possibly we can, to make use of
the first manner, and to find the repose of which
we speak, by the Light and by the Shadow,
which naturally accompany solid Bodies. But
since the Subjects on which we work are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54218:116"/>
favourable to dispose the Bodies as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
a Painter in such a case may take his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by the Bodies of Colours, and put into such
places as ought to be darken'd, Draperies or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which we may suppose to be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brown and sully'd, which will produce the
same effect and give him the same reposes as the
Shadows would which could not be caus'd by the
disposition of the objects.</p>
                  <p>Thus, an understanding Painter will make his
advantages both of the one manner and the other.
And if he makes a design to be grav'd, he is to
remember that the <hi>Gravers</hi> dispose not their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
as the <hi>Painters</hi> do; and that by consequence
he must take occasion to find the reason of his
<hi>Design,</hi> in the natural Shadows of the Figures,
which he has dispos'd to cause the effect. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi>
has given us a full information of this in those
prints of his which he caus'd to be engrav'd; and
I believe that nothing was ever seen more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in that kind: the whole knowledge of
Grouppes, of the Lights and Shadows, and of
those Masses which <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is there expos'd so clearly to the Sight, that the
view of those <hi>Prints</hi> and the carefull observation
of them, might very much contribute to the
forming of an <hi>able Painter.</hi> The best and fairest
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54218:117"/>
of them are graven by <hi>Vorsterman, Pontius,</hi> and
<hi>Bolsvert,</hi> all of them admirable <hi>Gravers,</hi> whose
works <hi>Rubens</hi> himself took care to oversee, and
which without doubt you will find to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
if you examine them. But expect not there
the <hi>Elegance</hi> of <hi>Design,</hi> nor the <hi>Correctness</hi> of the
<hi>Out-lines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not but the Gravers can, and ought to
imitate the Bodies of the Colours by the degrees of
the Lights and Shadows, as much as they shall
judge that this imitation may produce a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
on the contrary, 'tis impossible in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to give much strength to what they grave,
after the works of the School, and of all those
who have had the knowledge of Colours and of
the Contrast of the Lights and Shadows, without
imitating in some sort the Colour of the Objects,
according to the relation which they have to the
degrees of white and black. We see certain Prints
of good <hi>Gravers</hi> different in their kinds, where
these things are observ'd, and which have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
strength. And there appears in publick
of late years, a <hi>Gallery</hi> of Arch-duke <hi>Leopold,</hi>
which though very ill graven, yet shows some
part of the Beauty of its <hi>Originals,</hi> because the
Gravers who have executed it, though otherwise
they were sufficiently ignorant, have observ'd in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54218:117"/>
almost the greatest parts of their Prints, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Colours in the relation which they have
to the degrees of the Lights and Shadows. I
could wish the <hi>Gravers</hi> would make some reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon this <hi>whole Remark,</hi> 'tis of wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>full
consequence to them; for when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to the knowledge of these reposes, they
will easily resolve those difficulties which many
times perplex them: And then chiefly when
they are to engrave after a Picture, where neither
the Lights and Shadows, nor the Bodies of the
Colours are skilfully observ'd, though in its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts the Picture may be well perform'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the same manner as we behold it in a Convex
Mirror,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶286.</note> &amp;c. A <hi>Convex Mirror</hi> alters the objects
which are in the middle, so that it seems to make
them come out from the <hi>Superficies.</hi> The Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
must do in the same manner in respect of the
Lights and Shadows of his Figures, to give them
more Relievo and more Strength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And let those which turn be of broken Colours,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶290.</note> 
                     <hi>as
being less distinguish'd and nearer to the borders,</hi> &amp;c.
'Tis the duty of a <hi>Painter,</hi> even in this also, to
imitate the <hi>Convex Mirror,</hi> and to place nothing
which glares either in Colour or in Light at the
borders of his Picture; for which, there are two
reasons, the first is, that the Eye at the first view
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54218:118"/>
directs it self to the midst of the object, which
is presented to it, and by consequence, must there
necessarily find the principal object, in order to
its satisfaction. And the other reason is, that the
sides or borders being overcharg'd with a strong
and glittering work attract the Eyes thither, which
are in a kind of Pain, not to behold a continuity
of that work, which is on the sudden interrupted,
by the borders of the Picture; instead of which
the borders being lighten'd and eas'd of so much
work, the Eye continues fixt on the Center of the
Picture, and beholds it with greater pleasure. 'Tis
for the same reason, that in a great composition
of Figures, those which coming most forward,
are cut off by the bottom of the Picture, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
make an ill effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A bunch of Grapes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶329.</note> &amp;c. 'Tis sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that <hi>Titian</hi> by this judicious and familiar
comparison, means that a Painter ought to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the objects, and to dispose them in such a
manner, as to compose one whole; the several
contiguous parts of which, may be enlighten'd;
many shadow'd and others of broken Colours to
be in the turnings, as on a Bunch of Grapes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Grapes, which are the parts of it, are in the
Light, many in the Shadow, and the rest faintly
colour'd to make them go farther back. <hi>Titian</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:54218:118"/>
once told <hi>Tintoret, That in his greatest works, a
Bunch of Grapes had been his principal rule and his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
guide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pure or unmix'd white,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶330.</note> 
                     <hi>either draws an object
nearer or carries it off to farther distance. It draws
it nearer with black, and throws it backward without
it,</hi> &amp;c. All agree that white can subsist on the
fore-ground of the Picture, and there be us'd
without mixture; the question therefore is to
know, if it can equally subsist and be plac'd in
the same manner, upon that which is backward,
the Light being universal and the Figures suppos'd
in a Campaign and open Field.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> concludes affirmatively, and the
reason on which he establishes his rule is this, That
there being nothing which partakes more of the
Light than Whiteness, and the Light being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of subsisting well in remoteness (or at a long
distance, as we daily see in the rising and setting
of the Sun) it follows that white may subsist in
the same manner. In Painting, the Light and a
white Colour are but one and the same thing.
Add to this, that we have no Colour, which
more resembles the Air than white, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
no Colour which is lighter, from whence
it comes that we commonly say, the Air is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
when we see the Heavens cover'd with black
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54218:119"/>
Clouds, or when a thick fog takes from us that
clearness, which makes the Lightness or Serenity
of the Air. <hi>Titian, Tintoret, Paul Veronese,</hi> and
all those who best understood Lights, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it in this manner, and no man can go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Precept, at least without renouncing
any skill in Landtschape, which is an undoubted
confirmation of this truth. And we see that all
the great <hi>Masters of Landtschape,</hi> have follow'd
<hi>Titian</hi> in this, who has always employ'd brown
and earthly Colours upon the fore-part, and has
reserv'd his greatest Lights for remotenesses and
the back parts of his <hi>Landtschapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be objected against this opinion, that
white cannot maintain it self in remotenesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is ordinarily us'd to bring the Objects
nearer, on the advanc'd part. 'Tis true, that so
it is us'd, and that to very good purpose, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Objects more sensible, by the opposition of
the Dark, which must accompany it; and which
retains it, as it were by force, whether the Dark
serves it for a ground, or whether it be combin'd
to it. <hi>For example,</hi> If you wou'd make a <hi>white
Horse</hi> on the fore-ground of your Picture, 'tis
of absolute Necessity, that the ground must be
of a mixt brown, and large enough, or that the
Furniture must be of very sensible Colours; or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54218:119"/>
lastly, that some Figure must be set upon it,
whose Shadows and the Colour may bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>But it seems (say you) that blue is the most
flying or transient Colour, because the Heavens
and Mountains, which are at the greatest distance,
are of that Colour. 'Tis very true that blue is one
of the lightest and sweetest Colours: But it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
true, that it possesses these qualities so much
the more, because the white is mingled in it, as
the example of the distances demonstrate to us.
But if the Light of your Picture be not universal,
and that you suppose your Figures in a Chamber,
then recall to your Memory that <hi>Theorem</hi> which
tells you that the nearer a Body is to the Light,
and the more directly 'tis oppos'd to us, so much
the more it is enlighten'd, because the Light
grows languishing, the farther it removes from
its original.</p>
                  <p>You may also extinguish your white, if you
suppose the Air to be somewhat thicker, and if
you foresee that this supposition will make a good
effect in the Oeconomy of the whole work; but
let not this proceed so far, as to make your Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
so brown, that they may seem as it were
in a filthy Fog, or that they may appear to be
part of the ground. See the following Remark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:54218:120"/>
                     <hi>But as for pure black,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶332.</note> 
                     <hi>there is nothing that brings
the Object nearer to the Sight,</hi> &amp;c. Because black
is the heaviest of all Colours, the most earthly,
and the most sensible. This is clearly understood
by the qualities of white which is oppos'd to it,
and which is, as we have said, the lightest of all
Colours. There are few who are not of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and yet I have known some, who have
told me, that the black being on the advanc'd
part, makes nothing but holes. To this there
is little else to be answer'd, but that black always
makes a good effect, being set forward, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it be plac'd there with Prudence. You are
therefore so to dispose the Bodies of your Pictures
which you intend to be on the fore-ground, that
those sorts of holes may not be perceiv'd, and
that the blacks may be there by Masses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
confus'd. See the <hi>47th.</hi> Rule.</p>
                  <p>That which gives the Relievo to a Bowl, (may
some say to me) is the quick Light, or the white,
which appears to be on the side, which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to us, and the black by consequence distances
the Object: we are here to beware, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the turnings with the distances: the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is onely in respect of Bodies, which are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by some distance of a backward Position,
and not of round Bodies, which are of the same
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54218:120"/>
Continuity: the brown which is mingled in the
turnings of the <hi>Bowl,</hi> makes them go off, rather
in confounding them, as we may say, than in
blackning them. And do you not see, that the
reflects are an Artifice of the Painter, to make
the turnings seem more Light, and that by this
means the greatest blackness remains towards the
middle of the <hi>Bowl,</hi> to sustain the white, and make
it deceive us with more pleasure.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black</hi> is of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that unless it be exactly practis'd, 'tis
impossible for a Picture to make any great effect,
that the Masses can be disentangl'd, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
distances may be observ'd at the first Glance
of the Eye without trouble.</p>
                  <p>It may be inferr'd from this <hi>Precept,</hi> that the
Masses of other Colours, will be so much the
more sensible, and approach so much the nearer
to the Sight the more brown they bear; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this be amongst other Colours which are of
the same Species. <hi>For example,</hi> A yellow brown
shall draw nearer to the Sight, than another
which is less yellow. I said provided it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Colours, which are of the same
Species, because there are simple Colours, which
naturally are strong and sensible, though they
are clear, as <hi>Vermillion;</hi> there are others also,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54218:121"/>
which notwithstanding that they are brown, yet
cease not to be soft and faint, as the blue of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ine.</hi>
The effect of a Picture comes not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore from the Lights and Shadows, but
also from the nature of the Colours. I thought
it was not from the purpose in this place to give
you the qualities of those Colours which are most
in use, and which are call'd Capital, because they
serve to make the composition of all the rest,
whose number is almost infinite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Red Oker</hi> is one of the most heavy Colours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yellow Oker</hi> is not so heavy, because 'tis clearer.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Masticot</hi> is very Light, because it is a
very clear yellow, and very near to white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ultramarine</hi> or <hi>Azure,</hi> is very light and a very
sweet Colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vermillion</hi> is wholly opposite to <hi>Ultramarine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lake</hi> is a middle Colour betwixt <hi>Ultramarine</hi>
and <hi>Vermillion,</hi> yet it is rather more sweet than
harsh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brown Red</hi> is one of the most earthy and most
sensible Colours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pinck</hi> is in its nature an indifferent Colour,
(that is) very susceptible of the other Colours
by the mixture: if you mix <hi>brown-red</hi> with it, you
will make it a very earthy Colour; but on the
contrary, if you joyn it with <hi>white</hi> or <hi>blue,</hi> you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54218:121"/>
shall have one of the most faint and tender Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Terre Verte</hi> (or green Earth) is light; 'tis a mean
betwixt <hi>yellow Oker</hi> and <hi>Ultramarine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Umbre</hi> is very sensible and earthy; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>pure black</hi> which can dispute with it.</p>
                  <p>Of all <hi>Blacks,</hi> that is the most earthly, which
is most remote from <hi>Blue.</hi> According to the
<hi>Principle</hi> which we have establish'd of <hi>white</hi> and
<hi>black,</hi> you will make every one of these Colours
before-nam'd more earthy and more heavy, the
more <hi>black</hi> you mingle with them, and they will
be light the more <hi>white</hi> you joyn with them.</p>
                  <p>For what concerns <hi>broken</hi> or <hi>compound Colours,</hi> we
are to make a judgment of their strength by the
Force of those Colours which compose them. All
who have thoroughly understood the agreement
of Colours, have not employ'd them wholly pure
and simple in their Draperies, unless in some Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
upon the fore-ground of the Picture; but they
have us'd <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>compound Colours,</hi> of which
they made a Harmony for the Eyes, by mixing
those which have some kind of Sympathy with each
other, to make a <hi>Whole,</hi> which has an Union with
the Colours which are neighbouring to it. The
Painter who perfectly understands the force and
power of his Colours, will use them most suitably
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54218:122"/>
to his present purpose, and according to his own
Discretion.</p>
                  <p>But let this be done relatively,<note place="margin">¶355.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. One Body
must make another Body fly off in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that it self may be chas'd by those Bodies
which are advanc'd before it.</hi> "We are to take
care and use great attention, <hi>says Quinctilian,</hi> not
onely of one separate thing, but of many which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
each other: and by a certain relation which they
have with each other, are as it were continued in the
same manner, as if in a straight Street, we cast our
Eyes from one end of it to the other, we discover
at once those different things which are presented to
the Sight, so that we not onely see the last, but
whatsoever is relating to the last."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let two contrary extremities never touch each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶361.</note>
&amp;c. The Sense of seeing has this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with all the rest of the Senses, that it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrs
the contrary Extremities. And in the same
manner as our hands, when they are very cold
feel a grievous pain, when on the sudden we hold
them near the Fire, so the Eyes which find an
extreme white, next to an extreme black, or a
fair cool Azure next to a hot Vermillion, cannot
behold these extremities without Pain, though
they are always attracted by the Glareing of two
contraries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54218:122"/>
This rule obliges us to know those Colours
which have a Friendship with each other, and
those which are incompatible, which we may
easily discover in mixing together those Colours
of which we would make trial.</p>
                  <p>And if by this mixture, they make a gracious
and sweet Colour, which is pleasing to the Sight,
'tis a Sign that there is an Union and a Sympathy
betwixt them: but if, on the contrary, that Colour
which is produc'd by the mixture of the two be
harsh to the Sight, we are to conclude, that there
is a Contrariety and Antipathy betwixt these two
Colours. <hi>Green,</hi> for example, is a pleasing Colour,
which may come from a <hi>blue</hi> and a <hi>yellow</hi> mix'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and by consequence <hi>blue</hi> and <hi>yellow</hi> are two
Colours which <hi>sympathize:</hi> and on the contrary,
the mixture of <hi>Blue</hi> with <hi>Vermillion,</hi> produces
a sharp, harsh, and unpleasant Colour; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then that <hi>Blue</hi> and <hi>Vermillion</hi> are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Nature. And the same may be said of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Colours of which you make the experiment.
And to clear that matter once for all, (see the
Conclusion of the <hi>332d. Remark,</hi> where I have
taken occasion to speak of the force and quality of
every Capital Colour,) yet you may neglect this
Precept, when your Piece consists but of one or
two Figures, and when amongst a great number
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54218:123"/>
you would make some <hi>one</hi> Figure more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than the rest. <hi>One</hi> I say, which is one of the
most considerable of the Subject, which otherwise
you cannot distinguish from the rest. <hi>Titian</hi> in
his triumph of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> having plac'd <hi>Ariadne</hi> on
one of the Borders of the Picture, and not being
able for that reason to make her remarkable by
the brightness of Light, which he was to keep in
the middle of his Picture, gave her a Scarf of a
<hi>Vermillion</hi> Colour, upon a <hi>blue</hi> Drapery, as well
to loosen her from his ground, which was a <hi>blue
Sea,</hi> as because she is one of the principal Figures
of his Subject, upon which he desir'd to attract
the Eye. <hi>Paulo Veronese,</hi> in his Marriage of <hi>Canaa,</hi>
because <hi>Christ</hi> who is the principal Figure of the
Subject, is carry'd somewhat into the depth of
the Picture, and that he cou'd not make him
distinguishable by the strength of the Lights and
Shadows, has cloath'd him with <hi>Vermillion</hi> and
<hi>Blue,</hi> thereby to conduct the Sight to that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>hostile Colours</hi> may be so much the more
ally'd to each other, the more you mix them
with other Colours, which mutually sympathize;
and which agree with those Colours, which you
desire to reconcile.</p>

He said in another place, Endeavour after that
which aids your Art, and is suitable to it, and
shun whatsoever is repugnant: 'tis the 59th. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi>
If the Painter wou'd arrive to the end he
has propos'd, which is to deceive the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ight, he
must make choice of such a Nature, as agrees with
the weakness of his Colours; because his Colours
cannot accommodate themselves to every sort of
Nature. This Rule is particularly to be observ'd,
and well consider'd, by those who paint <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Field or Ground of the Picture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶378.</note> &amp;c. The
reason of it is, that we are to avoid the meeting
of those Colours, which have an <hi>Antipathy</hi> to
each other, because they offend the Sight, so that
this Rule is prov'd sufficiently by the <hi>41st.</hi> which
tells us, that two contrary Extremities are never
to touch each other, whether it be in Colour, or
in Light, but that there ought to be a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, which partakes of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let your Colours be lively,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶382.</note> 
                     <hi>and yet not look (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Painters Proverb) as if they had been
sprinkled with Meal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Donner dans la farine,</hi> is
a Phrase amongst Painters, which perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
what it means, which is to paint with
clear, or bright Colours, and dull Colours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54218:124"/>
for being so mingled, they give no more
life to the Figures, than if they had been rubb'd
with Meal. They who make their flesh Colours
very white, and their Shadows grey or inclining
to green, fall into this inconvenience. Red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
in the Shadows of the most delicate or finest
Flesh, contribute wonderfully to make them live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
shining and natural; but they are to be us'd
with the same discretion, that <hi>Titian, Paul Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,
Rubens</hi> and <hi>Van Dyck,</hi> have taught us by their
example.</p>
                  <p>To preserve the Colours fresh, we must paint
by putting in more Colours, and not by rubbing
them in, after they are once laid; and if it could
be done, they should be laid just in their proper
places, and not be any more touch'd, when they
are once so plac'd; it would be yet better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Freshness of the Colours is tarnish'd and
lost, by vexing them with the continual Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Daubing.</p>
                  <p>All they who have colour'd well, have had
yet another Maxim to maintain their Colours
fresh and flourishing, which was to make use of
<hi>white Grounds,</hi> upon which they painted, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
at the first Stroke, without retouching
any thing, and without employing new Colours.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54218:124"/>
                     <hi>Rubens</hi> always us'd this way; and I have seen
Pictures from the hand of that great Person paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up at once, which were of a wonderfull Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                  <p>The reason why they made use of those kind
of Grounds, is, because white as well preserves
a Brightness, under the Transparency of Colours,
which hinders the Air from altering the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Ground, as that it likewise repairs
the injuries which they receive from the Air, so
that the Ground and the Colours assist and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
each other. 'Tis for this reason that glaz'd
Colours have a Vivacity which can never be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the most lively and most brillant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
because according to the common way,
the different Teints are simply laid on each in its
place one after another. So true it is, that white
with other strong Colours, with which we paint
at once that which we intend to glaze, are as it
were, the Life, the Spirit, and the Lustre of it.
The Ancients most certainly have found, that
white Grounds were much the best, because, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that inconvenience, which their
Eyes receiv'd from that Colour, yet they did not
forbear the use of it; as <hi>Galen</hi> testifies in his <hi>tenth
Book of the use of the parts. "Painters,</hi> says he,
<hi>when they work upon their white Grounds, place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54218:125"/>
them dark Colours, and others mixt with blue
and green, to recreate their Eyes, because white is
a glareing Colour, which wearies and pains the Sight
more than any other.</hi>" I know not the reason
why the use of it is left off at present, if it be not
that in our days there are few Painters who are
curious in their Colouring, or that the first Strokes
which are begun upon white, are not seen soon
enough, and that a more than <hi>French</hi> Patience is
requir'd to wait till it be accomplish'd; and the
Ground, which by its whiteness tarnishes the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre
of the other Colours, must be entirely cover'd
to make the whole work appear pleasingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the parts which are nearest to us and most rais'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶383.</note>
&amp;c. The reason of this is, that upon a flat su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, and as much united as a Cloth can be,
when it is strain'd, the least Body is very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and gives a heightning to the place which it
possesses; do not therefore load those places with
Colours, which you would make to turn; but
let those be well loaded, which you would have
come out of the Canvass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let there be so much Harmony or Consent in the
Masses of the Pictures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶385.</note> 
                     <hi>that all the shadowings may
appear as if they were but one,</hi> &amp;c. He has said in
another place, that after great Lights, great Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
are necessary, which he calls <hi>Reposes.</hi> What
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54218:125"/>
he means by the present <hi>Rule,</hi> is this, That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is found in those great Shadows, should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Colours of one another, so that the
different Colours which are well distinguish'd in
the Lights seem to be but one in the Shadows,
by their great Union.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the whole Picture be made of one Piece,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶386.</note> &amp;c.
That is to say, of one and the same Continuity
of Work, and as if the Picture had been painted
up all at once; the Latin says all of one Pallet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Looking Glass will instruct you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶387.</note> &amp;c. The
Painter must have a principal Respect to the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and to the Effect of the whole together. The
<hi>Looking-Glass</hi> distances the Objects, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
gives us onely to see the Masses, in which
all the little parts are confounded. The Evening,
when the Night approaches, will make you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understand this observation, but not so
commodiously, for the proper time to make it,
lasts but a quarter of an hour, and the <hi>Looking-Glass</hi>
may be usefull all the day.</p>
                  <p>Since the <hi>Mirror</hi> is the rule and Master of all
Painters, as showing them their faults by distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Objects, we may conclude that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
which makes not a good effect at a distance
cannot be well done; and a Painter must never
finish his Picture, before he has examin'd it at
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54218:126"/>
some reasonable distance, or with a <hi>Looking-Glass,</hi>
whether the Masses of the Lights and Shadows,
and the Bodies of the Colours be well distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Giorgione</hi> and <hi>Correggio</hi> have made use of
this method.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for a Portrait,<note place="margin">¶393.</note> or Pictures by the Life,</hi> &amp;c.
The end of <hi>Portraits</hi> is not so precisely as some
have imagin'd, to give a smiling and pleasing Air
together with the resemblance; this is indeed
somewhat, but not enough. It consists in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the true temper of those persons which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents,
and to make known their <hi>Physiognomy.</hi>
If the Person whom you draw, <hi>for example,</hi> be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
sad, you are to beware of giving him any
Gayety, which would always be a thing which
is foreign to his Countenanc. If he or she be
merry, you are to make that good Humour appear
by the expressing of those parts where it acts, and
where it shows it self. If the Person be grave
and majestical, the Smiles or Laughing, which
is too sensible, will take off from that Majesty and
make it look childish and undecent. In short,
the Painter, who has a good <hi>Genius</hi> must make a
true Discernment of all these things, and if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
<hi>Physiognomy,</hi> it will be more easie to
him, and he will succeed better than another.
<hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, "<hi>That</hi> Apelles <hi>made his Pictures so
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54218:126"/>
very like, that a certain Physiognomist and Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller,</hi>
(as it is related by <hi>Appion</hi> the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian)
<hi>foretold by looking on them the very time of
their Deaths, whom those Pictures represented, or
at what time their Death happen'd, if such persons
were already dead."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You are to paint the most tenderly that possibly you
can,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶403.</note> &amp;c. Not so as to make your Colours die
by force of tormenting them, but that you should
mix them as hastily as you can, and not retouch
the same place, if conveniently you can avoid
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Large Lights,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶403.</note> &amp;c. 'Tis in vain to take pains
if you cannot preserve large Lights, because
without them, your work will never make a
good effect at a distance; and also because lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Lights are confus'd and effac'd, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
as you are at a distance from the Picture.
This was the perpetual <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Correggio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ought to have somewhat of Greatness in them,<note place="margin">¶417.</note> and
their Out-lines to be noble, <hi>&amp;c. As the Pieces of</hi>
Antiquity <hi>will evidently show us.</hi>

                     <hi>There is nothing more pernicious to a Youth,</hi> &amp;c.
'Tis common to place our selves under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of a <hi>Master</hi> of whom we have a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and whose manner we are apt to embrace
with ease, which takes root more deeply in us,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54218:127"/>
and augments the more we see him work, and
the more we copy after him. This happens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
to that degree, and makes so great an
Impression in the Mind of the Scholar, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give his approbation to any other manner
whatsoever, and believes there is no man under
the Cope of Heaven, who is so knowing as <hi>his
Master.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is most remarakble in this point is,
that nature appears to us always like that manner
which we love, and in which we have been taught,
which is just like a Glass through which we behold
Objects, and which communicates its Colour to
them without our perceiving it. After I have
said this, you may see of what consequence is the
choice of a <hi>good Master,</hi> and of following in our
beginning the manner of those who have come
nearest to <hi>Nature.</hi> And how much injury do
you think have the ill manners which have been
in <hi>France,</hi> done to the Painters of that Nation, and
what hindrance have they been to the knowledge
of what is well done, or of arriving to what is so
when once we know it. The <hi>Italians</hi> say to those
whom they see infected with an ill manner, which
they are not able to forsake, <hi>"If you knew
just nothing, you would soon learn something."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Search whatsoever is aiding to your Art and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶433.</note>
                     <hi>and avoid those things which are repugnant to it,</hi>
&amp;c. This is an admirable <hi>Rule;</hi> a Painter
ought to have it perpetually present in his Mind
and Memory. It resolves those difficulties which
the <hi>Rules</hi> beget; it loosens his hands, and assists
his understanding. In short, this is the <hi>Rule</hi>
which sets the Painter at liberty, because it teaches
him that he ought not to subject himself servilely,
and be bound like an Apprentice to the <hi>Rules</hi> of
his Art; but that the <hi>Rules</hi> of his Art ought to be
Subject to him, and not hinder him from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dictates of his <hi>Genius,</hi> which is superior
to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bodies of diverse Natures which are aggroupp'd or
combin'd together are agreeable and pleasant to the
Sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶434.</note> &amp;c. As <hi>Flowers, Fruits, Animals, Skins,
Sattins, Velvets, beautifull Flesh, Works of Silver,
Armors, Instruments of Musick, Ornaments of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Sacrifices,</hi> and many other pleasing Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which may present themselves to the Painters
imagination. 'Tis most certain that the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Objects recreates the Sight, when they are
without confusion; and when they diminish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Subject on which we work. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
teaches us, that the Eye grows weary with
poring perpetually on the same thing, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54218:128"/>
on Pictures, but even on Nature it self. For
who is he who would not be tir'd in the Walks
of a long Forest, or with beholding a large plain
which is naked of Trees, or in the Sight of a Ridge
of Mountains, which instead of Pleasure, give us
onely the view of Heights and Bottoms. Thus
to content and fill the Eye of the Understanding,
the best Authors have had the Address to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
their Works with pleasing Digressions, with
which they recreate the Minds of Readers. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
in this as in all other things is the surest
Guide: and as tedious Digressions, which wander
from their Subject, are impertinent, so the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
who under Pretence of diverting the Eyes,
would fill his Picture with such varieties as alter
the truth of the <hi>History,</hi> would make a ridiculous
Piece of Painting, and a mere Gallimaufry of
his Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As also those things which appear to be perform'd
with ease,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶435.</note> &amp;c. This ease attracts our Eyes, and
Spirits so much the more, because it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
that a noble work, which appears so easie
to us, is the product of a skilfull Hand which is
Master of its Art. It was in this part, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi>
found himself superior to <hi>Protogenes,</hi> when
he blam'd him, for not knowing when to lay
down his Pencil (and as I may almost say) to make
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54218:128"/>
an end of finishing his Piece. And it was on
this account he plainly said, "<hi>That nothing was
more prejudicial to Painters than too much exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and that the greatest part of them knew not
when they had done enough:"</hi> as we have likewise
a Proverb, which says, <hi>An Englishman never knows
when he is well.</hi> 'Tis true, that the word <hi>enough</hi>
is very difficult to understand. What you have
to do, is to consider your Subject thoroughly,
and in what manner you intend to treat it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your rules, and the Force of your <hi>Genius;</hi>
after this you are to work with all the ease and
all the speed you can, without breaking your
head so very much, and being so very industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in starting Scruples to your self, and creating
difficulties in your work. But 'tis impossible to
have this Facility without possessing perfectly all
the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> and to have made it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
to you. For ease consists in making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
that work which you ought to make, and
to set every thing in its proper place with speed
and Readiness, which cannot be done without
the Rules, for they are the assur'd means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
you to the end that you design with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
'Tis then most certain, (though against
the opinion of many,) that the <hi>Rules</hi> give Facility,
Quiet of Mind, and readiness of Hand to the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54218:129"/>
Genius, and that the same <hi>Rules</hi> increase, and
guide that ease in those who have already receiv'd
it at their Birth from the happy influence of their
Stars.</p>
                  <p>From whence it follows that we may consider
<hi>Facility</hi> two several ways, either simply, as <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
and a <hi>readiness of Mind</hi> and of <hi>the Hand;</hi>
or as a <hi>Disposition in the Mind,</hi> to remove readily
all those difficulties which can arise in the work.
The first proceeds from an active temper full of
Fire; and the second from a true knowledge and
full possession of infallible Rules; the first is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
but it is not always without Anxiety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it often leads us astray, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the last makes us act with a Repose of Mind,
and wonderfull Tranquillity; because it ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
us of the goodness of our work. 'Tis a
great advantage to possess the first, but 'tis the
height of perfection to have both in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which <hi>Rubens</hi> and <hi>Van Dyck</hi> possessed them,
excepting the part of Design or Drawing, which
both too much neglected.</p>
                  <p>Those who say that the Rules are so far from
giving us this Facility, that on the contrary they
puzzle and perplex the Mind and tie the hand,
are generally such people who have pass'd half
their lives in an ill practice of Painting, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54218:129"/>
of which is grown so inveterate in them, that
to change it by the Rules, is to take as it were
their Pencils out of their hands, and to put them
out of condition of doing any thing; in the same
manner as we make a Country-man dumb whom
we will not allow to speak, but by the Rules of
Grammar.</p>
                  <p>Observe, if you please, that the Facility and
Diligence of which I spoke, consists not in that
which we call bold strokes and a free handling of
the Pencil, if it makes not a great effect at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
That sort of Freedom belongs rather to
a Writing-Master than a Painter. I say yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that 'tis almost impossible that things which
are painted should appear true and natural, where
we observe these sorts of bold strokes. And all
those who have come nearest to nature, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us'd that manner of Painting, those tender
Hairs, and those hatching strokes of the Pencil,
which make a kind of minced meat in Painting,
are very fine I must confess, but they are never
able to deceive the Sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor till you have present in your Mind a perfect
Idea of your work,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶442.</note> &amp;c. If you will have pleasure
in Painting, you ought to have so well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the oeconomy of your work, that it may
be entirely made and dispos'd in your head before
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54218:130"/>

flatter us; they are always too pleasing, and 'tis
impossible not to be fond of them at the moment
of their Conception. They are Children of a

our Hatred on them. 'Tis said, That Apes, as

Grace, which we shall easily make appear, if we are
carefull to cultivate that which Nature has given us
in propriety, and made our own, provided it be no
Vice or Imperfection: we ought to undertake nothing
which is repugnant to Nature in general; and when
we have paid her this duty, we are bound so reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
to follow our own Nature, that though many
things which are more serious and more important,
present themselves to us, yet we are always to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our Studies and our Exercises to our natural
Inclinations. It avails nothing to dispute against
Nature, and think to obtain what she refuses; for
then we eternally follow what we can never reach; for,
as the Proverb says, There is nothing can please, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be gracefull which we enterprize in spight
of <hi>Minerva;</hi> that is to say, in spight of Nature.
When we have consider'd all these things attentively,
it will then be necessary, that every man should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that in particular, which Nature has made
his portion, and that he should cultivate it with care;
'tis not his business to give himself the trouble of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether it will become him to put on the Nature
of another man; or as one would say, to act the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

Let every one therefore endeavour to understand his
own Talent, and without flattering himself, let him
make a true judgment of his own Vertues, and his
own Defects and Vices; that he may not appear to
have less judgment than the Comedians, who do
not always chuse the best Plays, but those which are
best for them; that is, those which are most in the
compass of their acting. Thus we are to fix on those
things for which we have the strongest Inclination.
And if it sometimes happen that we are forc'd by
necessity to apply our selves to such other things to
which we are no ways inclin'd; we must bring it so
about by our Care and Industry, that if we perform
them not very well, at least we may not do them so
very ill as to be sham'd by them: we are not so
much to strain our selves to make those Vertues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in us which really we have not, as to avoid
those Imperfections which may dishonour us." <hi>These
are the Thoughts and the Words of</hi> Cicero, <hi>which

'Tis impossible to become an able Artist, without
making your Art habitual to you: and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to gain an exact Habitude, without an
infinite number of Acts, and without perpetual
Practice. In all Arts the Rules of them are learn'd
in little time; but the perfection is not acquir'd
without a long Practice and a severe Diligence.
<hi>We never saw that Laziness produc'd any thing which
was excellent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diss. 34.</note> says <hi>Maximus Tyrius:</hi> and <hi>Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

That is to say, without working, without giving
some strokes of the Pencil or the Crayon. This
was the Precept of <hi>Apelles;</hi> and 'tis of so much the
more necessity, because Painting is an Art of much
length and time, and is not to be learn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great Practice. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> at the Age of

was the custom of <hi>Titian</hi> and the <hi>Carraches;</hi> there
are yet remaining in the hands of some who are
curious in Painting; many thoughts and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which those great Men have made on Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

continually about them.</p>
                  <p>Wine and good Cheer are no great Friends to Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">¶475.</note>
they serve onely to recreate the Mind when it is
oppress'd and spent with Labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "During
the time, <hi>says</hi> Pliny, that <hi>Protogenes</hi> was
drawing the Picture of <hi>Jalysus,</hi> which was the
best of all his Works, he took no other nourishment
than Lupines mix'd with a little water, which serv'd
him both for Meat and Drink, for fear of clogging
his Imagination by the Luxury of his Food." Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Angelo, <hi>while he was drawing his day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fed onely on Bread and Wine at Dinner.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54218:134"/>
And</hi> Vasari <hi>observes in his life, that he was so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that he slept but little, and that he often rose
in the Night to work, as being not disturb'd by
the Vapours of his thin Repasts.</hi>

and well-tasted Fruits proceeding from a
Tree which is incompass'd round, and choak'd
with Thorns and Bryars. Marriage draws a
world of business on our hands, subjects us to
Law-suits, and loads us with multitudes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Cares, which are as so many Thorns
that encompass a Painter, and hinder him
from producing his works in that perfection of
which otherwise he is capable. <hi>Raphael, Michael
Angelo,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal Carracci</hi> were never marry'd:
and amongst the Ancient Painters we find none
recorded for being marry'd, but onely <hi>Apelles,</hi> to
whom <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> made a present of his
own Mistress <hi>Campaspe;</hi> which yet I would have
understood without offence to the Institution of
Marriage, for that calls down many Blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Families, by the Carefulness of a vertuous
Wife. If Marriage be in general a remedy against
Concupiscence, 'tis doubly so in respect of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
who are more frequently under the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Sin than other Men; because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54218:134"/>
a frequent necessity to seeing Nature bare-fac'd.
Let every one examine his own strength upon
this point: but let him preferr the interest of his
<hi>Soul</hi> to that of his <hi>Art</hi> and of his <hi>Fortune.</hi>

&amp;c. I have said at the end of the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that both Poetry and Painting were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by the strength of Imagination. Now there
is nothing which warms it more than Repose and
Solitude: Because in that estate, the Mind being
freed from all sorts of business, and in a kind of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
undisturb'd by vexatious Visits, is more
capable of forming noble Thoughts and of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to its Studies.

"I enquir'd of a prudent man,<note place="margin">Petron. Ar biter.</note> (<hi>says a grave Author</hi>)
in what times those noble Pictures were made which
now we see; and desir'd him to explain to me some of
their Subjects, which I did not well understand. I
ask'd him likewise the reason of that great negligence
which is now visible amongst Painters: And from
whence it proceeded, that the most beautifull Arts
were now bury'd in Oblivion, and principally Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a faint Shadow of which is at present remaining
to us. To which he thus reply'd, That the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
desire of Riches had produc'd this change: For
of old, when naked Vertue had her Charms, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Arts then flourish'd in their Vigour: and if there
was any contest amongst men, it was onely who
should be the first Discoverer of what might be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to posterity. <hi>Lysippus</hi> and <hi>Myron,</hi> those
renown'd Sculptors, who could give a Soul to Brass,
left no Heirs, no Inheritance behind them, because
they were more carefull of acquiring Fame than Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
But as for us of this present Age, it seems
by the manner of our Conduct, that we upbraid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
for being as covetous of Vertue as we are of
Vice: wonder not so much therefore, if Painting has
lost its Strength and Vigour, because many are now of
opinion, that a heap of Gold is much more beautifull
than all the Pictures and Statues of <hi>Apelles</hi> and
<hi>Phidias,</hi> and all the noble Performances of <hi>Greece.</hi>"</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:54218:135"/>
I would not exact so great an act of Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from our modern Painters, for I am not
ignorant that the hope of gain is a wonderfull
sharp spur in Arts, and that it gives industry to
the Artist; from whence it was that <hi>Iuvenal</hi> said
even of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, who were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors
of Painting, and who first understood all
the Graces of it and its whole perfection;
<q>
                        <l>Graeculus esuriens, in Coelum, jusseris, ibit.</l>

                     </q>
But I could heartily wish, that the same hope
which flatters them did not also corrupt them:
and did not snatch out of their hands a lame,
imperfect Piece, rudely daub'd over with too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reflection and too much haste.</p>

                     <note place="margin">¶487.</note>
&amp;c. 'Tis to be confess'd that very few Painters
have those qualities which are requir'd by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
because there are very few, who are <hi>able Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
There was a time when onely they who were
of noble Blood, were permitted to exercise this Art;
because it is to be presum'd, that all these Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
of a good Painter, are not ordinarily found in
men of vulgar Birth. And in all appearance, we may
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54218:136"/>
hope that though there be no <hi>Edict</hi> in <hi>France</hi> which
takes away the Liberty of Painting from those to
whom Nature has refus'd the Honour of being
born Gentlemen, yet at least that the <hi>Royal Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
will admit hence-forward onely such who being
endu'd with all the good Qualities and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
which are requir'd for Painting, those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
may be to them instead of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Birth. 'Tis certain, that which debases Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and makes it descend to the vilest and most
despicable kind of Trade, is the great multitude
of Painters who have neither noble Souls nor any
Talent for the Art, nor even so much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sence. The Origin of this great Evil, is
that there have always been admitted into the
Schools of Painting all sorts of Children promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously,
without Examination of them, and
without observing for some convenient space of
time, if they were conducted to this Art by their
inward Disposition, and all necessary Talents,
rather than by a foolish Inclination of their own,
or by the Avarice of their Relations, who put them
to Painting, as a Trade which they believe to be
somewhat more gainfull than another. The

                     <hi>A Sublimity, and Reach of Thought,</hi> To conceive
radily, to produce beautifull Ideas, and to
work on their Subjects nobly and after a lofty
manner, wherein we may observe somewhat that
is delicate, ingenious and uncommon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A warm and vigorous Fancy,</hi> To arrive a least to
some degree of Perfection, without being tir'd
with the Pains and Study which are requir'd in
Painting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Health,</hi> To resist the dissipation of Spirits, which
are apt to be consum'd by Pains-taking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Youth,</hi> Because Painting requires a great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and a long Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Handsomeness,</hi> Because a Painter paints
himself in all his Pictures, and Nature loves to
produce her own Likeness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A convenient Fortune,</hi> That he may give his
whole time to study, and may work chearfully,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54218:137"/>
without being haunted with the dreadfull Image
of Poverty, ever present to his Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Labour,</hi> Because the Speculation is nothing
without the Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Love for his Art,</hi> We suffer nothing in the
Labour which is pleasing to us: or if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that we suffer, we are pleas'd with the Pain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to be under the Discipline of a knowing Master,</hi>
&amp;c. Because all depends on the Beginnings,
and because commonly they take the manner of
their Master, and are form'd according to his
Gusto: See <hi>Verse</hi> 422, and the <hi>Remark</hi> upon it.
All these good qualities are insignificant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the Painter, if some outward dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are wanting to him. By which I mean
favourable times, such as are times of <hi>Peace,</hi>
which is the Nurse of all noble Arts; there must
also some fair occasion offer to make their Skill
manifest by the performance of some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Work within their power: and a Protector,
who must be a Person of Authority, one who
takes upon himself their care of the Fortune, at
least in some measure; and knows how to speak
well of them in time and place convenient. <hi>'Tis
of much importance,</hi> says the Younger <hi>Pliny, in
what times Vertue appears. And there is no Wit, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
excellent it may be, which can make it self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54218:137"/>
known. Time and Opportunity are necessary
to it, and a person who can assist us with his favour
and be a Moecenas to us.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And Life is so short,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶496.</note> 
                     <hi>that it is not sufficient for so long
an Art,</hi> &amp;c. Not onely Painting but all other
Arts consider'd in themselves require almost an
infinite time to possess them perfectly. 'Tis in
this Sense that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> begins his Aphorisms
with this saying, <hi>That Art is long and Life is short.</hi>
But if we consider Arts, as they are in us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a certain degree of Perfection, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
enough, to make it known that we possess
them above the common sort, and are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
better than most others, we shall not find
that Life is too short on that account, provided
our time be well employ'd. 'Tis true, that Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is an Art which is difficult and a great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
But they who are endu'd with the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are necessary to it, have no reason to be
discourag'd by that apprehension.<note place="margin">Veget. de re Milit. lib. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Labour always
appears difficult before 'tis try'd.</hi> The passages by
Sea, and the Knowledge of the Stars, have been
thought impossible, which notwithstanding have
been found and compass'd, and that with ease by
those who endeavour'd after them.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de fin.</note>
                     <hi>'Tis a shamefull
thing,</hi> says, <hi>Cicero, to be weary of Enquiry, when
what we search is excellent.</hi> That which causes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54218:138"/>
us to lose most of our time, is the repugnance
which we naturally have to Labour, and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
the Malice, and the Negligence of our
Masters: we waste much of our time in walking
and talking to no manner of purpose, in making
and receiving idle Visits, in Play and other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which we indulge, without reckoning those
hours which we lose in the too great care of our
Bodies; and in Sleep, which we often lengthen out
till the day is far advanc'd: and thus we pass
that Life which we reckon to be short, because
we count by the years which we have liv'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by those which we have employ'd in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
'Tis evident that they who liv'd before us,
have pass'd through all those difficulties to arrive
at that Perfection which we discover in their Works,
though they wanted some of the Advantages
which we possess, and that none had labour'd for
them as they have done for us. For 'tis certain
that those Ancient Masters, and those of the last
preceding Ages, have left such beautifull Patterns
to us, that a better and more happy Age can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be than ours; and chiefly under the Reign of
our present King, who encourages all the noble
Arts, and spares nothing to give them the share
of that Felicity of which he is so bountifull to his
Kingdom: and to conduct them with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54218:138"/>
of advantages to that supreme Degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
which may be worthy of such a Master,
and of that Sovereign Love which he has for them.
Let us therefore put our hands to the work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being discourag'd by the length of time, which
is requisite for our Studies; but let us seriously
contrive how to proceed with the best Order, and
to follow a ready, diligent, and well understood
Method.</p>

                     <hi>O ye noble Youths! you
legitimate Offspring of</hi> Minerva, <hi>who are born under
the influence of a happy Planet.</hi> &amp;c. Our Author
intends not here to sow in a barren, ungratefull
Ground, where his Precepts can bear no Fruit:
He speaks to young, Painters, but to such onely
who are born under the Influence of a happy
Star; that is to say, those who have receiv'd from
Nature the necessary dispositions of becoming
great in the Art of Painting: and not to those
who follow that Study through Caprice or by a
sottish Inclination, or for Lucre, who are either
incapable of receiving the Precepts, or will make
a bad use of them when receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">¶509.</note> &amp;c. Our Author speaks not
here of the first Rudiments of Design; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
The management of the Pencil, the just
relation which the Copy ought to have to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54218:139"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He supposes, that before he begins
his Studies, one ought to have a Facility of Hand
to imitate the best Designs, the noblest Pictures
and Statues, that in few words he should have
made himself a Key, wherewith to open the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and to enter into that Sacred
Place, where those fair Treasures are to be found
in all abundance, and even offer themselves to
us, to make our advantage of them by our Care
and Genius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You are to begin with Geometry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶509.</note> &amp;c. Because
that is the Ground of <hi>Perspective,</hi> without which
nothing is to be done in Painting: besides, <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
is of great use in <hi>Architecture,</hi> and in all things
which are of its dependence; 'tis particularly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for <hi>Sculptors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Set your self on designing after the Ancient Greeks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶510.</note>
&amp;c. Because they are the Rule of Beauty, and
give us a good Gusto: For which reason 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proper to tie our selves to them, I mean ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
speaking; but the particular Fruit which
we gather from them, is what follows. To
learn by heart four several Ayres of Heads: of a
Man, a Woman, a Child, and an Old Man.
I mean those which have the most general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
for example those of the <hi>Apollo,</hi> of
the <hi>Venus de Medices,</hi> of the little <hi>Nero,</hi> (that is,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54218:139"/>
when he was a Child,) and of the God <hi>Tiber.</hi> It
would be a good means of learning them, if when
you have design'd one after the Statue it self, you
design it immediately after from your own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
without seeing it; and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
if your own work be conformable to the
first Design. Thus exercising your self on the
same Head, and turning it on ten or twelve sides;
you must do the same to the Feet, to the Hands,
to the whole Figure. But to understand the
Beauty of these Figures, and the justness of their
Outlines, it will be necessary to learn <hi>Anatomy:</hi>
when I speak of four Heads and four Figures, I
pretend not to hinder any one from designing
many others after this first Study, but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is onely to show by this, that a great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things undertaken at the same time, dissipates
the Imagination, and hinders all the Profit; in
the same manner as too many sorts of Meat are
not easily digested, but corrupt in the Stomach
instead of nourishing the parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And cease not Day or Night from Labour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶511.</note> 
                     <hi>till by
your continual Practice,</hi> &amp;c. In the first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the Students have not so much need of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
as of Practice: And the Antique Statues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rule of Beauty, you may exercise your
selves in imitating them without apprehending
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54218:140"/>
any consequence of ill Habits and bad Ideas,
which can be form'd in the Soul of a young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner.
'Tis not, as in the School of a Master,
whose Manner and whose Gust are ill, and under
whose Discipline the Scholar spoils himself the
more he exercises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when afterwards your Iudgment shall grow
stronger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">¶514.</note> &amp;c. 'Tis necessary to have the Soul
well form'd, and to have a right Judgment to make
the Application of his rules upon good Pictures,
and to take nothing but the good. For there are
some who imagine, that whatsoever they find in
the Picture of a Master, who has acquir'd Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
must of necessity be excellent; and these
kind of people never fail when they copy to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the bad as well as the good things; and to
observe them so much the more, because they
seem to be extraordinary and out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
road of others, so that at last they come to
make a Law and Precept of them. You ought
not also to imitate what is truly good in a crude
and gross Manner, so that it may be found out
in your works, that whatsoever Beauties there are
in them, come from such or such a Master. But
in this imitate the Bees, who pick from every
Flower that which they find most proper in it
to make Honey. In the same manner a young
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54218:140"/>
Painter should collect from many Pictures what
he finds to be the most beautifull, and from his
several Collections form that Manner which
thereby he makes his own.</p>

                  <head>THE
JUDGMENT
OF
Charles Alphonse du Fresnoy,
On the Works of the Principal and Best
PAINTERS of the two last Ages.</head>
                  <p>PAINTING was in its Perfection amongst
the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The principal Schools were at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
afterwards at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi>
and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and at last in <hi>Rome.</hi> Wars and
Luxury having overthrown the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, it
was totally extinguish'd, together with all the noble
Arts, the Studies of Humanity, and the other Sciences.</p>
                  <p>It began to appear again in the Year 1450 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
some Painters of <hi>Florence,</hi> of which <hi>DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENICO
GHIRLANDAIO</hi> was one, who was
Master to <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> and had some kind of
Reputation, though his manner was <hi>Gothique</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:54218:142"/>
                     <hi>MICHAEL ANGELO</hi> his Scholar, flourish'd
in the times of <hi>Julius</hi> the second, <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, <hi>Paul</hi>
the third, and of eight successive Popes. He was a
<hi>Painter,</hi> a <hi>Sculptor,</hi> and an <hi>Architect,</hi> both Civil
and Military. The Choice which he made of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
was not always beautifull or pleasing: His Gust
of Designing was not the finest, nor his Out-lines the
most elegant: The Folds of his Draperies, and the
Ornaments of his Habits, were neither noble nor grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
He was not a little fantastical and extravagant
in his Compositions; he was bold even to Rashness, in
taking Liberties against the Rules of Perspective. His
Colouring is not over true or very pleasant. He
knew not the Artifice of the Lights and Shadows: But
he design'd more learnedly, and better understood all the
Knittings of the Bones, with the Office and Situation
of the Muscles, than any of the modern Painters. There
appears a certain Air of Greatness and Severity in his
Figures, in both which he has oftentimes succeeded:
But above the rest of his Excellencies, was his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
skill in Architecture, wherein he has not onely
surpass'd all the Moderns, but even the Ancients also:
The St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s of <hi>Rome,</hi> the St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the <hi>Palazzo Farnese,</hi> and
his own <hi>House,</hi> are sufficient Testimonies of it. His
Scholars were <hi>Marcello Venusto, Andrea de Vater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
Il Rosso, Georgio Vasari, Fra. Bastiano,</hi> (who
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54218:142"/>
commonly painted for him) and many other <hi>Florentines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PIETRO PERUGINO</hi> design'd with sufficient
knowledge of Nature, but he is dry and his manner
little. His Scholar was</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RAPHAEL SANTIO,</hi> who was born on Good
Friday, in the Year 1483, and died on Good Friday,
in the Year 1520: So that he liv'd onely 37 years
compleat. He surpass'd all modern Painters, because
he possess'd more of the excellent parts of Painting
than any other; and 'tis believ'd, that he equall'd the
Ancients, excepting onely that he design'd not naked
Bodies with so much Learning, as <hi>Michael Angelo:</hi>
But his Gust of Designing is purer and much better.
He painted not with so good, so full, and so gracefull
a manner as <hi>Correggio;</hi> nor has he any thing of the
Contrast of the Lights and Shadows, or so strong and
free a Colouring, as <hi>Titian;</hi> but he had a better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in his Pieces without comparison, than either
<hi>Titian, Correggio, Michael Angelo,</hi> or all the
rest of the succeeding Painters to our days. His
Choice of Postures, of Heads, of Ornaments, the Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
of his Drapery, his manner of Designing,
his Varieties, his Contrasts, his Expressions, were beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in Perfection; but above all, he possess'd the
Graces in so advantageous a manner, that he has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since been equall'd by any other. There are
Protraits (or single Figures of his) which are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54218:143"/>
Pieces. He was an admirable Architect. He
was handsome, well made, and tall of Stature, civil,
and well-natur'd, never refusing to teach another what
he knew himself. He had many Scholars, amongst
others, <hi>Julio Romano, Polydore, Gaudens, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovanni
d'Udine,</hi> and <hi>Michael Coxis.</hi> His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was <hi>Marc Antonio,</hi> whose Prints are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the correctness of their Out-lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JULIO ROMANO</hi> was the most excellent of
all <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Scholars; he had Conceptions which were
more extraordinary, more profound, and more eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
than even his Master himself. He was also a great
Architect, his Gust was pure and exquisite. He was
a great Imitator of the Ancients, giving a clear Testimony
in all his Productions, that he was desirous to restore to
Practice the same Forms and Fabricks which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
He had the good Fortune to find great persons
who committed to him the care of <hi>Edifices, Vestibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
and <hi>Portico's,</hi> all <hi>Tetrastyles, Xistes, Theatres,</hi>
and such other places as are not now in use. He was
wonderfull in his Choice of Postures. His manner
was drier and harder than any of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s School.
He did not exactly understand the Lights and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
or the Colours. He is frequently harsh and
ungracefull: The Folds of his Draperies are neither beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
nor great, easie nor natural, but all extravagant
and too like the Habits of fantastical Comedians. He
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54218:143"/>
was very knowing in humane Learning. His Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
were <hi>Pirro Ligorio,</hi> (who was admirable for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Buildings, as for Towns, Temples, Tombs, and
Trophies, and the Situation of Ancient Edifices)
<hi>Aeneas Vico, Bonasone, Georgio Mantuano,</hi> and
others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>POLYDORE,</hi> Scholar to <hi>Raphael,</hi> design'd
admirably well, as to the practical part, having a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Genius for Freezes, as we may see by those of
white and black, which he has painted at <hi>Rome.</hi> He
imitated the Ancients, but his manner was greater
than that of <hi>Julio Romano:</hi> Nevertheless <hi>Julio</hi>
seems to be the truer. Some admirable Grouppes are
seen in his Works, and such as are not elsewhere to be
found. He colour'd very seldom, and made Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schapes
of a reasonable good Gusto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GIO. BELLINO,</hi> one of the first who was of
any consideration at <hi>Venice,</hi> painted very drily accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the manner of his time. He was very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both in Architecture and Perspective. He was
<hi>Titian</hi>'s first Master, which may easily be observ'd in
the first Painting of that noble Scholar, in which we
may remark that Propriety of Colours which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
has observ'd.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>GEORGIONE</hi> the Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Titian</hi> came to excell in Portraits or Face-paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and also in great Works. He first began to make
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54218:144"/>
choice of Glowing and Agreeable Colours; the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and entire Harmony of which were afterwards to
be found in <hi>Titian</hi>'s Pictures. He dress'd his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
wonderfully well: And it may be truly said, that
but for him, <hi>Titian</hi> had never arriv'd to that height
of Perfection, which proceeded from the Rivalship and
Iealousy of Honour betwixt those two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TITIAN</hi> was one of the greatest Colourists, who
was ever known; he design'd with much more Ease and
Practice than <hi>Georgione.</hi> There are to be seen Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children of his hand, which are admirable
both for the Design and Colouring: the Gust of them
is delicate, charming and noble, with a certain pleasing
Negligence of the Head-dresses, the Draperies and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Habits, which are wholly peculiar to him.
As for the Figures of Men, he has design'd them but
moderately well. There are even some of his Draperies,
which are mean and savour of a little gust. His
painting is wonderfully glowing, sweet and delicate.
He made Portraicts, which were extremely noble; the
Postures of them being very gracefull, grave, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sify'd,
and adorn'd after a very becoming fashion. No
man ever painted Landtschape, with so great a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
so good a colouring, and with such a resemblance
of Nature. For eight or ten years space, he copy'd
with great labour and exactness whatsoever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took;
thereby to make himself an easy way, and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54218:144"/>
some general maximes for his future conduct.
Besides the excellent gust which he had of Colours, in
which he excell'd all Mortal Men, he perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how to give every thing the touches which were
most suitable, and proper to them, such as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
them from each other; and which gave the
greatest Spirit, and the most of Truth. The Pictures
which he made in his beginning, and in the declension of
his Age, are of a dry, and mean manner. He liv'd
ninety nine years. His Scholars were <hi>Paulo Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,
Giacomo Tintoret, Giacomo da Ponte,
Bassano,</hi> and his Brothers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PAULO VERONESE</hi> was wonderfully graceful
in his Airs of Women: with great variety of shining
Draperies; and incredible vivacity, and ease. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
his Composition is sometimes improper; and his
Design is uncorrect. But his colouring, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
depends on it, is so very charming in his Pictures,
that it surprizes at the first sight, and makes us totally
forget those other qualities which are wanting in
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TINTORET</hi> was Scholar to <hi>Titian,</hi> great in
the practical part of Designing; but sometimes also
sufficiently extravagant. He had an admirable Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
for Painting, if he had had as great an affection
to his Art, and as much patience in undergoing the
difficulties of it, as he had fire and vivacity of Nature:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54218:145"/>
He has made Pictures, not inferiour in beauty to those
of <hi>Titian:</hi> his Composition and his Dresses, are for
the most part improper; and his Out-lines are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect:
But his Colouring, and the dependencies of it,
like that of his Master, are most admirable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>BASSANS</hi> had a more mean and poorer gust
in Painting than <hi>Tintoret;</hi> and their Designs were
also less correct than his. They had indeed an excellent
gust of Colours; and have touch'd all kinds of Animals
with an admirable manner: But were notoriously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
in the Composition and Design.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CORREGGIO</hi> painted at <hi>Parma</hi> two large Cupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's
in Fresco, and some Altar-pieces. This Artist,
found out certain natural and unaffected Graces, for
his <hi>Madonnas',</hi> his <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>little Children,</hi>
which were particular to him. His Manner is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great, both for the design and for the work, but
withall is very uncorrect. His Pencil was both easie
and delightfull, and 'tis to be acknowledg'd, that he
painted with great Strength, great Heightning, great
Sweetness, and liveliness of Colours, in which none sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
him.</p>
                  <p>He understood how to distribute his Lights in such
a manner as was wholly peculiar to himself, which gave
a great force and great roundness to his Figures. This
manner consists in extending a large Light, and then
making it lose it self insensibly in the dark shadowings,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54218:145"/>
which he plac'd out of the Masses. And those give
them this great roundness, without our being able to
perceive from whence proceeds so much of force, and
so vast a pleasure to the Sight. 'Tis probable, that in
this part the rest of the <hi>Lombard School</hi> copied him:
he had no great choice of gracefull Postures, nor of
distribution for beautifull Grouppes: his Design often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appears lame, and the Positions are not much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in them. The Aspects of his Figures are many
times unpleasing; but his manner of designing Heads,
Hands, Feet, and other parts, is very great, and well
deserves our imitation. In the conduct and finishing
of a Picture, he has done wonders; for he painted with
so much Union, that his greatest Works seem'd to have
been finish'd in the compass of one day; and appear,
as if we saw them from a <hi>Looking-glass.</hi> His <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schape</hi>
is equally beautifull with his <hi>Figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time with <hi>Correggio,</hi> liv'd and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
<hi>PARMEGIANO;</hi> who besides his great man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of well Colouring, excell'd also both in Invention
and Design, with a <hi>Genius</hi> full of gentleness and of
spirit, having nothing that was ungracefull in his
choice of Postures and in the dresses of his Figures,
which we cannot say of <hi>Correggio:</hi> there are Pieces
of his to be seen, which are both beautifull and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:54218:146"/>These two Painters last mention'd, had very good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but they are known onely to those of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and besides there is little to be credited of what
his <hi>Country-men</hi> say, for Painting is wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
amongst them.</p>
                  <p>I say nothing of <hi>LEONARDO da VINCI,</hi>
because I have seen but little of his, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
the Arts at <hi>Milan,</hi> and had many Scholars
there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LUDOVICO CARRACCI,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
and <hi>Augustine,</hi> studied at <hi>Parma</hi> after <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reggio;</hi>
and excell'd in Design and Colouring, with
such a Gracefulness, and so much Candour, that <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
the Scholar of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> did afterwards imitate
him with great success. There are some of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
to be seen, which are very beautifull, and well
understood. He made his ordinary residence at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi>
and it was He, who put the Pencil into the
hands of <hi>Hannibal</hi> his Nephew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HANNIBAL</hi> in a little time excell'd his Master,
in all parts of Painting: He imitated <hi>Correggio,
Titian,</hi> and <hi>Raphael,</hi> in their different manners as
he pleas'd, excepting onely that you see not in his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
the Nobleness, the Graces, and the Charms of
<hi>Raphael,</hi> and that his Out-lines are neither so pure,
nor so elegant as his. In all other things, he is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
accomplish'd, and of an <hi>Universal Genius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:54218:146"/>
                     <hi>AUGUSTINO,</hi> Brother to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> was also
a very good Painter, and an admirable Graver. He
had a Natural Son, call'd <hi>ANTONIO,</hi> who dyed
at the age of 35, and who according to the general
opinion, wou'd have surpass'd his Uncle <hi>Hannibal:</hi>
for by what he left behind him, it appears that he was
of a more lofty Genius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GUIDO</hi> chiefly imitated <hi>Ludovico Carracci,</hi> yet
retain'd always somewhat of the manner which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Lawrence</hi> the <hi>Flemming</hi> taught him. This
<hi>Lawrence</hi> liv'd at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and was Competitor and
Rival to <hi>Ludovico Carracci: Guido</hi> made the same
use of <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> did of old <hi>Ennius:</hi>
borrow'd what pleas'd him, and made it afterwards his
own: that is, he accommodated what was good in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
to his own manner: which he executed with so
much gracefulness and beauty, that He alone got more
Money, and more Reputation in his time, than his own
Masters, and all the Scholars of the <hi>Carraches,</hi> though
they were of greater capacity than himself. His Heads
yield no manner of precedence to those of <hi>Raphael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SISTO BADOLOCCHI</hi> design'd the best of all
his Scholars: but he dy'd young.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DOMENICHINO</hi> was a very knowing Painter,
and very laborious, but otherwise of no great Natural
Endowments: 'tis true, he was profoundly skill'd in all
the parts of Painting, but wanting <hi>Genius,</hi> as I said,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54218:147"/>
he had less of nobleness in his Works than all the rest
who studied in the School of the <hi>Carraches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ALBANO</hi> was excellent in all that belong'd to
Painting, and adorn'd with variety of Learning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JOHN LANFRANC,</hi> a Man of a great and
sprightly wit, supported his Reputation for a long time
with an extraordinary gust of Design and Colouring.
But his foundation being onely on the practical part, be
at length lost ground in point of correctness: so that
many of his Pieces appear extravagant and fantastical.
And after his Decease, the School of the <hi>Carraches</hi>
went dayly to decay in all the parts-Painting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GIO. VIOLA</hi> was very old before he learn'd
Landtschape, the knowledge of which was imparted to
him by <hi>Hannibal Carracche,</hi> who took pleasure to
instruct him, so that he painted many of that kind
which are wonderfully fine and well colour'd.</p>
                  <p>If we cast our eyes towards <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> we may there behold <hi>ALBERT DU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RER,
LUCAS VAN LEYDEN, HOLBEIN,
ALDEGRAVE,</hi> and <hi>ISBIN,</hi> who were all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries.
Amongst these, <hi>Albert Durer</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bein,</hi>
were both of them wonderfully knowing and had
certainly been of the first form of Painters, had they
travell'd into <hi>Italy:</hi> For nothing can be laid to their
charge, but onely that they had a <hi>Gothique</hi> Gust. As
for <hi>Holbein,</hi> he perform'd yet better than <hi>Raphael;</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:54218:147"/>
and I have seen a <hi>Portrait</hi> of his Painting, with
which one of <hi>Titian</hi>'s could not come in Competition.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> we had <hi>RUBENS,</hi> who
deriv'd from his Birth, a lively, free, noble and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<hi>Genius.</hi> A <hi>Genius</hi> which was capable not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of raising him to the rank of the <hi>Ancient Painters,</hi>
but also to the highest employment in the Service of his
Country: so that he was chosen for one of the most
important <hi>Embassies</hi> of our Age. His Gusto of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
savours somewhat more of the <hi>Flemming</hi> than
of the Beauty of the Antique, because he stay'd not long
at <hi>Rome.</hi> And though we cannot but observe in all
his Paintings, somewhat of great and noble; yet it
must be confess'd, that generally speaking, he design'd
not correctly: But for all the other parts of Painting,
he was as absolute a Master of them, and possess'd them
all as throughly as any of his Predecessors in that noble
Art. His principal Studies were made in <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
after the Works of <hi>Titian, Paul Veronese</hi> and <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toret;</hi>
whose Cream he has skimm'd (if you will allow
the Phrase) and extracted from their several Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
many general Maxims and infallible Rules, which
he always follow'd, and by which he has acquir'd in his
Works, a greater Facility than that of <hi>Titian;</hi> more
of Purity, Truth and Science, than <hi>Paul Veronese;</hi>
and more of Majesty, Repose and Moderation, than
<hi>Tintoret.</hi> To conclude, His manner is so solid, so
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54218:148"/>
knowing, and so ready, that it may seem, this rare
accomplish'd Genius was sent from Heaven to instruct
Mankind in the Art of Painting.</p>
                  <p>His School was full of admirable Scholars, amongst
whom <hi>VAN DYCK</hi> was he, who best comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Rules and general Maxims of his Master;
and who has even excell'd him in the delicacy of his
Colouring and in his Cabinet Pieces; but his Gust in
the designing Part, was nothing better than that of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens.</hi>

PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Title</hi> having onely promis'd a <hi>short
Account of the most Eminent Masters,</hi>
&amp;c. the <hi>Reader</hi> must expect to find very
little more in the small Compass of these <hi>few Sheets,</hi> than
the Time <hi>when,</hi> the Place <hi>where,</hi> by <hi>whose</hi> Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in what particular <hi>Subject</hi> each of those
<hi>great Men</hi> became <hi>Famous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>first part,</hi> which comprehends the <hi>prime
Masters</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> I have follow'd <hi>Pliny:</hi> yet
not blindly, or upon his <hi>Authority</hi> alone, but chiefly
in those places, where I have found his <hi>Evidence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the concurrent <hi>Testimony</hi> of other <hi>Writers.</hi>
The <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Fran. Junius</hi> I have diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd,
and examin'd most of the <hi>Records</hi> cited in it.
I have also read over the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Four Principal
Painters</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> written in <hi>Italian,</hi> by <hi>Carlo Dati</hi>
of <hi>Florence,</hi> together with his learned <hi>Annotations</hi>
upon them: and in a word, have left nothing unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that cou'd give me any manner of <hi>Assistance</hi> in this
present <hi>Undertaking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Chronological part,</hi> because I foresaw that
the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and the <hi>Years of Rome,</hi> would be of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54218:150"/>
little use to the generality of <hi>Readers,</hi> I have adjusted
them to the two <hi>Vulgar Aeras</hi> (viz.) the <hi>Creation of
the World,</hi> and the <hi>Birth of Christ.</hi> The <hi>Greek Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents</hi>
I have likewise reduc'd into <hi>English Money:</hi> but
to justifie my <hi>Account,</hi> must observe, that here (as in
most <hi>Authors,</hi> where a <hi>Talent</hi> is put absolutely, and
without any other Circumstance) the <hi>Talentum Atticum
Minus</hi> is to be understood; which according to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Computation comes to about 187 l. 10 s. of <hi>our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
the <hi>Majus</hi> being about 62 l. 10 s. more.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>latter part,</hi> which contains the <hi>Masters</hi> of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Note amongst the <hi>Moderns,</hi> I have been equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
not onely searching into all the most considerable
<hi>Writers,</hi> who have left us any <hi>Memorandums</hi> relating
to them; but also in procuring from <hi>Rome,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the best <hi>Advice</hi> that possibly I could get, concerning
those <hi>Painters</hi> who are but lately deceas'd, and whose
<hi>Lives</hi> have never yet appear'd in <hi>Print.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> I have
taken such <hi>Guides,</hi> as I had reason to believe, were best
acquainted in that Country: and in <hi>France, Germany,
Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> have been govern'd by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
who have been most conversant in <hi>those</hi> Parts. For
the <hi>Roman, Florentine,</hi> and some other particular
<hi>Masters,</hi> I have apply'd my self to the <hi>Vite de' Pittori,
&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Giorgio Vasari,</hi> and that excellent <hi>Treatise</hi> of
<hi>Gio: Pietro Bellori</hi> on the same Subject. For the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard
School,</hi> I have consulted the <hi>Maraviglie dell'
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54218:150"/>
Arte</hi> of <hi>Cavalier Ridolfi.</hi> For the <hi>Bolognese Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
the <hi>Felsina Pittrice</hi> of <hi>Conte Carlo Cesare Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasia.</hi>
For those of <hi>Genoua,</hi> the <hi>Vite de' Pittori,</hi> &amp;c.
of <hi>Rafaelle Soprani nobile Genouese.</hi> For the <hi>French
Masters,</hi> the <hi>Entretiens sur les Vies,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Felibien.</hi>
For the <hi>German, Flemish,</hi> and <hi>Dutch Painters,</hi> (of
whom I have admitted but <hi>very few</hi> into this <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi>
the <hi>Academia nobilissimae Artis Pictoriae,</hi> of
<hi>Sandrart,</hi> and the <hi>Schilder-Boeck</hi> of <hi>Carel van Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
For those of <hi>our own Country,</hi> I am asham'd
to acknowledge how difficult a matter I have found it, to
get but the least <hi>Information</hi> touching some of those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Men,</hi> whose <hi>Works</hi> have been a <hi>Credit</hi> and
<hi>Reputation</hi> to it. That all our <hi>Neighbours</hi> have a
greater value for the <hi>Professors</hi> of this <hi>noble Art,</hi> is
sufficiently evident, in that there has hardly been any <hi>one
Master<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> of <hi>tolerable Parts</hi> amongst them, but a <hi>Crowd</hi>
of <hi>Writers,</hi> nay some <hi>Pens</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> too, have been
imploy'd in adorning their <hi>Lives,</hi> and in transmitting their
<hi>Names</hi> honourably to <hi>Posterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Characters of the <hi>Italians</hi> of the <hi>first Form,</hi>
I have all along referr'd the <hi>Reader</hi> to the <hi>Judgment</hi>
of Monsieur <hi>du FRESNOY</hi> in the <hi>preceding Pages.</hi>
But for the rest, I have from the <hi>Books</hi> above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
and the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Learned,</hi> briefly shewn,
wherein their different <hi>Talents</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
chusing always (in the little Room to which I have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54218:151"/>
been confin'd) to set the best side forwards, especially
where their <hi>few Faults</hi> have been <hi>over-balanc'd</hi> by
their <hi>many Virtues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Figures</hi> in the <hi>Margin</hi> it will easily appear,
how careful I have every-where been, to preserve the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Time,</hi> which indeed was the <hi>thing</hi> principally
<hi>intended</hi> in these <hi>Papers.</hi> Some few <hi>Masters</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

the <hi>Method</hi> here made use of, is more <hi>regular,</hi> and quite
<hi>different</hi> from any thing that has been hither to <hi>publish'd</hi>

taken greater Care in <hi>drawing</hi> them <hi>true,</hi> and that my

                  <p>BY whom, and in what particular Age the <hi>Art</hi>
of <hi>Painting</hi> was first invented in <hi>Greece,</hi>
Ancient <hi>Authors</hi> are not agreed. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ascribes
the honour of it to <hi>EUCHIR,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An. Mun. 2730.</note> a Kinsman of the
famous <hi>Daedalus,</hi> who flourish'd <hi>Anno 1218</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Birth of <hi>Christ; Theophrastus</hi> pleads for
<hi>POLIGNOTUS</hi> the <hi>Athenian, Athenagoras</hi> for
<hi>SAURIAS</hi> of <hi>Samos;</hi> some contend for <hi>PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLES</hi>
the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and others again for <hi>CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES</hi>
of <hi>Corinth.</hi> But howsoever the Learned
may differ in their Opinions touching the <hi>Inventer,</hi>
yet as to the <hi>Art</hi> it self, all of them are unanimous,
that its first appearance amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was
in no better a dress than the bare <hi>Shadow of a
Man,</hi> or <hi>some other Body,</hi> circumscrib'd with
a single line onely, call'd by them <hi>Sciagraphia,</hi>
and by the <hi>Latines, Pictura Linearis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first step made towards the advancement
of <hi>Painting,</hi> was by <hi>ARDICES</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi>
and <hi>TELEPHANES</hi> of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> or <hi>CRATO</hi> of the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54218:152"/>
same City; who began to add other lines, by
way of shadowing their Figures, to make them
appear round, and with greater strength. But
so inconsiderable were the advantages, which the
Authors of this <hi>Manner</hi> (call'd <hi>Graphice)</hi> gain'd
by their <hi>Invention,</hi> that they still found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
to write under each piece, the name of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual thing which they endeavour'd to
represent, least otherwise the Spectators shou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to discover what they intended
by it.</p>
                  <p>The next Improvement, was by <hi>CLEOPHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS</hi>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who first attempted to fill up his
<hi>Out-lines</hi> with a single Colour: from whence his
Pieces, and those of <hi>HYGIEMON, DINIAS,</hi> and
<hi>CHARMAS</hi> his followers, got the name of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochromata,
(viz.)</hi> Pictures of one colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>EUMARUS</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> began to paint Men
and Women in a manner different from each
other, and ventured to imitate all sorts of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
but was far excell'd by his Disciple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CIMON</hi> the <hi>Cleonaean,</hi> who found out the Art
of Painting <hi>Historically,</hi> design'd his Figures in
variety of Postures, distinguish'd the several parts
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54218:152"/>
of the Body by their Joints, and was the first who
took notice of the folds of Draperies in his Pieces.</p>
                  <p>In what Century the <hi>Masters</hi> abovemention'd
liv'd, <hi>Antiquity</hi> has given us no Account: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is,<note place="margin">An. Mun. 3198.</note> that about the time of the Foundation
of <hi>Rome, Anno 750 ante Chr.</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
<hi>Painting</hi> to such a height of Reputation, that
<hi>Candaules</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> sirnam'd <hi>Myrsilus,</hi> the
last of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> and who was kill'd by <hi>Gyges
Anno quarto Olymp. 16.</hi> for a Picture made by
<hi>BULARCHUS,</hi> representing a Battel of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesians,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PANAENUS</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> liv'd <hi>Olymp. 83. Anno

the Battel at <hi>Marathon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3502.</note> between the <hi>Athenians</hi>
and <hi>Persians,</hi> so very exactly, that <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and
all the General Officers on both sides, were easily
to be known, and distinguish'd from each other in
that Piece.</p>

                     <hi>PHIDIAS</hi> his Brother, the Son of <hi>Charmidas,</hi>
flourish'd <hi>Olymp. 84. Anno 442 ante Chr.</hi> and was
famous both for <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3506.</note> but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the latter so profoundly skill'd, that
his Statue of <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> was by the <hi>Ancients</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:54218:153"/>
esteem'd one of the Seven wonders of the World,
as his <hi>Minerva,</hi> in the <hi>Citadel</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> made of
Ivory and Gold, was (by way of Eminence) call'd
<hi>the Beautiful Form.</hi> He was very intimate with
<hi>Pericles,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General; and so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
upon that account, and for the Glory which
he acquir'd by his Works, that his Enemies cou'd
never be at rest till they had plotted him into a
Prison, and had there (as some say) taken away
his Life by Poison.</p>
                  <p>

87. Anno 430 ante Chr.</hi> and beside the Honour
which he gain'd, by having brought the <hi>Bass-Relievo</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>POLYGNOTUS</hi> the <hi>Thasian,</hi> was the Disciple
of his Father <hi>Aglaophon,</hi> and particularly famous
for representing Women; whom he painted in
lightsom and shining Draperies, adorning their
heads with dresses of sundry colours, and giving
a greater freedom to his Figures, than had been
us'd by any of his Predecessors. His principal
Works, were those which he made <hi>gratis</hi> in the

call'd the <hi>Various;</hi> in honour of which it was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
decreed, in a great Council of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phictyons,</hi>
that where-ever he should travel in <hi>Greece,</hi>

the <hi>Art</hi> of mingling his Colours, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the Lights and Shadows.<note place="margin">3546.</note> He was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
also for his judicious choice of Nature, and
in the beauty and strength of his Figures surpassed
all the Masters who went before him. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54218:154"/>
likewise in <hi>Sculpture,</hi> but was surnam'd the

though <hi>Cicero, Pliny,</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi> tell us,
there were but four Colours then in use (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<hi>white, yellow, red</hi> and <hi>black.</hi> He was censur'd by
some, for making his Heads too big; and by
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> for not being able to express the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Passions. He was very famous not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
for the <hi>Helena</hi> which he painted for
the People of <hi>Crotona;</hi> in the Composition of
which he collected from five naked Virgins (the
most beautiful the Town cou'd produce)
whatever he observ'd Nature had form'd most
perfect in each, and united all those admirable
parts in that single Figure. He was extoll'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for several other Pieces; but being very rich,
cou'd never be prevail'd upon to fell any of
them, because he thought them to be above any
price; and therefore chose rather to give them
away freely to <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Cities.</hi> He died (as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54218:154"/>
'tis generally said) of a fit of Laughter, at the
sight of a Comical old Woman's Picture, which
he had drawn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PARRHASIUS</hi> a Native of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of <hi>Athens,</hi> was the Son and Disciple of <hi>Evenor,</hi>
and the Contemporary of <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> whom he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
in the noted Contest between them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him with a Curtain, which he had painted
so excellently well, that his Antagonist mistook it
for the Nature it self. He was the first who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Rules of <hi>Symmetry</hi> in his works; and
was much admired for the liveliness of his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and for the gayety and graceful Airs of his
Heads: but above all, for the softness and elegance
of his <hi>Out-lines,</hi> and for rounding off his Figures,
so as to make them appear with the greater strength
and relievo. He was wonderfully fruitful of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
had a particular talent in small pieces,
especially in wanton Subjects, and finish'd all
his works to the last degree of perfection. But
withall was so extravagantly vain and arrogant,
that he commonly writ himself <hi>Parrhasius</hi> the
<hi>Beau,</hi> the <hi>Sir Courtly</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) went cloath'd
in purple, with a Crown of Gold upon his
Head, pretended to derive his Pedigree from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
and styl'd himself the <hi>Prince of his Profession.</hi>

Yet, to his great affliction, was humbl'd at last by</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TIMANTHES</hi> of <hi>Sicyon</hi> (or as some say, of
<hi>Cythnus)</hi> who in a Dispute betwixt them, was by
the majority of Votes declared the better <hi>Painter:</hi>
And besides was as eminent for the singular mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and sweetness of his Disposition, as for the
agreeable variety of his Invention, and peculiar
happiness in moving the Passions. His most ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
works were the <hi>sleeping Polyphemus,</hi> and
the <hi>Sacrifice of Iphigenia;</hi> in both which (as in all
his other Performances) his distinguishing <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>
appear'd, in making more to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
than was really express'd in his Pieces.</p>
                  <p>In this time also flourish'd <hi>EUPOMPUS</hi> of
<hi>Sicyon,</hi> an excellent Artist, and whose Authority
was so very considerable, that out of the two
<hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> the <hi>Asiatick</hi> and the <hi>Greek,</hi> he
made a third, by dividing the last into the <hi>Attick</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAMPHILUS</hi> a Native of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who to

that without the help of <hi>Geometry,</hi> no <hi>Painter</hi> could
ever arrive at perfection. He was the first who

112,<note place="margin">3618.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno 330 ante Chr.</hi> He improv'd the

<hi>School</hi> of <hi>Pamphilus;</hi> and afterwards by degrees
became so much in esteem with <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi>
that by a public <hi>Edict</hi> he strictly commanded,
that no other <hi>Master</hi> shou'd presume to make his
<hi>Portrait;</hi> that none but <hi>Lysippus</hi> of <hi>Sicyon</hi> shou'd
cast his <hi>Statue</hi> in <hi>Brass;</hi> and that <hi>Pyrgoteles</hi> onely
shou'd grave his <hi>Image</hi> in <hi>Gems</hi> and <hi>Precious Stones.</hi>
And in farther testimony of his particular respect
to <hi>this Artist,</hi> he presented him, even with his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54218:156"/>
most beautiful and charming Mistress <hi>Campaspe,</hi>
with whom <hi>Apelles</hi> had fall'n in Love, and by
whom 'twas suppos'd he copy'd his <hi>Venus (Anadyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene</hi>)
rising out of the Sea. <hi>Grace</hi> was his <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
portion,</hi> as <hi>our Author</hi> tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 150, and
211. In which, and in knowing when he had
done <hi>Enough,</hi> he transcended all who went before
him, and did not leave his Equal in the world.
He was miraculously skill'd in taking the true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
and features of the Face: Insomuch that
(if <hi>Apion</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> may be credited) <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomists</hi>
upon sight of his Pictures onely, cou'd
tell the precise time of the parties death. He was
admirable likewise in representing people in their
last Agonies. And in a word, so great was the
veneration paid by <hi>Antiquity</hi> to his Works, that
several of them were purchas'd with heaps of
Gold, and not by any set number or weight of
pieces. He was moreover extremely candid and
obliging in his temper, willing to instruct all
those who ask'd his advice, and generous even to
his most potent Rivals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PROTOGENES</hi> of <hi>Caunus,</hi> a City of <hi>Caria</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

miserably poor, and very little regarded in his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54218:157"/>
own <hi>Country,</hi> till <hi>Apelles</hi> having made him a visit,
to bring him into Reputation, bought up several
of his Pictures, at greater rates than he ask'd for
them; and pretending, that he design'd to sell 'em
again for his own work, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> were glad
to redeem them upon any terms. Whose Disciple
he was, is not certainly known; but 'tis general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm'd, that he spent the greatest part of his
life in painting Ships, and Sea-pieces onely: yet
applying himself at last to nobler Subjects, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an <hi>Artist</hi> so well accomplish'd, that <hi>Apelles</hi>
confess'd he was in all respects at least equal to
himself, excepting onely, that never knowing when
to leave off, by overmuch diligence, and too nice
a correctness, he often dispirited and deaden'd the

which he made in <hi>Brass:</hi> but his most celebrated
piece of <hi>Painting,</hi> was that of <hi>Ialysus,</hi> which cost

                  <p>Of <hi>MELANTHIUS</hi> we have nothing certain,

                     <hi>Art;</hi> and amongst many excellent Pieces, painted
<hi>Aristratus</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian</hi> Tyrant, in a Triumphal
Chariot, attended by <hi>Victory,</hi> putting a wreath

liv'd in the same <hi>Olympiad</hi> with <hi>Apelles,</hi> and
was the first who by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> attain'd a
perfect knowledge of expressing the Passions and
Affections of the Mind. And though his colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was somewhat hard, and not so very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as cou'd be wish'd, yet notwithstanding so
much were his Pieces admir'd, that after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
<hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> gave an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Talents</hi> (18750 <hi>lib.)</hi> for one of them.</p>
                  <p>His Contemporary was <hi>ASCLEPIODORUS</hi> the
<hi>Athenian,</hi> equally skill'd in the Arts of <hi>Sculpture</hi>
and <hi>Painting;</hi> but in the latter, chiefly applauded
for the beauties of a correct <hi>Style,</hi> and the truth of
his Proportion: In which <hi>Apelles</hi> declared himself
as much inferior to this <hi>Artist,</hi> as he was to <hi>AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHION,</hi>
in the ordering, and excellent dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Figures. The most famous <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiodorus,</hi>
were those of the <hi>twelve Gods,</hi> for
which <hi>Mnason</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Elatea,</hi> gave him the

got the surname of <hi>Rhyparographus.</hi> Yet though
his Subjects were poor, his Performance was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;

great skill in the distribution of the lights and

all sorts of four-footed <hi>Animals,</hi> beyond
any <hi>Master</hi> in his time. His most celebrated
Piece was that of <hi>Homer's Hell;</hi> for which having

King <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> he generously

shake off the stiffness of the <hi>Greek Masters;</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

of the Mind: but cou'd not come up to the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of the Eyes, the tenderness of the Flesh, or
the strength of the Muscles in naked Figures. He

Yet however his neglect of seasoning his Studies

whom he had drawn bound to a Tree,
with his hands tied over his head. In which Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
besides the delicacy of its Colouring, and
gracefulness of the Posture, the proportion of its
Parts was so admirably just and true, that all the

colour'd with more Strength and Beauty, gave
a better Relievo, more Life, and a nobler Spirit
to his Figures, and was the first who found out
the admirable effects of strong Lights and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,

bred up in the School of <hi>Gio. Bellino,</hi> at the same

He was censur'd indeed by <hi>M. Angelo Buo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naroti,</hi>

Reputation of <hi>Titian,</hi> that there was hardly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any Eminence then living, from whom he
did not receive some particular mark of Esteem:
and besides, being of a temper wonderfully obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

constant <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of all the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

of him; and fearing, that he might in time
come to eclipse his Reputation, sent him upon
pretended business to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
and there found such means to divert him
from <hi>Painting,</hi> that he quite gave over the study

Yet however, in <hi>Sculpture</hi> he succeded better: and

he could never order them so as to please himself:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54218:173"/>

tedious about it, that in the space of eleven years
he would admit no body to see what he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
He was also of so mean and pitiful a

                     <note place="margin">1494.</note> so call'd from the
place where he was born, <hi>Anno</hi> 1494, was at first
a Disciple of his <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Painter</hi> of note, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
of <hi>Cornelius Engelbert:</hi> and wonderfully
cry'd up in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> for his
skill in <hi>Painting,</hi> and <hi>Graving.</hi> He was prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
laborious in his Works, and a great <hi>Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:54218:174"/>
of <hi>Albert Durer:</hi> with whom he became at
length so intimate, that they drew each others
<hi>Picture.</hi> And indeed their <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> are
in all respects so very much alike, that it seem'd
as if one and the same <hi>Soul</hi> had animated them
both. He died <hi>Anno</hi> 1533, after an interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and some other <hi>Painters</hi> at <hi>Middleburgh:</hi>
where disputing, and falling out in their Cups,
<hi>Lucas</hi> fancying they had poyson'd him,<note place="margin">Aet. 39.</note> languish'd
by degrees, and pined away purely with conceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QUINTIN MATSYS</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
of <hi>Lucas;</hi> and famous for having been
transform'd from a <hi>Blacksmith</hi> to a <hi>Painter,</hi> by the
force of <hi>Love,</hi> and for the sake of a <hi>Mistress,</hi> who
dislik'd his former <hi>profession.</hi> He was a painful
and diligent Imitator of the <hi>ordinary Life,</hi> and much
better at representing the <hi>defects,</hi> than the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Nature.</hi> One of his best Pieces is a <hi>Descent
from the Cross</hi> (in a Chapel of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp)</hi>
for which, and a multitude of other <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and <hi>Portraits,</hi> he gain'd a great number of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers;
especially for his <hi>Curiosity</hi> and <hi>Neatness,</hi>
which in truth, was the principal part of his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
He died <hi>Anno</hi> 1529.</p>

                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:54218:174"/>Beside the two <hi>Masters</hi> last mention'd, there
were several other <hi>History-painters,</hi> who flourish'd
in <hi>Germany, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> about this time.
But their <hi>manner</hi> being generally <hi>Gothique, Hard,</hi>
and <hi>Dry;</hi> more like the <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>Cimabue,</hi> in the
<hi>Dawning</hi> of the <hi>Art of Painting,</hi> than the <hi>Gusto</hi> of
<hi>Raphael,</hi> in its <hi>Meridian Lustre;</hi> we shall onely
give you the names of some of the most noted;
and such were <hi>Mabuse, Aldegraef, Schoorel, Frans
Floris, Martin Hemskerck, Chris. Schwarts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>POLIDORO</hi> of <hi>CARAVAGGIO,</hi> in the Dutchy
of <hi>Milan,</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1495,<note place="margin">1495.</note> and brought up
to no better an imployment than carrying <hi>Stone</hi>
and <hi>Mortar,</hi> in the <hi>New-buildings</hi> of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X.
But being tempted at last by the performances of
<hi>Gio. d'Udine,</hi> to try his <hi>Talent</hi> in <hi>Designing:</hi> by the
assistance of one of <hi>his Scholars,</hi> and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Application to the <hi>Antiquities,</hi> in a little
time he became so skilful an <hi>Artist,</hi> that he had
the honour of contributing much to the finishing
those glorious Works in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> He associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself both in the Study and Practice of his
<hi>Art</hi> with one <hi>MATURINO,</hi> a <hi>Florentine;</hi> and their
<hi>Genius</hi> being very conformable, they liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:54218:175"/>
whereby they acquir'd great reputation; their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
being the richest, and their <hi>Design</hi> the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that could any where be seen. But <hi>Maturino</hi>
dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1527, and <hi>Rome</hi> being then in the
hands of the <hi>Spaniards, Polidoro</hi> retir'd to <hi>Naples,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Messina;</hi> where his excellent
<hi>Talent</hi> in <hi>Architecture</hi> also being highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he was order'd to prepare the <hi>Triumphal Arches</hi>
for the reception of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. from
<hi>Tunis;</hi> for which he was nobly rewarded: and
being afterwards desirous of seeing <hi>Rome</hi> once
more; in his return thither was murther'd by his
Servant and Accomplices, for the sake of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and bury'd at <hi>Messina,</hi>

Angelo,</hi> improv'd himself by the help of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy;</hi>
which he understood so very well, that he
compos'd two <hi>Books</hi> upon that Subject. He had a
copious <hi>Invention,</hi> great skill in the mixture of his
<hi>Colours,</hi> and in the management of his <hi>Lights</hi>
and <hi>Shadows:</hi> was very happy also in his <hi>Naked
Figures,</hi> which he express'd with a good <hi>Relievo,</hi> and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54218:175"/>
proper <hi>Attitudes;</hi> and would have excell'd in all
the parts of <hi>Paintinig,</hi> had he not been too <hi>licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>extravagant</hi> sometimes, and suffer'd himself
rather to be hurry'd away with the heat of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<hi>Fancy,</hi> than govern'd by his own <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art.</hi> From <hi>Florence</hi> his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
carry'd him to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into <hi>France;</hi> where by his Works in the
<hi>Galleries</hi> at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and by several proofs
which he gave of his extraordinary knowledge in
<hi>Architecture,</hi> he recommended himself so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to <hi>Francis</hi> I. that he made him <hi>Super-intendent
General</hi> of all his <hi>Buildings, Pictures,</hi> &amp;c. and gave
him other opportunities of growing so vastly rich;
that for some time he liv'd like a <hi>Prince</hi> himself,
in all the Splendor and Magnificence imaginable:
till at last being rob'd of a considerable Summ of
Money, and suspecting one of his intimate Friends
(a <hi>Florentine</hi> who frequented his house) he caus'd
him to be imprison'd, and put to the Torture,
which he underwent with courage; and having in
the highest extremities maintain'd his innocence
with so much constancy, as to procure his Release;
<hi>Rosso,</hi> partly out of remorse for the barbarous
treatment of his Friend, and partly out of fear of
the ill consequence from his just Resentment,<note place="margin">Aet. 45.</note>
made himself away by <hi>Poison, Anno</hi> 1541.</p>

by the assistance of <hi>NICOLO dell' ABBATE,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

with abundance of noble <hi>Statues,</hi> and other <hi>Pieces</hi>
of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which he brought purposely from

by whose assistance and his own industry,
he made a wonderful Progress in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi>
and acquir'd such a name by his Piece of

<hi>Erasmus,</hi> after he had oblig'd him to draw his

him with the greatest respect imaginable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
him in making the <hi>Portraits</hi> of himself and

King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. that he immediately took him
into his service, and by the many signal Instances
which he gave him of his Royal Favour and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
brought him likewise into esteem with all the

One of his best <hi>Pieces,</hi> is that of the said

of <hi>Invention,</hi> very conspicuous in a multitude of
<hi>Designs,</hi> which he made for <hi>Gravers, Sculptors,

being dead at two months end, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
suckled by a <hi>Goat.</hi> The name of <hi>Vaga</hi>
he took from a <hi>Country Painter,</hi> who carry'd him
to <hi>Rome:</hi> where he left him in such poor circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that he was forc'd to spend three days of
the week in working for Bread; but yet setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the other three for his improvement; in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time, by studying the <hi>Antique,</hi> together with
the Works of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
one of the boldest and best <hi>Designers</hi> of the
<hi>Roman School:</hi> and understood the <hi>Muscles</hi> in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Bodies, and all the difficulties of the <hi>Art</hi> so
well; that <hi>Raphael</hi> took an affection to him, and
imploying him in the <hi>Popes Apartments,</hi> gave
him a lucky opportunity of distinguishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his <hi>Fellow-disciples,</hi> by the marvellous beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his <hi>Colouring,</hi> and his peculiar <hi>Talent</hi> in <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesque.</hi>
His chief Works are at <hi>Genoua:</hi> where he
grew famous likewise for his skill in <hi>Architecture;</hi>
having design'd a noble Palace for Prince <hi>Doria,</hi>
which he also painted, and adorn'd with his own

should have been the support of his old Age; and

by undertaking any little <hi>Pieces,</hi> for a small Summ

charming Beauty of his <hi>Pieces,</hi> that instead of
Plunder and Destruction, which was then their

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54218:178"/>
besides the perfections of his <hi>Pencil</hi> (which was
one of the gentilest, the most graceful, and the

that he could hardly allow any body else a good

own frequent copying the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Titian,</hi> and
<hi>Parmegiano,</hi> he brought himself into a pleasant and

apply'd himself wholly to the imitation of <hi>Nature;</hi>

the <hi>Ideas</hi> of most of his <hi>Figures.</hi> His Works are

those of the celebrated <hi>Poets Ludovico
Ariosto, Bernardo Tasso,</hi> and <hi>Torquato</hi> his Son.
In a word, so great was the Reputation of this
<hi>Artist</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> that <hi>Titian</hi> himself was glad to
purchase one of his <hi>Pieces</hi> (representing <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

the ill usage which he receiv'd from the

at <hi>CARAVAGGIO,</hi> from whence he deriv'd his
<hi>Name,</hi> was at first (like his Countryman <hi>Polidore)</hi>
no better than a <hi>Day-labourer;</hi> till having seen
some <hi>Painters</hi> at work, upon a Brick-wall, which
he had prepar'd for them, he was so charm'd
with their <hi>Art,</hi> that he immediately address'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the study of it: and in a few years made so
considerable a progress, that in <hi>Venice, Rome,</hi> and
several other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> he was cry'd up, and
admir'd by all the <hi>Young men,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> of a
<hi>new Style</hi> of <hi>Painting.</hi> Upon his first coming to
<hi>Rome,</hi> his <hi>Necessities</hi> compell'd him to <hi>paint
Flowers</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> under <hi>Cavalier Gioseppino:</hi> but
being soon weary of that <hi>Subject,</hi> and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his former practice of <hi>Histories,</hi> with <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
drawn to the middle onely, he made use of
a <hi>Method,</hi> quite different from the conduct of
<hi>Gioseppino,</hi> and running into the <hi>contrary extreme,</hi>
follow'd the <hi>Life</hi> as much too close, as the other
went wide from it. He affected a <hi>way</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to himself, of <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>dark shadows,</hi> to give
his <hi>Pieces</hi> the greater <hi>relievo,</hi> and despising all other
help, but what he receiv'd from <hi>Nature</hi> alone
(whom he took with all her faults, and copy'd
without judgment or discretion) his <hi>Invention</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so <hi>poor,</hi> that he could never <hi>draw</hi> any thing
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54218:192"/>
without his <hi>Model</hi> before his eyes; and therefore
understood but little either of <hi>Design,</hi> or <hi>Decorum</hi>
in his <hi>Compositions.</hi> He had indeed an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Colouring,</hi> and great <hi>strength</hi> in all his <hi>Works:</hi>
But those <hi>Pictures</hi> which he made in imitation of
the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Georgione,</hi> were his best, because
they have nothing of that <hi>blackness</hi> in them, in
which he afterwards delighted. He died in his
return from <hi>Malta,</hi> (where he had been Knighted
by the <hi>Grand Master,</hi> for some <hi>things</hi> which he
had wrought for him) <hi>Anno</hi> 1609.<note place="margin">Aet. 40.</note> His chief

and never offering to touch his <hi>Pencil</hi> till he
found a kind of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or <hi>Inspiration</hi> upon

His <hi>way,</hi> was very often in <hi>Half-Figures</hi>

strict in following the <hi>Life;</hi> but as <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> in

But however in all his <hi>Compositions, Nature</hi> was
imitated with so much <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> that a
certain <hi>Lady big with Child,</hi> having accidentally
cast her Eyes upon an <hi>Ixion,</hi> whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<hi>in Torture upon the Wheel,</hi> receiv'd such
an <hi>Impression</hi> from it, that she brought forth an

a great <hi>Encourager</hi> of all such as <hi>excell'd</hi> in

Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> and liv'd in <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi>

                     <hi>Apartments</hi> seem'd rather to be the <hi>Court</hi> of some

towards the latter end of his Life, of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
trouble that attended <hi>Face-Painting;</hi> and being
desirous of immortalizing his <hi>Name</hi> by some more
glorious <hi>Undertaking,</hi> went to <hi>Paris</hi> in hopes of
being imploy'd in the <hi>Grand Gallery</hi> of the <hi>Louvre;</hi>
but not succeeding there, he return'd hither, and
propos'd to the <hi>King</hi> (by his Friend Sir <hi>Kenelm
Digby)</hi> to make <hi>Cartoons</hi> for the <hi>Banqueting house</hi>
at <hi>White-hall:</hi> the subject of which was to have
been the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Order of the Garter,</hi> the
<hi>Procession</hi> of the <hi>Knights</hi> in their <hi>Habits,</hi> with the
<hi>Ceremony</hi> of their <hi>Installment,</hi> and St. <hi>Georges Feast.</hi>
But his Demands of <hi>fourscore thousand pounds,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought unreasonable, whilst the <hi>King</hi> was
upon treating with him for a less Summ, the <hi>Gout</hi>
and other <hi>Distempers</hi> put an end to that <hi>Affair</hi>
and his <hi>Life, Anno</hi> 1641;<note place="margin">Aet. 42.</note> and his <hi>Body</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd

in both the <hi>Sister-Arts</hi> of <hi>Poesy</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> was
esteem'd one of the most excellent <hi>Masters</hi> that
<hi>Italy</hi> has produc'd in this <hi>Century.</hi> In the first,
his Province was <hi>Satire;</hi> in the latter, <hi>Landtschapes,
Battels, Havens,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>little Figures.</hi> He was
a Disciple of <hi>Daniele Falconi</hi> his Countryman, and
<hi>Artist</hi> of good repute; whose instructions he very
much improv'd by his <hi>Study</hi> after the <hi>Antiquities,</hi>
and the <hi>Works</hi> of the most eminent <hi>Painters</hi> who
went before him. He was fam'd for his <hi>copious</hi>
and <hi>florid Invention,</hi> for his <hi>profound Iudgment</hi> in the
<hi>ordering</hi> of his <hi>Pieces,</hi> for the <hi>gentile</hi> and <hi>uncommon

Management</hi> of his <hi>Figures,</hi> and his <hi>general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in all the parts of <hi>Painting:</hi> But that which
gave a more particular <hi>stamp</hi> to his <hi>Compositions,</hi>
was his <hi>inimitable Liberty of Pencil,</hi> and the <hi>noble
Spirit</hi> with which he animated all his <hi>Works. Rome</hi>
was the place where he spent the greatest part of
his <hi>Life;</hi> highly courted and admir'd by all the
<hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Note</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> and where he died <hi>Anno</hi>
1673;<note place="margin">Aet. 59.</note> having <hi>etch'd</hi> abundance of valuable <hi>Prints</hi>

                     <hi>GIACOMO CORTESI,</hi> the famous <hi>Battel-pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
commonly call'd The <hi>BORGOGNONE,</hi>
from the <hi>Country</hi> where he was born, was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
of <hi>Salvator Rosa,</hi> and equally applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his admirable <hi>Gusto,</hi> and <hi>grand Manner</hi> of
<hi>Painting.</hi> He had for several years been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in <hi>Military</hi> Affairs, was a considerable <hi>Officer</hi>
in the <hi>Army,</hi> made the <hi>Camp</hi> his <hi>School,</hi> and form'd
all his excellent <hi>Ideas</hi> from what he had seen <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi>
in the <hi>Field.</hi> His <hi>Style</hi> was <hi>roughly noble,</hi>
and (<hi>Souldier</hi> like) full of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
towards the latter end of his Life, into the
<hi>Convent</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> where he was
forc'd to take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> (as they say) to rid his
hands of an ill <hi>Bargain,</hi> which he had unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
got in a <hi>Wife.</hi>

                     <hi>Sir PETER LELY</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1617,<note place="margin">1617.</note> in
<hi>Westphalia,</hi> where his Father, being a <hi>Captain,</hi>
happen'd to be then in <hi>Garrison.</hi> He was bred up
for some time in the <hi>Hague,</hi> and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of one <hi>de Grebber</hi> of <hi>Haerlem.</hi> He
came over into <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1641, and pursu'd
the natural bent of his <hi>Genius</hi> in <hi>Landtschapes</hi> with
<hi>small Figures,</hi> and <hi>Historical Compositions:</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the practice of <hi>Painting after the Life</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more encourag'd, he apply'd himself to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits</hi>
with such success, as in a little time to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
all his <hi>Contemporaries</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earnest in his younger days, to have finish'd
the <hi>course</hi> of his <hi>Studies</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> but the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in which he was perpetually ingag'd, not
allowing him so much time; to make himself
amends, he resolv'd at last, in an excellent and
well chosen <hi>Collection</hi> of the <hi>Drawings, Prints,</hi> and
<hi>Paintings,</hi> of the most celebrated <hi>Masters,</hi> to bring
the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Lombard Schools</hi> home to him.
And what benefit he reap'd from this <hi>Expedient,</hi>
was sufficiently apparent in that admirable <hi>Style</hi>
of <hi>Painting,</hi> which he form'd to himself by dayly
conversing with the <hi>Works</hi> of those <hi>great Men:</hi> In
the <hi>correctness</hi> of his <hi>Drawing,</hi> and the <hi>beauty</hi> of his
<hi>Colouring;</hi> but especially in the <hi>graceful Airs</hi> of his
<hi>Figures,</hi> the <hi>pleasing Variety</hi> of his <hi>Postures,</hi> and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54218:207"/>
his <hi>gentile negligence</hi> and <hi>loose manner</hi> of <hi>Draperies:</hi>
in which <hi>particular</hi> as few of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> were
equal to him, so all succeeding <hi>Artists</hi> must stand
oblig'd to his happy <hi>Invention,</hi> for the noble <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>
which he has left them for <hi>Imitation.</hi> He
was recommended to the favour of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.
by <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then Lord <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;</hi>
and drew his <hi>Majesties Picture,</hi> when he was
<hi>Prisoner</hi> in <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> He was also much in
esteem with his Son <hi>Charles</hi> II. who made him
his <hi>Painter,</hi> conferr'd the honour of <hi>Knighthood</hi>
upon him, and would oftentimes take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in his <hi>Conversation,</hi> which he found to be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
as his <hi>Pencil.</hi> He was likewise highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
by all the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Eminence</hi> in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
and indeed so extraordinary were his <hi>natural
Parts,</hi> and so great his <hi>acquir'd Knowledge,</hi> that it
would be hard to determine whether he was a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Painter,</hi> or a more <hi>accomplish'd Gentleman:</hi> or
whether the <hi>Honours</hi> which he has done his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
or the <hi>Advantages</hi> which he deriv'd from
it were the most considerable. But as to his
<hi>Art,</hi> certain it is, that his <hi>last Pieces</hi> were his <hi>best,</hi>
and that he gain'd ground, and improv'd himself
every day, even to the very <hi>Moment</hi> in which
<hi>Death</hi> snatch'd his <hi>Pencil</hi> out of his <hi>hand</hi> in an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic

1626,<note place="margin">1626.</note> and by his <hi>Studies</hi> under <hi>Pietro da Cortona</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> joyn'd with his continu'd <hi>Application</hi> to all
the <hi>noble Remains of Antiquity,</hi> became one of the
best accomplish'd, and most universal <hi>Masters</hi> in his
time. He was wonderfully skill'd in the <hi>practical
part <hi>of</hi> Designing,</hi> and from his incredible <hi>Facility,</hi>
and prodigious <hi>Dispatch,</hi> was call'd by his <hi>Fellow-Painters,
Luca fà Presto.</hi> He was besides very
happy in imitating the different <hi>Styles</hi> of other
<hi>great Men,</hi> and particularly follow'd the <hi>manner</hi>
of <hi>Titian, Bassan, Tintoret, Guido,</hi> &amp;c. so close
in several of his <hi>Pieces,</hi> that it is not the <hi>talent</hi> of
every <hi>Pretender to Painting,</hi> to distinguish them
from <hi>Originals</hi> of <hi>those Hands.</hi> He was famous
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54218:208"/>
for his many excellent <hi>Performances</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Florence:</hi> And being continually imploy'd in
<hi>working</hi> for <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>first Quality</hi>
all over <hi>Europe,</hi> grew so vastly <hi>rich,</hi> that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Naples,</hi> he purchas'd a <hi>Dutchy</hi> in that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
marry'd and liv'd splendidly, kept a noble
<hi>Palace,</hi> and a numerous <hi>Retinue,</hi> with <hi>Coaches, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and all other imaginable <hi>State.</hi> Being grown
<hi>Old,</hi> he was earnestly press'd by the <hi>Viceroy</hi> to go
over into <hi>Spain,</hi> and serve the <hi>King</hi> his Master:
He had no fancy for the <hi>Voyage,</hi> and therefore rais'd
his <hi>Terms</hi> very high: was not content with <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Crowns</hi> paid him down, and the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Key</hi> given him, as <hi>Groom of the Bed-chember;</hi>

of St. <hi>Iago,</hi> and the other <hi>Military Orders</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
it was expresly <hi>provided,</hi> that no <hi>Painter</hi> should be

was generally look'd upon as <hi>Mechanic;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
for the <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Art,</hi> not to stir a

St. <hi>Iago,</hi> and his <hi>two</hi> Sons <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Alcantara</hi>
and <hi>Calatrava.</hi> All which being granted, he set
out for <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he was receiv'd very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>King,</hi> and having <hi>adorn'd</hi> the grand
<hi>Stair-case</hi> of the <hi>Escurial,</hi> with the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel

Mind</hi> not so well satisfy'd as at <hi>Naples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aet. 68.</note> he <hi>sickned</hi>

for the <hi>Elegance</hi> of his <hi>Out-lines,</hi> and the

of <hi>Painting</hi> by Mr. <hi>Zoust</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi>
but left them whilst he was very <hi>Young,</hi> and
began to practise after the <hi>Life:</hi> yet acquir'd no

Lely,</hi> his Friends being desirous that he should
succeed that excellent <hi>Master</hi> in the favour of
King <hi>Charles</hi> II. ingag'd Mr. <hi>Chiffinch</hi> to sit to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54218:209"/>
him for his <hi>Picture;</hi> which he perform'd so well,
that the <hi>King,</hi> upon sight of it, sent for him, and
having imploy'd him in drawing the Duke of <hi>Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
Portrait,</hi> and soon after his <hi>own,</hi> took him into
his Service, honour'd him with several obliging
<hi>Testimonies</hi> of his <hi>Esteem,</hi> and withal gave this
<hi>Character</hi> of his <hi>Works,</hi> that <hi>he painted both Inside and
Outside.</hi> Upon the Accession of K. <hi>William</hi> and
Q. <hi>Mary</hi> to the Crown, he was sworn their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<hi>Principal Painter;</hi> which <hi>place</hi> he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
in the preceding <hi>Reign,</hi> tho' K. <hi>Iames</hi> and
his <hi>Queen</hi> were <hi>both</hi> pleas'd to be <hi>drawn</hi> by his <hi>Hand.</hi>
He was very diligent in the Imitation of <hi>Nature;</hi>
and by studying the <hi>Life,</hi> rather than following
any particular <hi>manner,</hi> attain'd a pleasant and
most agreeable <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>Painting.</hi> But that which
eminently distinguish'd him from all his <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries,</hi>
was his <hi>peculiar Excellence</hi> in a <hi>Head,</hi>
and especially in the <hi>Colouring part;</hi> wherein some
of his <hi>Peices</hi> were so very extraordinary, that Mr.
<hi>Riley</hi> himself was the <hi>onely Person</hi> who was not
charm'd with them. He was a <hi>Gentleman</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<hi>courteous</hi> in his <hi>Behaviour, obliging</hi> in his
<hi>Conversation,</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> in all his <hi>Actions.</hi> He
was a dutiful <hi>Son,</hi> an affectionate <hi>Brother,</hi> a kind
<hi>Master,</hi> and a faithful <hi>Friend.</hi> He never was
guilty of a piece of <hi>Vanity</hi> (too common amongst
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54218:209"/>
                     <hi>Artists</hi>) of saying <hi>mighty things</hi> on his <hi>own</hi> behalf,
but contented himself with letting his <hi>Works</hi>
speak for him; <hi>which</hi> being plentifully dispers'd
over <hi>other Nations</hi> as well as <hi>our own,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
everywhere very <hi>Eloquent</hi> in his <hi>Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
He had for several years been violently
persecuted by the <hi>Gout;</hi> which after many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<hi>Assaults,</hi> flying up at last into his <hi>Head,</hi>
brought him to his <hi>Grave, Anno</hi> 1691, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
lamented by all such as had the happiness
of being acquainted either with his <hi>Person</hi> or his
