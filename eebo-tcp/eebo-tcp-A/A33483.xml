            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Clothiers REASONS <hi>for Eſtabliſhing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of</hi> Merchant Adventurers <hi>of</hi> England.</head>
            <p n="1">I <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Antient Company of <hi>Merchant Adventurers</hi> always took Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Credit and Eſteem of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture abroad, and had good judgment in Cloth; and thereby kept the Trade from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners, and Exported far greater quantities of the Cloth of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for <hi>Hamborough, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> than hath been Tranſported of late Years ſince we have ſold to Interlopers; and the ſame Cloth that was then ſold currant at Twelve Pound <hi>per</hi> Cloth will not now yield above Nine; and the ſame Wooll that was then ſold at Twenty Four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Tod will not now yield above Fifteen Shillings.</p>
            <p n="2">II Theſe Merchants always paid the Clothiers ready Mony for their Cloths, and there was no Expence upon the Woollen Manufacture between the Merchant and Clothier: This enabled the Clothier to buy his Commodity at the firſt hand, and to make good Cloth, by paying his Work-people with ready Money. And in thoſe days Wages was continued at a certain price, and no Loſſes came upon the Clothier, he then turned his Stock three times for once now; came to <hi>London</hi> and met the Merchant at <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> ſold his Cloth, and was diſpatch'd home again in Two or Three Days, and had fair Meaſure for his Goods.</p>
            <p n="3">III That ſince theſe Interlopers have intruded into the Trade, Cloth is Sold at Six Months and Nine Months Credit, and many times not paid in Twelve Months, which makes many bad Debts to the <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and puts them upon ſtraights to pay their Work-people with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: By which means ſuch ſtops in Trade are occaſioned, Wages is many times beaten down from Nine Pence a Weight for Spining, to Five Pence; which hath ſo far impoveriſh'd m<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="3 letters">

            <p n="5">V The Engliſh Merchant being laid aſide, who ſtood by the true Intereſt of the Engliſh Nation, our Manufacture is extreamly falſifyed, and its eſteem loſt, and thereby the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners get the Trade from us. The Wool that formerly made Eight Cloths doth now make Nine, and a Tenth made out by ſtraining; ſo that Ten Cloths are carried abroad with the ſame Wool that formerly made but Eight, whilſt a due care to make our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture true, ſubſtantial and good, will occaſion a riſe upon Wooll from a true ground, and preſerve a Credit abroad. The preſent pretence of a riſe upon Wooll can have no real ſubſtance in it, the advance being only in long Wooll, and not in Clothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wooll, which is the far greater part; which if occaſioned by the Exportation of the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture, what is pretended muſt have the ſame Effect upon both: Therefore the Reaſon of this Riſe muſt rather come from the great bane of Sheep that hath hapened theſe Two laſt Years, which always Effects long Wooll, more than Clothing-Wooll, that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from low Paſture and deeper Feed, more ſubject to bane; and from other Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="6">VI Since the Trade of our Woollen Manufacture is fallen into the hands of Foreigners, the Myſteries of our Trade are ſtoln away from us; theſe men always ſearching into the Ways and Methods of making our Cloth, which we are well aſſured hath been of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to us; For through the want of the Engliſh Merchants to inſtruct us in the humor of Markets abroad, for Colours and the like, the Foreigners have very much prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And if the Merchandice of ſo conſiderable a part of our Woollen Manufacture, as is vended in <hi>Germany, Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> doth hereby come into the hands of Foreign Merchants, Packers and Factors, at One or Two <hi>per Cent,</hi> What room can there be left for the Younger Sons of the Engliſh Gentleman? who bring into this Kingdom what they acquire and gain abroad, to the Enriching of the Nation; whereas the Foreigner carryeth all he gaineth into his own Country, to the Impoveriſhing of ours.</p>
