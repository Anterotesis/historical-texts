         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Authors, who write
upon this subject, bring the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27231:7"/>

the first and chiefe of which
is their depriving from the
essence of God, which they
call essentiall paine, it being
that, which properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all the torments that
can be imagined in Hel. And
that same is so extreame and
so cruell, that if the soule had
in the other world as many
pleasures and contentments
as the thought of man could
imagine, being deprived of
God, it could not have any
thing which had one onely
shadow of comfort. Because
that God being the roote and
the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and all contentments
and delights, which are in

him alone, it is evident that
with him the soule shall have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27231:8"/>
all consolation which is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be imagined and that
without him it shall be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

of sorrow &amp; confusion, with
which and with the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that it hath, that its griefes
shall never be ended, it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
its being, its birth and
its life.</p>
               <p>The other paine which the
damned suffer in Hell is the
accidentall paine, so called
because it is joyned to the
former as an accident, which
serveth to make the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the damned more
sensible, throwing them
headlong into the bitter
sight of their miserie. To

that wretched and perpetuall
Hell is composed.</p>
               <p>And as touching the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of officers, that beare rule
in this darke dungeon; wee
know already that in that
great battell which Saint
<hi>Michael</hi> th' Archangell
had against <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for the
throne and the glory of the
Creator, not onely the same
<hi>Lucifer</hi> fell from Heaven,
and from the highest of his
perfection to the lowest and
hollowest gulfes of Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
also a great number of evill
angells with him, who were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27231:9"/>
copartners with him in his
rash and accursed purpose.
And these although they do
equally partake with him in
the paine essentiall, which is
being deprived of God, have
neverthelesse some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
amongst themselves:
whether it be that everyone
is of one kind, as saith a
Doctor of the Church, or
whether for that they had
more or lesse consent in his
malice. Because that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt those who obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly
defended the pride of
<hi>Lucifer</hi> fell with him into
the deepest place of the earth
which is the center of the
the world where divines doe
place Hell. And those who
were not so vehement; but
onely approved his purpose
with a certaine and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

so low: I will say that the
accidentall paine of them
was not so great as that of
these others. And of this sort
the accidentall paine of these

a correspondence that
there is not almost any other

to the essentiall paine of Hel,
which is the depriving of
Gods powerful presence, the

               <p>And as in that, the soule
being deprived of God, it is
also deprived of all worldly
pleasures, even so in this (to
wit in prison) it enjoyeth
not any thing which hath
the least shadow of content.
Because that although a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
were clothed with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Purple,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27231:13"/>
served as a King, fed
with the most delicate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
of the world, his
Chamber hang'd with
cloth of gold, that hee
were entertained with all
sort of Musicke, visited by
his parents and friends, all
this, nor all that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
more could bring him
any kinde of comfort. On
the contrary he should have
lesse, because that all things
availe nothing but to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his appetite and make
him desire that which others
enjoy, and to which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attaine. Whenceprocee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the increasing of his
want (of libertie) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
his paine.</p>
               <p>The harshnesse and force
of depriving (of libertie)
may be easily, known by its
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27231:13"/>
contrarie, this being infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the depriving of one
thing shall be by so much
evill as the possession of it
shall be good. And libertie
being the most precious
Iewell of the soule, and the
greatest perfection, which
the vnbounded Author of
this, hath engrafted in
the reasonable creature; it
is certaine that the depriving
thereof shall be the most
crosse and vnsufferable of all
others. That libertie is that
which guideth and directe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h
mans actions to diverse ends,
without enforcing them and
with pleasure, choosing, and
commanding, experience
teacheth this, in which the
supreme work-master would
distinguish man from other
living creatures, whose end
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27231:14"/>
obtaineth by a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
which leadeth them, as
by a bridle, to the appetite
and delight in it, and that it is
so powerfull, and maketh
man so absolute, that his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
having propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the good, the perfect, the
honest and the delectable, he
may resolve with himselfe
to love it or not to love it
at all, sith that none but God
may aske a reason of this so
absolute commandement,
Naturall Philosophie telleth
it. Whence and from many
other reasons, which I could
bring, it is clearely perceived
that there is not any thing
in the world, to which the
essentiall paine of Hell can
more properly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
than to the depriving of
libertie, seeing it bringeth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27231:14"/>
man to such extremitie, that
he abhorreth himselfe, his
being, his ranke, and his
estate.</p>
               <p>He knoweth well this truth
which I write, who hath
sometimes beene in prison,
laded with chaines and with
irons, subject to the rage of
that terrible abode, cursing
(though Noble and well
borne) his being, his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Noblenesse, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to be that which he is,
and wishing to be a great
deale meaner. In midst of
which despaire hee envieth
the peaceable condition and
tranquillity, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and could wish to
have beene borne of the
most base dregs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He curseth his actions
and his studies, the points of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27231:15"/>
honour which his parents
taught him, the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which he hath, thinking
with himselfe, that if he were
a privat man, he should not
at all see himselfe in so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and so extreame a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie,
and that this would
not be litle enough for him,
if despaire left him amongst
the folke of that same sort
and nature: but it goeth on
refining and consuming him
in the fire of impatience, in
such sort, that it draweth
him out of his reasonable
being, and bringeth him to
that of a brute beast, and to
the most base and infinite
kindes of them, that groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for libertie, he envieth
the bird that flieth, the Dog
that barketh, the Pismire
that travelleth, and desireth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27231:15"/>
to be one of them. And the
venome of this fierce beast
stayeth not there, for tying
harder the cords of a poore
prisoner, it draweth him out
of the ranke and file of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures, making him
desire to be a tree, an image
or a stone, bringing him to
nothing, and making him
bewaile that ever hee was
borne in the world. By
which it is clearely seene
that the want of liberty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so unhappy a change
in man, as to throw him
headlong from the highest &amp;
most perfect of his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and appetite, to the basest
and lowest, and from the
image and likenesse of God,
to nothing; this is the most
strong and most rigorous
paine that can be imagined,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27231:16"/>
and that which truely doth
better represent the essential
paine of Hell.</p>
               <p>To the accidentall paine
doe correspond the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
afflictions and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
of libertie, amongst
which are the stinke of the
prison, the disorderly frame
of the buildings, the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
companie, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and huge lewd voices, the
diversitie of nations, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
humors, the shame,
the persecution, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
the mocquerie, the
crueltie, the blowes, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the poverty and the
miseries without number,
which are suffered in prison,
of the which, and of other
depriving of libertie the
lively patterne of Hell is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27231:16"/>
framed and composed.</p>
               <p>As touching the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
and officers, no man
will deny but that all the
earth is full of incarnat
Divells, more obstinate and
more accursed in their kinde
than those of Hell, the most
part of them being fallen, as
<hi>Lucifer</hi> and his followers,
from the Heaven of honour.
I will say that for the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and sinnes which they
have committed, the Angell
Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> who is the
Iustice, hath drawne them
from the fellowship and
dwelling of the good, and
they seeing themselves bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
downe and dishonoured,
have taken vpon them the
office of Divels, to avenge
themselves of the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
soules, running day
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27231:17"/>
&amp; night thorow the streets,
markets and publike places
of the Citie, smelling out
and searching for people to
lay them in prison. And these
are they who commonly are
called Sergeants, who drag
a poore man to prison with
such rage and tyrannie, as
these in the perpetuall Hell
could not utter more. And
if we be able to find any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene them, it is
this, that the Divells of Hell
fly from the signe of the
Crosse; but those of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
love, reverence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
that happy signe, in
such sort, that hee who
would deale well with them,
and somewhat turne their
rigour into a litle pitie, it is
necessarie that hee have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the Crosse in his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27231:17"/>
hands, for at what time hee
shall leave it, they will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him ten times more
than his sinne can deserve:
but they having met with
him, they say a <hi>Pater noster</hi>
for the soule which they
take, untill they come to
<hi>da nobis bodie,</hi> and they goe
not at all any further.</p>
               <p>These Divells are those
who walke commonly
through the streetes, and
places of the Citie, seeking
for soules in the most secret
corners, the multitude and
trade of whom is so great,
that I doe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

are more Legions of Divels
in Hell, than there be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants

men into prison from places
most solitarie and quiet.

to baile a soule, and
to take the burthen on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
answering for it every

for it. And though it be in
their keeping, they give it
alwayes time and place to
solicite its owne affaires, to
visite its Iudges, and to
pleade its cause, vsing with
it some pitie and friendship.
Finally they have a nature
mingled with goodnesse
and malice, and they
are betweene Divels and

of the familiaritie which
they have with man, wee

tyrannous, so cruel &amp; so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that they satisfie not their
inraged hunger but by suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bloud, &amp; the life of the
poore captive that fals among
their hands: albeit they suffer
him to breath so long; while
they have emptied his purse.
And these be the under por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
&amp; servants of the Iayler,
who, as a President of that
dreadfull dwelling, receives
the prisonner from the hands
of the Sergeant and writes
in his booke the day of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27231:21"/>
entring, his accusation, his
name and the name of that
Divell that hath taken him.</p>
               <p>These shut-up Divells have
no power nor authoritie to
torment a soule which the
others do bring in, nor these
others to take them, but
by the command of Iustice
declared by some honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Officer, who with reason
and truth by a signed writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chargeth these uncleane
spirits to take such a soule.</p>
               <p>As for the rest it may well
be proved that every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
hath power to leade a
man to prison, even so as
every Divell may beare a
soule to Hell, seeing that
there ordinarily entreth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an infinite number of
prisoners, and every one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
by his severall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27231:21"/>
Iudge: some answer before
a Iudge with a long gown,
others before one with a
short gown, without recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
many other officers of
Iustice, who as good Angels
have authoritie and power
to exercise it, who have their
appointed and praticular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
who execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
and will.</p>
               <p>As touching the diversitie
of the lodgings and places
of their abode, the curious
shall see many differing in
the prison, every one fitted
for the prisoners delight. For
hee who is not criminall, and
who is Noble is usually
lodged in the lightsomest
chambers and neatest contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
but understand that the
Noblenesse of a prison con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in a good purse. Those
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27231:22"/>
that be of a meaner qualitie
&amp; deserving are fitted in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
darke &amp; black chambers,
where smoke and cinders
continually bearesway.</p>
               <p>The prison hath yet this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Hel, to take in all sort
of sinners &amp; criminals, being
usually peopled, and full of
Theeves, Russians, Cut-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Panders, Whoores, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
Perjured men, Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts,
Cheaters, Usurers, &amp;
Sorcerers, in as great varietie
as the living creatures that
entered into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, so
that entry is not denied nor
the gate shut against any.</p>
               <p>Of this remarkeable variety
the confused multitude of a
prison is composed with a
thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other circumstances
which accompanie it, which
because it is altogether disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

&amp; without bounds I shal
not be able to reduce it to one

of this dreadfull dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if the curious Reader
will not be contented with
the Analogie and proportion
which it hath with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Hell. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supposed as a thing most
proper to a prison, we shall
be able to describe it by its
properties &amp; by experience,

pit of violence which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27231:23"/>
hath nothing that is in its

Babylon where all speake
and none heare, it is a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

is seene the peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of two contraries,
mingling the Noble with
the infamous, the rich with
the poore, the civill with
the criminall, the sinner with
the just, it is a communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with agreement; one
whole by accident, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
without parts, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
without orders or

the fining-pot of friendship,
the wakener of rage, the

of treasons, a den of Foxes,
the refuge of vengeance: the

to end the miserie of that

saying that it is a forrest full
of wilde beasts, in which
the one teareth the other,
eating his heart and drinking
his bloud, so that no scruple
of conscience, feare of God,
suspition of love, compassion
or other respect whatsoever
which can have any shadow
of vertue or of goodnesse
is able to hinder them.

and finally one shall
hardly finde two of one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise

eating in a corner, another
will pisse behind him: and
in the middle of them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall pull off his shirt
and strip himselfe starke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Every one is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his particular exercise,
they not having any other
houre or time appointed for
that save their will, which
being disordered, free in its
actions, produceth them
without any let or shame.
In that which concerneth
the sustenance of life, there is
no order kept there among
them, because that hunger is
their appetite, their time of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27231:25"/>
meales alwayes, their table
the bare board, their sawce
the nastinesse and filthy
stinke, and their musicke
sneesing and belchings. The
hangings of their chambers
are all mourning, with some
borders of spiders-cloth
(cobwebs), their seates the
ground or some stone grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with two inches of fat
Bacon. The Dishes where
they eate are alwayes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to cleanlinesse, to serve
for a pot-lid and other vses
more base, and for spoones
they are served with five fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
spotted like Iasper, and
having their nailes of a huge
length. As for their drinke,
the industrie of man teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them to make a pit in
the top of their Hat, and to
drinke in it more grease than

there be found among them
a pot or kettle, it shall be,
according to the order and

without a handle, nor
without vernish, and hath

and hath beene vsed in
the most base offices, serving
for a pisse-pot, for a Flagon,
for a vineger bottle, for an

for napkins, they take their
skirts, or the outside of their
breeches, and for a table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
the wrongside of a

tatter'd and pucker'd, and
so fitted to the passions and
necessities of their bodies,
so that without breaking
their cod-piece point they
want not a perpetuall loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to satisfie their flux
of the belly. They live
Apostollically, without scrip
without staffe and without
shooes, having nothing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
nor double: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
there is so great
simplicitie that they cover

they have no more save the

it off till it can go alone of its

he could finde nothing to

cannot say that there is any
kinde of vices in the prison,
because that idlenesse the
mother of them hath no
entrie there, because they are
all carefull and watchfull to
search for that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for life: and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus
time they spend in
exercising themselves on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
instruments of Musicke
having the itch for the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
of that vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:27231:27"/>
They have also their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
houres for the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Art, in the which they
fight with their bodily ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whence they retire
evermore with the victorie,
bearing continually for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
&amp; trophees the bloud
on their nailes. They live
in Evangelicall hope never
troubling themselves with
the care of that which they
should eate or drinke to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Their ordinarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is the faith and hope
which they have to come
out of prison one day, and
put an end to their miseries.
With this comfort they live,
ever dying, putting cataracts
and deceiveable imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before the eyes of their
reason. And if by chance the
time of their imprisonment
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27231:27"/>
endeth, and Iustice giveth
assent that some one of them
goe forth, then the Divell is
so carefull and so watchfull
troubling and quelling his
libertie, that it seemeth to
him there are no gates
through which hee can get
out. One withholds him
asking a debt thirtie yeares
old, another the succession
of one of his grandfathers,
and another sheweth a band
more ancient than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
And when his diligence
and meanes have delivered
him from his enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
these within doores
begin to thunder out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
song, for one deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of him five shillings
which he lent him eleven
months ago, another that
should pay for a pot which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27231:28"/>
he brake to him, another
draweth forth a bill of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
asking him for ten
eggs and a sallet which he
paid for him. This man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
that he should pay
him the good-morrow's
which he hath given him,
another the good nights, one
askes his Cap, another his
Doublet, another his Shooes
and all lay hold upon him.
And when he escapeth this
importunate swarm of Bees,
these tunes begin to deafe
his eares; the Iayler de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of him the rights of
the prison, his entrance, his
going forth, and the time
that he hath tarried there,
for his sleeping, his talking,
his eating, his sneesing and
his coughing, and all the
time that he hath lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27231:28"/>
there, making more scores
in his booke than an Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
on the erecting of an
Horoscope. And when he
hath given him that which
he demands of him without
reason, he askes his gloves,
his Iayle fees, his slippers,
his old shooes and a coife
for the maide-servant. The
Dog askes him to pay for
his watching and barking
that he hath kept for him
while he slept, the Cat for
the paines she hath taken to
cleare his chamber from
Mice and Rats, one pulls
him on this side and another
on that, and all catch hold
of him like briers, while they
have left him dry, pluckt

by a thousand meanes to

it was not possible for me
to free my selfe, without

of mishap. They depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the place, and he seeing
himselfe alone and with
freedome to discover his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27231:33"/>
thoughts to me, without any
other preface, preamble, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
or courtesie, he
said to me.</p>
               <p>Sir, to day is my feast day,
and they have made me a
gift of a clarke of a harbour,
with a Cardinalls Hat: what
remedie shall I be able to
finde for so great a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
Verily this darke
speech of his words, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the manner of
telling it, held mee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in doubt, because I
knew not how to comment
upon so vncouth a language
followed with so many
fights and groanes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
these words and already
guessing that which it might
be, I beleeved that he had got
this hat at some pot of wine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27231:33"/>
and that out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
thereof this noble
dignitie had climed up to
the head. So smiling I said to
him: My friend, the Post
that hath brought you this
newes, is he of a douzen or
of twentie? It is not of
twelue, nor offoure, unhappy
man that I am! answered he,
for I am not drunke, nor ever
was I in all my lifetime, and
would to God that all the
world were so retired in this
action as I am: but as the
Proverbe saith, some have
the name, the others have the
eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct. And you doe not well
to make a poore unhappie
wretch that askes your
counsell in his extreame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
His answer to the
purpose redoubled my asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and not being able
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27231:34"/>
to hit at that which this
might meane, I said to him
somewhat in anger; Make
an end then to relate to me
the cause of your paine, and
hold me no more in doubt
with your darke speeches
or ridles. Now I know, Sir,
said he, that yee have not
studied Martiall tearmes,
nor you vnderstand not as
yet Galunatias his stile, so it
will be hard for you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of two solide bodies
with the perspective of red
flowers in a white field.
From this second answer I
fully resolved that hee was
not drunke, but foolish, and
as to such a one, I agreed
with him to all that he said,
although I vnderstood him
never a whit. And taking the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27231:34"/>
subject to reason with him
upon the same reasons, I
asked him, who made him a
Cardinall and why? To
which he answered me thus.
You should understand that
some officers of the <hi>three</hi>
and of the <hi>five</hi> of <hi>Topo &amp;
Tango</hi> vpon the <hi>Seventh</hi> and

with the money. They were

which they had of me,
they found mee not good

left me the office of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.
You ought to account
your selfe happy, I answerd
him, having so great a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
seeing that few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, and these with great
paines and travell. I would
quite it, with all my heart,
saith he, and that without
pension, if any one would
receive it for mee, and I
would moreover binde my
selfe to him to pay for the
seales, because to speake the
truth, it is a charge too heavy
for me, and hee that gives
it, hath not any good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
among the people nor
many friends in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and this is the cause that I
make no great account of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:27231:35"/>
And doe not thinke that in
saying, that I will no wayes
accept of it, I can helpe my
selfe of this paine: for it is
not in my power, nor in
theirs who receive the like
charges to be able to refuse
them, sithence dignities are
bestowed by deservings, and
albeit that men refuse them,
they are made to take them
by force, that no man may
refuse them nor make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
by too great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
they binde it upon him
as if he were a foole. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my friend, said I then to
him; you ought to account
your selfe happy and very
fortunate, for such an electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
this being supposed that
it is made for deserving, and
not for favour. Very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
saith hee, assuredly I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27231:36"/>
am, howbeit an vnworthy
sinner, but no wise happy, for
if I were, I should not be
very fortunate. With this
answer I began to see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he was neither foolish
nor drunke: but that dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hee covered his words
of this his chatting, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
to leave him with his
—I rise speaking to
him some harsh words, to
which hee answered with
great humilitie, saying, Sir
I beseech you to stay your
choler a litle: for it is not
without a mysterie, that I
have spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you in a riddle,
and beleeve me that in this I
have had no other intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to hide my mishaps
from some—who
usually watch harkning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the life of another, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27231:36"/>
report them to their copse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.
But now seeing that
I can utter it to you without
feare I will explaine my
selfe, being well assured that
a man of so good a wit as
you are, will not be offended
to heare my weakenesse, and
will not deny me your good
counsell which out of your
charitie I promise to my
selfe. So know that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
is that which to day at
noone one hit mee over the
shoulders: The Clarke of
harbour hee that receiveth
such as are condemned to the
Gallies: those of three, are
some of our companie, are
some that watch the streete,
when any theft is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and these have the third
part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Those of Five are

and keepe the theft in their
house, and for that the fifth
part is given to them. Now
you shall know that by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
I being one night in
a list that was made, the
booty was so little, that there
was not whereof to make
neither fourth nor fifth, and
I being the man that put
himselfe in greatest danger
I was willing to goe away
with all, promising to redresse
the bygone fault in another
more gainefull occasion.

for more mercie, from the

Scarcely had I ended my

that the newes which they
had tolde him were false,

that it was a tricke

some remembrance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:27231:39"/>

he cut moe than five and

with a thousand turnings of
good liking, and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
began to play upon
him, in which he paid them
home their change, with so
wittie answers, that hee left
me a great desire, to keepe
him with me all alone, and
at leasure to know at length
his vocation and office, and
the cleering of some obscure

and excellencie of his trade,
if I had not broke him off
with an extreame impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the titles of honour
and noblenesse which hee
gave it seeming to me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
improper, as well for
that it is of it selfe imfamous,
as for the innumerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which usually happen
to them, who undertake such
like traffiques: wherefore I
said to him; I do not know,
<hi>Andrew,</hi> how nor by what
reason you your selfe reckon
up to me these Arts so noble,
so easie and so profitable, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you have related to
me the perilous extremities
in which you have beene,
which your povertie and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
assure me to be of little
profit &amp; of great misery which
is therein, that makes mee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27231:44"/>
to marvel very much at your
persevering in your unhappy
trade, ere you were made
wise by the experiences past.
You have reason (he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
and I confesse that
many hazards and disgraces
light upon vs, but one Oxe
eateth more than a hundred
Larks, I will say that one
good encounter shoulders
out many disgraces, which
have not in so great number
as you thinke, and though
they were, it is not possible
for vs to give over this trade
but by death, because this
Art hath I cannot tell what
with it, that it is like one sicke
of the Dropsie, who the
more he drinks the more he
thirsts, and of one onely act
there becommeth a habite,
<hi>qui difficilè removetur a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:27231:45"/>
subjecto,</hi> which is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the subject.
And I know wel that you wil
like my doctrine well, being
so learned a man as you are,
seeing they are accustomed
to dispute among the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
if this maxime of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> (who saith <hi>Expluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
actibus generatur habitus,</hi>
of many actions is begot a
habit) be Universally true.
And some say that of one
only action a habit may be
bred, which should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of morall actions, and
those of worser sort: I will
affirme that to breede a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
custome in sinning,
one only action is sufficient:
but to doe well, there is need
of many. The reason is
cleere, for that the will of
man being disposed to sinne,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27231:45"/>
because it is called <hi>fomes
peccati,</hi> the fewell of sinne,
and for the miseries drawen
upon it in its conception, one
action alone leaveth in it a
certaine inward disposition
with which it becommeth
easie, and disposed to like
actions; but the desire being
so marred, corrupt and ill
disposed to receive vertue,
there needeth not only one
vertuous action, but many,
if any disposition or custome
of doing well should remaine
after it. By which you may
judge that albeit a thousand
disgraces fall upon us it were
almost impossible for us to
forsake our trade, nor change
our life, having already tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it into a nature, and if
this should be done, it should
be needfull to make the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27231:46"/>
world a new againe, more or
lesse all wooll is haire, we
are all of us of one brothers
hood, no man is content with
his state, he that hath most
desireth more, that which
costeth little agreeth best
with us, and all (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe
goeth) like well.</p>
               <p>But mishap be to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat
man who payeth for
all; for as the Proverb saith,
the Gallowes are for all
such, we rubbe all men, and
for those sinnes some are
hang'd, others are rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Happy are they who robbe
Hippocrates-like, I will
speake as the Physitians;
whose faults the earth cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
so that no man is able
to accuse them, nor aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of his life, and of the
money which they have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27231:46"/>
publickly rob'd and in the
view of all the world. And
though some of these be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
men, others tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
notwithstanding all
meete in the same way, and
shoote at one marke: for
there be also horseleeches
which sucke the world
sweetly, and wring their
necke, with a sad dumpish
countenance, and a faire
shew colour their ambitious
designes with godly words.
And for them, it is said in the
Proverbe, the Divell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
the Crosse. There are
others also, who though
they wring not the necke, nor
speake so much of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
neverthelesse the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of their offices in
favour of him that giveth
them most; who being lap't
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27231:47"/>
in long wide gownes making
them to bee respected there is
not a man that dare to give
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a word, nor shew by any
signe the evil satisfaction that
they have by them: but the
wretched person that neither
hath God in his mouth, nor
barke wherwith to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
if he be not very wise &amp;
prudent all the persecutions
of the world hang about him
at once, all men spit in his
face, and he is the marke of all
the abuses in the world: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
blame not our Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you understand it; for
you should so offend all the

to gather the fruit where one

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27231:47"/>
the in gathering in his garner
&amp; in his cellar, himself having
neither fielde nor vineyard,
you would even licke your

I pray you, that a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

penny nor farthing, nor
knowing yet whence to have
it for to nourish his family,
and yet ere night he is worth
a hundred crownes, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not whence they came?
Is this a small matter in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sloth and necessitie to
finde apparell cut and slasht
without paying either for
stuffe or making? Is there
any such Noblenesse in the
world, as to be a Gentleman
without rents, and to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods so his own,
as that hee may dispose of
them at his will, without
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27231:48"/>
costing him any more but
to take them? Doe you
thinke it a small matter to be
a Marchant without a stocke,
to gaine two hundreth for
nothing, without crossing the
seas, going to faire or market,
not caring if the Marchant
turne banque-rupt, if the

if wares be deare or cheape?</p>
               <p>And if ye will take our trade
by way of reputation or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
doth it seeme a small
thing to you, to finde one
who will insure us our life,
whatsoever wee doe, and to
have at our becke some
Iudges, who save us from the

only with a single &amp; wel-assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S for my race, you
shall know that I
am a man borne of
a woman, in a town
of this world, whose name
I lost in a sicknesse which I
had in the yeare sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and foure. My, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was called <hi>Peter</hi> and
my mother <hi>Hope,</hi> people,
though meane, honorable
and vertuous, of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and praise-worthy
manners. And as for the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27231:49"/>
goods of fortune, they were
not so great, that they were
able to give bribes, nor
marry Orphans out of
their meanes, nor so meane,
that they obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to aske almes, nor to
subject themselves to any
man, but they were people
that knew how to live, and
that had bread to eate, and
clothes to put on. In all the
course of their life there
was nothing found that
they could be reproched
for, nor whereof they
could be reproved, because
they heeded no other thing
(particularly my mother)
but to keepe their honour
and the good esteeme which
they had gained, for which
and for the freedoome and
faire conditions of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27231:50"/>
and conversation,
all the world honored and
loved them. But as vertue
is ordinarily envied, and
honest people persecuted,
there was no want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and wicked people,
who by false and rash ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
darkned the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and glistering of their
good works &amp; the cleannes
of their life. They were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
(I say) to have
robbed a Church, to have
spoiled the Vestrie with
the ornaments and chalices,
and which is worse, to have
cut off S. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> hand,
who was upon an Altar,
which they said was of
silver. An accusation as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
as false, especially,
for my mothers part, whose
devotion towards the Saints
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27231:50"/>
was so great, that when she
went to Church, if my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had not pull'd her out
by the haire, or the Sexton
had not shut the doore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, there was no
meanes to make her come
out of the Church, although
shee had beene three dayes
without meate, and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
was so knowne to all
the people, that she never
came forth to the streete,
but a thousand folke praied
her to say some <hi>Ave Maria</hi>
for women with child, sicke
and other afflicted persons,
having all of them great
faith in her prayers. But as
there are traitors enough to
condemne a just man, and in
this age innocency serveth
to no purpose, if it be not
favoured, for so much as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27231:51"/>
the Lawes goe as it pleaseth
Kings, it came to passe that
notwithstanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
which they gave in
against the witnesses, more
than sufficient to refute the
malice of the accusers,
and to manifest the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of the accused, they
condemned them to die, and
together with them a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mine, and my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Nephew. Verily the
case was strange and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
though false, and
their death unjust: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the cause I doe not
envie them the profit, which
let them eate with their
bread, they shall not goe
to <hi>Rome</hi> for penance, for
there is a God in the world
that seeth all things, and
seeing he punisheth that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27231:51"/>
he will not suffer one haire of
the just to perish, it belongs
to him to avenge the wrong
done to his servants, for so
I may call them, yea even
Martyrs, sith they constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
suffered death for the
love of God, they being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of faults which they
had not committed. A
tricke, finally that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poore, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to pay with their
life, that which they were
not able with their goods. I
only may praise my selfe
that I found some mercie
with the Iudges, in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of my young yeares,
and of the small experience
that I had; yet the favour
they shewed me, was a grace
with sinne: because Iustice
left me my life, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27231:52"/>
that I shuld be the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
of these Martyres.
I was very unwilling and
did all I could, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
so execrable a crime as
that is, to take away their
lives that had given me mine:
but it was impossible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
me, but by losing my
life with them. Wherefore
I considering that another
would doe that, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and of the other side
the perswasion of my friends
who with a great charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my conscience, counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to doe it, that so the
whole kindred of my parents
should not be lost, and that
there should remaine some
one in the world who might
pray for them; I put on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to doe that which
for any other respect I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27231:52"/>
would never have done. But
this is my comfort, which is
not a little one to me, that
my father gave me his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at the houre of his death
forgiving me all that I could
have committed in this
world, against the respect
and reverence, which I owed
him, giving me also some
wholesome counsels, and
recommending to me vertue
and the feare of God, above
all that I should ever strive
to be like my parents and
that I should shew my selfe
such a one as those of whom
I was descended. With these
reasons and some others I
remained greatly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and resolved to end
my prison with their life. I
was left an Orphan, young,
alone, or ill accompanied,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27231:53"/>
and without counsell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing what side to
turne me to, for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that life which these
gentlemen had left me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the cockering and
good cheere in which my
mother had bred me, had
beene the especiall cause of
my undoing, shee suffering
me to live idlely and
lazily.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse I seeing that
the memorie of the good
past brought me no profit,
and that if I should live and
eate bread it ought to be
with the sweate of my
browes, I determined to
looke out for a master whom
I might serve, or some han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-crafts-man
with whom
I might learne some trade,
which was all in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:27231:53"/>
that the accident of
my parents being in fresh
memorie, and their infamie
yet late, I found not one
that would receive me into
his house, nay not so much
as to be a groome of his
stable: wherefore I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave the countrey,
and to goe try my fortunes
in a strange countrey. What
countrey is that (I asked him
then) in which your parents
dwelt, because if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the discourse of
your relation, you have
changed its right name as
also its surname, and your

I beseech you, answered he,
to breake a solemne oath

this is the first time that we
have beene taken, and the

ever bin accused, and no man
knowing the name of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
nor of our countrey
they cannot be informed of
our lives &amp; manners, nor our
parents receive any shame
from our disgrace seeing that
as you may oftentimes haue
seene, when they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne a

such a place, the son of such a

to be whipt or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
such a day, moneth and
yeare, from which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
nothing else, but sorrow
to him that dyeth, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his parents. If this be
so (said I to him) you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to hid it, &amp; this being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that is not for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27231:55"/>
and follow your Historie.
It fell out then (said hee)
that about foure leagues
from the place of my birth,
I put my selfe apprentice to
a Shooemaker, it seeming
to mee to be the most gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of all trades, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>France,</hi> where all those
that walke goe at it were
post, even as if Iustice
were running after them, and
where all Shooe themselves
against nature, that which
is contained being greater
than that which containeth
that is to say, the foot grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the shooe, whence it
falleth out that the shooes
last a very short while. I
opened then mine eyes
thither and bend my
minde to this trade for
that beside the gaine it was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27231:55"/>
the most easie. But as from
my infancie my parents had
taught me to rip, it was not
possible for me so suddenly
to change the habite which
I had already, turned into
nature, and so sixe weeks
past ere I could learne to set
one right stitch. From this
ignorance my Master tooke
occasion to disdaine me,
breaking some lasts on my
head, to see if they could
leave some impression beside
the continuall abstinence
with which hee punisht me,
some of his friends having
said to him that it was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
remedie—and
quicken my wit. This
life seemed not good to
me nor to bee desired,
wherefore I resolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it, and lay out for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27231:56"/>
another more peaceable,
knowing particularly in my
selfe some motions of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
which inclined me
to things higher and greater
than to make shooes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude with my
selfe to search all meanes
possible to bring me into the
house of some man of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and rich, being assured
that with the faire conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and readinesse that I had,
my service should be well-pleasing
to my Master. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the resolution was good,
and the thoughts honourable
and noble; but so lame,
maime and without force
for want of meanes, and
apparell to set them forward
seeing that it is most certaine,
that if with my hands waxed,
my apron and other markes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27231:56"/>
of a Shoomaker I should
have presented my selfe at
the gate of some Knight,
they would not have suffered
me to enter</p>
               <p>This difficultie held mee
some few dayes in perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
without knowing how to
enter upon my enterprises,
notwithstanding making a
vertue of necessitie, being
vexed at the miserable life
which I led, I determined to
draw Physicke out of the
disease, and honie from the
Bees stings, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to revenge my selfe on
the Spanish lether and all
shooe-makers. To this effect
there came a notable bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in my mind, yea and
profitable enough and sure,
if fortune who then was my
enemie had not over-thrown
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27231:57"/>
my designes and my inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I considered that if
I stole any thing out of the
house, my shift should have
beene discovered in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and I as a stranger and
friendlesse, beene ill dealt
withall, particularly, with
the hatred which my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
bare towards me, &amp; the
harshnesse with which they
are wont to punish houshold
thefts in <hi>France.</hi> So rising on
Fryday morning earely than
I had been accustomed,
rubbing my hands with
waxe and also my face, I
went with my apron girt to
mee, and my hands all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed,
to runne through
all the shops of the towne,
especially those that were
best acquainted with my
Master, and telling to every
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27231:57"/>
one that were in the shops,
that the Gentleman staid at
my Masters for a paire of
bootes of the eights, to put
them on incontinent, I asked
for one boote to trie if it
would fit him that desired
them. None made any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
to give me it, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that a man could not
be served with one
boote alone, otherwise the
most part of the shooe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
knew me, and these who
had never seene me were in
a minute so well satisfied
with my presence, that if
the first finder out of the
trade had come, they could
not have given him more
credite. With this inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I went almost through
all the shops of the towne,
ever heeding to aske for a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27231:58"/>
boote of the same size, and
last that the first was of: And
the invention fell out so to
the purpose, and with so
great ease that in halfe an
houres space, I gathered me
then two hundred bootes all
of one size, and of one fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which having tied up in
a sacke, I laid them on my
shoulders and betooke me to
the way. The fact lay dead
without suspition almost
two houres, but seeing that
I came not backe againe,
nor returned the boots which
I had carried away, nor
tooke that which I had left,
all of them suspected that
which truely fell out. And
so this time being past, moe
than a hundred apprentices

his boote, which my Master
and some few of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who loved mee not
very well, seeing they told
the Iustice, who dividing
themselves through the three
gates of the Citie, met mee
not very farre from one of
them, because the weight of
my burthen suffered me not
to get out of sight as I could
have wisht. They brought
me backe to the towne, and
proceeding against mee for
the fact yet hot and fresh in
minde, they condemned me
to walke foure houres
through the accustomed
streets (that is to be
scourged) with three

Art had no other
excellency but the
antiquitie of its
beginning and the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the first finder out
thereof, it might suffice to
the end that every good wit
should approve it for to be
the most Noble of all those
which are practized at this
day in the world, the first
inventour thereof was one
of the fairest Angells that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27231:59"/>
was, whose beautie, dignitie
and greatnesse was so extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and high, that the most
curious of his perfection
found no other title more
proper to exalt him than that
of the Morning Starre,
Governour of the dawning
of the day, the Sun's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour.
This then was the
first Thiefe that was in the
world, or before the world,
if it be true that the Angells
were created before time,
who overcome by an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
desire, adventured rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to robbe God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But hee was degraded
because Iustice tooke him
in the fact, and seazing upon
all the goods that hee had,
condemned him to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
prison, and together
with him all his associats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:27231:60"/>
The second Thiefe that
ever was in the world was
our first father <hi>Adam,</hi> as
bold as the Angell, yet not
so blame-worthie for being
not so malicious in his sin,
and of lesse knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I cannot be perswaded
that hee was ignorant of the
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he owed to
his Creator, having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
infused in him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
overcome by the
importunate reasons of his
wife, and tormented with an
ambitious curiositie hee was
desirous to steale the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wisedome of God.
But it fell out as badly to
him as to the Angell, so that
his fleeing and hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
served him to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for the Iudge having
asked him, and he not being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27231:60"/>
able to deny the fact, for
that he was taken in the
fault, his state of innocencie
and originall justice was
taken away, he and all his
race remaining condemned
to spend their life with
sweate, travell and mishaps,
and his wife to bring forth
her children with sorrow.
And if you aske mee why
God did not equally punish
these two theeves, being
guiltie of treason, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attempted one and the
same kinde of theft which is
the divine perfection. It was
to this purpose that I have
heard spoken by a great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
and Preacher of the
Church; because if God had
punisht man with the same
rigour that hee punisht the
Angell withall, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27231:61"/>
an intire nature, seing
that all men sinned in <hi>Adam</hi> &amp;
so the world had remained
imperfect. But in punishing
the Angell, this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venience
followed not, because many
other Angels remained in
heaven, and all the nature of
Angels sinned not, and this is
the cause why God was not
so severe to man as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
but you shal better learn
this curiositie from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who knoweth it better
than I do. It is sufficient that
those aforesaid Theeves were
the first that brought theft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
credit in the world. And
wee cannot say, that pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and necessitie stirred them
vp to steale, because the first
was the noblest and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all the Angells, and
the second was the first of all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27231:61"/>
men, King of the living
creatures, and absolute Lord
of the earth. From thence
is brought in the deceite
which to the day, this world
seeth, beleeving that poverty
was the finder out of theft,
seeing it is riches and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,
because the love &amp;
desire of honour and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
groweth so much the
more as it is increased, as a
Poet saith very well. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being an unsatiable fire,
in which how much more
wood is laid, so much the
more it is inflamed, and a
Dropsie, in which the more
one drinketh, the more hee
thirsteth. Even so in those
great theeves, the great riches
and prosperitie which they
had, was the cause of their
unruly appetite, and unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27231:62"/>
ambition, for that they
desiring that which they had
not, they could not attempt
any other theft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and wisedome of God,
seeing they possessed all the
rest. Whence you shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that to steale and
robbe is in a sort naturall to
man, and that it goeth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and propagation
in all the linage of men, and
not by cunning. For if it
be true that we all are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, his sin
being nothing else but to
robbe God of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it is evident, that there
is in vs an inclination, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and naturall desire
to robbe and steale. From
<hi>Adam</hi> this profession was
extended to all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
being alwayes kept on
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27231:62"/>
foote amongst the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and best qualified of all
his children. So <hi>Cain,</hi> as
jealous of this originall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
would needs steale from
his brother <hi>Abel</hi> the grace
and particular favour with
which God received his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and sacrifices. <hi>Iacob</hi>
cunningly rob'd the blessing
from his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> and
it went well with him. <hi>David</hi>
the wife of <hi>Vriah. Achab</hi>
though himselfe a rich King
stole <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. And
finally <hi>Nimrod</hi> by theft sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
all the Inhabitants of
<hi>Assyria.</hi> And if leaving these
and other Theeves almost
innumerable, which holy
writing relate unto us, wee
take the examples that
humane histories rehearse
unto us, we shall see that this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27231:63"/>
singular Art hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
preserved among the
Nobilitie, sith <hi>Paris</hi> stole
<hi>Helen,</hi> ravisht before that by
<hi>Theseus;</hi> The same <hi>Theseus</hi>
stole <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and <hi>Iason
Medea.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
of whose policie and
good government <hi>Plutarch</hi>
maketh honorable mention
had this laudable and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
custome of stealing, and
hee that was most cunning
and subtile in that Art, was
in greatest account and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
amongst them. The
very mothers taught their
children, while they were but
little ones, to steale, holding
it for an infallible point of
policie, that they could never
be good and brave souldiers,
if they had not beene cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and well experienced
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27231:63"/>
theeves. I will not tarrie
now to tell the name and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
which <hi>Vircat</hi> got
himselfe by his thefts, nor
the renowne which <hi>Crocota</hi>
deserved by them in the time

and deceits which the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27231:67"/>
naughtie Tradesmen use for
to robbe and steale.</p>
               <p>The Tailer stealeth asking
a third part more of cloth,
then there needeth to make
a sute of: and when he that
putteth it out to making,
presuming to be wise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the Tailer, would
be by to see it cut, he vexeth
him, and casts a mist over his
eyes marking foure houres
along the peece and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart,
and when hee hath
at last dazeld him with a
great many strokes and lines
with his chalke, hee throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a false ply under the
sheeres with which at the
cutting of a paire of breeches
one breech abideth with him
for his gain, besides buttons,
silke, lace, and lynings.</p>
               <p>The linnen Weaver stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27231:67"/>
in asking more yarne
than the web hath neede of,
laying fiftie ells instead of
five and fortie and with the
remainder of many broken
threeds he pincheth out the
length, which makes worth
to him the eight part, all
which he stealeth.</p>
               <p>The Cordwainer restoreth
with his teeth that which hee
stealeth with his—biting
and drawing thinne the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so that of one paire of
shooes which one giveth him
to make, there resteth to him
at least an upper lether or a
heele for a third. And if the
lether be his owne, he sets on
a rotten soale with rotten
threed, to the end it may be
the sooner spoil'd and fall
off, which I thinke but stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:27231:68"/>
The Physitian and the
Chirurgion both steale, the
one appointing and th'other
applying plasters, which feed
the disease and make it worse
to the end that the time of
the cure continning long,
the fees may be the greater
and the more.</p>
               <p>The Apothecarie stealeth
with a <hi>quid pro quo</hi>—put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in one drugge for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and taking that which
is cheapest, not considering
what humour should be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and what vertue the
drugge hath which he apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
in which hee stealeth
the honour and reputation
of the Physitian, and the sick
persons life. And if haply any
call for an oile which he hath
not, he wil not faile to give of
that which hee hath for oile
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27231:68"/>
of—or other costly oyle
which any shall have asked
them, that they may not
lose the credit of their shop.</p>
               <p>The Marchant stealeth in
putting out his money upon
use, taking more than the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
alloweth, and writing
downe in his booke such a
debt, which, it may be, shall
be thrice paid,</p>
               <p>The Notary stealeth with
an (&amp;c. <hi>Et coetera)</hi> a whole
Lordship, and if there be a
question of any criminall
processe, the Scrivener for
money that he shall take of a
forfeit, will sell the soule of
the poore innocent.</p>
               <p>The Counsellour &amp; the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney
steale selling a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
lies to the poore client,
making him to understand,
that he shall win his cause, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27231:69"/>
they see cleerely that he
hath no right at all; and
many times it falleth out that
the Lawyer agreeth with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to sell the parties right
and part the gaine betweene
them.</p>
               <p>The Iudge stealeth Iustice
from this man, having pitie
on him, who by some bribe
shall have already corrupted
him, wresting violently the
texts of <hi>Bartole</hi> and <hi>Baldus</hi>
for his own profit.</p>
               <p>The Drugster and other
Marchants, that sell by
weight steale, putting under
the scale a very thinne plate
of leade, where they put that
which they would weigh,
with which they shew that
there is more then weight,
albeit there be many ounces,
and when they doe not that,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27231:69"/>
with their little finger they
touch the tongue of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with which they make
the scale sway to what side
they will.</p>
               <p>The Vintner stealeth a
hundreth thousand wayes,
mixing and blending one
wine with another, beside
the water that hee putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
it, and when his wine
by the force of so much
mingling and watering hath
his strength, hee hangeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the lees a little bagge
full of Cloves, Pepper, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and other spices, with
which he makes it still seeme
to be good.</p>
               <p>The Butcher also stealeth
blowing up his meate with
a Cane, that so they may
seeme the bigger, and that
he may sell them at a deerer

               <p>The Treasurer stealeth the
third part, yea the halfe of
a pension, when a poore

because that hee, who should
receive it, being drown'd in
debt or charged with some

to give the halfe, nor makes

it.</p>
               <p>The Marshall stealeth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a poore harmelesse man,
and laying him in hold never
telling him for what, and at
the end of three or foure
dayes that hee keepeth him
in a chaine, sends a Divell of
those that belong to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to tell him that hee is
accused for making of false
coine, and that there are ten
witnesses who have given e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27231:70"/>
against him: but that
for the respect of some of
his friends, hee will set him
at libertie some evening, if
he will give him a hundreth
Crownes to give content to
the witnesses, and to make
them in some sort to hold
their tongues, whereby the
poore wretch being sore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
selleth all to the

of so great affliction.</p>
               <p>The Courtier stealeth the
report of a favorite, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to himselfe that which
another receiveth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being loaded with
feathers, brussing up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

where the Pages waite, some

and amongst other things
hee told the newes that hee

               <p>The Perfumer stealeth

               <p>The Priest stealeth, saying
foure Masses instead of forty

for the dead, Answers and

               <p>The Religious (Monkes

assaulting with a
grave countenance and a
wry necke a poore sicke man
at the point of death, and
laying before him a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of doubts and burthens
of conscience, turning and
stirring them up to pious
deeds, applying to their own
Monasterie all that which he
was bound to restore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever making any scruple
of conscience to leave halfe
a dozen of Orphans defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their inheritance, and
the sicke mans wife to live

               <p>The Preacher stealeth, pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and S.

them to their very thoughts,
selleth in the Pulpit their

his owne making himselfe
the inventor and author of

               <p>The Blind man stealeth
the halfe of every song that

received money from

and it seeming to him that

               <p>The Begger stealeth telling

               <p>The Robbers steale upon

tyrannie, because that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that in the meane time
while he alighteth and staieth

they come forth to snatch
cloakes in the darkest and
rainest nights, and to them
places which they see is most
quiet and most out of the
way, at least upon the one
side, to the end that the
neighbours may not come
forth (at the outcryes and
noise which the robbed are
commonly wont to make)
and take them. These same
are accustomed sometimes
to go in Lackeyes clothes to
come in to some Maske or
feast, making shew to looke
for their Masters, and with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27231:76"/>
this liberty, they meete with

name from the likenesse that
they have to those young
boyes in ships, who clime
up with great nimblenesse,
by the tacklings to the top
of the Mast; and the sailers
call them Cats or Grumets.
Those that beare this name
steale by night, climing up
lightly, by a ladder of ropes,
at the end of which they

tye a line made fast to

waiting their time, either
under some Altar, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
some table, on the eeve
of some solemne feast, to the
end that they may get out

the image of all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

adventure into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
of the Religious as

three or foure to
meete in the twilight at night
and taking a bottle of five or
sixe pottles with a fourth
part of water in it, they goe
to a Taverne bidding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27231:79"/>
them fill the bottle with the
wine in the house, and having
agreed for the price, the
poore Vintner beginneth to
measure while it be almost
full, then they make shew of
a desire to taste it, if it be the
wine that they bought at the
beginning, and scarcely have
they tasted it when bending
their browes, casting up
their eyes and wrying their
nose they cry out at the
wretched Vintner, saying
that he is a theefe and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
who hath changed
them their wine. The poore
fellow seeing that his oathes
and curses availe nothing, is
content to take his wine again
and to take out the bottle the
measures that hee had put in,
by which meanes they have
a fourth part left so well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:27231:80"/>
that it may passe for
wine of sixe pence a quart.
Other whiles they goe five
or sixe in companie to the
Taverne with two great pots
so like th'one to the other,
that very hardly can there
any difference be perceived
betweene them; they carry
th'one emptie and the other
full of water under his cloak,
and biddes them fill the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie
one with the best wine
that they have, never taking
care for the price, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full, the one of them takes
it under his cloake, and the
other staies reckoning with
the Vintner, holding his purse
in his hand and making shew
to pay him: being upon
these termes, the others come
in, and aske alowd whether
or no they shall suppe there,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27231:80"/>
which the Vintner seeing,
allured presently by the
gaine that hee shall make if
they suppe at his house, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
them to stay, and they
take his counsell determining
to goe to the Cookes to buy
some joynt for supper, and
to call backe the rest of their
comerads, leaving the pot
full of water to the Vintner,
that he may keepe it in the
meane while till they come
backe, with which he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
contented and well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
thinking hith himselfe,
that though they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
the pot notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shall remaine with him
for his gaines.</p>
               <p>As for the provision of
flesh, poulterie and other
things they have a thousand
inventions, whereof I will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27231:81"/>
tell you one only which
hapned long agoe to one of
my copsemates. It was,
if I rightly remember, on a
holy Saturdayes market, in
which they sold great store
of Hennes, Partridges, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,
Pullets and other things
against the feastivall day.
Three of the company went
out to seeke for provision,
dividing themselves every
one to his owne walke, the
two met with a Countrey-Clown
loaded with Capons
and Partridges, which were
in the market; one of them
drew neare to buy up all that
he had, &amp; cheapning a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an houre with the
Clowne, agreed to give him
ten Nobles for all his ware,
giving it to his fellow to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it home, and he stayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27231:81"/>
with his hand in his
pocket, making as if he would
pay him. He searcheth both
the sides, of his hose, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out first a great purse,
next a little one, afterwards a
hand-kercher tyed in knots
with some papers folded up,
with which he inchanted the
Clown, and gave his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
time and leasure
enough to get him out of
sight, and at last not finding
in all his budgets the whole
summe, he bids the Clowne
follow him and he should
pay him. The Clown was
content, and beginneth to
follow him with diligence,
and almost on the trot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that as my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had an intention, to get
out of sight crossing the
streets and lanes he walk't
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27231:82"/>
a-pace with posting speede.
But seeing himselfe so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followed by the Clown
he went into the Cloister of
the <hi>Austin</hi> Friers, where
there were some Friers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
folkes, and having
made a devout prayer, hee
turned himselfe towards the
Clown, saying to him, My
friend, the provision that
you have sold me is for this
House, and that Father, who
is there a confessing is the
Proctour, I will goe tell him
that he must pay you; and
speaking thus, he comes to
one of the Confessors with
the Clown after him, and
turning a little aside hee put
sixe pence into his hand, and
whispers him in the eare say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Father, this country man
is one of my acquaintance,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27231:82"/>
and commeth hither to be
confest, he lives sixe miles
hence, and he must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
goe backe to his house
this evening, I beseech you
to do me the favour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
him out of hand and let
him goe. The good Father
obliged by the almes given
aforehand, promist him, that
when hee had ended the
penitents confession whom
he had at his feete, hee should
dispatch him presently. With
this answer, he called to the
Clown, and said to him,
friend, the Father will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
you by and by, when
he hath made an end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
this man, to which
the Father added goe, not

from them, and the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
staid, reckoning on his
singers the money that hee
should lay out on shooes, hat
and other trifles which hee
minded to buy as well for
himselfe, as for his familie
out of his Poultry money.
The penitent makes an end
of his confession, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes a signe to the
Clown to draw neere; the
Clown was not in so trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a perplexitie, with so
great hast as those who come
to confession, which the
good father was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at, it seeming to him
that he had little devotion
and lesse humility to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
The Clown stood bolt
upright, looking heedfully
upon the Confessor, to see if
he should put his hand in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27231:83"/>
pocket, and the Confessor
look't upon the Clown in
like manner, astonisht to see
him stand with so little devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Notwithstanding excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him because of simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
which is ordinarie to
these Country people, hee
biddes him, kneele. The
Clowne at the beginning
made some resistance, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be an extraordinarie
ceremonie for one to kneele
to receive money, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
at last he did it though
grumbling. The father bids
him make the signe of the
Crosse, and say his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereat the Clown lost
all patience, beleeving the
Confessor to be out of his
wits, and standing up begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to mumble within his
teeth and to sweare with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27231:84"/>
great obstinacie. This assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Confessor that the
Clown was possest with a
Devill, and having made the
signe of the Crosse begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to conjure him, putting
S. <hi>Austins</hi> girdle about his
head, and saying some devout
prayers, with which the
Clowne went out of his
wits, taking the good Father
by the surplis and casting
him down upon the ground,
demanding aloud mony for
his poultry. The father sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that hee had all the
fiends of Hell together upon
him, beginneth to say, the
Letanie with a weake and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
voyce, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
himselfe to all the
Saints in the Almanacke,
praying them to aid him. At
the clamour and noise, the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27231:84"/>
whole Convent began to be
troubled, all the Monkes
comming out in procession
with the Crosse and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestickes,
casting holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on every side, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that there was a Legion
of Devils in the Church.
They came thither where
the Confessour was at debate
with the Clown, who still
was asking money, for his
Poultry, &amp; the Prior having
asked the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>I will tell you a wittie
tricke which I once plotted,
though it fell out but badly
by me, seeing that the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
with which you
hearken to me, makes me
know that you are not wearie
to heare me. The last yeere
there came to <hi>London</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of <hi>Italie,</hi> rich, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and of good carriage,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27231:86"/>
who being in rouled by our
spies I tooke the charge upon
me to deale with him. I rose
that day betimes in the
morning, lest I should lose
the occasion, and after I
had dog'd him through
many streets, Lanes and
Churches (for he was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a good Christian) wee
came to a crowd of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
wont to be kept in
the Exchange about eleven
a clock, seeing him alone, I
came to him, talking to him of
a bargaine very profitable
&amp; certaine, which made him
open his eyes, and listen
heedfully to my reasons.
Then seeing him thus fitted
to my inventions, I winded
him gently into a Maze of
difficulties, in such sort, that
I never ceast to declare to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27231:86"/>
him the businesse, nor he
to learne the circumstances.
My Camerade then drew
neare making shew as if he
knew me not; and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to interpret the traffick
for him which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
whereupon the
Marchant began to take no
more heede to me, and I to
thinke evermore of him. I
put secretly my fingers in
his pocket to try the depth
and breadth thereof, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that it and its Masters
little care gave me free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to put in all my hand. I did
so and at the first essay, I
drew his purse, at the second
a silver Watch, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
tied to a small gold-chaine,
with which I might
have bin content if stealing
could be limited. I was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27231:87"/>
to try the third time, to
see if I could draw thence
a Holland hankercher, which
before he had shewed edged
with curious bonelace, but I
could not be so nimble to
draw it, nor my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to hold him in talke, but
he felt me, and running to
save his pocket with his hand
he could not misse but meete
with mine, wherewith being
vext and suspitious, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
knew that he had lost
his purse and his Watch, and
not finding them he tooke me
by the necke, crying A theefe
A theefe. I foreseeing the
evill that might befall mee
(for <hi>Astrologie</hi> is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for a Theefe) had given
the purse and Watch from
underneath my cloake to my
companion, as soone as ever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27231:87"/>
I had drawne it, who was
but only two steps from me:
Wherefore with the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that I had, that he
would finde about me that
which he sought, I scorned
all he said, giving him the lie
a thousand times. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
holding me fast by the
coller, with a loude voyce
calling for his purse, in such
sort that he made all upon
the place to gather together.
But my Camerade seeing
that my honor runne a great
hazard, if the businesse should
be proved amongst so many
people, secretly calls a crier
who was at a corner of the
place, whom he made cry,
If any one had lost a purse
and a silver Watch, that he
should come to him, &amp; give
true tokens therof, he would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27231:88"/>
restore them, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
the place. Hardly
was the sound of the first
cry heard but my good <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
let me goe, intreating me
with great humilitie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him the rash judgement
conceived of me, which I
did at the request of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
and presently got me
out of sight. He went as
nimble as a Roe to seeke for
the cryer, and having found
him he gave the true tokens
of his losse, but he that had
bid him doe it could not be
found any more; and so I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
this dangerous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

called for the likenesse that

through the towne in the

evening, and finding some
doore open, they enter soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hiding themselves in the
Cellar, in the stable, or in
some other dark secret place,
to the end they may throw
out at windowes all that is in
the house, when those within
are fast a-sleepe. I adventured
once to play such a pranke,
and turne my selfe in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of darkenesse, but I was
deceived. It fell out then,
that one night on the Eeve
of a high holy-day I went
to seeke my fortune, my
mishap made me meete with
a doore halfe open, into
which thrusting my head I
saw that all my body might
enter, I went up a paire of
staires to a great Chamber
well furnisht and fitted, and
thinking that it was a safe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27231:89"/>
course for me to hide my
selfe under a bed, while these
of the house were gone to
rest, I did so. After foure
houres that I had laien all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
on the flower, I heard
a noyse of folks, comming
up suddenly into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you neede not aske if I
was heedfull to see who they
were, and by and by with
the light of a Candle I saw
the feete of two footmen
and one maide laying the
cloth with great diligence,
and were making of a fire,
because the Master of the
house was to suppe there.
The table furnish't with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
dishes of meate, foure or
five sate downe, besides the
children that were in the
house. I was then so affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and confounded, that I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27231:89"/>
thinke verily if the noise of
their voyces and the great
number of children had not
hindred them, they might
have heard plainely the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of my joynts, because
my buttockes beate so hard
one against the other, that I
thinke the noise might have
bin heard halfe a mile off. By
mischance there was a little
dogge, that runne about
gnawing the bones that fell
from the table, and one of
the children having thrown
him a bone, a Cat that
watch't under the table was
more nimble to catch it with
which she run away to hide
her under the bed, the dog
grinning and pressing to take
the bone from her, but the
Cat could so well use her
clawes and defend her prize,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27231:90"/>
that having given the Dog
on the nose two or three
blowes with her paw, there
began so great a skirmish, and
there was such a hurly burly
between them, that one of
the waiters tooke a great fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shouell
that was in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ney and cast it so furiously
under the bed, that if, as it
gave me over the nose with
the broad side, it had lighted
on me with the end, it had
kill'd me out-right. The blow
was so great, that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
halfe an houre ere I
could come to my selfe, but
it made the Cat come out
like a thunder from under the
bed, and the Dog staied
grinning and barking with
such a fury that neither faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor threatning of
mine could quiet him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27231:90"/>
the waiters at table were
so vext that they began
to chase him out, throwing
fire-brands at him, which
made him come out from
under the bed, and leave me
there in the pangs of death.
The Dogges noise was done,
and there began another in
my guts, so violent, that to
stay the sudden rumbling of
a flux in my belly, which
the apprehension and feare
had moved I was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to sneeze thrice, &amp; with
the force of my sneezing to
wrong my breeches by the
liberty of that unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
These two noises met
together, and making one of
two, increast so much the
force, that it made all at
table rise, and take off the
Candles, to see what was this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27231:91"/>
novelty. They pulled me
out, but I could give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that could be heard, nor
humble suing that could be
admitted, so I remained sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the rigour of their
vengeance, they stript me
starke naked and binding me
hand and foote, they began
to scorch me with a lighted
Torch not without loud
laughing, and after they had
satisfied their furious passion,
they put me in the hands of
Iustice, out of whose power
I escaped signed and sealed.</p>
               <p>The Mallettes are a sort of
theeves who hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon great perills
and inconveniences, for they
are made up in a bale, basket
or dry fat, faining that it is

one or other of their friends
in Marchants apparell carrie
from one house to another,
that when night commeth
and every one being fast a
sleepe, he cutteth the cloth
with a knife, hee breaketh
forth to empty the house. I
was one of those when the

because a friend of mine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
counterfeited to have
foure bales to be laid by
night in a rich goldsmithes
house, counsel'd me to be
pack't up in one of them, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the sides thereof with
cloth and webs of fustian.
The goldsmith made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
to receive them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as he had not them
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> keeping but a little while,
and that he thought, if the
owner in the meane time
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27231:92"/>
should happen to die, some
one of them might fall to
his share, so he made them
to be laid in his backe-shop,
whereby I was well assured
to worke my feate. I wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
while night with such
desires as that plot deserved,
which notwithstanding fell
out to my disgrace; for three
or foure prentises meeting
that night in the house, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to tarrie there upon
occasion of the bales, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to lay them together,
and lye upon them. After
supper, every one withdrew
himselfe. The prentises fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the unhappy bed, or to
say rather, the bale, in which
I was in the middle of the
others, on which they began
to sleepe so soundly, that one
might have drawne them a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27231:92"/>
mile and never awakened
them. I being impatient of
the exceeding great weight
that I felt, not daring to
stirre my selfe more then I
had bin dead; and on the
other part the little breath
that I had, being choaked, I
began to stirre my selfe a
little, and seeing the unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
weight of that which
was on me; I certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that they had layd a
bale upon me; with which
imagination, and the extreme
anguish that I suffred, I drew
a sharpe knife, and thrusting
it up, I made a great hole in
the tillet of the bale, and a
huge deepe wound in the
buttocks of him that lay
upon me. Hee rose like a
thunder raising his voyce to
the heavens, calling for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27231:93"/>
neighbours helpe and the
Iustices aide, thinking that
some one of his companions
would have kill'd him. The
confused noise of all the
neighbours, and the alarum
was so great, that ere the
Master of the house had ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a candle, the Iustice beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open the doore came in,
and finde the poore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fellow in his shirt bleed
and faint, and the other vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confounded, takes
the deposition of him that
was wounded never taking
notice of the bale, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
neere it, thinking that it
was not needful to know the
place where hee was hurt.
But the goldsmith, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
hearkened to the
Iustice, and beheld the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the fact, seeing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27231:93"/>
the poore-hurt fellow all
bloudie, supposed that the
bales and the cloth in them
might be bloudy and spoil'd
and he bound to pay them,
and with this unquietnesse
he came neere to looke on
the bale, and seeing it cut
thrust in his fingers to trie
if nothing was spoil'd, and
he mist not to finde my
bearde. I could very well
have bitten him if I had
thought it had bin the best of
my play, but I lay quiet,
thinking that he would
never guesse what it was. He
held the torch nigher to the
hole, and stooping to see that
he had touch't, the waxe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to melt and drop upon
my face, which forced me
to remove a little, and him to

Theeves, Theeves. The
Iudge came neere, who was
yet making one write the
deposition of the hurt man,
and opening the bale, they
found one within it. They
carried me to prison, whence
I came out at the seventh
day after at a cartes taile well
accompanied, beside other
favours that they did me,
whereof the greatest was to

Neverthelesse I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed

hoping that fortune would
offer some good occasion to
set me at libertie: so all my

finde out the means to attaine
to this end. And having tried

which might have hapned
well, if fortune had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with my past troubles,
and had not made mee fall
any more in the try all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The invention then was
on this wise. The Captaine
of the Gallie, where I was
slave, being exceedingly in
love with a Lady of good
ranke, and she in no wise
loving him, hee tried all
meanes (though impossible)
to bring her to his bow, and
as is usuall with Lovers to
be the more inflamed when
they finde their beloved hard
to be won, the Ladies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27231:96"/>
coales to the Captaine, in
such sort that he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
rest but when he was
talking of his love. I having
got knowledge by the report
of a slave that went daily to
my Masters house, there to
carrie water, wood, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
necessaries, determined
to try my fortune, and not
lose the occasion. So I
spake him kindly, promising
him that if he would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ayde me, that he might
hope assuredly for his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereof I would as well
make him certaine as of
mine own. The good <hi>Antony,</hi>
(for so the slave was called,)
put so much trust in my
words, hearing me speake of
libertie which I had promist
him, that waited but for the
houre to be employed in that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27231:96"/>
which I did intreate him, and
he thought there was not
time enough; hoping with
great impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that I should
declare to him that which
he was to doe for me: who
seeing him so well minded
on my behalfe, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sillie, faithfull and true,
I shewed him my resolution,
recommending to him secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and wisedome above all
things. I said thus unto him,
My friend <hi>Antony,</hi> know
that it is long since I have
desired to impart a secret to
thee, which I will tell thee
of: but as all things require
wisedome, patience, and the
occasion, I have not done
till now; because I thought it
not fitting till now to do it:
as also, because not being so
satisfied (as I am this present)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27231:97"/>
of thy goodnesse, seeing, as
the Proverb saith, one should
eate a bushell of salt with
his friend ere he trust him.
Thou knowest well our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
love with this Lady
that dwelleth by the great
Church, and how much he
is out of kelter for her, yet
never having received one
favour of her, after so long
time spent in her service, and
so many Duckets spent in
vaine for love of her. Now
if I should finde a meane and
assured invention, to make
him without the spending of
one shilling, or troubling her
doores enjoy his pleasure,
what reckoning would the
Captain make of this service,
and what reward would he
give him who should bestow
on him that which he so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27231:97"/>
desireth? Verily (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered

all those for whom thou
shalt aske. Go to friend, said
I, if thou hast any particular
acquaintance with some one
of them who are most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and best liked in the
Captaines house, thou must
acquaint him with this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
that he may tell him,
and assure him that I will
doubtlesse doe that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and I counsell thee that
it be not delayed. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
which <hi>Antony</hi> received
was so great, that without
bidding me farewell, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
me one word, he
went from me like a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:27231:98"/>
intreating a souldier o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Gallie, that he would
bring him into the Captaines
house, to talke with him of a
matter of great importance.
He was there, and could give
order for my businesse, that
halfe an houre after, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the house came
to the Master of the Gallie,
charging him to send me
with a souldier to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
because he would see
me. The quicke effect which
<hi>Antonies</hi> diligence wrought,
gave me extreme great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and made me hope
that so good a beginning
would bring my designes to
a happie end. Finally, I was
at my Captaines house, tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,
torne, and naked, and
with a great chaine tyed to
my foote. He comming to

his hand upon my shaven
head, began to talke kindly
to me, asking me what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
I was, what was my
name, and why I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to the Gallies. And
I having answered him in a
dissembling manner, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best I could, he drew
me aside, to a corner of the
Chamber, asking if that
which <hi>Antony</hi> had promist
him, was certaine, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
I him, I know not
what he hath said, nor what
promise he hath made, yet I
will tell you, that if he hath
spoken according to that
which I told him, all is true,
without failing one tittle.
Sir, I told him, that if you
would promise to release
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:27231:99"/>
me out of this distresse which
I indure, and to give me my
libertie freely and wholly,
I should make you injoy the
love which you desire with
so great passion and which
so torments you, I promise
you moreover and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you, that making this
condition with you, if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
not my promise you
shall my head cut off, or
throw me into the sea. Thou
bindest thy selfe greatly
(said he with a smiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
alreadie desirous to
see the effect of my promise)
but if thou art a man of so
great knowledge and skill,
that thou canst doe this for
me, this Gallie wherin thou
art shall be thy fortune, for
I shall not onely be content
to give thee thy libertie but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27231:99"/>
I will make thee one of my
houshold servants, and the
best respected of them all.
But tell me, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
canst thou doe it? Sir,
you shall know (said I) that
I was bred with a great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer,</hi>
who under pretence
to cast <hi>Horoscops</hi> and Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
dissembled his Magicke
with so great craft, that there
was not any one in the world
that suspected him. He made
use of me in some of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
experiences, supposing
because I was young and of
a dull wit I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing of the secrets
of his Art. But he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there, because though I
seemed foolish and ignorant,
yet I had an eye on all his
tryalls, and I studied them so
well, that many love secrets
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27231:100"/>
stucke in my memorie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which I have one
most certaine and approved,
with which if a woman were
harder then the <hi>Adamant,</hi> I
will make her softer then the
waxe. In such sort that the
secret which I propound to
you is Magicall, not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and it is requisite to have
some haires of the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
to put it in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
with which, and with
some Ceremonies that must
be performed, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans
heart will be so set
on fire, that she shall take
no rest, but when she is with
or thinketh of her beloved.
Notwithstanding this must
be done in the night, at the
waxing of the Moone, and in
the fields, there being but
only three in the companie,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:27231:100"/>
and these stout and resolute,
that cannot be dismaied nor
frighted, fall out what may,
or whatsoever they see. If,
saith the Captaine, that to
further the businesse there
needeth no other thing but
a good heart, we shall easily
have our desire, for though
all Hell should stand before
me, it were notable to make
me give backe so much as
one step, nor once to change
my colour, or countenance:
and for the haires that thou
hast mentioned, I will give
thee as much as thou shalt
desire. I know Sir, (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
I) by your face that your
naturall inclination is very
fit for Magicke, and if you
had studied it, you would
worke wonders by it. So
now seeing the time favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27231:101"/>
us, and that you have
the Ladies haire, let us not
suffer this waxing of the
Moone to passe with bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our businesse to passe.
You may goe out on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
and he also that shall
accompanie you, as for me,
though ill bestead with the
weight of this chaine, I will
not forbeare to goe a foote.
All shall be in readinesse (saith
the Captaine) against thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
night, &amp; sith experience
hath made thee Master in this
Art, prepare thee well and
studie that which thou
oughtest to doe, to the end
that our designe may not
be lost by negligence or
little care; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
get thee backe to the
Gallie; for I will send to
thee by the governour of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:27231:101"/>
my house who shall be the

                  </gap>hird of our companie, a
faithfull man, couragious &amp;
valiant, and if there neede
any thing to this purpose,
thou maist in the meane time
provide thee, for I will take
order that all be paid that
thou shalt buy. With this
good answer I parted from
my Master more joyfull and
merrie then the flourishing
Spring seeing my businesse
thrive so well at so good a
passe, and being returned to
the Gallie I found my good
<hi>Antony,</hi> who waited for me
with great impatience to
know what I had bargain'd
with the Captaine, and upon
what termes my affaires
stood, to whom I related all
that we had agreed upon, and
the kindnesse that he received
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:27231:102"/>
me withall in accepting my
promise, assuring him that
when I was in favour, the
next thing I asked should be
his libertie. Hardly had I
begun my discourse, but I
perceiued the Governour of
the Captaines house entring
the Gallie, his visage infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
his eyes staring and
dansing, and he running, as
he had quickesilver in his
heeles, asked where I was,
and having perceived me, and
drawne me aside, he said to
me, I am Governour of the
house to the Captaine of
this Gallie, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to come hither,
and to know of thee all that
shall be necessarie for the
businesse that you talked of,
dispose and appoint at thy
pleasure, for I have money
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27231:102"/>
for all, and because that I
may offer thee something in
my own behalfe, take this
crown of gold which I give
thee as a token of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which shall be between
us, and I assure thee that thou
shalt have a good friend of
me at the Captains hands.
But as reason would thou
must answer me with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
acknowledgment, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some thing for me. You
shall binde me much Sir, (I
answered him then very
humbly,) having disparaged
your selfe so much in regard
of him, who is so farre une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:
consider in what my
weakenesse and my povertie
can serve you; for I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it with all my soule. I
will not, saith the Governor,
that thou hazard thy soule,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27231:103"/>
because it is Gods, but I
would faine intreat thee, that
with thy fecrets and thy
skill thou wouldst helpe me
to purchase the favour of a
Gentlewoman of good ranke
whom I have loved now
these five yeares, and
because I am of somewhat
a meaner condition then she
there is no meane to make
her heare me, and if it were
possible to give two blowes
with one stone it would be
be an extreme great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me, &amp; thou shouldst
binde me to thee, not only
as a friend, but as a slave.
Now the Moone is waxing,
and the time very fit, so that
I thinke there is no neede to
make any more ceremonies
for my mistresse than for the
Captaines, and if you must
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27231:103"/>
have of her haire, see here
are some, for it is above a
yeare that I carried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me, keeping them as
reliques. And drawing a
paper out of his pocket put
one of her locks into my
hand. I who desired no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing but that the third
of our companie should be
also so besotted, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
might fall out well, I
was in a manner beside my
selfe with contentment,
which I could not hide nor
dissemble without shewing
some signes in my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of being troubled, by
which he tooke occasion to
aske me what it was that
troubled me. To whom I
answer'd, Sir, I feare that if
the Captaine should know
that I doe any thing for you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27231:104"/>
he would be vexed with me,
and I should lose this good
opportunitie in which lyeth
no lesse then my libertie; this
consideration is that which
troubleth me, not want of
desire to serve you. And
who will tell it him, saith he
then? The Divell, answered
I, that never sleepes, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
what may, I am resolved
to serve you, though I should
lose the Captaines good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
seeing it is the first thing
that you have commanded
me. As for that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the Captains busines
&amp; yours, you must buy a new
sacke, a small corde, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
bigge one of Hempe,
foure ells long, a new knife,
a chaine and a brush, and
these you shall buy without
making any price, that is to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27231:104"/>
say, that you shall give for
them whatsoever the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
shall aske without bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the price: and assure
your selfe, that within a
seven-night, you shall enjoy
your love with great liberty.
Thou givest me greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with this answer, saith
the Governour of the house,
than if the King had given
me a pension of a thousand
crownes a yeare, doe that
which thou promisest, &amp; thou
shall see what I will doe for
thee. And embracing me
kindly he went away full of
hope and joy, leaving me
the most contented man of
the world, seeing that if in
this prison I had sought an
occason which might have
fallen out better for my ease,
it had bin impossible for me
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27231:105"/>
to finde it, for as well my
Captaine as the Governour
of the house were so blinded
besotted and fool'd, that if
I should have call'd the day
night they would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
it. On the contrarie
my heart throb'd a thousand
waies, considering into what
a maze I should thrust my
selfe, if the businesse succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not, neverthelesse I made
a vertue of necessitie, using
that remedie which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
with these that are in
any extremity, which is bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
and resolution. With
this good courage I waited
for the Thursday, which
came more joyfull and fairer
then the Spring, though it
was slow, because of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
they had to injoy their
Mistresses, and mine to get
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:27231:105"/>
out of the harbour by the
cheating trickes that I put
upon them, it seem'd to us
the longest day of all the
yeare. Every time the clocke
struck, they despaired, fearing
to misse the telling of the
houres, as these do who hope
for a thing that they earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire; and after this care
they were in anextacie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what they would do in
the possession of their loves,
as if they had alreadie verily
past the night and overcome
the difficulty. This doubting
and hammering of theirs
served me well to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that they might not
perceive the gulleries that I
put upon them, and the
smoake that I sold them.
Whereby I finde that those
who paint Love blinde, have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27231:106"/>
great good reason for them,
because that, if they not bin
so, they would have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all my promises to be
nothing but winde, and that
the meanes which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them were
for no other end
but to gull.

into which the diseased
falleth, beleeving that which
is not, and framing a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
phantasies and visions
which have no other ground
but their perverse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
imagination, which
workes the same effect in
Lovers, giving them an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of jealouse, to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27231:109"/>
of disdaine, to an other
of favour, making a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of nothing, all which
is bred of a burning desire
which they have to possesse
that which they love. But to
be willing to perswade this
unto him who hath not tried
it, is to desire to draw water
with a sive, and to weight the
earth, I am no Doctor, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Governour, I answer'd
him, nor yet Batcehler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being left yong, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and poore, I lived also
without knowledge, having
only foure words of Latin.
Neverthelesse by the use of
reason well knowen of all
sciences, I understood the
smal reason that Lovers have
to be so oft troubled upon
so small occasion as they are
troubled, because of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:27231:110"/>
their affections tend to
two points, to wit, that the
woman must be good or evil
faithfull or disloyall. If she
be good, faithfull &amp; answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to your affection in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
love, it is a great follie
to be jealous over her: if
she be unfaithfull and known
for such a one, there needs no
other counsel, but not to trust
her nor love her. Whence
may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that all the
accidents to which you say
lovers are subject, are the
overflowings of follie, and
wants of wit, it being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
extravagancie to love
one that hateth, this being
supposed that hatred cannot
be the subject of love, nor
love of hatred, seeing we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
love them that bind
us thereto by their love. If it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27231:110"/>
went by experience, saith the

this hate is not that

the account she makes of her

if she should consent to the

her, which consideration
makes her coole and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that the woman offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not in hating him that

I beleeve so, said the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
but I cannot chuse
but wonder why thou being
so cunning a fellow didst not
enchant the Iudge to be in
love with thee and not have
condemned thee to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
If this secret were good
for a man, said I, a hundred
yeares a goe I had bin a Duke
or a Governour of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
if I had not bin a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
It is not good but for
women, because he that first
found it out, gave it this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
only. That alone sufficeth
me, saith the Governour, if

with it I can soften that ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but with the hope that
thou hast given me, I hold the
victorie as certaine, and I
hinder my selfe that I doe
not see to morrow already.
With these words we came

all that I would have him,
that if I had then cut off his

beleeved that it was needfull

I tooke the
high way towards
the town of <hi>Lyons,</hi> joyfull to
see my self free, &amp; the owner
of foure and twentie double
pistolls, which I found by the

with which and with their

I went into the towne, &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in love with as many
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27231:118"/>
brave Dames as were there: I
talked of love to all that I met
with, and receiving particular
favours of some, because my
presence and my clothes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them that I was a man
of some great house and of
good ranke. True it is that to
keep them in this errour, and
to hold my selfe in the good
account with which I had be
gun, I oftentimes visited the
Merchants of greatest credit,
telling them, that I lookt for
some Merchandise from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and promising to deale

with me, and they trusted my
words as much as my outside

By which &amp; by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit

was not so blinded with love
but this colour'd goodwil, &amp;
these fained sighs tended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for my monies then for

mine. But as there is nothing
that can resist the kinde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
by which a woman
maketh warre against him,
whom she minded to deceive
I suffered my selfe a little to

shewes of a Gentle woman of
the towne, merry, pleasant &amp;c
who entertained me best
though she was none of the
fairest: who making shew
that she was taken with my
love, in a short time emptied
my poore purse, leaving me
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:27231:119"/>
like an Image wrapt up in vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.
I pressed also to binde her
by allmeanes possible answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to her fained affection,
not so much for my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as for that she was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with fine knackes,
which she had bin accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to aske of any new lover
such as are chaines, rings
bracelets, &amp; above all a chain
of Pearle, so bigge, round &amp;
bright, that at the very sight
of them any man of courage
would desire them: This
friendship at first was very
hot, &amp; had a prosperous gale
of winde, but as soone as she
perceived the weakenesse of
my purse, she struck the sailes
of her good-will, &amp; began to
looke upon me with a crosse
&amp; sowre countenance, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
which in some sort put
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27231:120"/>
me in doubt, &amp; made me dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
that I should never work
my seate, which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
at the beginning of her
loves. So before that any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out or vexing should rise
between us, relying upon the
kinde offers which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she had made me, making
me understand, that not only
her goods, but also her very
life shuld be sacrificed to my
friendship; I requested her to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>awn her chain or her Pearls
for to contribute with her
for the expences of the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,
assuring her that I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for two thousand Ducats
from a living which I had in
my country. But as they are
old and subtle in their trade
so they are also in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust,
and so she excused her
selfe, saying that the Pearles
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27231:120"/>
and the chain were pawns of
a friend of hers who was to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> day, and that her honor
should be greatly endangered
if she had them not in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
There needed no small

                  </gap> to cover the annoy which

                  </gap>or little wit to turne into
jest such a plaine denyall.
So without making any
shew, or answering one word
to that purpose, I fell a
laughing most heartily over
her shoulders, saying to her,
that it was a device that I
had framed to try her good
will and to see if she would
indeede confirme that which
she had promist by her
words, and drawing out of
my pocket a counterfeit
letter of Exchange, I made

she knew well, where with
comming to her selfe from
her rugged coynesse, shee
fell againe into her smiling
humour, giving me a few
light blowes on my cheeke,
calling me distrustfull and
mocker. I went away from
her with a thousand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings,
making her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that I was going to
receive a part of that sum,
and God knowes what my
heart was. But as povertie

But it happened quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

would in no wise aske the

which I considered the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,

to me that she would

and that seeing the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of that shee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
shee would raise the
house with her cryes, and
put all the neighbours in
armes. But amongst many
inventions, there came a
subtle one in my minde,
and most fit for the purpose
to this fact, which was, not
to hide the Pearles in any
part of my clothes, but to
swallow them one and one,
being assured that having
past them through my body
they would come forth
more cleere and bright then

that in lesse then a quarter
of an houre, above two

the doores of the house,
came up furiously, finding
me in my shirt, and her in

for her Pearles most furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
The Iudge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
that every one should
hold their peace, that hee
might be inform'd of the
fact, and take the deposition

from me. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the Iudge seeing the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
vehement complaints

that my clothes should be
search't which was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that hardly a moate
of the Sunne could have
beene hid in them, and they
not finding there the Pearles
all of them with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
judged mee to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and condemned her
as subtle, shamelesse, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled.
She seeing then
that they all spake against
her, and misregarded her
complaints, cast her selfe
downe at the Iudges feete,
tearing her haire, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her clothes, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such strong cryes, that
the Iudge knew not what
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:27231:127"/>
to thinke, nor what resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take, and consulting
of the matter with those he
brought with him, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it having beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
that she had the Pearles
when she went to bed, they
should be searched for, in all
the most secret corners of
the Chamber, they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found, they should send

give me a potion mingled

the end that if I had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, I might cast

Iudges sentence was put in
execution, and having done
their diligence proposed
about the Chamber, and not
finding the Pearls, they were
forced to come to the last
remedy, which was the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,

they which forced me
to take in full health without
the Physitians appointment,
and against my wil, &amp; though
I did all that was possible for
me to vomite them, there was
no meane to make me doe it,
so a vehement strife being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
in my guts I was
compelled to give way to
the Pearles, and to tarry my
selfe in prison, enjoying the
favours which these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Iustices are wont to
bestow upon those
that fall into their

we resolved to make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

before wee were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
of all things fitting
for the voyage, we had a
consultation about our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
and infamie, descan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the meanes which
we might make in so great
mishap, and thinking it was
not safe for us to embarke
our selves in so great a citie
as <hi>Paris,</hi> not having meanes
to live on there, and by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27231:130"/>
which to busie our selves,
at least while wee were

had given me the hearing a

heard all the reasons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
which I propounded,
he said, Master <hi>Lucas</hi> (for
that was the name which I
had at <hi>Lions)</hi> the inventions
that you shew me are good
and worthy of such a spirit
as yours: but they bee
hard and difficult questions.
Wherefore leaving them
for another occasion, I will
tell you one, which if it fal
out well, it may well be
that we shall get out of this
miserie. This is that we may
use diligence to finde in this
Citie of <hi>Lions</hi> some Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
that hath trade and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
at <hi>Paris,</hi> from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:27231:130"/>
whom wee may get a letter
directed to his friend, and
having found him, you shal
tell him secretly, that you
will make up some packes
of Marchandise in this
towne to be transported to
<hi>Flanders</hi> with some mony,
and leave all at <hi>Paris</hi> in
the hands of some sure man,
that it might be kept safe,
while you go to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
where you shall make as if
you have a Cozen germane,
to trie the price, and how
your Marchandise may be
past off; and that having
never beene at <hi>Paris,</hi> nor
made any acquaintance to
whom you might recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your packes, you shall
intreate him to write to some
Merchant of his friends,
that hee may keepe them
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27231:131"/>
for you. For so much, I
suppose, hee will not refuse
you, and if he agreeth to it,
let me alone. You shall see
how I will rule my hands?
If that be all that hinders
you, said I, I will finde
them that shall give me a
thousand letters, and not one
only though I am now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced,
and with infamie
yet bleeding, I would have
you to know, that there
was moe than foure that
will doe somewhat for me,
and that this is true you shall
see by and by. With these
words I went from him, and
going to a Marchants house
of my acquaintance, asking
of him a letter, after the
forme that my camerade
had told me, with which I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eturned exceeding content,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:27231:131"/>
and putting it into his hand,
he kissed it a thousand times,
praising my diligence and
credit, and so at last we came
to <hi>Paris</hi> with it, where wee
being retired to a Chamber
of the suburbs, we made
two Packes, with some pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of coorse canvasse, the
rest full of sundry things,
such as old shooes, old
clothes, ragges, and such
other wares, and my Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade
put himselfe in the
third, wherein I packt him
up so neately and handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that neither his Packe
nor the other two seemed
to be nothing else but cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
or Fustians. Our Packes
being made up, I went to
give the letter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to whom it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
who received it most
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27231:132"/>
gladly offering me all his
house. After this wee
agreed that I should send the
Packes at eight a clocke at
night, to save the custome
other dues to be paid by the
Marchants, amongst which
entred that of my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if not full of camlots,
yet at least of cords, ladder,
hooke, file, lantern, knife and
other militarie tooles, with
which to make war for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
and robbe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
mony. He then being
entred and all in the house
asleepe, because it was past
eleven a clocke he slit the
canvasse with a knife, and
comming out hee search't
all the corners of the
house, throwing out at the
windowes some apparell
and silke gownes with that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27231:132"/>
seemed to him to be of the

the Divell would

that they gave me
no leasure to hide our boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which I was gathering
up, nor to betake my selfe to

no great neede of questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mee for to know my

could not fall from heaven,
they perceived that my
Camerade was above,
whom, after they led mee

also for the same
crime. He went out a fort

those that otherwise
exercise our arte. We have in
the first place a captain &amp; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
all sorts of whom
theevsobey, &amp; he disposeth of
their thefts w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they shold act,
na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing these whoseeme to him
the fittest for the purpose, and
choosing the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningest &amp; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany for the most
difficult &amp; dangerous thefts.
And in this there is so good
order kept, that there is no
man amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst us that forgetteth
one only point of his duty, nor
that passeth the bounds of his
commission undertaking that
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in another mans charge
nor medling with greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
than his capacity can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.
And know this that it is
the most esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall point of our
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, by the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27231:134"/>
wherof all others are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
This captain examineth
him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth newly unto
the company giving him three
months of novice ship, to try
his courage, inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time, he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to him some witty que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
as be these; to hang up
some little thing without lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
pole or line; to steale a
mans horse as he is riding on
him upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way; To snatch a
way a Courtiers band amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst
a hundred people, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of this kinde. And
having known his inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; capacity,<note place="margin">See Cap. 7. p. 54.</note> he givs him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a robber, of a Grumet,
of a Cut-purse, or any other
wherof he is found to be most
capable. You will not deny
but that this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
is a great state point,
just reasonable, &amp; so necessary
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:27231:135"/>
for the Common wealth,
that because it hath not bin
practised, so great disorders
are seene every where in it,
seeing violence can promise
no other good end. I will tel
you that estates and offices
should be given to every
one, according to his natural
inclination, without enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or tying him by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to another thing than
to that which it desireth, not
following that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
to wit, unquietnesse
and mishap. For I held it
impossible, that shee whom
her parents shall put in a
Cloister against her will, for
want of monie to marrie her,
can live in peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
As also he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
proue a better husband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27231:135"/>
his parents, and against his
minde is tyed in marriage,
and so of other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
We have a notable
example of this good order
in the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> state, a
curious people, civill and
wise, who suffered their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to grow up in libertie,
without putting them upon
any employment, nor to
store up their appetite to any
other estate, than to that to
which their minde prompted
them, and when they came
to age and discretion they
might choose of themselves
the meane to live by most
proper and most befitting
their naturall inclination, and
thence it proceeded that all
their actions were so wel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and so per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
