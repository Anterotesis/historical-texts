            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I am resolved not to be much afflicted for the loss of that which is not in my power to keep, yet I cannot deny but the loss of a Friend goes very neer to my heart; and by this name of a Friend I did presume, till of late, I might have called you: because, though perhaps for want of power and opportunity I have done you no good office, yet I have been alwayes willing and ready to do you the best service I could: and therefore I cannot but admire the affected strangeness which in your last Letter to me you seem to take upon you, renouncing in a manner all Relation to me, and tacitly excommunicating me from all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in you. The superscription of your Letter is to Mr. <hi>William Chillingworth,</hi> and the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Iohn Leuger</hi>; as if you either disdained, or made a conscience of stiling me your Friend, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48545:3"/>
your self mine: If this proceed from passion and weakness, pray mend it, if from reason, pray shew it; if you think me one of those to whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> forbids you to say, <hi>God save you</hi>; then you are to think and prove me one of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, Who deny Christ Jesus to be come in the flesh; if you think me an Heretick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be avoided, you must prove me <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, condemned by mine own judgment, which I know I cannot, and therefore I think you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: If you say I do not hear the Church, and therefore am to be an Heathen, or a Publicane, you are to prove then that by the Church, is meant your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet when you have done so, I hope Christians are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to shew humanity and civility even to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: For Gods sake Mr. <hi>Leuger</hi> free your self from this blind zeal, at least for a little space, and consider with reason and moderation what strange Crime you can charge me with, that should deserve this strange usage, especially from you: is it a crime with all my understanding, to endeavour to find your Religion true, and make my self a Believer of it, and not to be able to do so? Is it a crime to imploy all my reason upon the justification of the Infallibilitie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, and to find it impossible to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified? I will call God to witness (who knows my heart better than you do) that I have evened
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48545:3"/>
the scale of my judgment as much as possibly I could, and have not willingly allowed any one grane of worldly Motives on either side, but have weighed the reasons for your Religion, and against it with as much indifferencie, as if there were nothing in the world but God and my self, and is it my fault, that the scale goes down which hath the most weight in it? That the building falls, that hath a false foundation? have you such power over your understanding, that you can believe what you please, though you see no reason? or that you can suspend your belief when you do see reason? if you have, I pray for old friendship-sake, teach me that trick; but until I have learned it, pray blame me not for going in the ordinarie way, I mean for believing, or not believing as I shall see reason: If you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of wilfull opposition against the known truth, of negligence in seeking it, of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to find it, of preferring temporal respects before it, or of any other fault which is in my power to amend (that indeed is a fault) if I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it not, be as angry with me as you please; but to impute to me involuntary errors, or that I do not see, that which I would see, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or that I will not confess that, which I do not believe; certainly this is a far more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable error, then any you can justly charge me with. But let me tell you, that imputing Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48545:4"/>
to me, (whosoever was the Author of it) was a wicked and groundless slander: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will say (for this is the usual song of that side) that Pride is a voluntary fault, and with this I am justly chargeable, for forsaking that guide which God hath appointed me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: but what if I forsook it, because I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear it was one of those blind guides which whosoever blindly follows, is threatned by our Saviour, that both he and his guide shall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch? Then I hope you will grant it was not Pride but Conscience, that caused me to do so: for as it is wise humility to obey those whom God hath set over me, so it is sinfull credulity to follow every man, or every Church, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant will take upon them to guide me: Shew then some good and evident title, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath to this office, produce but one reason for it, which upon trial will not finally be resolved and vanish into uncertainty; and if I yield not unto it, say if you please I am as proud as <hi>Lucifer.</hi> In the mean time give me leave to think it strange, and not far from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, that this doctrine of the Romane Churches, being the guide of Faith (if it be true doctrine) should either not be known to the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, or if it were known to them, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wise and good men, should either be so envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Churches happiness, or so forgetfull
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48545:4"/>
of the good work they took in hand, which was to write the whole Gospel of Christ, as that not one of them should so much as mention, so much as once, this so necessary a part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, without the belief whereof there is (as you would make the world believe) no salvation and with the belief whereof (unless men be snatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by sudden death) there is hardly any damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is evident they do all of them with one consent speak very plainly of many things of no importance in comparison hereof, and is it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or indeed possible, that with one consent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conspiracy, they should be so deeply silent concerning this <hi>Unum necessarium,</hi> this one very necessary thing? You may believe it if you can, for my part I cannot, unless I see demonstration for it: For if you say, they send us to the Church, and consequently to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this is to suppose that which never can be proved, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Church; and without this supposal, upon the division of the Church, I am as far to seek of a Guide of my Faith as ever.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 As for example, in that great division of the Church, when the whole world wondred (saith S-<hi>Ierome</hi>) that it was become Arian, when <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and S. <hi>Hillary</hi> testifie) subscribed their Heresie, and joyned communion with them: Or in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48545:5"/>
division between the Greek and the Romane Church about the Procession of the Holy Ghost, (when either side was the Church to it selfe, and each part heretical and schismatical to the other) what direction could I then an ignorant man have found from that Text of Scripture, <hi>Unless he hear the Church, let him be unto thee, as an heathen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </item>
               <item>2 Again give me leave to wonder, that neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> should so much as intimate this their priviledg of Infallibility, but rather on the contrary, put them in fear in the 11<hi>th</hi> Chapter, that they, as well as the <hi>Iews,</hi> were in danger of falling away.</item>
               <item>3 That S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the pretended Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> writing two Catholick Epistles mentioning his departure, should not once acquaint the Christians, whom he writes to, what Guide they were to follow, after he was taken from them.</item>
               <item>4 That the Writers of the New Testament should so frequently forewarn men of Hereticks, false Christs, false Prophets, and not once arme them against them, with letting them know this onely sure meanes of avoiding their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</item>
               <item>5 That so great a part of the New Testament
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48545:5"/>
should be employed about Antichrist, and so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and indeed none, about the Vicar of Christ, and the guide of the faithful.</item>
               <item>6 That our Saviour should leave this onely means for the ending of Controversies, and yet speak so obscurely and ambiguously of it, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow our Judge is the greatest Controversie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e greatest hindrance of ending of them.</item>
               <item>7 That there should be better evidence in the Scripture to entitle the King to this office, who disclaims it, then the Pope, who pretends it.</item>
               <item>8 That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> should never exercise over the Apostles any act of Jurisdiction, nor they ever give him any one title of Authority over them.</item>
               <item>9 That if the Apostles did know that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was made Head of them, when our Saviour said, [<hi>Thou art Peter, and on this Rock, &amp;c.</hi>] they should still contest who should be greatest, and that our Saviour should never tell them, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man.</item>
               <item>10 That S. <hi>Paul</hi> should say, that he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferior to the very chief of the Apostles.</item>
               <item>11 That the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> or Novices in the Primitive Church, should never be taught this foundation of their faith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the guide of their faith.</item>
               <item>12 That the Fathers, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome</hi> and
<hi>Optatus,</hi> when they flew highest in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, should attribute
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48545:6"/>
no more to her, then to all other Apostolical Churches.</item>
               <item>13 That in the Controversie about <hi>Easter,</hi> the Bishops and Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> should be so ill ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized, as not to know this principle of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, the necessity of conformity in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>14 That they should never be pressed with any such necessity of conformity in all things, but only with the particular tradition of the Western Churches in that point.</item>
               <item>15 That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and many other Bishops not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>Ad hanc Ecclesiam necesse est omnem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire Ecclesiam,</hi> should not yet think that a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Doctrine, nor a sufficient ground of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought to be so.</item>
               <item>16 That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> should be so ill instructed in their faith, as not to know this foundation of it.</item>
               <item>17 That they likewise were never urged with any such necessity of conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ever charged with heresie or error for denying of it.</item>
               <item>18 That when <hi>Liberius</hi> joyned in communion with the Arrians, and subscribed their heresie, the Arrians should not then be the Church and guide of faith.</item>
               <item>19 That never any Hereticks for five Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48545:6"/>
Christ, were pressed with this Argument of the Infallibility of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or charged with the denyal of it as a distinct Heresie; so that <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (who was himself as Pope) should have cause to say, <hi>Ante tempora Concilii Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeni quisque sibi vivebat, &amp; parvus respectus habebatur ad Ecclesiam Romanam.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>20. That the Ecclesiastical story of those times mention no Acts of Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Churches; as if there should be a Monarchy, and the King for some ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, should exercise no Act of Jurisdiction in it.</item>
