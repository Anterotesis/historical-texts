            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If this bee not done perfectly, the losse of Carret séedes will bee more in value then the Charges of stakes, roddes and lynes. The stakes must bee set in this manner: First two stakes at the end of the bed, then ouer passe foure Carrets, and in the middest betweene two Carrets set a stake on either side the bed, and the lines &amp; rods as aforesaid, then as the Carret branches doe grow, they must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tended to keepe them in good order within the lynes: this being done about the last of August, the Carret séedes will begin to bee ripe, and as they doe change to some browne colour, so to bee cut from time to time, vntill the last bee sufficiently ripe about the first of October: Then place the Carret seedes as you doe cut them on a Chamber floore to drie, &amp; when they be drie, beate the seedes out with small staues, or beast with the edge of a lath, and clense them from the composte or refuse (as you finde best by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) with ridle and siue. There are three kindes of Carrets, two of them are profitable and the third is not: The great long yellow Carret, and the great short Carret are principall good, but the common or wilde Carret, which is pale yellow coloured and small and long, is to be refused, for they yeeld small profit, neither are they so good meate as the other two kindes by much. The séedes of the two best kindes of Carrets doe change into diuerse colours: and if you choose a roote of any colour that doth best like you, then set the same for séede, and so shall you haue store of rootes of that colour that so is set for séede when time serueth: if you doe make choyse of the best Carrets and set them for seedes as aforesaid, then your séedes are very bad and not profitable to bee vsed by any, but deceiueth the sower

            <p>THere bee two manner of sowing of Gardens heere in this Countie of <hi>Salop,</hi> and as I finde by experience those two maners vsual &amp; common, are very vnprofitable. The one maner is to open the bed and set the earth on both sides, then to sowe the séedes on the bed, then to draw with a Rake the earth from both sides to couer the seedes, but when the seedes doe growe in sight, there is nothing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a quarter of a yard to the edge of the bed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much ground is lost on both sides of the bed, and very vnprofitable to the owner.</p>
            <p>The second manner of vsuall and common sowing of Gardens, is when the bed is made, the seedes are sowed thereon, and then earth is sifted thervpon, to couer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> séeds, and when the seedes be sprong and begin to growe, they be so ebbe vnder the earth, that euery small frost or colde raine which commeth dooth destroy the new spring of the séedes, and sometimes all is lost thereby.</p>

The good Carrets which are to be drawen from the rest, will easily bee drawen into a good ground with hand, and the easier to bee drawen in the fore noone and best after a shower of raine. And you may haue good profit by those Carrets so drawen and sowed, for they are nouelties and desired of many soe timely in the yéere. Then about the twentith of Iuly, your Carrets in a good ground will be somewhat faire to sell: and if you sell them then or shortly after, so that you take them vp before the fourtéenth of August: you may as you rid the ground of Carrets, sowe Turnips séede or Radish séede in their place, so that you haue the best kinde of Turnip séede to sow, and in so dooing you may haue two croppes euery yere and both with good profit. And if it happen that the Carret seedes doe faile in the spring time by hardenes of weather, or by wormes of the earth: Then about the midst of May or the end of May you may set Cabadge plants in those places, where the Carrets doe want, and in want of Cabadge plants you may sowe good Turnips séedes, or Radish séedes thereon.

Then by this means the beanes so pinched or cut, will stand stiffe of themselues, that there needeth no rises nor boughs to bee sticked amongst them, to keepe them for breaking with the winde, And they will also beare the more beanes, and the sooner will be ripe, because there be no rises or boughs to shadow them.
