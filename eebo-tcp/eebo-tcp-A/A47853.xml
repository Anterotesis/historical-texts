            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Finall Protest, and Sence of the
CITIE.</head>
            <p>HAving diligently perused two <hi>printed Papers,</hi> bearing date the 14<hi>th</hi> of this instant <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember:</hi>
The one, in form of <hi>a Proclamation concerning the summoning of a Parliament:</hi> The
other, as an <hi>Order of the Common-councell,</hi> commanding the City to acquiesce in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Parliament: We finde therein contained, matters so contrary to the <hi>Honour</hi> of
the <hi>Nation,</hi> and to the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> that we stand obliged, both as <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and as <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
to protest, against the <hi>Impositions</hi> of the <hi>Former,</hi> as <hi>Illegal,</hi> and the <hi>Concessions</hi> of the Latter, as
a direct <hi>Combination</hi> against us. These <hi>two papers</hi> are <hi>Seconded</hi> by a <hi>Third:</hi> (for the <hi>Two</hi> are <hi>One,</hi>
both in <hi>effect,</hi> and Design,) and that is, a <hi>Proclamation of Banishment,</hi> directing to the late Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
under the notion of the Common Enemy; so that there's no love lost betwixt the <hi>Committee
of Safety,</hi> and the <hi>Common Council,</hi> when the <hi>General</hi> provides for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>City;</hi> and the
<hi>Mayor,</hi> for the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> not to argue <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> and the violation of <hi>publique
Faith</hi> in the case: that they <hi>conditioned</hi> for their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>compounded</hi> for their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
This is not our <hi>concern,</hi> what <hi>they do</hi> suffer; but what <hi>we may, if we Trust those, that Keep
no faith with them:</hi> And that we'll take a care of: When <hi>They</hi> are gone, Then <hi>we are</hi> the <hi>Common
Enemy; So are the Laws of God, and of the Nation, and such is every Man that Loves them.</hi> What
this <hi>Malignant party</hi> is, these People talk of, we neither <hi>Know,</hi> nor <hi>Meddle;</hi> the <hi>Gentry</hi> 'tis we
Live by, and by the Laws of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Hospitality,</hi> we are Bound to <hi>Protect</hi> them, and as well
resolved to do it, within our Walls, against any other power, than that of the Known Law. The
short of the Design is this, a <hi>Danger</hi> is pretended to the <hi>City,</hi> from the <hi>late Kings party,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the mischief, the Kind <hi>Committee Banishes</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> with Order to the <hi>Mayor of Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
(late of <hi>London</hi>) &amp;c.—<hi>to make strict searches for Delinquents.</hi> Now in pursuance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Order, our <hi>Houses</hi> must be <hi>Forced,</hi> and <hi>we Disarmed,</hi> and then, our <hi>Throats cut, to preserve
the City.</hi> Let those that would be <hi>Chronicled</hi> for <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Fools, submit to suffer this; and after
that Infamous Hour, may a Yellow coat, and a Wooden Dagger be the Badge, and Distinction of a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.</hi>
To conclude, We our selves <hi>are that City,</hi> so much the care and cry of the Proclamation; and
<hi>This is</hi> our <hi>Vnanimous sence,</hi> and <hi>Resolve.</hi> The <hi>Army</hi> proposes to <hi>Pillage,</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> us, the <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi>
and his worthy <hi>Advisers, Ireton, &amp;c.</hi>—are to hold our hands, whiles they give the <hi>Blow,</hi> So,
that we are now to provide against <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Treason,</hi> having <hi>One</hi> enemy within our <hi>Walls,</hi> and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in our <hi>Councils.</hi> But withal, we have our <hi>Swords</hi> in our <hi>Hands,</hi> and our <hi>Brains</hi> in our <hi>Heads;</hi>
so that only to <hi>Strike</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and to <hi>Dis-believe</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> is to <hi>Subdue</hi> and <hi>Disappoint</hi> them <hi>Both.</hi>
We do therefore declare to the World, that we will by <hi>Violence</hi> oppose all <hi>Violence</hi> whatsoever,
which is not warranted by the letter of the <hi>Established Law:</hi> and that in pursuance of this duty, both
toward the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> an insolent <hi>Souldier,</hi> and an <hi>Apostatized Magistrate</hi> shall be to us as
the same thing.—Not to word it much further, as we will not be <hi>Bafled,</hi> by <hi>Affronts,</hi> so neither
will we be <hi>Fooled</hi> by <hi>Flatteries.</hi>—After the loss of Trade, and Liberty, a vast expence of Blood,
and Treasure, after many <hi>Injuries received, more Threatned,</hi> and <hi>none Returned;</hi> we made a sober,
and regular <hi>Application,</hi> to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> for <hi>Redress.</hi> This they <hi>Promised,</hi> and we <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,</hi>
till at last, instead of a <hi>Reparation for past Wrongs,</hi> or a <hi>Security</hi> against <hi>worse to come,</hi> we are
paid with an <hi>Expectation of a Parliament</hi> in <hi>Ianuary.</hi> This is is a Logique we understand not. It is
in <hi>English, Lye still,</hi> till you have your <hi>Throats cut.</hi> It would be well to commit the disposition
of our Fortunes, to those people, that are at this Instant designing an execution upon our persons,
and to requite those <hi>Worthies,</hi> that have already <hi>Robb'd</hi> vs of <hi>all</hi> we have <hi>Lost,</hi> with the <hi>Offer</hi> of
that little <hi>Rest</hi> they have <hi>Left.</hi> But this will not do our businesse; we will not have our <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
for our <hi>Iudges:</hi> not will we wait. That <hi>Parliament</hi> they <hi>Babble</hi> of so much, will not soon <hi>Vote</hi>
up the <hi>City</hi> again out of Ashes, nor all the Saints in that holy Assembly, be able to bring the <hi>poor
Cobler</hi> into the world again, that was <hi>Kill'd</hi> by order of his <hi>Brother Hewson.</hi> No, the <hi>cheat</hi> is too
stale, and we are determined to redeem our selves; but with this caution; we do solemnly profess,
that we will exercise all the tendernesse which possibly the case will bear. The <hi>Common Souldier</hi> is
engaged rather out of a <hi>Heedlesse,</hi> than <hi>Malitious Interest:</hi> We do therefore protest, that such of
those as shall not evidence their <hi>Malice,</hi> by their <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> shall receive a fair consideration; But,
for such as <hi>Lead</hi> them, we do <hi>Resolve,</hi> not to allow Quarter to any one of them, that draws his
Sword in the Quarrel: and in order to the quicker, and Gentler Dispatch of the businesse: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with a Text. <hi>Fight neither with small nor Great, but with the King of Israel.</hi> And so God
give a Blessing to the Endeavours of all Honest Men.</p>
