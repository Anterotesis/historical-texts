            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>HONOURED GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving done considerable Services relating to the Victualling, Mr. <hi>Agar</hi> being dead (for whose Memory I shall always have a Veneration); and it being confidently spread abroad that Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> was laying down, and Capt. <hi>Ayles</hi> to be removed, which would have made way for new Comissioners; being sensible of my Loss in the former, who had constantly given me Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in what I offered for the Publick; and that Mr. <hi>Main</hi> who was to succeed Him as First Commissioner would be my violent Opposer. Upon this I resolved and accordingly applyed my self to the Admiralty (Recommended by His Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>) for a Settlement and Compensation, for Performances laid before Them; which the following Prints present the Reader with. Their Lordships sent my Allegations down to the Commissioners for Victualling, with a Command of a Report concerning me, which They made, and I have publish'd from a Copy granted me after it was sent up. This was soon replyed to by me, and only given in to Them. I now likewise print it. Paragraph to Paragraph to Their Report, that in one single view the Reader may see and judg of both. From that time Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> has made me hope the Gentlemen might be brought over to do me Right, yea even after the Lords of the Admiralty had writ to Them in Words of a harsh Sound about me, occasioned by the Severity of their Report. Several Months being spent in fruitless Attendance, Capt. <hi>Ayles</hi> since dead, and Mr. <hi>Burlington</hi> were prevail'd with, by Mr. <hi>Papillion,</hi> upon Proposals here to be seen of eminent Advantage to the Government, to Contract with me. Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> recedes and leaves me all in Ruines, Mr. <hi>Main</hi> is what he ever was, and nothing less than a Miracle can change him. The Letters I likewise set forth, to shew I have used my utmost Endeavours to soften them to a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with me: All being successless, I became desperate, as may appear by my Farewel-Letter, of such a strain nothing could justify it but such a Treatment; especially when at that very Instant the King was abus'd in His Subjects, the Commissioners in their Honour, and I with a Numerous Family expos'd to a Jail and Starving. Who could have done more to have prevented this Publication? Or who would silently perish in complaisance to such unrelenting Tempers?</p>

            <head>An Account of the Transactions between <hi>John Kelly</hi> and the Commissioners for Victualling, since their coming in and his first being employ'd by them.</head>
            <p>BEing heartily affected to the present Government, I very early devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my thoughts to the Service of it. I well knew that there might be Baked in the Kings Ovens larger quantities of durable Bisket than custom, that common plea for all that's Ill, would ever admit of; and that the Town Bakers in Contract required an Overseer as much as formerly. I was recommended to the Commissioners for the Victualling by Persons of so extraordinary a Character, that they soon received me to regulate their own Bakehouse, and to see the Bakers abroad perform'd their part. In this Trust I was for six Months, I challenge my Enemies to prove upon me the least failure in my duty. All that space I Baked in my own House, and sold to the Commissioners, being under the daily view of such who (if they had found any thing to my disparagement) would loudly have proclaim'd it. At the foresaid Expiration, Mr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne</hi> at the Board demanded my Warrant, telling me, They had no farther Occasion for me; and when they had, they would send for me: Which some intended they never should, as by the sequel will easily be discern'd. This was the deep Contrivance of Capt. <hi>Bolt,</hi> whose private Interest justling with the Publick and Mine, is the Source of all my Misfortunes. Not long after <hi>D<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was taken into my Place on Labourers pay, one of no judgment, and whose mean allowance might be foreseen a temptation to <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I detected: He does his utmost to blast my Reputation, thereby to prevent my re entry whence I was dispossess'd. The Commissioners having occasion for great quantities of Bisket bought 3000 Bags of me. I had just taken a new built House, which I had a prospect would prejudice my Bread if it continued with me; I acquainted the Gentlemen with it, they promis'd to take it as fast as baked: This not being done, I renewed my application; they told me the Ships were not ready; with these Delays I had 1500 Bags of Bisket so damnified (though very good in it self) that it was left on my hands, which I was forced to cull, and sold to those of the Trade who sold part of it to the Commissioners, as I proved before them. Dampness of Ships spoil'd some Mens Bread while in the River, yet they sustain'd no loss by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> The sending for Bisket was Capt. <hi>Bolt's</hi> business. At the same time two others baked Horse-Beans in their Bread, and was accepted, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Mr. <hi>Mayne</hi> who sold a Horse, Capt. <hi>Bolt</hi> who had the Present of a Silver-heated Cain, and <hi>Dodson</hi> who had 10 <hi>l.</hi> lent him on a Note, which was to be deliver'd up when the Bisket went to Sea. This I made out against <hi>Dodson,</hi> for which he was discharg'd.</p>
            <p>Thence forward such Grain was made use of in Bisket for the Navy, as ne're had been known. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> bought 130 <hi>Quarter</hi> of dammag'd Pease out of the Victualling-Office, baked it into Bisket, and sold it to the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I ask'd him how he thought to get clear of it? He told me I might go with him and see: he buys a Horse of Mr. <hi>Mayne,</hi> who challenges him for 10 <hi>s.</hi> remaining for the former in my hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37660:5"/>
I baked 500 Bags of Bisket with some Pease in it, to see how they would pass from me: They were refus'd, and after six Months keeping, sold by another to the Office, for more than I would have parted with them for at first.</p>
            <p>The Town-Bakers were in Confederacy to fix an extravagant Price on the Bisket, they knew the Commissioners were in urgency for; after all these Discouragements I resolv'd to appear, and as I happily baffled their Designs, I made then Three Proposals to the Commissioners. <hi>1st.</hi> To prevent mixtures. <hi>2dly.</hi> To carry on Baking in their own Office, as afore done by me. <hi>3ly.</hi> By baking in my own House the Kings Stuff. The latter they soon complied with me in, and contracted with me for, the Two former was to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured over as I shall presently relate. The Proposal they closed with me in, was to be defeated as far as possible. Mr. <hi>Mayne</hi> set himself against my pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to Contract, which Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> was for, yet it was carried against me. Nor did I bake what I could have baked, though I might have Goods sent into me on the Office credit: This was to my great Injury, and the Publick too, and Gain to none I know of, but the Purveyor. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners order'd the clearing of my House of the Bisket I had in it, before I baked for them; which I did, and after sold it to them. <hi>Dodson</hi> was again brought in, he survey'd it, and reports it, as handling cold; when I came to take out my Warrants, Mr. <hi>Mayne</hi> crys out we'll amerce him, Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> askt how much? Mr. <hi>Mayne</hi> said 3 <hi>l. per C.</hi> which came to 45 <hi>l. Dodson</hi> seem'd concern'd at it, and told me, he thought 1 <hi>s. per C.</hi> would have been as much as they would have laid on it. This was the first Amercement ever was made, as I knew of; and by Mr. <hi>Mayne's</hi> good will it should be the only one, as will appear by an Article in the Report about Amercement, which was what he openly express'd at the Board against me to have brought them off; which taking Air the Bakers Petition'd for Remission, but Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> resolv'd it should not go unpunish'd, and carried it.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners Ship'd great quantities of Bisket for the <hi>Streights</hi> There was sent to Sea as I proved upon <hi>Dodson</hi> by Three Witnesses such Bisket it was ashame it should pass; upon this he was again thrown out, Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> declaring he must never expect to be imployed more in the Office.</p>
            <p>For all this the Commissioners accepted not of my two former Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals till some time after, as the succeeding Papers will manifest.</p>
            <p>I'll put an end to this account, acquainting only after all the Services my Reply to the Report will make out, with the brightest Evidence, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was rumour'd Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> had resign'd, there having been a Drip in my House that had damaged some Cakes; the whole Lost of Bisket, was given out for such to Capt. <hi>Ayles,</hi> which he so resented, he resolv'd I should turn out before himself, so forbid me any more Meal. This Inspiration from the Father of Lies was to render me odious to the New Commissioners, Mr. <hi>Maine</hi> to be Chairman. While my Enemies were flusht with this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Victory they flatter'd themselves they had obtain'd, and looking on themselves as rid on me forever. The Almighty Patron of the Oppress'd infuses new Courage into me; and bold as Innocence I attended the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> with my Case, who was nobly pleas'd to send me in his Great Name to the Admiralty; to whom I presented what follows.</p>
            <p>I must only detain the Reader while I do justice to their Lordships, for their most obliging Reception of me. I should be guilty of the blackest Ingratitude, did I not make an honourable mention of what was so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. I return likewise the Gentlemen of the Navy my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their dispatch in my Affair. How pleas'd should I be to celebrate the Praises of those, whose goodness has been flowing to me, while I'm all in torture now, I am forc'd to appear a rude ill-natur'd Satyrist, in making the iustest Reflexions on those who have been otherwise.</p>

            <head>The Case of <hi>John Kelly</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls Shadwell,</hi> His Majesty's Bisket-Baker, and Supervisor of the Victualling-Office on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THat the said <hi>John Kelly</hi> for many Years hath followed his Calling of a Bisket-Baker, but in <hi>November</hi> 95, the Commissioners for victualling the Navy contracted with him wholly to serve the King, and to quit all Merchants and other Services, and to bake all he could in his own House on <hi>Wapping-Wall,</hi> and make it of the King's Stuff, which he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with all Faithfulness according to his Contract.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That being zealous to serve His Majesty and his Seamen, and he did in several Letters inform the said Commissioners, that other Bakers who were in Contract to deliver Bread made all of sound and sweet Wheat at a certain Price, did defraud the King, and abuse the Seamen by mixing Meal made of Rye, Barly and Pease, which would not keep any considerable time Water-born, nor was wholsome for the Seamen.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That such Practices was the occasion that so much Bread was so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently return'd, and particularly betwixt <hi>November</hi> 96, and <hi>May</hi> 97, vast Quantities were return'd at one time, for which the King paid 20 <hi>s. per C.</hi> and was sold for 4 <hi>s. per C.</hi> and there went away as good Bread with it for want of being cull'd, as the King gave 20 <hi>s. per C.</hi> for at that time; and I did propose a Method to the Commissioners to prevent such Evils (as had long rain'd) for the future; provided they would empower me so to do, and that I was inform'd by <hi>R. S.</hi> that some part was sold to the Transport-Office for 12 <hi>s. per C.</hi> and some to <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> for 45 <hi>s. per C.</hi> by <hi>R. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 97, he receiv'd a Warrant under the Seal of the Office requiring and impowering him to supervise all the Bakers in Contract with the Office, and to inspect what Stuff they made their Biskket of, and if not according to Contract to report the same in order to their Abatement and Punishment.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 97, the Commissioners being in a great Strait for want of Bread, the Bakers understanding it, they would have impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them as to Price and Payment. I acquainted Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> how they might raise more Bread in the Office, and my House, by setting the Ovens to work Night-work, which he acquainted the Commissioners with; upon which I was sent for to the Board, and was order'd to do as I proposed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced by Mr. <hi>Green</hi> into the Bake-house) which I so well perform'd, that they baked there, and at my House, a sufficient Quantity of Bread from the King's Stuff.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That <hi>Kelly</hi> Pursuant to the Warrant to him directed, did inspect the Bakers in Contract, and through many Difficulties did discover such notorious Abuses in their mixing undue Grains with Wheat, that the Commissioners amerced 10 of them in proportion to their Offences.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That <hi>Kelly</hi> acquainted the Commissioners, that he had consider'd of such Methods that would save the King Thousands, and to have always good and wholsom Bread; and in order thereto did propose that His Majesty should purchase Mills and grind all their own Wheat that they made into Bisket; by which all Frauds and Abuses to His Majesty's Subjects, and Losses by bad Bread, which had for many Years been practiced would utterly cease; and accordingly <hi>Kelly</hi> did further propose the purchasing Mr. <hi>Mayhew's</hi> Mills at <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> which upon survey of <hi>Kelly,</hi> he found it accommodated with four pair of Stones, and all other Conveniences ready fixed with large Grainerys, and a Killn for drying of Wheat, in order to dress their Flower, which will make it keep three times longer at Sea than without drying.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37660:6"/>
VIII. That the King with those Mills might grind 180 Quarters of Wheat, a Week, which is as much as would supply the Victualling-Office and the said <hi>Kelly's</hi> House, and be a sufficient Supply, and likewise prevent all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that have hitherto attended the buying of Bisket, and that none is used in the Bisket they buy for the Navy.</p>
            <p>Here follows a Copy of the Letter sent to the Commissioners, upon which they granted me their Warrant.</p>

I am the Butt into which the Arrows of their Malice are Shot. I have laboured to open your Eyes, but you seem as tho you had no Eyes; I assure you, you have not the same Goods you buy, so that the Government pays for that it has not, and the Subjects abused by it, who will reflect on you.

I am sure there is 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Quarter difference in some sort of Goods that come to me; and you buy Bread to be made of good Wheat, whereas 'tis made of Barly, Rye and Pease, and coarse Midlings, which makes Bread four Shillings in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred worse than you buy it for.

I do not know how to proceed any further, till you have seen what has been made thus far. I doubt not but your Honours will see a necessity for an Alteration, or else you cannot be safe in what you buy to send abroad, if it be Water-born any considerable time it will not hold, and that's the reason you have so much return'd Bread, because the nature of the Stuff will not hold, it being made of Rye, Barley, Pease, coarse Midlings and some Wheat, more or less, in the most of the Bread I have seen you have.

I am sorry to see you so far abused as you have been and are; do hope you'll strengthen my Hands, who can by Power from you not only prevent these for the future, but may do that which was never perform'd, nor I believe can be exceeded hereafter, in that which I profess to undertake.

If your Honours would amerce the present Wheats, which ye are sensible vary so much from what you bought them for, with submission it seems equally just to amerce Wheat as Bisket, and perhaps may be the best way to deter from such prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises hereafter.

                  <p>I Have made several Essays in my way to serve the Government, and for the most part I have been unhappily understood and bauk'd; however, seeing there is one way more very providentially falls out, and perhaps 'tis the greatest from me of any. I know a Person that has Mills, with large Grainaries, four pair of Stones, with all moveable Conveniencies, which he'll let the King have for two hundred and fifty Pounds, the standing Rent is 135 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and there is as much to be let as will yield 50 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> so that the standing Rent will be 85 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> These Mills <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 180 Quarter <hi>per</hi> Week, if fully employed, which is as much as the Office and my House can bake in that time. The Toles thereof is 115 Bushel, which at 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Bushel, is 28 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s. per</hi> Week, and at 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Bushel, as it is now currant is 46 <hi>l. per</hi> Week. These Mills at the utmost cannot stand the King in more than 500 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> 'tis certain this will be of great advantage to the King, if you do but compute it according to what Wheat has been, and must be spent in the Office and my House, besides the innumerable Evils and chargeable Practices; this very thing will prevent too many here to be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated.

                  <p n="2">II. Another great Evil was your sending your Wheat to so many Mills at such distances, and has been proved upon some of the Millers to have gone there good, but have come home bad, besides the power of Sacks you have lost every Year; these have been reigning Evils along time: when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan I doe not know, but hope you will put an end to them now, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a better way for the Publick Good, and your Honours.

                  <p>I Beg leave to reply to your Honours Report, whereby I intend to set things in a clearer Light before you. The Title of Master-Baker I'll drop, but desire to be your humble Remembrancer, that Mr. <hi>Green</hi> by your verbal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, introduced me into the Office of inspecting your own Bakers, who ever since have constantly observed my Directions, and in particular my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them Night-work, whereby more Bisket than ordinary being raised, it occasioned the Town-Bakers who were then caballing to advance their Price, to lower it (as Capt. <hi>Bolt</hi> then own'd to me.) I sometime after put things into such a method, you might always be ascertained of the actual Produce of Bisket from Meal, whereby you might discover the Quality of the Stuff (which before had a Cloud cast over it.) I discovered likewise the excessive charge you were at in repair of your Ovens, and would have demonstrated, by what might have been done for the future, the shameful Management for the past.</p>
                  <p>I add, I would have ordered the dressing your Bran to a considerabler Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than at present: I offered it, but it was neglected, as was likewise the dressing your own Flower. I do not see how a Master-Baker becomes so unallowed a Title, when a Master-Cooper is so granted a one; in baking there seems to be more of Mistery, and so one to guide and govern it seems to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37660:8"/>
be as necessary: and Names are only for Distinction. I once oppposed Capt. <hi>Bolt's</hi> Judgment, recommending such Stuff to be baked into Bisket, to be sent with Capt. <hi>Warren</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> as I am certain would have fail'd, and preferr'd other which lasted the Voyage out and Home, as I received ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from Mr. <hi>Edward Wilks</hi> Clerk to Capt. <hi>Warren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to your signifying your not contracting with me wholly to serve the King, I with due submission rejoin, the very nature of the thing implies it; otherwise I might have been under continual Suspicion (blow up by those whose Interest it interfer'd with) of changing the King's Goods for worse of my own, having no Eye of yours over me, I suppose because you knew me only employ'd for the King, therefore there was none. I add, my former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers puts this out of doubt, relating such Circumstances about it I shall neve forget.</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I was above a Year in baking for you, before I prov'd upon <hi>Dodson</hi> his Connivance at the Bakers, for which he was a second time discharg'd; soon after you gave me a Warrant to the purpose you express it. Mr. <hi>Agur</hi> gave it as his Sense at the Board, and none of you contradicted it, that half of the Amercement should be my Encouragement. I am ready to give Oath I made Complaint against them with all imaginable Candor, to avoid the Clamour I expected upon it. The receiving of the Bisket mulcted by them was by the Appointment of the Board, notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Maine's</hi> asserting differently. Mr. <hi>Agur</hi> had the several Samples at delivery handed to him, by Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> who is ready to attest it. I could never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined your Honours could have thought all the fore-mentioned Services to be done, only for the good done by them, or that it could be expensless, or that I would create Legions of Enemies only for the pleasure of engaging them.</p>
                  <p>I add, I had a Salary for executing my former Warrant, though I baked my own Stuff, and might have gain'd sufficiently, as all did except my self, for the Reasons before-given.</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I come now to the concluding Paragraph about my Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.

                  <p>As to your representing me as unqualify'd, from undue Baking whilst in Contract, it should seem more an Objection against using me formerly, than at present; and what gave satisfaction then, will, I trust, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it now.

The 400 Bags of Bisket disposed of by me, was such a fault, nothing less than Necessity can Apologize for: But your Honours have been misinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about paying my Debts with the Sale of them. I have their Note to shew it otherwise: As it is not out of your Power, or unreasonable to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it, seeing it has been made good; so let it not be against your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but let my Services, with the State of a poor Family in the depth of Misery, move your Compassion; and may I upon a Second Commission of that kind, fall under the severest Justice, as now I hope to become an Object of your Mercy.

               <p>I add, I assume the Boldness to assert, I have abundantly Refuted your charging me, when in Contract, with delivering as bad Bread as others; I wish both that and what I have returned to it, had never seen the Sun. The Services about the Mills alone in the full extent of their usefulness, are of that consequence, the consideration of them might have prevail'd with you to have buried the 400 Lent Bags in Everlasting Oblivion: I must be free with you, Gentlemen, you had no other way of intercepting the Lords of the Admiralty's Bounty to me, and preventing their Settling me (upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning them) according as I requested them, but with blackening me with that unhappy Fact.</p>
               <p>I am sorry for you, that your Prejudices should not rest here, and tho' I have declined the Matter of my Petition, and only Crave to live by Serving the Government, and that only because I can live no otherwise, having disoblig'd almost all others, by my Serving the Government in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to them. I must be deny'd this, though I give in Security; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will satisfie, but to abandon me to all that is Miserable, as if I had been one of the Vilest of Criminals. The Touch about Bisket supply'd, being not so good, I can only say to it, Captain <hi>Ayles</hi> might have refused it, I could have compelled them to send in better, as I might sooner, had I known your Scarcity, the Notes running to answer it on Demand.</p>
               <p>I cannot take my leave of the last Article, (that gives such a wound to my Reputation, I and all mine are threatened to bleed to Death by it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making two Observations upon it.</p>
               <p>First, As to what you term the Prayer of my Petition, my Answer to the first Article, and the Amercement; I think, clears it up to a Demonstration, that my Conduct has been unexceptionable in both Parts; and that is more than I shall grant that of my Adversaries to have been.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither can that far fetch'd Argument against me, nor your nearer ones (all so weakened (as I humbly conceive) by my Reply to them) I verily think, conclude against me even in that, unless my Faults, different from all Mankind, admit of no Extenuations; and what would be a Vertue in others, is demerit in me. Much less for ever to shut me out of Employ under the King, when I have given in Security.</p>

                  <p>I Have delivered the Account of the two last Parcels which have been in hand since the 2d. of <hi>July,</hi> the neat produce of the former, was 600 Bags of Bisket at 13 <hi>s. per</hi> Bag, and the other 449 Bags at 12 <hi>s. per</hi> Bag, I could have baked twice as much in the time or more; and considering how cheap I work, and the great Charge I am at, it's hard with me, for want of Money for what I have done, as well as for want of what I could have done; so that set my Working time and my Playing time together, I have got nothing by Serving you this Year, for I have Three Ovens which draw 200 and a half <hi>per</hi> Shute, which comes but to 5 <hi>s.</hi> and the Wood and Wages of that is 4 <hi>s.</hi> 7 <hi>d.</hi> whence it appears my Profit is very small, to pay House-Rent and Taxes, and maintain my great Family, for whom I have no other way to get Bread; having, as you know, thrown off all my other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns (as you oblig'd me) to serve the Government, which has Created me many Enemies, who labour industriously to overthrow all my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which is to me a great Trouble, and especially from those who should have been one with me: They are the great Tools made use of by my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (within) though, I thank God, they cannot charge me with the least unfaithfulness to my Trust, and all the former I could much better bear, had I but the Countenance and Encouragement from your Honours, as my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness and Fidelity might obtain, were not your Honours possess'd with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sentiments, all which, I hope, Time will change into favonrable ones concerning</p>

                  <p>I Am constrained to give you the trouble of these, because your Delays to pay me my Wages for my last Years Work, lays me under such Necessities, that I can no longer stand under the same, unless you pay me. What I have done, is cheaper than any other Man could do it, or than it is done in the Office by 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> from <hi>November</hi> 1695, to <hi>November</hi> 1696; and if you please to compute it, you will find it so, or pretty near it. One thing more I can prove, that if you would have let me Bake what I would have Baked from <hi>June</hi> to <hi>November</hi> last, I had saved the King 35 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of what you give now; which is 926 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> on the 2647 Bags of Bread which I could have Baked more than I had. The Meal, &amp;c. to have made it of, I could have had of such as would have Credited the Office at that time, which are as followeth; Mr. <hi>Francis Hollaway,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Hubart,</hi> Mr. <hi>Megar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Davis,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Norwood,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mary Tillard,</hi> &amp;c.

Gentlemen, I hope you will not take my Addressing you amiss, for is there not a Cause? I find you slight me, and all I do for you, as if I were not faithful to you, when no Man could have done more to Serve you than I have; I have obeyed your Orders punctually, have given you an Account justly, have been diligent in finding out all Irregular Practices that were prejudicial to the Subject, or reflect dishonour on you: I have spent both my Time and Money to serve you, and had I had the Incouragement I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from you, things might have been so managed, that none of your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors should be able to find fault in these Species: I humbly remain,</p>

IT was not my first Intention to print the Transcript out of the Books, and the Three Letters that accompany it, which I am sensible in the order of Things should be in another more proper place: But this being an After-Thought, I must acquaint you they have a double Face, looking backward and forward, and are so serviceable to my main Design, I cannot without Injury to my self omit them.</p>
            <p>First, The Transcript proves what I assert in my foregoing Reply to the the Commissioners, that I was employ'd by them in baking, long before they gave me the Warrant they specify the Date of, <hi>viz. May</hi> 97. I leave it to all who are impartial, whether love of Trouble and fierce Opposition only, could be a reasonable Motive to pay further Services to the Government, without respect to the Rewards of it; I am sure I cannot pretend to so elevated a Vertue, and never thought any would have fastened it upon me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They show from the ample Produce the goodness of the Stuff then used; which failing afterwards, the then Accomptant Mr. <hi>Lillburne,</hi> since deceased that examined it, finding the same Deficiency in the King's own Bake-house. It a wakened to the Consideration of the Abuses at the Mills, as the true Causes of it, which made way for the purchasing of them, and like a Torrent bore down all Arguments against them, and will be a standing Demonstration the Victualling-Office can never be without them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, They with a Glance of the Eye discover the frequent compleatings of Parcels, and the natural Consequences to me seems my Payment ought to have kept pace with them; and that they did not, I feelingly express in my Letters, where I likewise manifest I might and ought to have had constanter Work, for the Publick Advantage and my own, which evinces what the last Page will present you with about my Losses: All Men will easily be satisfied the Prepossession against me was long before the 400 Bags, and guess at the Quiver whence so many Arrows have been shot at me; though I am certain the Government has been wounded through my Sides.</p>

            <p>I With profound Respects to your Honours, and equal Sincerity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd my self in words you ordered Minuting, and ever since with a Patience only Heaven could inspire me with, have been Echoing to them. Were your generous Natures sensible of half my Sufferings, they long e're this had period put unto them. I'm pleas'd with nothing more, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal now before you; wherein no Man's Interest is interfer'd with; the King's secur'd, and I not nam'd. This carries such Demonstration with it, I presume to believe, were proper for their Lordships of the Admiralty's Cognizance, that they would approve it, as I humbly suppose your Great Judgments do. And yet at the same time, out of the Abyss of Misery I court your Affection, to a speedy embracing it. My Case look'd on as Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and reported such as to your Office, reach'd the Ears of some who about a Week since, engaged me on <hi>Saturday</hi> next to meet them, in order to the transmitting it to the Parliament. I wish and heartily entreat your</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37660:11"/>
Honours to prevent that Assignation. By such Benificence you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse the Clouds have so long hung ore a distressed Family, give Light and Life unto them, and your selves taste surely the Satisfaction the Divnity it self is bless'd in, <hi>viz.</hi> that of being and doing good.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First, The Words minuted were,</hi> That my Design was to serve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in doing what might be to their Honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>By no Mans Interest interfered with;</hi> I had an Eye to the Small-Coal and Bran, that they should be disposed of by the usual Hands, I design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only their frequent payment of that Money to me for my present supply: and my Modesty was such (the Lords having writ concerning not employing me as Master-Baker and Supervisor) I proposed the Contract might run in another Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, My Invitotion to Parliament was Fact; supposing it such, could it have been expressed softer? Upon this Letter Mr. <hi>Barrington</hi> and Capt. <hi>Ayles</hi> told one, who immediately imparted it to me, they thought they should comply with me, Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> being for it: without this Intimation I had gone up according to the appointment.</p>

               <head>The PROPOSALS of <hi>JOHN KELLY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE third of <hi>April</hi> last, I laid before the Commissioners the advantage 'twould be to the King, in employing my House in baking the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of what their Mills could grind, over and above what they could bake at their Office.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That 'tis more consistent with the Interest of the Government, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my House with your Office, because your Office cannot bake all the Bread you have occasion for, as appears by your buying Bread.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Your Office cannot bake all the Wheat your Mills can grind; therefore the Mills do not answer the Ends for which they were taken for.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Mills will grind as much Wheat as your Office and my House can bake in a Week, and therein they fully answer the End for which they were taken for.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Tolls of the overplus of what the Mills can grind over and above what the Office can bake, will come to Ten Pounds a Week, which will pay the Rents of the Mills, and the Servants Wages belonging thereto.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That I will make Bread of all Wheat, as cheap to the King (all things considered, and far better for the Subject that eats it) than that which you buy of the Bakers and Mealmen, made of Barley, Rye, and Midlings of Bran ground over again, which is improper for the Navy's use, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your Instructions.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Employing of my House has been of great Advantage to the Government, it being a Check to them that sold Bread to the Office, who would have made greater Advantage to themselves, had it not been for me; and likewise that I gave them to understand the true Produce of the Stuff I received, made out; and what the Bread laid the King in, clear of all Charge.</p>
               <p>Upon these Articles I founded these Proposals.</p>
               <p>First, To give Security to Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to bake the Stuff for Eight Shillings the Quarter. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37660:12"/>
Thirdly, To be paid Quarterly, and that the Money that ariseth from the Bran and Small-Coal Weekly, be paid to me, from the Hands of them that receive it, and to be discounted out of the Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the 4th the Commissioners sent for me, in pursuance to my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, upon which we entred into Contract: The Commissioners present at the Contract, was,</p>

Without it I had been remanded to a Goal, and 7 Children, and a Wife big with another, had all perish'd. I am stab'd to the Heart to find fresh Differences to arise among your Honours about me. By all that is gentle in human Nature, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the most charitable Religion in the World, be won over to Mr. <hi>Papillon's</hi> Sense of that Expression of the Lords of the Admiralty concerning me, should it be a mistaken one, all that shall hear of my deplorable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, would applaud and justify you in it. And give me leave, Sir, to hope your Goodness may carry you so far, as to influence even Mr. <hi>Mayne</hi> to the same Nobleness of Spirit with your self: This would be Heroick. May he that has the Hearts even of Kings in his hands, affect both yours with a Case, one of the most compassionable the heart of man was ever address'd to withal.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> AM Ruin'd by your Service, and have the Demonstration of it in several Articles, 'tis fit the World should know it. A truly Virtuous Man were he to make his choice would rather be as I, one of the most distressed Men living, than one of my Oppressors in all his Flourish. The Justice of the Nation shall hear my Cry; and I cannot entertain so reflecting a Thought on it, as to question its relieving me. I am at an end of all my Humble Melting Addresses to you; I will be trampled on no more for casting my self at your Feet, by some of you, nor once again pierce the tenderer Heart of one of you, by the sight of it. I now take my Farewel of you, by giving you to understand your Old Conjurers have rais'd a New Mist to continue you in Darkness. I'm sorry I must say your constant encouraging them (and to use a Silken Expression for what deserves a rougher one) your different treating me emboldens them. Your Warrant to me, and my last Proposals to you, agreeable to your own Instructions from Above, are to prevent the Sailors being abus'd by mixt Grains: To evade this, Artists are started up (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond me, for I have try'd in vain) who have succeeded in an Experiment of grinding over Bran, mixing it with other Stuff and Baking it: You may fancy this Biscake hearty as you please, blow up your Mills, beat down your Ovens, and lay me aside altogether in Complement to the Cheapness of it. This is the happy Project some Mens Wits have hit upon, to gratify their Interest and Malice in my Destruction. I have had my Brains near dash'd out for once writing you had no Eyes, but all Men will say they are strange Ones, that shall hear of their magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Mole-hills into Mountains in me, and dwindling Mountains into Nothing in my Enemies. They of you who are against employing me, from the Admiralty's Command about me, I must say I think are egregiously mistaken. I request only their Review of my modest Reply, to that Report which occasioned it; and then I dare leave it to the Judgment they will be of about it in their Dying Hours, when they may be perplext with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my Usage, on their going to a Place where all that is past will appear in a better Light to Angels and Men than ever it has yet done: Then I should not have been, as I am, one of the greatest Objects of Compassion that ever was by them unpittied,</p>

            <p>When I sent this in Writing with a Postscript, I mentioned my design of printing it, with many other Papers; this I did hoping they would excuse me so ungrateful a Trouble.</p>

I shall according to my last farewel Letter to the Commissioners, give my demonstrations of my ruin by these several Articles.</p>

            <p>I'll wind up all with this one Offer more. I am ready to make out before proper Judges, to save the Government in baking in their own Office, and my House, and in their dry Provisions, in proportion to 1000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for the future.
