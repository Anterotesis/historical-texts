         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Noble Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It hath always been my hearty Prayer to God, since I
have been your Wife, That first I might prove an honest
and good Wife, whereof your Grace must be the onely Iudg:
Next, That God would be pleased to enable me to set
forth and declare to after-ages, the truth of your loyal actions
and endeavours, for the service of your King and Country;
For the accomplishing of which design, I have followed the
best and truest Observations of your Secretary <hi>John Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leston,</hi>
and your Lordships own Relations, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
writ the History of your Lordships Life, which
although I have endeavoured to render as perspicuous as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I could, yet one thing I find hath much darkned it;
<pb facs="tcp:47770:4"/>
which is, that your Grace commanded me not to mention
any thing or passage to the prejudice or disgrace of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or particular person (although they might be of great
truth, and would illustrate much the actions of your Life)
which I have dutifully performed to satisfie your Lordship,
whose Nature is so Generous, that you are as well pleased to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
the faults of your Enemies, as you are to divulge the
vertues of your Friends; And certainly, My Lord, you have
had as many Enemies, and as many Friends, as ever any one
particular person had; and I pray God to forgive the one,
and prosper the other: Nor do I so much wonder at it, since
I, a Woman, cannot be exempt from the malice and asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of spightful tongues, which they cast upon my poor
Writings, some denying me to be the true Authoress of
them; for your Grace remembers well, that those Books
I put out first, to the judgment of this censorious Age, were
accounted not to be written by a Woman, but that some body
else had writ and publish'd them in my Name; by which
your Lordship was moved to prefix an Epistle before one of
them in my vindication, wherein you assure the world upon
your honour, That what was written and printed in my
name, was my own; and I have also made known, that your
Lordship was my onely Tutor, in declaring to me what you
had found and observed by your own experience; for I being
young when your Lordship married me, could not have much
knowledg of the world; But it pleased God to command his
Servant Nature to indue me with a Poetical and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Genius, even from my Birth; for I did write some
<pb facs="tcp:47770:4"/>
Books in that kind, before I was twelve years of Age, which
for want of good method and order, I would never divulge.
But though the world would not believe that those Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Fancies which I writ, were my own, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
my capacity, yet they found fault, that they were
defective for want of Learning; and on the other side, they
said I had pluckt Feathers out of the Universities; which
was a very preposterous judgment. Truly My Lord, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that for want of Scholarship, I could not express my
self so well as otherwise I might have done, in those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Writings I publish'd first; but after I was returned
with your Lordship into my Native Country, and led a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Country life, I applied my self to the reading of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Authors, of purpose to learn those names and
words of Art that are used in Schools; which at first were so
hard to me, that I could not understand them, but was
fain to guess at the sense of them by the whole context, and
so writ them down as I found them in those Authors, at
which my Readers did wonder, and thought it impossible
that a Woman could have so much Learning and Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in Terms of Art, and Scholastical Expressions;
so that I and my Books are like the old Apologue mention'd
in AEsop, of a Father, and his Son, who rid on an Ass
through a Town when his Father went on Foot, at which
sight the People shouted and cried shame, that a young Boy
should ride, and let his Father, an old man, go on Foot:
whereupon the old Man got upon the Ass, and let his Son
go by; but when they came to the next Town, the People
<pb facs="tcp:47770:5"/>
exclaimed against the Father, that he a lusty man should
ride, and have no more pity of his young and tender child,
but let him go on foot: Then both the Father and his Son
got upon the Ass, and coming to the third Town, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
blamed them both for being so unconscionable as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
the poor Ass with their heavy weight: After this
both Father and Son went on foot, and led the Ass; and
when they came to the fourth Town, the People railed as
much at them as ever the former had done, and called them
both Fools, for going on foot, when they had a Beast able to
carry them. The old Man, seeing he could not please Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in any manner, and having received so many blemishes
and aspersions, for the sake of his Ass, was at last resolved to
drown him when he came to the next bridg. But I am
not so passionate to burn by Writings for the various hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of Mankind, and for their finding fault, since
there is nothing in this world, be it the noblest and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
action whatsoever, that shall escape blameless. As
for my being the true and onely Authoress of them, your
Lordship knows best, and my attending Servants are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that I have had none but my own Thoughts, Fancies
and Speculations to assist me; and as soon as I have set them
down, I send them to those that are to transcribe them, and
fit them for the Press; whereof since there have been several,
and amongst them such as onely could write a good hand, but
neither understood Orthography, nor had any Learning (I
being then in banishment with your Lordship, and not able
to maintain learned Secretaries) which hath been a great
<pb facs="tcp:47770:5"/>
disadvantage to my poor works, and the cause that they have
been printed so false, and so full of Errors; for besides that,
I want also the skill of Scholarship and true writing, I did
many times not peruse the Copies that were transcribed, lest
they should disturb my following Conceptions; by which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
as I said, many Errors are slipt into my Works, which
yet I hope Learned and Impartial Readers will soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
and look more upon the sense, then carp at words. I
have been a Student even from my Childhood; and since I
have been your Lordships Wife, I have lived for the most part
a strict and retired Life, as is best known to your Lordship,
and therefore my Censurers cannot know much of me, since
they have little or no acquaintance with me: 'Tis true, I
have been a Traveller both before and after I was married
to your Lordship, and sometimes shew my self at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Command in Publick places or Assemblies; but yet I
converse with few. Indeed, My Lord, I matter not the
Censures of this Age, but am rather proud of them; for it
shews that my Actions are more then ordinary, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the old Proverb, <hi>It is better to be Envied, then
Pitied:</hi> for I know well, that it is meerly out of spight and
malice, whereof this present Age is so full, that none can
escape them, and they'l make no doubt to stain even Your
Lordships Loyal, Noble and Heroick Actions, as well as
they do mine, though yours have been of War and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
mine of Contemplating and Writing: Yours were
performed publickly in the Field, mine privately in my

hitherto bless'd both Your Grace and me, will, I question
not, preserve both our Fames to after Ages, for which we
shall be bound most humbly to acknowledg his great Mercy;

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>VVHen I first Intended to write this History,
knowing my self to be no Scholar, and as
ignorant of the Rules of writing Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as I have in my other Works acknowledg'd my
self to be of the Names and Terms of Art; I desired
my Lord, That he would be pleased to let me have
some Elegant and Learned Historian to assist me; which
request his Grace would not grant me; saying, That
having never had any Assistance in the writing of
my former Books, I should have no other in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his life, but the Informations from himself,
and his Secretary, of the chief Transactions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
occurring in it, to the time he married me. I
humbly answer'd, That without a learned Assistant,
the History would be defective: But he replied, That
Truth could not be defective. I said again, That
<pb facs="tcp:47770:7"/>
Rhetorick did adorn Truth: And he answer'd, That
Rhetorick was fitter for Falshoods then Truths. Thus
I was forced by his Graces Commands, to write this
History in my own plain Style, without elegant Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishings,
or exquisit Method, relying intirely upon
Truth, in the expressing whereof, I have been very
circumspect; as knowing well, that his Graces Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have so much Glory of their own, that they need
borrow none from any bodies Industry.</p>
            <p>Many Learned Men, I know, have published
Rules and Directions concerning the Method and
Style of Histories, and do with great noise, to little
purpose, make loud exclamations against those Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
that keeping close to the Truth of their Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cannot think it necessary to follow flavishly such
Instructions; and there is some Men of good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
as I have heard, that applaud very much
several Histories, meerly for their Elegant Style, and
well-observ'd Method; setting a high value upon feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Orations, mystical Designs, and fancied Policies,
which are, at the best, but pleasant Romances. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
approve, in the Relations of Wars, and of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Actions, such tedious Descriptions, that the
Reader, tired with them, will imagine that there was
more time spent in Assaulting, Defending, and taking
of a Fort, or a petty Garison, then <hi>Alexander</hi> did
employ in conquering the greatest part of the World:
which proves, That such Historians regard more their
<pb facs="tcp:47770:7"/>
own Eloquence, Wit and Industry, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
they believe to have of the Actions of War, and
of all manner of Governments, than of the truth of
the History, which is the main thing, and wherein
consists the hardest task, very few Historians knowing
the Transactions they write of, and much less the
Counsels, and secret Designs of many different Parties,
which they confidently mention.</p>
            <p>Although there be many sorts of Histories, yet
these three are the chiefest: 1. a General History.
2. A National History. 3. A Particular History.
Which three sorts may, not unfitly, be compared to
the three sorts of Governments, Democracy, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
and Monarchy. The first is the History of
the known parts and people of the World; The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is the History of a particular Nation, Kingdom
or Commonwealth. The third is the History of the
life and actions of some particular Person. The first
is profitable for Travellers, Navigators and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
the second is pernicious, by reason it teaches
subtil Policies, begets Factions, not onely between
particular Families and Persons, but also between
whole Nations, and great Princes, rubbing old sores,
and renewing old Quarrels, that would otherwise have
been forgotten. The last is the most secure; because it
goes not out of its own Circle, but turns on its own
Axis, and for the most part, keeps within the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Truth. The first is Mechanical, the second
<pb facs="tcp:47770:8"/>
Political, and the third Heroical. The first should
onely be written by Travellers, and Navigators;
The second by Statesmen; The third by the Prime
Actors, or the Spectators of those Affairs and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of which they write, as <hi>Caesars</hi> Commentaries are,
which no Pen but of such an Author, who was also A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
in the particular Occurrences, private Intrigues,
secret Counsels, close Designs, and rare Exploits of War
he relates, could ever have brought to so high Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This History is of the Third sort, as that is; and
being of the Life and Actions of my Noble Lord and
Husband, who hath informed me of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
passages I have recorded, I cannot, though neither
Actor, nor Spectator, be thought ignorant of the
Truth of what I write; Nor is it inconsistent with my
being a Woman, to write of Wars, that was neither
between <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
and <hi>Turks;</hi> but among my own Countreymen,
whose Customs and Inclinations, and most of the
Persons that held any considerable Place in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
was well known to me; and besides all that (which
is above all) my Noble and Loyal Lord did act a
chief Part in that fatal Tragedy, to have defended (if
humane power could have done it) his most Gracious
Soveraign, from the fury of his Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47770:8"/>This History being (as I have said) of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Person, his Actions, and Fortunes; it cannot
be expected, that I should here Preach of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the World; nor seem to express understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Politicks, by tedious moral Discourses, with
long Observations upon the several sorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that have been in <hi>Greece</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon others
more modern; I will neither endeavour to make
show of Eloquence, making Speeches that never was
spoken, nor pretend to great skill in War, by making
Mountains of Mole-hills, and telling Romansical Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods
for Historical Truths; and much less will I
write to amuse my Readers, in a mystical and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Style, of the disloyal Actions of the opposite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of the Treacherous Cowardise, Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of some Persons, my Lords Enemies, and of the
ingratitude of some of his seeming Friends; wherein I
cannot better obey his Lordships Commands to
conceal those things, then in leaving them quite out,
as I do, with submission to his Lordships desire, from
whom I have learn'd Patience to overcome my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Discretion to yield to his Prudence.</p>
            <p>Thus am I resolved to write, in a natural plain style,
without Latin Sentences, moral Instructions, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Designs, feigned Orations, or envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Exclamations, this short History of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
Heroick and Prudent Actions of my Noble Lord,
as also of his Sufferings, Losses, and ill-Fortunes,
<pb facs="tcp:47770:9"/>
which in honour and Conscience I could not suffer to
be buried in silence; nor could I have undertaken so
hard a task, had not my love to his Person, and to
Truth, been my Encourager and Supporter.</p>
            <p>I might have made this Book larger, in transcribing
(as is ordinary in Histories) the several Letters, full
of Affection, and kind promises he received from His
Gracious Soveraign, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and from his
Royal Consort, in the time he was in the Actions of
War, as also since the War, from his dear Soveraign
and Master, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; But many of the
former Letters having been lost, when all was lost; I
thought it best, seeing I had not them all, to print
none. As for Orations, which is another way of
swelling the bulk of Histories; it is certain, that My
Lord made not many; chusing rather to fight, then
to talk; and his Declarations having been printed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
it had been superfluous to insert them in these
Narrations.</p>
            <p>This Book would however, have been a great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
if his Grace would have given me leave to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
his Enemies Actions; But being to write of his
own onely, I do it briefly and truly; and not as many
have done, who have written of the late Civil War,
with but few sprinklings of Truth, like as Heat-drops
upon a dry barren Ground; knowing no more of the
Transactions of those Times, then what they learned
in the Gazets, which, for the most part, (out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb facs="tcp:47770:9"/>
to amuse and deceive the People) contain nothing
but Falshoods and Chimeraes; and were such Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
that after the Kings Party was over-powred,
the Government among the Rebels changing from
one Faction to another, they never miss'd to exalt
highly the Merits of the chief Commanders of the then
prevailing side, comparing some of them to <hi>Moses,</hi>
and some others to all the great and most famous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
both Greeks and Romans; wherein, unawares,
they exceedingly commended my Noble Lord; for
if those Ring-leaders of Factions were so great men as
they are reported to be, by those Time-servers, How
much greater must his Lordship be, who beat most of
them, except the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose employment
was never in the Northern parts, where all the rest of
the greatest strength of the Parliament was sent, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my Lord's Forces, which was the greatest the
Kings Party had any where.</p>
            <p>Good Fortune is such an Idol of the World, and
is so like the golden Calf worshipped by the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,
that those Arch-Rebels never wanted Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
to foretel them good success in all their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
nor Poets to sing their Praises, nor Orators for
Panegyricks; nay, which is worse, nor Historians
neither, to record their Valour in fighting, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Governing. But being, so much as I am, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
base Profit, or any Preferment whatsoever, I
cannot fear to be suspected of Flattery, in declaring
<pb facs="tcp:47770:10"/>
to the World the Merits, Wealth, Power, Loyalty,
and Fortunes of My Noble Lord, who hath done
great Actions, suffered great Losses, endured a long
Banishment, for his Loyalty to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and leads now, like another <hi>Scipio,</hi> a quiet
Countrey-life. If notwithstanding all this, any should
say, That those who write Histories of themselves,
and their own actions, or of their own Party, or instruct
and inform those that write them, are partial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
I answer, That it is very improbable, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Persons, who having done Great, Noble and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Exploits, deserving to be recorded, should be
so vain, as to write false Histories; but if they do, it
proves but their Folly; for Truth can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and so it will be more for their disgrace, then for
their Honour or Fame. I fear not any such blemishes
in this present History, for I am conscious of any such
Crime as Patiality or Falshood, but write it whilest
My Noble Lord is yet alive, and at such a time where
Truth may be declared, and Falshood contradicted;
and I challenge any one (although I be a Woman)
to contradict any thing that I have set down, or prove
it to be otherwise then Truth; for be there never
so many Contradictions, Truth will conquer all at last.</p>
            <p>Concerning My Lords Actions in War, which
are comprehended in the first Book, the relation of them
I have chiefly from my Lords Secretary Mr. <hi>Rolleston,</hi>
a Person that has been an Eye-witness thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:47770:10"/>
accompanied My Lord as Secretary in his Army, and
gave out all his Commissions; his honesty and worth
is unquestionable by all that know him. And as for
the Second Book, which contains My Lords Actions
and Sufferings, during the time of his Exile, I have
set down so much as I could possibly call to mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any particular Expression of time, onely from
the time of his Banishment, or rather (what I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
from the time of my Marriage, till our return
into <hi>England.</hi> To the end of which I have joined a
Computation of My Lord's Losses, which he hath
suffered by those unfortunate Warres. In the third
Book I have set down some particular Chapters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Description of his Person, his Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and Personal Vertues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the last,
some Essayes and Discourses of My Lords, together
with some Notes and Remarques of mine own; which
I thought most convenient to place by themselves at the
end of this Work, rather then to intermingle them with
the Body of the History.</p>
            <p>It might be some prejudice to my Lord's Glory,
and the credit of this History, not to take notice of a
very considerable thing I have heard, which is, That
when his Lordship's Army had got so much Strength
and Reputation, that the Rebellious Parliament find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves overpower'd with it, rather then to
be utterly ruin'd, (as was unavoidable) did call the
<hi>Scots</hi> to their Assistance, with a promise to reward so
<pb facs="tcp:47770:11"/>
great a Service, with the Four Northern Counties of
<hi>Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmerland,</hi> and the
Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> which I have not mention'd
in the Book.</p>
            <p>And it is most certain, That the Parliaments For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were never Powerful, nor their Commanders or
Officers Famous, until such time as my Lord was
overpower'd; neither could Loyalty have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by Rebellion, had not Treachery had better
Fortune then Prudence.</p>
            <p>When I speak of my Lord's Pedigree, where <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Grandfather to the now Duke of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> is mention'd, they have left out <hi>William</hi>
Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> one of his Sons, who did marry the
Heir of the last Baron <hi>Stafford,</hi> descended from the
Dukes of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> which was set down in my Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Manuscript.</p>
            <p>Some of those Omissions, and very probably others,
are happened, partly for want of timely Information,
and chiefly by the death of my Secretary, who did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
my Writings for the Press, and dy'd in <hi>London,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that Service, afore the Printing of the Book
was quite finish'd. And as I hope of your Favour to
be excus'd for omitting those things in the Book; so I
expect of your Justice to be approv'd in putting them
here, though somewhat unseasonably.</p>
            <p>Before I end this Preface, I do beseech my Readers
not to mistake me when I speak of my Lord's Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:47770:11"/>
as if I would conceal that he went voluntarily
out of his Native Country; for it is most true, that his
Lordship prudently perceiving all the King's Party
lost, not onely in <hi>England,</hi> but also in <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it was impossible to withstand the
Rebels, after the fatal overthrow of his Army; his
Lordship, in a poor and mean condition quitted his
own Countrey, and went beyond Sea; soon after
which, the Rebels having got an Absolute Power, and
granted a general Pardon to all those that would come
in to them, upon composition, at the Rates they had set
down, his Lordship, with but few others, was except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it, both for Life and Estate, and did remain
thus banish'd till His Majesties happy Restauration.</p>
            <p>I must also acknowledg, That I have committed
great Errors in taking no notice of Times as I should
have done in many places of this History: I mention
in one place the Queen Mothers being in <hi>France,</hi> when
my Lord went thither, but do not say in what year
that was: Nor do I express when His Majesty (our
now Gracious Soveraign) came in, and went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
several times from that Kingdom, which has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
for want of Memory, and I desire my Readers
to excuse me for it.</p>
            <p>No body can certainly be more ready to find faults
in this Work, then I am to confess them; being very
conscious that I have, as I told my Lord I should,
committed many for want of Learning, and chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:47770:12"/>
of skill in writing Histories: But having, according
to his Lordships Commands, written his Actions and
Fortunes truly and plainly, I have reason to expect,
that whatsoever else shall be found amiss, will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
pardoned by the candid Readers, to whom
I wish all manner of happiness.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been taught, and do believe, That Obedience is
better then Sacrifice; and know, that both are due from me
to your Grace; and since I have been so long in obeying your
Commands, I shall not presume to use any Arguments for my
excuse, but rather chuse ingeniously to confess my fault, and
beg your Graces Pardon. And because forgiveness is a
Glory to the supreamest Powers, I will hope that your
Grace by that great example will make it yours. And now
<pb facs="tcp:47770:13"/>
I humbly take leave to represent to your Grace, as faithfully
and truly as my memory will serve me, all my Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the most memorable Actions, and honourable Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of His Grace, my most Noble Lord and Master,
<hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in the execution and
Performance of the Trusts and high Employments commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and commended to his care and charge by three Kings of
<hi>England;</hi> that is to say, King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the
First, of ever blessed Memory; and our Gracious King,
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second; under whom he hath had the happiness
to live, and the honour to serve them in several capacities:
And because I humbly conceive, that it is not within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of your Graces Commands, that I should give you
a particular Relation of His Graces High Birth, his Noble
and Princely Education and Breeding, both at home and
abroad; his Natural Faculties, and Personal Vertues;
his Iustice, Bounty, Charity, Friendship; his Right
Approved Courage, and True Valour, not grounded upon,
or govern'd by Passion, but Reason; his Magnificent
manner of living and supporting his Dignity, testified by his
great Entertainments of their Majesties, and his private
Friends, upon all fit occasions, besides his ordinary and
constant House-keeping and Attendants; some for Honour,
and some for business, wherein he exceeded most of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and that he was, and is an incomparable Master to
his Servants, is sufficiently testified by all or most of the
chiefest of them, living and dying in His Graces Service,
which is an Argument that they thought themselves as
<pb facs="tcp:47770:13"/>
happy therein, as the World could make them; nor of his
well-chosen Pleasures, which were principally Horses of all
sorts, but more particularly Horses of Mannage; His
Study and Art of the true use of the Sword; His Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Buidings. These are his chiefest Delights, wherein
his Grace spared for no cost nor charge, which are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifested to the World; for other Delights, as those
of running Horses, Hawking, Hunting, &amp;c. His Grace
used them meerly for societies sake, and out of a generous and
obliging Nature to please others, though his knowledg in
them excelled, as well as in the other. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these his large and vast expences, before his Grace
was called to the Court, he encreased his Revenue by way
of Purchase to a great value; and when he was called to
the Court, he was then free from Debts, and, as I have
heard, some Thousands of Pounds in his Purse. These
Particulars, and as many more of this kind as would swell
a Volume, I could enumerate to your Grace; but that they
are so well known to your Grace, it would be a Presumption
in me, rather then a Service, to give your Grace that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and therefore I humbly forbear, and proceed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of Your Graces Commands, as becomes</p>

               <head>The First Book.</head>
               <p>SInce my chief intent in this present Work,
is to describe the Life and Actions of
My Noble Lord and Husband, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,
Duke of Newcastle,</hi> I shall do it
with as much Brevity, Perspicuity and Truth, as is
required of an Impartial Historian. The History
of his Pedigree I shall refer to the Heralds, and partly
give you an account thereof at the latter end of this
work; onely thus much I shall now mention, as will
be requisite for the better understanding of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47770:15"/>His Grandfather by his Fathers side was Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Cavendish,</hi> Privy Counsellour and Treasurer
of the Chamber to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> His Grandfather by
his Mother was <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> an ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.
His Father Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi> was the
youngest son to Sir <hi>William,</hi> and had no other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
but three Sons, whereof My Lord was the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
but his elder Brother dying in his Infancy, left
both his Title and Birth-right to My Lord, so that My
Lord had then but one onely Brother left, whose
name was <hi>Charles</hi> after his Father, whereas My Lord
had the name of his Grandfather.</p>
               <p>These two Brothers were partly bred with <hi>Gilbert</hi>
Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> their Uncle in Law, and their Aunt
<hi>Mary,</hi> Countess of <hi>Shrewsbury, Gilbert</hi>'s Wife, and
Sister to their Father; for there interceded an intire
and constant Friendship between the said <hi>Gilbert,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and My Lord's Father, Sir <hi>Charles
Cavendish,</hi> caused not onely by the marriage of My
Lord's Aunt, his Fathers Sister, to the aforesaid <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and by the marriage of <hi>George</hi>
Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury, Gilbert</hi>'s Father, with My Lord's
Grandmother, by his Fathers side; but Sir <hi>Charles
Cavendish,</hi> My Lord's Father, and <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> being brought up and bred together in
one Family, and grown up as parts of one body, after
they came to be beyond Children, and travelled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47770:15"/>
into foreign Countries, to observe the Fashions,
Laws, and Customs of other Nations, contracted such
an intire Friendship which lasted to their death: neither
did they out live each other long, for My Lord's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> lived but one year after <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But both My Lords Parents, and his Aunt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in Law, shewed always a great and fond love to
My Lord, endeavouring, when He was but a Child,
to please him with what he most delighted in. When
He was grown to the Age of fifteen or sixteen, he was
made Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> an ancient and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Order, at the time when <hi>Henry,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> of
blessed Memory, His eldest Son was created Prince of
<hi>Wales:</hi> and soon after, he went to travel with Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wotton,</hi> who was sent as Ambassador Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to the then <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which Duke made very
much of My Lord, and when he would be free in
Feasting, placed Him next to himself. Before
My Lord did return with the Ambassador into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the said Duke profer'd My Lord, that if he
would stay with him, he would not onely confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the best Titles of Honour he could, but also
give him an honourable Command in War, although
My Lord was but young, for the Duke had then
some designs of War. But the Ambassador, who had
taken the care of My Lord, would not leave Him
behind without his Parents consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47770:16"/>At last, when My Lord took his leave of the Duke,
the Duke being a very generous person, presented
Him with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, a Saddle very richly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered,
and with a rich Jewel of Diamonds.</p>
               <p>Some time after My Lord's return into <hi>England,
Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> died, and left My Lord,
though he was then but young, and about Twenty
two years of age, his Executor; a year after, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> died also. His Mother,
being then a Widow, was desirous that My Lord
should marry: in obedience to whose Commands, he
chose a Wife both to his own good liking, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
approving; who was Daughter and Heir to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Basset</hi> of <hi>Blore</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> a very honourable and ancient
Family in <hi>Stafford-Shire,</hi> by whom was added a
great part to His Estate, as hereafter shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
After My Lord was married, he lived, for
the most part, in the Country, and pleased Himself
and his neighbours with Hospitality, and such delights
as the Country afforded; onely now and then he
would go up to <hi>London</hi> for some short time to wait on
the King.</p>
               <p>About this time King <hi>Iames,</hi> of blessed memory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a purpose to confer some Honour upon My
Lord, made him Viscount <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and Baron of
<hi>Bolsover;</hi> and after the decease of King <hi>Iames,</hi> King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First, of blessed Memory, constituted him
Lord Warden of the Forrest of <hi>Sherewood,</hi> and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47770:16"/>
of <hi>Nottingham-Shire,</hi> and restored his Mother
<hi>Catharine,</hi> the second Daughter of <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Lord <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
to her Fathers Dignity, after the death of her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sister <hi>Iane</hi> Countess of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that it was her Right; which Title after the
death of his Mother, descended also upon My Lord,
and his Heirs General, together with a large Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of 3000 l. a year, in <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the same time, after the decease of <hi>William,</hi>
late Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> his Noble Cousin German,
My Lord was by his said Majesty made Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Derby-Shire;</hi> which trust and honour, after
he had enjoyed for several years, and managed it,
like as all other offices put to his Trust, with all possible
care, faithfulness and dexterity, during the time of the
said Earls Son, <hi>William</hi> the now Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi>
his Minority, as soon as this same Earl was come
to age, and by Law made capable of that trust, he
willingly and freely resign'd it into his hands, he having
hitherto kept it onely for him, that he and no body
else might succeed his Father in that dignity.</p>
               <p>In these, and all other both publick and private im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
My Lord hath ever been careful to keep
up the Kings Rights to the uttermost of his power, to
strengthen those mentioned Counties with Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to administer Justice to every one; for he
refused no mans Petition, but sent all that came to him
either for relief or justice, away from him fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47770:17"/>Not long after his being made Lieutenant of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham-Shire,</hi>
there was found so great a defect of
Armes and Ammunition in that County, that the
Lords of the Council being advertised thereof, as the
manner then was, His Majesty commanded a levy to
be made upon the whole County for the supply
thereof; whereupon the sum of 500 l. or thereabout,
was accordingly levied for that purpose, and three
Persons of Quality, then Deputy Lieutenants, were
desired by My Lord to receive the money, and see it
disposed; which being done accordingly, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
account rendred to My Lord, he voluntarily
ordered the then Clerk of the Peace of that County,
That the same account should be recorded amongst
the Sessions Roles, and be published in open Sessions,
to the end that the Country might take notice, how
their monies were disposed of; for which act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
My Lord was highly commended.</p>
               <p>Within some few years after, King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First, of blessed Memory, His Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
in regard of His true and faithful service to his
King and Country, was pleased to honour him with
the Title of <hi>Earl of Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>Baron of Bothal</hi>
and <hi>Heple;</hi> which Title he graced so much by His
Noble Actions and Deportments, that some seven
years after, which was in the Year 1638. His Majesty
called him up to Court, and thought Him the fittest
Person whom He might intrust with the Government
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47770:17"/>
of His Son <hi>Charles</hi> then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now our
most Gracious King, and made him withal a Member
of the Lords of His Majesties most honourable Privy
Council; which, as it was a great Honour and Trust,
so He spared no care and industry to discharge His
Duty accordingly; and to that end, left all the care
of governing his own Family and Estate, with all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
attending His Master not without considerable
Charges, and vast Expences of his own.</p>
               <p>In this present Employment He continued for the
space of three Years, during which time there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
an Insurrection and Rebellion of His Majesties
discontented Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which forced His
Majesty to raise an Army, to reduce them to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and His Treasury being at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
he was necessitated to desire some supply and
assistance of the Noblest and Richest of his Loyal
Subjects; amongst the rest, My Lord lent His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
10000 l. and raised Himself a Voluntier-Troop
of Horse, which consisted of 120 Knights and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Quality, who marched to <hi>Berwick</hi> by His
Majesties Command, where it pleased His Majesty to
set this mark of Honour upon that Troop, that it
should be Independent, and not commanded by any
General Officer, but onely by his Majesty Himself;
The reason thereof was upon this following occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47770:18"/>His Majesties whole body of Horse, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to march into <hi>Scotland</hi> against the Rebels, a
place was appointed for their Rendezvous; Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon their meeting, My Lord sent a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Quality of his Troop<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>William Carnaby,</hi> Kt.</note> to His Majesties then
General of the Horse, to know where his Troop
should march; who returned this answer, That it was
to march next after the Troops of the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Field. My Lord conceiving that his
Troop ought to march in the Van, and not in the
Rear, sent the same Messenger back again to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
to inform him, That he had the honour to
march with the Princes Colours, and therefore he
thought it not fit to march under any of the Officers
of the Field; yet nevertheless the General ordered
that Troop as he had formerly directed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
My Lord thinking it unfit at that time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the business, immediately commanded his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of the North.</note>
to take off the Princes Colours from his staff, and
so marched in the place appointed, choosing rather to
march without his Colours flying, then to lessen his
Masters dignity by the command of any subject.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the return from that expedition
to his Majesties Leaguer, the General made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
thereof to his Majesty; who being truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the business, commended my Lords discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it, and from that time ordered that Troop to
be commanded by none but himself. Thus they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47770:18"/>
upon duty without receiving any pay or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
from His Majesty, until His Majesty had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his Rebellious Subjects, and then My Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with honour to his Charge, <hi>viz.</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prince.</p>
               <p>At last when the whole Army was disbanded,
then, and not before, my Lord thought it a fit Time to
exact an account from the said General for the affront
he pass'd upon him, and sent him a Challenge; the place
and hour being appointed by both their Consents,
where and when to meet, My Lord appear'd there
with his Second<note n="*" place="margin">Francis Palmes.</note>, but found not his Opposite: After
some while his Opposite's Second came all alone, by
whom my Lord perceiv'd that their Design had
been discover'd to the King by some of his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site's
Friends, who presently caused them both to
be confined until he had made their Peace.</p>
               <p>My Lord having hitherto attended the Prince,
his Master, with all faithfulness and duty befitting so
great an Employment, for the space of three years,
in the beginning of that Rebellious and unhappy
Parliament, which was the cause of all the ruines
and misfortunes that afterwards befell this Kingdom,
was privately advertised, that the Parliaments De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was to take the Government of the Prince from
him, which he apprehending as a disgrace to Himself,
wisely prevented, and obtained the Consent of His
late Majesty, with His Favour, to deliver up the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47770:19"/>
Charge of being Governor to the Prince, and retire
into the Countrey; which he did in the beginning
of the Year 1641, and setled himself, with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Children and Family, to his great satisfaction,
with an intent to have continued there, and rested
under his own Vine, and managed his own Estate;
but he had not enjoyed himself long, but an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
came to him from His Majesty, who was
then unjustly and unmannerly treated by the said
Parliament, to repair with all possible speed and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
to <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> where the greatest part
of His Majesties Ammunition and Arms then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in that Magazine, it being the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
place for strength in the Northern parts of the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon the receipt of these His
Majesties Orders and Commands, my Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for their execution, and about Twelve of the
Clock at night, hastned from his own house when
his Familie were all at their rest, save two or three
Servants which he appointed to attend him. The
next day early in the morning he arrived at <hi>Hull,</hi>
in the quality of a private Gentleman, which place
was distant from his house forty miles; and none of
his Family that were at home, knew what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of him, till he sent an Express to his Lady to
inform her where he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47770:19"/>Thus being admitted into the Town, he fell
upon his intended Design, and brought it to so
hopeful an issue for His Majesties Service, that he
wanted nothing but His Majesties further Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Pleasure to have secured both the Town and
Magazine for His Majesties use; and to that end by
a speedy Express<note n="*" place="margin">Capt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine</note> gave His <hi>Majesty,</hi> who was then
at <hi>Windsor,</hi> an account of all his Transactions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
together with his Opinion of them, hoping His
Majesty would have been pleased either to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Person, which He might have done with much
security, or at least have sent him a Commission
and Orders how he should do His Majesty further
Service.</p>
               <p>But instead thereof he received Orders from His
Majesty to observe such Directions as he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the Parliament then sitting: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was summoned personally to appear at the
House of Lords, and a Committee chosen to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Grounds and Reasons of his undertaking
that Design; but my Lord shewed them his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and that it was done in obedience to His
Majesties Commands, and so was cleared of that
Action.</p>
               <p>Not long after, my Lord obtained the freedom
from His Majesty to retire again to his Countrey-Life,
which he did with much alacrity: He had
not remained many months there, but His Majesty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47770:20"/>
was forced by the fury of the said Parliament, to repair
in Person to <hi>York,</hi> and to send the Queen beyond the
Seas for her safety.</p>
               <p>No sooner was His Majesty arrived at <hi>York,</hi> but
he sent his Gommands to my Lord to come thither to
him; which according to his wonted custom and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
he readily obeyed, and after a few days spent there
in Consultation, His Majesty was pleased to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> to take upon him
the Government of that Town, and the four Counties
next adjoining; that is to say, <hi>Northumberland, Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Westmerland,</hi> and the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham:</hi> which
my Lord did accordingly, although he wanted Men,
Money and Ammunition, for the performance of that
design; for when he came thither, he neither found
any Military provision considerable for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that work, nor generally any great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the people in those parts, more then what his
own interest created in them; Nevertheless, he thought
it his duty rather to hazard all, then to neglect the
Commands of His Soveraign; and resolved to shew
his Fidelity, by nobly setting all at stake, as he did,
though he well knew how to have secured himself, as
too many others did, either by Neutrality, or adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the Rebellious Party; but his Honour and
Loyalty was too great to be stained with such foul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47770:20"/>As soon as my Lord came to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in the first
place he sent for all his Tenants and Friends in those
parts, and presently raised a Troop of Horse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 120. and a Regiment of Foot, and put
them under Command, and upon duty and exercise
in the Town of <hi>Newcastle;</hi> and with this small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
took the Government of that place upon
him; where with the assistance of the Towns-men,
particularly the Mayor,<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Marlay</hi> Kt.</note> (whom by the power of his
Forces, he continued Mayor for the year following, he
being a person of much trust and fidelity, as he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself) and the rest of his Brethren, within few
days he fortified the Town, and raised men daily, and
put a Garrison of Soldiers into <hi>Tinmouth</hi> -Castle, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> betwixt <hi>Newcastle</hi> and the
Sea, to secure that Port, and armed the Soldiers as
well as he could: And thus he stood upon his Guard,
and continued them upon Duty; playing his weak
Game with much Prudence, and giving the Town
and Country very great satisfaction by his noble and
honourable Deportment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, there happend a great mutiny
of the Trainband Souldiers of the Bishoprick at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
so that my Lord was forced to remove thither
in Person, attended with some forces to appease them;
where at his arrival (I mention it by the way, and
as a merry passage) a jovial Fellow used this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
That he liked my Lord very well, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47770:21"/>
not his Company (meaning his Soldiers.)</p>
               <p>After my Lord had reduced them to their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and duty, he took great care of the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the said Bishoprick (as he did no less in
all other places committed to his Care and Protection,
well knowing that Schism and Faction in Religion is
the Mother of all or most Rebellions, Wars and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
in a State or Government) and constituted
that Learned and Eminent Divine the then Dean of
<hi>Peterborough,</hi> now Lord-Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens.</note>, to view
all sermons that were to be Preached, and suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them that in the least reflected against His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Person and Government, but to put forth and
add whatsoever he thought convenient, and punish
those that should trespass against it. In which that
worthy Person used so much care and industry, that
never the Church could be more happily govern'd
then it was at that present.</p>
               <p>Some short time after, my Lord received from Her
Majesty the Queen, out of <hi>Holland</hi> a small supply of
Money, <hi>viz.</hi> a little barrel of Ducatoons, which
amounted to about 500 l. <hi>Sterling;</hi> which my Lord
distributed amongst the Officers of his new raised Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to encourage them the better in their service; as
also some Armes, the most part whereof were consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his late Majesty; and those that were ordered to
be conveyed to his Majesty, were sent accordingly,
conducted by that onely Troop of Horse, which my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47770:21"/>
Lord had newly raised, with orders to return again
to him; but it seems His Majesty liked the Troop so
well, that he was pleased to command their stay to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
his own Army.</p>
               <p>About the same time the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
pleased to send His Majesty a Ship, which arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> laden with some Ammunition,
Armes, Regiment Pieces, and <hi>Danish</hi> Clubs; which
my Lord kept for the furnishing of some Forces which
he intended to raise for His Majesties service; for he
perceiving the flames increase more and more in both
the Houses of Parliament then sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
against his Majesties Person and Government; upon
Consultation with his Friends and Allies, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
he had in those Northern parts, took a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to raise an Army for His Majesties service, and
by an express acquainted His Majesty with his design;
who was so well pleased with it, that he sent him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
for that purpose, to constitute him General
of all the Forces raised and to be raised in all the parts
of the Kingdom, <hi>Trent-North,</hi> and moreover in the
several Counties of <hi>Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,
Cheshire, Leicester, Rutland, Cambridg, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,
Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> and Commander
in Chief for the same; as also to impower and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
him to confer the honour of Knighthood upon
such Persons as he should conceive deserved it, and
to coin Money and Print whensoever he saw occasion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47770:22"/>
for it: Which as it was not onely a great Honour,
but a great Trust and Power; so he used it with much
discretion and wisdom, onely in such occurrencies,
where he found it tending to the advancement of His
Majesties Service, and conferr'd the honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
sparingly, and but on such persons, whose Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and Loyal Actions did justly deserve it, so that
he Knighted in all to the number of Twelve.</p>
               <p>Within a short time, my Lord formed an Army
of 8000 Foot, Horse and Dragoons, and put them
into a condition to march in the beginning of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1642. No sooner was this effected, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
grew high in <hi>York-Shire,</hi> in so much, that
most of His Majesties good subjects of that County,
as well the Nobility as Gentry, were forced for the
preservation of their persons, to retire to the City of
<hi>York,</hi> a walled Town, but of no great strength; and
hearing that my Lord had not onely kept those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Northen parts generally faithful to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
but raised an Army for His Majesties Interest,
and the protection of his good subjects; thought it
convenient to employ and authorise some persons of
Quality to attend upon my Lord, and treat with
him on their behalf, that he would be pleased to give
them the assistance of his Army, which my Lord grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them upon such Terms as did highly advance His
Majesties Service, which was my Lords chief and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aim.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47770:22"/>Thus my Lord being with his Army invited into
<hi>York-Shire,</hi> He prepared for it with all the speed that
the nature of that business could possibly permit; and
after he had fortified the Town of <hi>Newcastle, Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthcastle,
Hartlepool</hi> (a Haven Town) and
some other necessary Garisons in those parts, and
Mann'd, Victuall'd and order'd their constant supply,
He thought it fit in the first place, before he did march,
to manifest to the World by a Declaration in Print,
the reasons and grounds of his undertaking that design;
which were in General, for the preservation of His
Majesties Person and Government, and the defence of
the Orthodox Church of <hi>England;</hi> where He also
satisfied those that murmur'd for my Lords receiving
into his Army such as were of the Catholick Religion,
and then he presently marched with his Army into
<hi>York-shire</hi> to their assistance, and within the time agreed
upon, came to <hi>York,</hi> notwithstanding the Enemies
Forces gave him all the interruption they possibly
could, at several passes; whereof the chief was at
<hi>Pierce-bridg,</hi> at the entering into <hi>York-shire,</hi> where
1500 of the Enemies Forces, Commanded in chief
by Col. <hi>Hotham,</hi> were ready to interrupt my Lord's
Forces, sent thither to secure that passe, consisting
of a Regiment of Dragoons, commanded by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and a Regiment of Foot, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Sir <hi>William Lambton,</hi> which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with so much Courage, that they routed the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47770:23"/>
Enemy, and put them to flight, although the said
Col. <hi>Howard</hi> in that Charge lost his life by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
shot.</p>
               <p>The Enemy thus missing of their design, fled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they met with a conjunction of their whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> some eight miles distant from <hi>York,</hi>
and my Lord went on without any other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Interruption. Being come to <hi>York,</hi> he drew up
his whole Army before the Town, both Horse and
Foot, where the Commander in Chief, the then
earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> together with the Gentry of
the Country, came to wait on my Lord, and the
then Governor of <hi>York,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with the Keys of the City.</p>
               <p>Thus my Lord marched into the Town with great
joy, and to the general satisfaction both of the
Nobility and Gentry, and most of the Citizens;
and immediately without any delay, in the later end
of <hi>December</hi> 1642, fell upon Consultations how
he might best proceed to serve his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and particularly, how his Army should be
maintained and paid, (as he did also afterwards in
every Country wheresoever he marched) well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that no Army can be governed without being
constantly and regularly supported by provision and
pay. Whereupon it was agreed, That the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Gentry of the several Counties, should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
a certain number of themselves to raise money
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47770:23"/>
by a regular Tax, for the making provisions for the
support and maintenance of the Army, rather than
to leave them to free-quarter, and to carve for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and if any of the Soldiers were exorbitant
and disorderly, and that it did appear so to those
that were authorised to examine their deportment,
that presently order should be given to repair those
injuries out of the moneys levied for the Soldiery;
by which means the Country was preserved from
many inconveniences, which otherwise would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have followed.</p>
               <p>And though the season of the year might well have
invited my Lord to take up his Winter-quarters, it
being about <hi>Christmas;</hi> yet after he had put a good
Garison into the City of <hi>York,</hi> and fortified it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intelligence that the Enemy was still at <hi>Tadcaster,</hi>
and had fortified that place, he resolved to march
thither. The greatest part of the Town stands on the
West side of a River not fordable in any place near
thereabout, nor allowing any passage into the Town
from <hi>York,</hi> but over a Stone-bridge, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
had made impassable by breaking down part
of the Bridg, and planting their Ordnance upon it,
and by raising a very large and strong Fort upon the
top of a Hill, leading Eastward from that Bridg
towards <hi>York,</hi> upon design of commanding the Bridg
and all other places fit to draw up an Army in, or to
plant Cannon against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47770:24"/>But notwithstanding all these Discouragements,
my Lord after he had refresh'd his Army at <hi>York,</hi>
and recruited his provisions, ordered a march before
the said Town in this manner: That the greatest part
of his Horse and Dragoons should in the night march
to a Pass at <hi>Weatherby,</hi> five miles distant from <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
towards North-west, from thence under the
Command of his then Lieutenant General of the
Army, to appear on the West side of <hi>Tadcaster</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the next morning, by which time my Lord with
the rest of his Army resolved to appear at the East-side
of the said Town; which intention was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
but ill executed; for though my Lord with
that part of the Army which he commanded in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that is to say, his Foot and Cannon, attended by
some Troops of Horse, did march that night, and
early in the morning appear'd before the Town on
the East side thereof, and there drew up his Army,
planted his Cannon, and closely and orderly besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that side of the Town, and from ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till four a Clock in the afternoon, battered the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Forts and Works, as being in continual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the appearance of the Troops on the other
side, according to his order; yet (whether it was out
of Neglect or Treachery that my Lords Orders were
not obeyed) that days Work was rendred ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
as to the whole Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47770:24"/>However the vigilancy of My Lord did put the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
into such a Terror, that they forsook that Fort,
and secretly fled away with all their Train that very
night to another strong hold not far distant from <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
called <hi>Cawood</hi>-Castle, to which, by reason of
its low and boggy Scituation, and foul and narrow
Lanes and passages, it was not possible for my Lord
to pursue them without too great an hazard to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
whereas had the Lieutenant General performed
his Duty, in all probability, the greatest part of the
principal Rebels in <hi>York-shire,</hi> would that day have
been taken in their own trap, and their further mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
prevented. My Lord, the next morning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of storming the Town, (as he he had intended)
entred without interruption, and there stayed some
few days to refresh his Army, and order that part of
the Country.</p>
               <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1642. My Lord thought it fit to march
to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and to quarter his Army in that part of
the Country, which was betwixt <hi>Cawood,</hi> and some
Garisons of the Enemy, in the west part of <hi>York-shire,
viz. Hallifax, Bradford, Leeds, Wakefield, &amp;c.</hi> where
he remained some time to recruit and enlarge his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was much lessened by erecting of Garisons,
and to keep those parts in order and obedience to His
Majesty; And after he had thus ordered his Affairs, He
was enabled to give Protection to those parts of the
Country that mere most willing to embrace it, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47770:25"/>
quarter'd his Army for a time in such places which
he had reduced. <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> which stood upon a Pass,
he made a Garison, or rather a strong Quarter, and
put also a Garison into <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle, not above eight
Miles distant from <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> which commanded that
Town, and a great part of the Country.</p>
               <p>During the time that his Army remained at <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret,</hi>
My Lord setled a Garison at <hi>Newark</hi> in <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-shire,</hi>
standing upon the River <hi>Trent,</hi> a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
pass, which kept the greatest part of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-shire,</hi>
and part of <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi> in obedience; and
after that, he returned in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
1642, back to <hi>York,</hi> with an intention to supply Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with some Ammunition, which He had ordered to
be brought from <hi>Newcastle:</hi> A Convoy of Horse that
were imployed to conduct it from thence, under the
Command of the Lieutenant General of the Army
the Lord <hi>Ethyn,</hi> was by the Enemy at a pass, called <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum-bridg,</hi>
in <hi>York-shire,</hi> fiercely encountred; in which
encounter My Lord's Forces totally routed them, slew
many, and took many Prisoners, and most of their
Horse Colours consisting of Seventeen Cornets; and
so march'd on to <hi>York</hi> with their Ammunition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Interruption.</p>
               <p>My Lord, after he had received this Ammunition,
put his Army into a condition to march, and having
intelligence that the Queen was at Sea, with intention
to land in some part of the Eastriding of <hi>York-shire,</hi> he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47770:25"/>
directed his March in <hi>February</hi> 1642, into those parts,
to be ready to attend Her Majesties landing, who was
then daily expected from <hi>Holland.</hi> Within a short
time, after it had pleased God to protect Her Majesty
both from the fury of Wind and Waves, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for several days such a Tempest at Sea, that Her
Majesty, with all her Attendance, was in danger to
be cast away every minute; as also from the fury of
the Rebels, which had the whole Naval Power of
the Kingdom then in their Hands: she arrived safely
at a small Port in the Eastriding of <hi>York-shire,</hi> called
<hi>Burlington</hi> Key, where Her Majesty was no sooner
landed, but the Enemy at Sea made continual shot
against her Ships in the Port, which reached not onely
Her Majesties landing, but even the House where she
lay (though without the least hurt to any) so that
she her self, and her Attendants, were forced to leave
the same, and to seek Protection from a Hill near that
place, under which they retired; and all that while it
was observed, that Her Majesty shewed as much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
as ever any person could do; for Her undaunted
and Generous spirit was like her Royal Birth, deriving
it self from that unparrallell'd King, Her Father, whose
Heroick Actions will be in perpetual Memory, whilest
the World hath a being.</p>
               <p>My Lord finding Her Majesty in this condition,
drew his Army near the place where she was, ready
to attend and protect Her Majesties Person, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47770:26"/>
was pleased to take a view of the Army as it was
drawn up in order; and immediately after, which
was in <hi>March</hi> 1643, took Her journey towards <hi>York,</hi>
whither the whole Army conducted Her Majesty, and
brought her safe into the City. About this time, Her
Majesty having some present occasion for Money, My
Lord presented Her with 3000 l. <hi>Sterling,</hi> which she
graciously accepted of, and having spent some time there
in Consultation about the present affairs, she was pleased
to send some Armes and Ammunition to the King,
who was then in <hi>Oxford;</hi> to which end, my Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a Party consisting of 1500, well Commanded,
to conduct the same, with whom the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi>
who then had waited upon Her Majesty from the
King, returned to <hi>Oxford;</hi> which Party His Majesty
was pleased to keep with him for his own Service.</p>
               <p>Not long after, My Lord, who always endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to win any place or persons by fair means, rather
then by using of force, reduced to His Majesties obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
a strong Fort and Castle upon the Sea, and a
very good Haven, call'd <hi>Scarborough</hi>-Castle, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Governour thereof, who heretofore had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his Forces at <hi>Yarum</hi>-bridg, with such rational
and convincible Arguments, that he willingly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
himself, and all the Garison under His Majesties
Devotion; By which prudent Action My Lord
highly advanced His Majesties Interest; for by that
means the Enemy was much annoyed and prejudiced
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47770:26"/>
at Sea, and a great part in the East-riding of <hi>York-shire</hi>
kept in due obedience.</p>
               <p>After this, My Lord having received Intelligence
that the Enemies General of the Horse<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax.</hi>
                  </note> had designed
to march with a Party from <hi>Cawood</hi> Castle, whither
they were fled from <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> as before is mentioned,
to some Garisons which they had in the West of
<hi>York-shire;</hi> presently order'd a party of Horse, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the General of the Horse, the Lord <hi>George
Goring,</hi> to attend the Enemy in their March, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
them on a Moor, call'd <hi>Seacroft-Moor,</hi> and
fell upon their Rear, which caused the Enemy to draw
up their Forces into a Body; to whom they gave a
Total rout (although their number was much greater)
and took about 800 Prisoners, and 10 or 12 Colours
of Horse, besides many that were slain in the charge;
which Prisoners were brought to <hi>York,</hi> about 10 or 12
miles distant from that same place.</p>
               <p>Immediately after, in pursuit of that Victory, My
Lord sent a considerable Party into the West of <hi>York-shire,</hi>
where they met with about 2000 of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Forces, taken out of their several Garisons in
those parts, to execute some design upon a Moor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tankerly-Moor,</hi> and there fought them, and routed
them; many were slain, and some taken Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Remainder of the Army that
were left at <hi>York,</hi> marched to <hi>Leeds,</hi> in the West of
<hi>York-shire,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Wakefield,</hi> being both
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47770:27"/>
the Enemies Quarters, to reduce and settle that part
of the Country: My Lord having possessed himself
of the Town of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> it being large, and of
great compass, and able to make a strong quarter,
order'd it accordingly; and receiving Intelligence
that in two Market-Towns Southwest from <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
viz. Rotheram</hi> and <hi>Sheffield,</hi> the Enemy was
very busie to raise Forces against his Majesty, and
had fortified them both about four miles distant from
each other, hoping thereby to give protection and
encouragement to all those parts of the Country
which were populous, rich and rebellious, he thought
it necessary to use his best endeavours to blast those
their wicked designs in the bud; and thereupon took
a resolution in <hi>April</hi> 1643, to march with part of
his Army from <hi>Wakefield</hi> into the mentioned parts,
attended with a convenient Train of Artillery and
Ammunition, leaving the greatest part of it at <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
with the remainder of his Army, under the
Care and Conduct of his General of the Horse, and
Major General of the Army<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Mackworth</hi> Knight.</note>, which was so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
both in respect of their number and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that they did, as they might well, conceive
themselves Master of the Field in those parts, and
secure in that quarter, although in the end it proved
not so, as shall hereafter be declared, which must
necessarily be imputed to their invigilancy and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47770:27"/>My Lord first marched to <hi>Rotheram,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Enemy had placed a Garison of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in that Town, and fortified it, he drew up his
Army in the morning against the Town, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
it; but they refusing to yield, my Lord fell
to work with his Cannon and Musket, and within
a short time took it by storm, and enter'd the
Town that very night; some Enemies of note that
were found therein, were taken Prisoners; and as
for the common Soldiers, which were by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
forced from their Allegiance, he shew'd such
Clemency to them, that very many willingly took
up Arms for His Majesties Service, and proved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faithful and loyal Subjects, and good Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>After my Lord had stayed two or three dayes
there, and order'd those parts, he marched with his
Army to <hi>Sheffield,</hi> another Market-Town of large
extent, in which there was an ancient Castle; which
when the Enemies Forces that kept the Town, came
to hear of, being terrified with the fame of my Lords
hitherto Victorious Army, they fled away from
thence into <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and left both Town and
Castle (without any blow) to my Lords Mercy;
and though the people in the Town were most of
them rebelliously affected, yet my Lord so prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordered the business, that within a short time he
reduced most of them to their Allegiance by love,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47770:28"/>
and the rest by fear, and recruited his Army dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he put a Garison of Soldiers into the Castle,
and fortified it in all respects, and constituted a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of Quality<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Will. Savil</hi> Kt. and Bar.</note> Governour both of the Castle,
Town and Country; and finding near that place
some Iron Works, he gave present order for the
casting of Iron Cannon for his Garisons, and for
the making of other Instruments and Engines of
War.</p>
               <p>Within a short time after, my Lord receiving
Intelligence that the Enemy in the Garisons near
<hi>Wakefield</hi> had united themselves, and being drawn
into a body in the night time, had surprised and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the Town of <hi>Wakesield,</hi> and taken all or most
of the Officers and Soldiers, left there, Prisoners,
(amongst whom was also the General of the Horse,
the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> whom my Lord afterwards redeem'd
by Exchange) and possessed themselves of the whole
Magazine, which was a very great loss and hinderance
to my Lords designs, it being the Moity of his
Army, and most of his Ammunition, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
new Counsels, and resolved without any delay
to march from thence back towards <hi>York,</hi> which was
in <hi>May</hi> 1643, where after he had rested some time,
Her Majesty being resolved to take Her Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Southern parts of the Kingdom, where the
King was, designed first to go from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Pomfret,</hi>
whither my Lord ordered the whole Marching Army
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47770:28"/>
to be in readiness to conduct Her Majesty,
which they did, he himself attending Her Majesty
in person. And after Her Majesty had rested there
some small time, she being desirous to proceed in Her
intended Journey, no less then a formed Army was
able to secure Her Person: Wherefore my Lord
was resolved out of his fidelity and duty to supply
Her with an Army of 7000 Horse and Foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a convenient Train of Artillery, for Her safer
Conduct; chusing rather to leave himself in a weak
condition (though he was even then very near the
Enemies Garisons in that part of the Country) then
suffer Her Majesties Person to be exposed to danger.
Which Army of 7000 men, when Her Majesty
was safely arrived to the King, He was pleased to
keep with him for His own Service.</p>
               <p>After Her Majesties departure out of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>
my Lord was forced to recruit again his Army, and
within a short time, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Iune</hi> 1643, took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to march into the Enemies Quarters, in the
Western parts; in which march he met with a strong
stone house well fortified, call'd <hi>Howley</hi>-House, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was a Garison of Soldiers, which my Lord sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd;
but the Governour disobeying the summons,
he batter'd it with his Cannon, and so took it by
force; the Governour having quarter given him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my Lords Orders, was brought before my
Lord by a Person of Quality, for which the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47770:29"/>
that brought him, received a check; and though
he resolved then to kill him, yet my Lord would
not suffer him to do it, saying, It was inhumane
to kill any man in cold blood. Hereupon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
kiss'd the Key of the House door, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it to my Lord; to which my Lord return'd
this answer, <hi>I need it not,</hi> said he, <hi>for I brought a
Key along with me, which yet I was unwilling to use,
until you forced me to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this House my Lord remained five or six days,
till he had refreshed his Soldiers; and then a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was taken to march against a Garison of the
Enemies call'd <hi>Bradford,</hi> a little, but a strong Town;
in the way he met with a strong interruption by the
Enemy drawing forth a vast number of Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
which they had very privately gotten out of
<hi>Lancashire,</hi> the next adjoining County to those parts
of <hi>York-shire,</hi> which had so easie an access to them at
<hi>Bradford,</hi> by reason the whole Country was of their
Party, that my Lord could not possibly have any
constant intelligence of their designs and motions; for
in their Army there were near 5000 Musquetiers, and
18 Troops of Horse, drawn up in a place full of hedges,
called <hi>Atherton-moor,</hi> near to their Garison at <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
ready to encounter my Lords Forces, which
then contained not above half so many Musquetiers
as the Enemy had; their chiefest strength consisting
in Horse, and these made useless for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47770:29"/>
by the Enemies Horse possessing all the plain
ground upon that Field; so that no place was left to
draw up my Lords Horse, but amongst old Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits:
Neither could they charge the Enemy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a great ditch and high bank betwixt my Lord's
and the Enemies Troops, but by two on a breast,
and that within Musquet shot; the Enemy being
drawn up in hedges, and continually playing upon
them, which rendred the service exceeding difficult and
hazardous.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Foot of both sides on the
right and left Wings, encounter'd each other, who
fought from Hedg to Hedg, and for a long time
together overpower'd and got ground of my Lords
Foot, almost to the invironing of his Cannon; my
Lords Horse (wherein consisted his greatest strength)
all this while being made, by reason of the ground,
incapable of charging; at last the Pikes of my Lords
Army having had no employment all the day, were
drawn against the Enemies left wing, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
those of my Lords own Regiment, which
were all stout and valiant men, who fell so furiously
upon the Enemy, that they forsook their hedges, and
fell to their heels: At which very instant, my Lord cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a shot or two to be made by his Cannon against the
Body of the Enemies Horse, drawn up within Cannon
shot, which took so good effect, that it disordered the
Enemies Troops; Hereupon my Lord's Horse got
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47770:30"/>
over the Hedg, not in a body (for that they could
not) but dispersedly two on a breast; and as soon as
some considerable number was gotten over, and drawn
up, they charged the Enemy, and routed them; so
that in an instant there was a strange change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and the Field totally won by my Lord, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he had quitted 7000 Men, to conduct Her
Majesty, besides a good Train of Artillery, which in
such a Conjuncture would have weakned <hi>Caesars</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
In this Victory the Enemy lost most of their
Foot, about 3000 were taken Prisoners, and 700
Horse and Foot slain, and those that escaped, fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Garison at <hi>Bradford,</hi> amongst whom was also
their General of the Horse.</p>
               <p>After this, My Lord caused his Army to be rallied,
and marched in order that night before <hi>Bradford,</hi> with
an intention to storm it the next morning; but the
Enemy that were in the Town, it seems, were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
that the same night they escaped all various
ways, and amongst them the said General of the Horse,
whose Lady being behind a Servant on Horse-back,
was taken by some of My Lord's Soldiers and brought
to his Quarters, where she was treated and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all civility and respect, and within few days
sent to <hi>York</hi> in my Lords own Coach, and from
thence very shortly after to <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi>
where she desired to be, attended by my Lords
Coach and Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47770:30"/>Thus my Lord, after the Enemy was gone, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Town and Garison of <hi>Bradford,</hi> by which
Victory the Enemy was so daunted, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the rest of their Garisons, that is to say, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax,
Leeds</hi> and <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and dispersed themselves
severally, the chief Officers retiring to <hi>Hull,</hi> a strong
Garison of the Enemy; and though my Lord, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would make their escape thither, as having
no other place of refuge to resort to, sent a Letter
to <hi>York</hi> to the Governour of that City, to stop them
in their passage; yet by neglect of the Post, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not timely enough to his hands, his Design was
frustrated.</p>
               <p>The whole County of <hi>York,</hi> save onely <hi>Hull,</hi>
being now cleared and setled by my Lords Care and
Conduct, he marched to the City of <hi>York,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a competent number of Horse well armed and
commanded, he quarter'd them in the East-riding,
near <hi>Hull,</hi> there being no visible Enemy then to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them: In the mean while my Lord receiving
News that the Enemy had made an Invasion into the
next adjoining County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where he had
some Forces, he presently dispatched<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ethyn.</hi>
                  </note> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General of the Army away with some Horse
and Dragoons, and soon after marched thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the body of the Army, being earnestly
defired by his Majesties Party there. The Forces
which my Lord had in the same County, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47770:31"/>
by the then Lieutenant General of the Horse, Mr.
<hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> second Brother to the now Earl
of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> though they had timely notice, and
Orders from my Lord to make their retreat to the
Lieutenant-General of the Army, and not to fight
the Enemy; yet the said Lieutenant-General of the
Horse being transported by his Courage, (he being
a Person of great Valour and Conduct) and having
charged the Enemy, unfortunately lost the field, and
himself was slain in the Charge, his Horse lighting in a
bogg: Which news being brought to my Lord when
he was on his March, he made all the hast he could,
and was no sooner joined with his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but fell upon the Enemy, and put them to
flight.</p>
               <p>The first Garison my Lord took in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>
was <hi>Gainsborrough,</hi> a Town standing upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Trent,</hi> wherein (not long before) had been a
Garison of Soldiers for His Majesty, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the then Earl of <hi>Kingstone,</hi> but surprised,
and the Town Taken by the Enemies Forces, who
having an intention to conveigh the said Earl of
<hi>Kingstone</hi> from thence to <hi>Hull</hi> in a little Pinnace,
met with some of my Lords Forces by the way,
commanded by the Lieutenant of the Army, who
being desirous to rescue the Earl of <hi>Kingstone,</hi> and
and making some shots with their Regiment Pieces,
to stop the Pinnace, unfortunately slew him, and
one of his Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47770:31"/>My Lord drawing near the mentioned Town of
<hi>Gainsborrough,</hi> there appear'd on the top of a Hill
above the Town, some of the Enemies Horse drawn
up in a body; whereupon he immediately sent a
party of his Horse to view them; who no sooner
came within their sight, but they retreated fairly so
long as they could well endure; but the pursuit of
my Lords Horse caused them presently to break their
ranks, and fall to their heels; where most of them
escaped, and fled to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> another of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons.
Hereupon my Lord summon'd the Town of
<hi>Gainsborrough;</hi> but the Governour thereof refusing
to yield, caused my Lord to plant his Cannon, and
draw up his Army on the mention'd Hill; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
play'd some little while upon the Town, put
the Enemy into such a terror, that the Governour
sent out, and offer'd the surrender of the Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fair terms, which my Lord thought fit rather to
embrace, then take it by force; and though accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Articles of Agreement made between
them, both the Enemies Arms and the Keys of the
Town should have been fairly delivered to my Lord;
yet it being not performed as it was expected, the
Arms being in a confused manner thrown down, and
the Gates set wide open, the Prisoners that had been
kept in the Town, began first to plunder; which
my Lords Forces seeing, did the same, although it
was against my Lords will and orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47770:32"/>After my Lord had thus reduced the Town, and
put a good Garison of Soldiers into it, and better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
it, he marched before <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and there he
entred with his Army without great difficulty, and
plac'd also a Garison in it, and raised a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, both Horse, Foot and Dragoons, for
the preservation of that County, and put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Commanders, and constituted a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> Commander in Chief, with intention to
march towards the South, which if it had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
would doubtless have made an end of that War;
but he being daily importuned by the Nobility and
Gentry of <hi>York-shire,</hi> to return into that County,
especially upon the perswasions of the Commander
in Chief of the Forces left there, who acquainted
my Lord that the Enemy grew so strong every day,
being got together in <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying
that Country, that his Forces were not able
to bear up against them; alledging withall, that my
Lord would be suspected to betray the Trust repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in him, if he came not to succour and assist
them; he went back with his Army for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that same Country; and when he arrived
there, which was in <hi>August</hi> 1643, he found the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of so small consequence, that they did all flie
before him. About this time His Majesty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to honour my Lord for His true and faithful
Service, with the Title of <hi>Marquess of Newcastle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47770:32"/>My Lord being returned into <hi>York-shire,</hi> forced
the Enemy first from a Town called <hi>Beverly,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they had a Garison of Soldiers; and from thence,
upon the entreaty of the Nobility and Gentry of
<hi>York-shire,</hi> (as before is mentioned) who promised
him Ten thousand men for that purpose, though
they came short of their performance, marched near
the Town of <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and besieged that
part of the Garison that bordered on <hi>York-shire,</hi> for
a certain time; in which time the Enemy took the
courage to sally out of the Town with a strong
party of Horse and Foot very early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with purpose to have forced the Quarters of a
Regiment of my Lords Horse, that were quarter'd
next the Town; but by the vigilancy of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> afterwards Lord
<hi>Langdale,</hi> his Forces being prepared for their reception,
they received such a Welcome as cost many of them
their Lives, most of their Foot (but such as were
slain) being taken Prisoners; and those of their Horse
that escaped, got into their Hold at <hi>Hull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enemy thus seeing that they could do my
Lords Army no further damage on that side of the
River in <hi>York-shire,</hi> endeavoured by all means (from
<hi>Hull,</hi> and other confederate places in the Eastern
parts of the Kingdom) to form a considerable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to annoy and disturb the Forces raised by my
Lord in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and left there for the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47770:33"/>
on of that County; where the Enemy being drawn
together in a body, fought my Lords Forces in his
absence, and got the honour of the day near <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
Castle in that County; which loss, caused part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by their own rashness, forced my Lord to leave
his design upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and to march back with his
Army to <hi>York,</hi> which was in <hi>October</hi> 1643, where
he remained but a few dayes to refresh his Army,
and receiving intelligence that the Enemy was got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and did grow numerous there, and
busie in seducing the people, that Country being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Lords Command, he resolved to direct his
March thither in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> 1643,
to suppress their further growth; and to that end
quarter'd his Army at <hi>Chesterfield,</hi> and in all the parts
thereabout, for a certain time.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his departure from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret,</hi>
in his said March into <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> the City of
<hi>York</hi> sent to my Lord to inform him of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to chuse another Mayor for the year following,
desiring his pleasure about it: My Lord, who knew
that the Mayor for the year before, was a person
of much Loyalty and Discretion, declared his mind
to them, That he thought it fit to continue him
Mayor also for the year following; which it seems
they did not like, but resolved to chuse one which
they pleased, contrary to my Lords desire. My Lord
perceiving their intentions, about the time of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47770:33"/>
sent orders to the Governour of the City of
<hi>York,</hi> to permit such Forces to enter into the City
as he should send; which being done accordingly,
they upon the Day of the Election repaired to the
Town-Hall, and with their Arms staid there until
they had continued the said Mayor according to my
Lords desire.</p>
               <p>During the time of my Lords stay at <hi>Chesterfield</hi>
in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> he ordered some part of his Army
to march before a strong House and Garison of the
Enemies, call'd <hi>Wingfield Mannor,</hi> which in a short
time they took by storm. And when my Lotd had
raised in that County as many Forces, Horse and
Foot, as were supposed to be sufficient to preserve
it from the fury of the Enemy, he armed them, and
constituted an Honourable Person<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Loughbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>
                  </note> Commander in
Chief of all the Forces of that County, and of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire;</hi>
and so leaving it in that condition, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>December</hi> 1643, from <hi>Chesterfield</hi> to <hi>Bolsover</hi> in
the same County, and from thence to <hi>Welbeck</hi> in
<hi>Nottinghamshire,</hi> to his own House and Garison, in
which parts he staid some time, both to refresh his
Army, and to settle and reform some disorders he
found there, leaving no visible Enemy behind him in
<hi>Derbyshire,</hi> save onely an inconsiderable party in the
Town of <hi>Derby,</hi> which they had fortified, not worth
the labour to reduce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47770:34"/>About this time the report came, that a great Army
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was upon their march towards the
Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> to assist the Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
His Majesty, which forced the Nobility and
Gentry of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> to invite my Lord back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those parts, with promise to raise for his service, an
Army of 10000 men; My Lord (not upon this prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
which had already heretofore deceived him, but
out of his Loyalty and duty to preserve those parts
which were committed to his care and protection) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
in the middle of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1643. And when he
came there, he found not one man raised to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him against so powerful an Army, nor an intention
of raising any; Wherefore he was necessitated to raise
himself, out of the Countrey, what forces he could get,
and when he had settled the affairs in <hi>York-shire</hi> as well
as time and his present condition would permit, and
constituted an honourable Person<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Bellasis.</hi>
                  </note> Governor of <hi>York</hi>
and Commander in chief of a very considerable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of horse and foot for the defence of the County
(for Sr. <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> was then made Colonel Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and marched into the Field with the Army) he
took his march to <hi>Newcastle</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
1643, to give a stop to the <hi>Scots</hi> army.</p>
               <p>Presently after his coming thither with some of his
Troups, before his whole army was come up, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
intelligence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Armie's near approach,
whereupon he sent forth a party of horse to view them,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47770:34"/>
who found them very strong, to the number of
22000 Horse and Foot well armed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
They marched up towards the Town with such
confidence, as if the Gates had been open'd for their
reception; and the General of their Army seem'd to
take no notice of my Lords being in it, for which
afterwards he excused himself; but as they drew near,
they found not such entertainment as they expected;
for though they assaulted a Work that was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
yet they were beaten off with much loss.</p>
               <p>The Enemy being thus stopt before the Town,
thought fit to quarter near it, in that part of the
Country; and so soon as my Lords Army was come
up, he designed one night to have fallen into their
Quarter; but by reason of some neglect of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in not giving timely notice to the party design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, it took not an effect answerable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
In a word, there were three Designs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against the Enemy, whereof if one had but hit,
they would doubtless have been lost; but there was
so much Treachery, Jugling and Falshood in my
Lord's own Army, that it was impossible for him
to be successful in his Designs and Undertakings.
However, though it failed in the Enemies Foot-Quarters,
which lay nearest the Town; yet it took
good effect in their Horse-Quarters, which were more
remote; for my Lord's Horse, Commanded by a
very gallant and worthy Gentleman<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Langdale.</hi>
                  </note> falling upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47770:35"/>
them, gave them such an Alarm, that all they could
do, was to draw into the Field, where my Lord's
Forces charged them, and in a little time routed them
totally, and kill'd and took many Prisoners, to the
number of 1500.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Enemy was forced to draw their
whole Army together, and to quarter them a little
more remote from the Town, and to seek out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible
places for their security, as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more plainly; for so soon as my Lord had
prepared his Army for a March, he drew them
forth against the <hi>Scots,</hi> which he found quarter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
high Hills close by the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> where they
could not be encounter'd but upon very disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
terms; besides, that day proved very stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and tempestuous, so that my Lord was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to withdraw his Forces, and retire into his own
Quarters.</p>
               <p>The next day after, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army finding ill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in those quarters, marched from hill to hill into
another part of the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> near the
Sea coast, to a Town called <hi>Sunderland;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Lord thought fit to march to <hi>Durham,</hi> to stop
their further progress, where he had contrived the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
so, that they were either forced to fight or starve
within a little time. The first was offered to them
twice, that is to say, at <hi>Pensher-hills</hi> one day, and at
<hi>Bowden-hills</hi> another day in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham:</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47770:35"/>
But my Lord found them at both times drawn up in
such places, as he could not possibly charge them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he retired again to <hi>Durham,</hi> with an intention
to streighten their Quarters, and to wait upon them,
if ever they left their Holds and inaccessible places.
In the mean time it hapned that the Earl of <hi>Montross</hi>
came to the same place, and having some design for his
Majesties service in <hi>Scotland,</hi> desired My Lord to give
him the assistance of some of his Forces; and although
My Lord stood then in present need of them, and
could not coveniently spare any, having so great an
Army to oppose; yet out of a desire to advance His
Majesties service as much as lay in his power, he was
willing to part with 200 Horse and Dragoons to the
said Earl.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> perceiving My Lords vigilancy and care,
contented themselves with their own quarters, which
could not have serv'd them long, but that a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
befel My Lords Forces in <hi>York-shire;</hi> for the
Governour whom he had left behind with sufficient
Forces for the defence of that Country, although he
had orders not to encounter the Enemy, but to keep
himself in a defensive posture; yet he being a man of
great valour and courage, it transported him so much
that he resolved to face the Enemy, and offering to keep
a Town that was not tenable<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Selby</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
                  </note>, was utterly routed, and
himself taken Prisoner, although he fought most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47770:36"/>So soon as my Lord received this sad Intelligence,
he upon Consultation, and upon very good Grounds
of Reason, took a resolution not to stay between the
two Armies of the Enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> and the
<hi>English,</hi> that had prevailed in <hi>York-shire;</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to march into <hi>York-shire</hi> with his Army, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
(if possible) the City of <hi>York</hi> out of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hands: which retreat was ordered so well, and
with such excellent Conduct, that though the Army
of the <hi>Scots</hi> marched close upon their Rear, and fought
them every day of their retreat, yet they gained seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Passes for their security, and entred safe and well
into the City of <hi>York,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1643.</p>
               <p>My Lord being now at <hi>York,</hi> and finding three
Armies against him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Army of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the
Army of the <hi>English</hi> that gave the defeat to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>York,</hi> and an Army that was raised out of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate
Counties, and but little Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
in the Town; was forced to send his Horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to quarter in several Counties, <hi>viz. Derbyshire,
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire,</hi> for their subsistance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of his Lieutenant-General of the
Horse, My dear Brother Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> himself
remaining at <hi>York,</hi> with his Foot and Train for the
defence of that City.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Enemy having closely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siedged
the City on all sides, came to the very Gates
thereof, and pull'd out the Earth at one end, as those
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47770:36"/>
in the City put it in at the other end; they planted
their great Cannons against it, and threw in Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
at pleasure: But those in the City made several
sallies upon them with good success. At last, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the associate Army of the Enemy, having
closely beleaguer'd the North side of the Town,
sprung a Mine under the wall of the Mannor-yard, and
blew part of it up; and having beaten back the Town-Forces
(although they behaved themselves very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly)
enter'd the Mannor-house with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their men, which as soon as my Lord percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he went away in all haste, even to the amazement
of all that were by, not knowing what he intended to
do; and drew 80 of his own Regiment of Foot, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the White-Coats, all stout and valiant Men, to
that Post, who fought the Enemy with that courage,
that within a little time they killed and took 1500 of
them; and My Lord gave present order to make up the
breach which they had made in the wall; Whereupon
the Enemy remain'd without any other attempt in that
kind, so long, till almost all provision for the support
of the soldiery in the City was spent, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
was so well ordered by my Lords Prudence,
that no Famine or great extremity of want en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.</p>
               <p>My Lord having held out in that manner above
two Months, and withstood the strength of three
Armies; and seeing that his Lieutenant-General of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47770:37"/>
the Horse whom he had sent for relief to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
could not so soon obtain it (although he used
his best endeavour) for to gain yet some little time,
began to treat with the Enemy; ordering in the mean
while, and upon the Treaty, to double and treble
his Guards. At last after three Months time from
the beginning of the Siege, His Majesty was pleased
to send an Army, which joining with my Lords Horse
that were sent to quarter in the aforesaid Countreys,
came to relieve the City, under the Conduct of the
most Gallant and Heroick Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
upon whose approach near <hi>York,</hi> the Enemy
drew from before the City, into an entire Body, and
marched away on the West-side of the River <hi>Owse,</hi>
that runs through the City, His Majesties Forces
being then of the East-side of that River.</p>
               <p>My Lord immediately sent some persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to attend His Highness, and to invite him into
the City to consult with him about that important
Affair, and to gain so much time as to open a Port
to march forth with his Cannon and Foot which
were in the Town, to join with His Highness's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and went himself the next day in person to wait
on His Highness; where after some Conferences, he
declared his Mind to the Prince, desiring His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
not to attempt any thing as yet upon the Enemy;
for he had intelligence that there was some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
between them, and that they were resolved to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47770:37"/>
divide themselves, and so to raise the Siege without
fighting: Besides, my Lord expected within two
dayes, Collonel <hi>Cleavering,</hi> with above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men out of the North, and two thousand
drawn out of several Garisons, (who also came at
the same time, though it was then too late) But
His Highness answered my Lord, That he had a
Letter from His Majesty (then at <hi>Oxford</hi>) with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
and absolute Command to fight the Enemy;
which in Obedience, and according to his Duty he
was bound to perform. Whereupon my Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That he was ready and willing for his part,
to obey his Highness in all things, no otherwise then
if His Majesty was there in Person Himself; and
though several of my Lords Friends advised him not
to engage in Battel, because the Command (as they
said) was taken from Him: Yet my Lord answer'd
them, That happen what would, he would not
shun to fight, for he had no other ambition but to
live and dye a Loyal Subject to His Majesty.</p>
               <p>Then the Prince and my Lord conferr'd with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Officers, amongst whom there were
several Disputes concerning the advantages which the
Enemy had of Sun, Wind and Ground. The Horse
of His Majesties Forces, was drawn up in both
Wings upon that fatal Moor call'd <hi>Hessom-Moor;</hi> and
my Lord ask'd His Highness what Service he would
be pleas'd to command him; who return'd this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47770:38"/>
That he would begin no action upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
till early in the morning; desiring my Lord
to repose himself till then: Which my Lord did,
and went to rest in his own Coach that was close by
in the Field, until the time appointed.</p>
               <p>Not long had My Lord been there, but he heard
a great noise and thunder of shooting, which gave
him notice of the Armies being engaged: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he immediately put on his Arms, and was no
sooner got on Horse-back, but he beheld a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
sight of the Horse of His Majesties right Wing,
which out of a panick fear had left the Field, and
run away with all the speed they could; and though
my Lord made them stand once, yet they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
betook themselves to their heels again, and
killed even those of their own party that endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to stop them; the Left Wing in the mean time,
Commanded by those two Valiant Persons, the
Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> having the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Enemies Right Wing, which they beat
back most valiantly three times, and made their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
retreat, in so much that they sounded Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>In this Confusion my Lord (accompanied onely
with his Brother Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> Major <hi>Scot,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Mazine,</hi> and his Page) hastning to see in what
posture his own Regiment was, met with a Troop
of Gentlemen-Voluntiers, who formerly had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47770:38"/>
him their Captain, notwithstanding he was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of an Army; to whom my Lord spake after
this manner: <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> said he, <hi>You have done me the
Honour to chuse me your Captain, and now is the fittest
time that I may do you service; wherefore if you'l follow
me, I shall lead you on the best I can, and shew you the
way to your own Honour.</hi> They being as glad of my
Lords Profer, as my Lord was of their Readiness,
went on with the greatest Courage; and passing
through Two Bodies of Foot, engaged with each
other not at forty yards distance, received not the
least hurt, although they fired quick upon each other;
but marched towards a <hi>Scots</hi> Regiment of Foot,
which they charged and routed; in which Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Lord himself kill'd Three with his Pages half-leaden
Sword, for he had no other left him; and
though all the Gentlemen in particular, offer'd him
their Swords, yet my Lord refused to take a Sword
of any of them. At last, after they had pass'd through
this Regiment of Foot, a Pike-man made a stand to
the whole Troop; and though my Lord charg'd
him twice or thrice, yet he could not enter him;
but the Troop dispatched him soon.</p>
               <p>In all these Encounters my Lord got not the least
hurt, though several were slain about him; and his
White-Coats shew'd such an extraordinary Valour
and Courage in that Action, that they were kill'd in
Rank and File: And here I cannot but mention by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47770:39"/>
the way, That it is remarkable, that in all actions and
undertakings where My Lord was in Person himself, he
was always Victorious, and prospered in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his designs; but whatsoever was lost or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ill, happen'd in his absence, and was caused ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Treachery, or Negligence and Carelesness
of his Officers.</p>
               <p>My Lord being the last in the Field, and seeing that
all was lost, and that every one of His Majesties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
made their escapes in the best manner they could;
he being moreover inquired after by several of his
Friends, who had all a great love and respect for my
Lord, especially by the then Earl of <hi>Craford</hi> (who
lov'd my Lord so well that he gave 20 s. to one that
assured him of his being alive and safe, telling him, that
that was all he had) went towards <hi>York</hi> late at night,
accompanied onely with his Brother, and one or two
of his servants; and coming near the Town, met His
Highness Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> with the Lieutenant General
of the Army, the Lord <hi>Ethyn;</hi> His Highness asked
My Lord how the business went? To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That all was lost and gone on their side.</p>
               <p>That night my Lord remained in <hi>York;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing left in his power to do his Majesty any
further service in that kind; for he had neither Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
nor Money to raise more Forces, to
keep either <hi>York,</hi> or any other Towns that were yet
in His Majesties Devotion, well knowing that those
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47770:39"/>
which were left could not hold out long, and being
also loath to have aspersions cast upon him, that he
did fell them to the Enemy, in case he could not keep
them; he took a Resolution, and that justly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably,
to forsake the Kingdom; and to that end,
went the next morning to the Prince, and acquainted
him with his Design, desiring His Highness would be
pleased to give this true and just report of him to his
Majesty, that he had behaved himself like an honest
man, a Gentleman, and a Loyal subject: Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
the Prince having granted, my Lord took his
leave; and being conducted by a Troop of Horse, and
a Troop of Dragoons to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> went to Sea, and
took shipping for <hi>Hamborough;</hi> the Gentry of the
Country, who also came to take their leaves of My
Lord, being much troubled at his departure, and
speaking very honourably of him, as surely they had
no reason to the contrary.</p>

               <p>My Lord being a Wise Man, and foreseeing well
what the loss of that fatal Battle upon <hi>Hessom-moor,</hi> near
<hi>York,</hi> would produce, by which not onely those of
His Majesties Party in the Northern parts of the
Kingdom, but in all other parts of His Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
both in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were
lost and undone, and that there was no other way, but
either to quit the Kingdom, or submit to the Enemy,
or die; he resolved upon the former, and preparing
for his journey, asked his Steward, How Much
Money he had left? Who answer'd, That he had but
90 l. My Lord not being at all startled at so small a
Summ, although his present design required much
more, was resolved too seek his Fortune, even with
that litle; and thereupon having taken leave of His
Highness Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the rest that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47770:40"/>
went to <hi>Scarborough</hi> (as before is mentioned)
where two Ships were prepared for <hi>Hamborough</hi> to set
sail within 24 hours, in which he embarqued with his
Company, and arrived in four days time to the said
City, which was on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1644.</p>
               <p>In one of these Ships was my Lord, with his two
Sons; <hi>Charles</hi> Viscount <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and Lord <hi>Henry
Cavendish,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Ogle;</hi> as also Sir <hi>Charles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendish,</hi>
My Lord's Brother; the then Lord Bishop of
<hi>London-derry</hi> Dr. <hi>Bramhall;</hi> the Lord <hi>Falconbridg,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Widdrington,</hi> Sir <hi>William Carnaby,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
died at <hi>Paris,</hi> and his Brother Mr. <hi>Francis Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby,</hi>
who went presently in the same Ship back again
for <hi>England,</hi> and soon after was slain by the Enemy,
near <hi>Sherborne</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi> besides many of my
Lord's and their servants: In the other Ship was the
Earl of <hi>Ethyne,</hi> Lieutenant General of My Lord's
Army, and the Lord <hi>Cornworth.</hi> But before My
Lord landed at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> his eldest Son <hi>Charles,</hi>
Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> fell sick of the Small-Pox, and not
long after his younger Son <hi>Henry,</hi> now Earl of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
fell likewise dangerously ill of the Measels; but it
pleased God that they both happily recovered.</p>
               <p>My Lord finding his Company and Charge very
great, although he sent several of his Servants back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into <hi>England;</hi> and having no means left to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him, was forced to seek for Credit; where at
last he got so much as would in part relieve his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47770:41"/>
and whereas heretofore he had been contented,
for want of a Coach, to make use of a Waggon,
when his occasions drew him abroad; he was now
able (with the credit he had got) to buy a Coach
and nine Horses of an <hi>Holsatian</hi> breed; for which
Horses he paid 160 l. and was afterwards offer'd for
one of them an hundred Pistols at <hi>Paris;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the money, and presented seven of them to
Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of <hi>England,</hi> and
kept two for his own use.</p>
               <p>After my Lord had stay'd in <hi>Hamborough</hi> from
<hi>Iuly</hi> 1644, till <hi>February</hi> 1645/4, he being resolved
to go into <hi>France,</hi> went by Sea from <hi>Hamborough</hi>
to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where
he sent one of his Servants with a Complement and
tender of his humble Service to Her Highness the
then Princess Royal, the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the
Princess Dowager of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
which was received with much kindness and civility.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> he directed his Journey to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
and from thence with one Coach, one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
and two Waggons, he went to <hi>Mechlin</hi> and
<hi>Brussels,</hi> where he received a Visit from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the Marquess of <hi>Castel Rodrigo,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Count <hi>Piccolomini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence he set forth for <hi>Valenchin</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
where the Governour of the Town, used my
Lord with great respect and civility, and desired him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47770:41"/>
to give the word that night. Thence he went to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon,</hi>
a Frontier Town in <hi>France,</hi> (where the Vice-Governour
in absence of the Governour of that
place, did likewise entertain my Lord with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and desired him to give the Word that night)
and so to <hi>Paris</hi> without any further stay.</p>
               <p>My Lord being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> which was in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi>
1645, immediately went to tender his humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of <hi>England,</hi>
where it was my Fortune to see him the first time,
I being then one of the Maids of Honour to Her
Majesty; and after he had stay'd there some time,
he was pleased to take some particular notice of me,
and express more then an ordinary affection for me;
insomuch that he resolved to chuse me for his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife; for he having but two Sons, purposed
to marry me, a young Woman, that might prove
fruitful to him, and encrease his Posterity by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculine
Off-spring: Nay, He was so desirous of
Male-Issue, that I have heard him say, He cared
not, (so God would be pleased to give him many
Sons) although they came to be Persons of the
meanest Fortunes; but God (it seems) had ordered
it otherwise, and frustrated his Designs, by making
me barren, which yet did never lessen his Love and
Affection for me.</p>
               <p>After My Lord was married, having no Estate or
Means left him to maintain himself and his Family,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47770:42"/>
he was necessitated to seek for Credit, and live upon the
Courtesie of those that were pleased to Trust him;
which although they did for some while, and shew'd
themselves very civil to My Lord, yet they grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at length, insomuch that his Steward was forced one
time to tell him, That he was not able to provide a
Dinner for him, for his Creditors were resolved to
trust him no longer. My Lord being always a great
master of his Passions, was, at least shew'd himself not
in any manner troubled at it, but in a pleasant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
told me, that I must of necessity pawn my
Cloaths, to make so much Money as would procure
a Dinner. I answer'd, That my Cloaths would be
but of small value, and therefore desired my Waiting-Maid<note n="*" place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> now Mrs. <hi>Top.</hi>
                  </note> to pawn some small toys, which I had formerly
given her, which she willingly did. The same day in
the afternoon, My Lord spake himself to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and both by his civil Deportment, and perswasive
Arguments, obtained so much, that they did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trust him for more necessaries, but lent him Mony
besides, to redeem those Toys that were pawned.
Hereupon I sent my Waiting-Maid into <hi>England,</hi> to
my Brother the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> for that small Portion
which was left me, and my Lord also immediately
after dispatched one of his Servants<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Beno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist.</hi>
                  </note>, who was then
Governour to his Sons, to some of his Friends, to
try what means he could procure for his subsistance;
but though he used all the industry and endeavour he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47770:42"/>
could, yet he effected but little, by reason every body
was so affraid of the Parliament, that they durst not
relieve Him, who was counted a Traitor for his Honest
and Loyal service to his King and Country.</p>
               <p>Not long after, My Lord had profers made him
of some Rich Matches in <hi>England</hi> for his two Sons,
whom therefore he sent thither with one Mr. <hi>Loving,</hi>
hoping by that means to provide both for them and
himself; but they being arrived there, out of some
reasons best known to them, declared their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Marry as yet, continuing nevertheless in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and living as well as they could.</p>
               <p>Some two years after my Lord's Marriage, when
he had prevailed so far with his Creditors, that they
began to trust him anew; the first thing he did was,
that he removed out of those Lodgings in <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he had been necessitated to live hitherto, to a House
which he hired for himself and his Family, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it as well as his new gotten Credit would permit;
and withal, resolving for his own recreation and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
in his banished condition, to exercise the Art
of Mannage, which he is a great lover and Master of,
bought a Barbary-horse for that purpose, which cost
him 200 Pistols, and soon after, another Barbary-horse
from the Lord <hi>Crofts,</hi> for which he was to pay
him 100 l. when he returned into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time, there was a Council call'd at
St. <hi>Germain,</hi> in which were present, besides My Lord,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47770:43"/>
Her Majesty the now Queen Mother of <hi>England;</hi> His
Highness the Prince, our now gracious King, His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Worcester,</hi> the then
Marquess, now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iermyn</hi>
now Earl of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and several others; where
after several debates concerning the then present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, my
Lord delivered his sentiment, that he could perceive
no other probability of procuring Forces for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
but an assistance of the <hi>Scots;</hi> But Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was pleased to answer my Lord, That he was too
quick.</p>
               <p>Not long after, When my Lord had begun to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
himsef in his mentioned new house, His gracious
Master the Prince, having taken a resolution to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Holland</hi> upon some designs; Her <hi>Majesty</hi> the Queen
Mother desired my Lord to follow him, promising to
engage for his debts which hitherto he had contracted
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and commanding Her Controller<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry Wood.</hi>
                  </note> and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer<note n="*" place="margin">Sir—<hi>Foster.</hi>
                  </note> to be bound for them in Her behalf; which they
did, although the Creditors would not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
until my Lord had joined his word to theirs;
So great and generous was the bounty and favour of
Her <hi>Majesty</hi> to my Lord! considering she had already
given him heretofore near upon 2000 l. <hi>Sterling,</hi> even
at that time when Her Majesty stood most in need
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47770:43"/>My Lord, after his Highness the Prince was gone,
being ready to execute Her Majesties Commands in
following Him, and preparing for his Journey, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the chief thing, which was Money; and having
much endeavoured for it, at last had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to obtain upon Credit three or four hundred
pounds <hi>sterl.</hi> With which Sum he set out of <hi>Paris</hi> in
the same Equipage he entred, <hi>viz.</hi> One Coach, which
he had newly caused to be made, (wherein were the
Lord <hi>Widdrington,</hi> my Lord's Brother Sir <hi>Charles
Cavendish,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loving,</hi> my Waiting-Maid, and
some others, whereof the two later were then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of <hi>England</hi>) one little Chariot, that would
onely hold my Lord and my self; and three Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
besides an indifferent number of Servants on
Horse-back.</p>
               <p>That day when we left <hi>Paris,</hi> the Creditors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take their Farwell of my Lord, expressed so
great a love and kindness for him, accompanied
vvith so many hearty Prayers and Wishes, that he
could not but prosper on his Journey.</p>
               <p>Being come into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions,
my Lord found a very Noble Reception. At <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
the Governour vvas so civil, that my Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that place somevvhat late; and vvhen it vvas
dark, he commanded some Lights and Torches to
meet my Lord, and conduct him to his Lodgings:
He offer'd my Lord the Keys of the City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47770:44"/>
him to give the Word that night, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
invited him to an Entertainment, which he had
made for him of purpose; but it being late, my
Lord (tyred with his Journey) excused himself as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
as he could; the Governour notwithstanding
being pleased to send all manner of Provisions to my
Lords Lodgings, and charging our Landlord to take
no pay for any thing we had: Which extraordinary
Civilities shewed that he was a Right Noble <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning early, my Lord went on his
Journey, and was very civilly used in every place of
His Majesty of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, where he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
At last coming to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> He took wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (which Town he chose for his
residing place, during the time of his stay in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
and sent thither to a Friend of his<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>William Throckmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Knight.</note>, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Quality, to provide him some Lodgings;
which he did, and procured them at the house of
one Mrs. <hi>Banaum,</hi> Widow to an English Merchant,
who had always been very Loyal to His Majesty the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and serviceable to His Majesties
faithful Subjects in whatsoever lay in his Power.</p>
               <p>My Lord being come to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that His Highness the Prince (now our Gracious
King) was gone to Sea: Wherefore he resolved to
follow him, and for that purpose hired a Boat, and
victual'd it; but since no body knew whither His
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47770:44"/>
Highness was gone; and I being unwilling that my
Lord should venture upon so uncertain a Voyage, and
(as the Proverb is) <hi>Seek a Needle in a Bottle of Hay,</hi>
he desisted from that design: The Lord <hi>Widdrington</hi>
nevertheless, and Sir <hi>Will. Throckmorton,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to find out the Prince, but having by a storm
been driven towards the Coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
their lives, they returned without obtaining
their aim.</p>
               <p>After some little time, my Lord having notice
that the Prince was arrived at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he went
to wait on His Highness (which he also did afterwards
at several times, so long as His Highness continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there) expecting some opportunity where he might
be able to shew his readiness to serve His King and
Countrey, as certainly there was no little hopes for
it; for first, it was believed that the English Fleet would
come and render it self into the obedience of the
Prince; next, it was reported that the Duke of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
was going out of <hi>Scotland</hi> with a great Army,
into <hi>England,</hi> to the assistance of His Majesty, and
that His Majesty had then some party at <hi>Colchester;</hi>
but it pleased God that none of these proved effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:
For the Fleet did not come in; the Duke of
<hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Army was destroyed, and <hi>Colchester</hi> was
taken by the Enemy, where my dear Brother Sir
<hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and his dear Friend Sir <hi>George Lile,</hi>
were most inhumanly murther'd and shot to death,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47770:45"/>
they being both Valiant and Heroick Persons, good
Soldiers, and most Loyal Subjects to His Majesty;
the one an excellent Commander of Horse, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Foot.</p>
               <p>My Lord having now lived in <hi>Rotterdam</hi> almost
six months, at a great charge, keeping an open and
noble Table for all comers, and being pleased espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to entertain such as were excellent Soldiers, and
noted Commanders of War, whose kindness he took
as a great Obligation, still hoping that some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would happen to invite those worthy Persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> to serve His Majesty; but seeing no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of either returning into <hi>England,</hi> or doing
His Majesty any service in that kind, he resolved to
retire to some place where he might live privately;
and having chosen the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
went to the <hi>Hague</hi> to take his leave of His
Highness the Prince, our now gracious Soveraign.
My Lord had then but a small stock of money left;
for though the then <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Hereford</hi> (after
Duke of S<hi>omerset</hi>) and his Cousin-German, once
removed, the now Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> had lent him
2000 l. between them; yet all that was spent, and
above 1000 l. more, which my Lord borrowed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time he lived in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> his Expence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the more, by reason (as I mentioned) he lived
freely and nobly.</p>
               <p>However my Lord, notwithstanding that little
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47770:45"/>
provision of Money he had, set forth from <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi>
to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where for some time he lay
in a publick Inne, until one of his Friends that
had a great love and respect for my Lord, Mr. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymion
Porter,</hi> who was Groom of the Bed-chamber
to His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First (a place not
onely honourable, but very profitable) being not
willing that a Person of such Quality as my Lord,
should lie in a publick House, profer'd him Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at the House where he was, and would not
let my Lord be at quiet, until he had accepted of
them.</p>
               <p>My Lord after he had stay'd some while there,
endeavouring to find out a House for himself which
might fit him and his small Family, (for at that
time he had put off most of his Train) and also be
for his own content, lighted on one that belonged
to the Widow of a famous Picture-drawer, <hi>Van
Ruben,</hi> which he took.</p>
               <p>About this time my Lord was much necessitated for
Money, which forced him to try several ways for to
obtain so much as would relieve his present wants. At
last Mr. <hi>Alesbury,</hi> the onely Son to Sir <hi>Th. Alesbury,</hi>
Knight and Baronet, and Brother to the now Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> a very worthy Gentleman, and
great Friend to my Lord, having some Moneys
that belonged to the now Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and
seeing my Lord in so great distress, did him the favour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47770:46"/>
to lend him 200 l. (which money my Lord since his
return hath honestly and justly repai'd) This relief
came so seasonably, that it got my Lord Credit in the
City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whereas otherwise he would have
lost himself to his great disadvantage; for my Lord
having hired the house aforementioned, and wanting
Furniture for it, was credited by the Citizens for as
many Goods as he was pleased to have, as also for Meat
and Drink, and all kind of necessaries and provisions,
which certainly was a special Blessing of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not onely a stranger in that Nation, but to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
a Ruined man.</p>
               <p>After my Lord had been in <hi>Antwerp</hi> sometime, where
he lived as retiredly as it was possible for him to do,
he gained much love and respect of all that knew or
had any business with him: At the beginning of our
coming thither, we found but few English (except
those that were Merchants) but afterwards their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
increased much, especially of Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and whereas at first there were no more but four
Coaches that went the <hi>Tour, viz.</hi> the Governors of
the Castle, my Lords, and two more, they amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the number of above a hundred, before we
went from thence; for all those that had sufficient
means, and could go to the price, kept Coaches, and
went the <hi>Tour</hi> for their own pleasure. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I cannot in duty and conscience but give this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Testimony to that place, That whereas I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47770:46"/>
that most commonly such Towns or Cities
where the Prince of that Country doth not reside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or where there is no great resort of the chief No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, are but little civilised; Certainly
the Inhabitants of the said City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> are the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilest,
and best behaved People that ever I saw; so
that my Lord lived there with as much content as a
man of his condition could do, and his chief pastime
and divertisement consisted in the Mannage of the two
afore mentioned Horses; which he had not enjoyed
long, but the <hi>Barbary</hi>-horse, for which he paid 200
Pistols in <hi>Paris,</hi> died, and soon after the Horse which
he had from the Lord <hi>Crofts;</hi> and though he wanted
present means to repair these his losses, yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and obtained so much Credit at last, that he
was able to buy two others, and by degrees so many
as amounted in all to the number of 8. In which he
took so much delight and pleasure, that though he was
then in distress for Money, yet he would sooner have
tried all other ways, then parted with any of them;
for I have hear'd him say, that good Horses are so rare,
as not to be valued for Mony, and that He who would
buy him out of his Pleasure, (meaning his Horses)
must pay dear for it. For instance I shall mention some
passages which happen'd when My Lord was in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; A stranger coming thither, and seeing my
Lords Horses, had a great mind to buy one of them,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47770:47"/>
which my Lord loved above the rest, and called him
his Favourite, a fine <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse; intreating my
Lords Escuyer to acquaint him with his desire, and
ask the price of the said Horse: My Lord, when he
heard of it, commanded his Servant, that if the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
returned, he should be brought before him; which
being done accordingly, my Lord asked him, whether
he was resolved to buy his <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse? Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
he, my Lord, and I'le give your Lordship a
good price for him. I make no doubt of it, replied My
Lord, or else you shall not have him: But you must
know, said he, that the price of that Horse is 1000 l.
today, tomorrow it will be 2000 l. next day 3000 l.
and so forth. By which the Chapman perceiving
that my Lord was unwilling to part with the said Horse
for any Money, took his leave, and so went his
ways.</p>
               <p>The next was, That the Duke <hi>de Guise,</hi> who was
also a great lover of good Horses, hearing much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of a gray leaping Horse, which my Lord
then had, told the Gentleman that praised and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him, That if my Lord was willing to sell
the said Horse, he would give 600 Pistols for him.
The Gentleman knowing my Lords humour, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again, That he was confident, my Lord would
never part with him for any mony, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
sent a Letter to my Lord from <hi>Paris;</hi> but my
Lord was so far from selling that Horse, that he was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47770:47"/>
displeased to hear that any Price should be offer'd
for him: So great a Love hath my Lord for good
Horses! And certainly I have observed, and do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe, that some of them had also a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Love to my Lord; for they seemed to rejoice
whensoever he came into the Stables, by their
trampling action, and the noise they made; nay,
they would go much better in the Mannage, when
my Lord was by, then when he was absent; and
when he rid them himself, they seemed to take much
pleasure and pride in it. But of all sorts of Horses,
my Lord loved <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses and <hi>Barbes</hi> best; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses were like Princes, and
<hi>Barbes</hi> like Gentlemen, in their kind. And this
was the chief Recreation and Pastime my Lord had
in <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now return to my former Discourse, and
the Relation of some Important Affairs and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which happen'd about this time: His Majesty
(our now Gracious King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) some
time after he was gone out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> took his Journey from thence to <hi>Breda</hi>
(if I remember well) to treat there with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had then made some offers of
Agreement: My Lord, according to his duty, went
thither to wait on His Majesty, and was there in
Council with His Majesty, His Highness the then
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> His Majesties Brother-in-law, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47770:48"/>
some other Privy-Counsellors; in which, after seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Debates concerning that Important Affair, His
Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and my Lord, agreed
in one Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That they could perceive no
other and better way at that present for His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
but to make an Agreement with His Subjects
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon any Condition, and to go into
<hi>Scotland</hi> in Person Himself, that he might but be
sure of an Army, there being no probability or
appearance then of getting an Army any where else.
Which Counsel, either out of the then alledged Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or some others best known to His Majesty,
was embraced; His Majesty agreeing with the <hi>Scots</hi>
so far, (notwithstanding they were so unreasonable
in their Treaty, that His Majesty had hardly Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to hear them) that he resolved to go into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in Person; and though my Lord had an earnest
desire to wait on His Majesty thither, yet the <hi>Scots</hi>
would not suffer him to come, or be in any part of
that Kingdom: Wherefore out of his Loyalty and
Duty, he gave His Majesty the best advice he could,
<hi>viz.</hi> that he conceived it most safe for His Majesty
to adhere to the Earl of <hi>Argyle's Party,</hi> which he
supposed to be the strongest; but especially, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<hi>Hamilton</hi>'s and <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Party, and compose the
differences between them; for then His Majesty would
be sure of Two Parties, whereas otherwise He would
leave an Enemy behind Him, which might cause
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47770:48"/>
His overthrow, and endanger His Majesties Person;
and if His Majesty could but get the Power into his
own hands, he might do hereafter what he pleased.</p>
               <p>His Majesty being arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordered his
affairs so wisely, that soon after he got an Army to
march with him into <hi>England;</hi> but whether they were
all Loyal, is not for me to dispute: However <hi>Argyle</hi>
was discontented, as it appear'd by two complaining
Letters he sent to my Lord, which my Lord gave His
Majesty notice of; so that onely the Duke of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
went with His Majesty, who fought and died like
a Valiant Man, and a Loyal subject. In this fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> His Majesty expressed an
extraordinary Courage; and though his Army was
in a manner destroyed, yet the Glory of an Heroick
Prince remained with our gracious Soveraign.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, whilest His Majesty was yet in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and before he marched with His Army into
<hi>England,</hi> it happen'd that the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
and Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> upon some differences, having
raised Forces against each other, but afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a Peace between them, were pleased to profer
those Forces to my Lord for His Majesties use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which (as the Lord Chancellour, who was then
in <hi>France,</hi> sent word to my Lord) was the onely
Foreign profer that had been made to his Majesty. My
Lord immediately gave His Majesty notice of it; but
whether it was for want of convenient Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47770:49"/>
or Mony, or that the <hi>Scots</hi> did not like the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that profer was not accepted.</p>
               <p>Concerning the affairs and intrigues that pass'd in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> during the time of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
stay there, I am ignorant of them; neither doth
it belong to me now to write, or give an account of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing else but what concerns the History of my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Lord and Husbands Life, and his own Actions;
who so soon as he had Intelligence that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which went with His Majesty into <hi>England,</hi> was
defeated, and that no body knew what was become
of His Majesty, fell into so violent a Passion, that I
verily believed it would have endanger'd his life; but
when afterwards the happy news came of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
safe arrival in <hi>France,</hi> never any Subject could
rejoice more then my Lord did.</p>
               <p>About this time it chanced, that my Lords Brother
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> and my self, took a journey into
<hi>England,</hi> occasioned both by my Lord's extream want
and necessity, and his Bothers Estate; which having
been under Sequestration from the time (or soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
he went out of <hi>England,</hi> was then, in case he did
not return and compound for it, to be sold out-right;
Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was unwilling to receive his Estate upon
such conditions, and would rather have lost it, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for it: But my Lord considering it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to recover something, then lose all, intreated the
Lord Chancellour, who was then in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47770:49"/>
his Brother to a composition, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
did very effectually, and proved himself a Noble
and true Friend in it. We had so small a Provision
of money when we set forth our Journey for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that it was hardly able to carry us to <hi>London,</hi>
but were forced to stay at <hi>Southwark;</hi> where Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> sent into <hi>London</hi> for one that had formerly
been his Steward; and having declared to him his
wants and necessities, desir'd him to try his Credit.
He seemed ready to do his Master what service he could
in that kind; but pretending withall, that his Credit
was but small, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> gave him his Watch to
pawn, and with that money paid those small scores
we had made in our Lodging there. From thence we
went to some other Lodgings that were prepared for
us in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> and having rested our selves
some time, I desired my Brother the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> to
claim, in my behalf, some subsistance for my self out
of my Lords Estate, (for it was declared by the
Parliament, That the Lands of those that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
should be sold to any that would buy them,
onely their Wives and Children were allowed to put
in their Claims:) But he received this Answer, That
I could not expect the least allowance, by reason
my Lord and Husband had been the greatest Traitor
of <hi>England</hi> (that is to say, the honestest man, because
he had been most against them.)</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Charles</hi> intrusted some persons to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47770:50"/>
for his Estate; but it being a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they agreed in their Composition, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Rents could be received, we having in the
mean time nothing to live on, must of necessity have
been starved, had not Sir <hi>Charles</hi> got some Credit
of several Persons, and that not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
for all those that had Estates, were afraid to
come near him, much less to assist him, until he was
sure of his own Estate. So much is Misery and Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shun'd!</p>
               <p>But though our Condition was hard, yet my dear
Lord and Husband, whom we left in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> was
then in a far greater distress then our selves; for at
our departure he had nothing but what his Credit
was able to procure him; and having run upon the
score so long without paying any the least part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
his Creditors began to grow impatient, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to trust him no longer: Wherefore he sent
me word, That if his Brother did not presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, he was forced to starve. Which doleful
news caused great sadness and melancholy in us both,
and withal made his Brother try his utmost endeavour
to procure what moneys he could for his subsistance,
who at last got 200 l. <hi>sterl.</hi> upon Credit, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made over to my Lord.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, before the said money could
come to his hands, my Lord had been forced to send
for all his Creditors, and declare to them his great wants
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47770:50"/>
and necessities; where his Speech was so effectual, and
made such an impression in them, that they had all
a deep sense of my Lords Misfortunes; and instead
of urging the payment of his Debts, promised him,
That he should not want any thing in whatsoever
they were able to assist him; which they also very
nobly and civilly performed, furnishing him with all
manner of provisions and necessaries for his further
subsistance; so that my Lord was then in a much
better condition amongst strangers, then we in our
Native Countrey.</p>
               <p>At last when Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi> had compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Estate, and agreed to pay 4500 l. for
it, the Parliament caused it again to be survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made him pay 500 l. more, which was
more then many others had paid for much greater
Estates; so that Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to pay this Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and discharge some Debts, was necessitated to
sell some Land of his at an under-rate. My Lords
two Sons (who were also in <hi>England</hi> at that time)
were no less in want and necessity, then we, having
nothing but bare Credit to live on; and my Lords
Estate being then to be sold outright, Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> his
Brother, endeavoured, if possible, to save the two
chief Houses, <hi>viz. Welbeck</hi> and <hi>Bolsover,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
rather to part with some more of his Land,
which he had lately compounded for, then to let
them fall into the Enemies hands; but before such
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47770:51"/>
time as he could compass the money, some body had
bought <hi>Bolsover,</hi> with an intention to pull it down,
and make money of the Materials; of whom Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> was forced to buy it again at a far greater Rate
then he might have had it at first, notwithstanding
a great part of it was pulled down already; and
though my Lords eldest Son <hi>Charles</hi> Lord-<hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
had those mentioned Houses some time in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
after the death of his Uncle; yet for want
of Means he was not able to repair them.</p>
               <p>I having now been in <hi>England</hi> a year and a half,
some Intelligence which I received of my Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not very well, and the small hopes I had of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some relief out of his Estate, put me upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of returning to <hi>Antwerp</hi> to my Lord; and Sir
<hi>Charles,</hi> his Brother, took the same resolution, but
was prevented by an Ague that seized upon him.
Not long had I been with my Lord, but we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the sad news of his Brothers death, which was an
extream affliction both to my Lord, and my self,
for they loved each other entirely: In truth, He was a
Person of so great worth, such extraordinary civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so obliging a Nature, so full of Generosity,
Justice and Charity, besides all manner of Learning,
especially in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> that not onely his
Friends, but even his Enemies, did much lament his
loss.</p>
               <p>After my return out of <hi>England,</hi> to my Lord, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47770:51"/>
Creditors supposing I had brought great store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
along with me, came all to my Lord to soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the payment of their Debts; but when my Lord
had informed them of the truth of the business, and
desired their patience somewhat longer, with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that so soon as he received any money, he
would honestly and justly satisfie them, they were
not onely willing to forbear the payment of those
Debts he had contracted hitherto, but to credit him
for the future, and supply him with such Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as he should desire of them. And this was the
onely happiness which my Lord had in his distressed
condition, and the chief blessing of the Eternal and
Merciful God, in whose Power are all things, who
ruled the hearts and minds of men, and filled them
with Charity and Compassion; for certainly it was
a work of Divine Providence, that they shewed so
much love, respect and honour to my Lord, a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to their Nation; and notwithstanding his ruined
Condition, and the small appearance of recovering
his own, credited him wheresoever he lived, both in
<hi>France, Holland, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my Lord was banished his Native Countrey,
and dispossessed from his own Estate, could neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
live in so much Splendor and Grandure as he
did.</p>
               <p>In this Condition (and how little soever the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
was) my Lord was never without hopes of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47770:52"/>
seeing yet (before his death) a happy issue of all his
misfortunes and sufferings, especially of the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of His most Gracious King and Master, to
His Throne and Kingly Rights, whereof he always
had assured Hopes, well knowing, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the Kingdom to subsist long under so
many changes of Government; and whensoever I
expressed how little faith I had in it, he would gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprove me, saying, I believ'd least, what I desir'd
most; and could never be happy if I endeavour'd
to exclude all hopes, and entertain'd nothing but
doubts and fears.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in which we lived, being
a place of great resort for Strangers and Travellers,
His Majesty (our now gracious King, <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second) passed thorough it, when he went his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards <hi>Germany;</hi> and after my Lord had done
his humble duty, and waited on His Majesty, He
was pleased to Honour him with His Presence
at his House. The same did almost all strangers that
were Persons of Quality; if they made any stay in the
Town, they would come and visit my Lord, and
see the Mannage of his Horses: And, amongst
the rest, the Duke of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and the Prince of
<hi>East-Friesland,</hi> did my Lord the Honour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with Horses of their own breed.</p>
               <p>One time it happen'd, that His Highness <hi>Dom Iohn d'
Austria</hi> (who was then Governour of those Provinces)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47770:52"/>
came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and stayed there some few days; and
then almost all his Court waited on my Lord, so that
one day I reckoned about seventeen Coaches, in
which were all Persons of Quality, who came in
the morning of purpose to see my Lord's Mannage;
My Lord receiving so great an honour thought
it sit to shew his respect and civility to them, and
to ride some of his Horses himself, which otherwise
he never did but for his own excercise and delight. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest of those great and noble Persons, there
were two of our Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the then Marquess, now
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bristol;</hi> but <hi>Dom
Iohn</hi> was not there in Person, excusing himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to my Lord (when my Lord waited on him)
that the multiplicity of his weighty affairs had hindred
his coming thither, which my Lord accounted as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high honour and favour from so great a Prince; and
conceiving it his duty to wait on his Highness, but
being unknown to him, the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> who had
acquaintance with him, did my Lord the favour, and
upon his request, presented him to his Highness; which
favour of the said Earl my Lord highly resented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dom `Iohn</hi> received my Lord with all kindness and
respect; for although there were many great and noble
Persons that waited on him in an out room, yet so
soon as his Highness heard of my Lord's, and the Earl
of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s being there, he was pleased to admit them
before all the rest. My Lord, after he had passed his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47770:53"/>
Complements, told His Highness, That he found
himself bound in all duty, to make his humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
for the Favour he received from His
Catholick Majesty, for permitting and suffering him
(a banished man) to live in His Dominions, and
under the Government of His Highness; whereupon
<hi>Dom Iohn</hi> ask'd my Lord whether he wanted any
thing, and whether he liv'd peaceably without any
molestation or disturbance? My Lord answer'd,
That he lived as much to his own content, as a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
man could do; and received more respect and
civility from that City, then he could have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for which he returned his most humble thanks to
his Catholick Majesty, and His Highness. After some
short Discourse, my Lord took his leave of <hi>Dom
Iohn;</hi> Several of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advising him to go
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and assuring him of His Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Kindness and Favour; but my Lord being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and besides, in years,
and wanting means for so long and chargeable a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
was not able to embrace their motions; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was so well pleased with the great Civilities he
received from that City, that then he was resolved
to chuse no other residing place all the time of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but that; he being not onely credited
there for all manner of Provisions and Necessaries
for his subsistance, but also free both from ordinary
and extraordinary Taxes, and from paying Excise,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47770:53"/>
which was a great favour and obligation to my Lord.</p>
               <p>After His Highness <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> had left the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of those Provinces, the Marquess of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racena</hi>
succeeded in his place, who having a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see my Lord ride in the Mannage, entreated
a Gentleman of the City, that was acquainted with
my Lord, to beg that favour of him. My Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not been at that Exercise six weeks, or two
months, by reason of some sickness that made him
unfit for it, civilly begg'd his excuse; but he was so
much importuned by the said Gentleman, that at
last he granted his Request, and rid one or two
Horses in presence of the said Marquess of <hi>Carace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and the then Marquess, now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
who often used to honour my Lord with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
The said Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> seem'd to take
much pleasure and satisfaction in it, and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
my Lord; and certainly I have observed,
That Noble and Meritorious persons take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in honouring each other.</p>
               <p>But not onely strangers, but His Majesty Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(our now Gracious Soveraign) was pleased to
see my Lord ride, and one time did ride Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
He being an Excellent Master of that Art,
and instructed by my Lord, who had the Honour
to set Him first on a Horse of Mannage, when he
was His Governour; where His Majesties Capacity
was such, that being but Ten years of Age, he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47770:54"/>
would ride leaping Horses, and such as would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
others, and mannage them with the greatest
Skill and Dexterity, to the admiration of all that
beheld Him.</p>
               <p>Nor was this the onely Honour my Lord received
from His Majesty, but His Majesty and all the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Race; that is to say, Her Highness the then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
Royal, His Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> with
His Brother the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> (except
the Princesse <hi>Henrietta,</hi> now Duchess of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>)
being met one time in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> were pleased
to honour my Lord with their Presence, and accept
of a small Entertainment at his House, such as his
present Condition was able to afford them. And some
other time His Majesty passing through the City, was
pleased to accept of a private Dinner at my Lord's
House; after which I receiving that gracious Favour
from His Majesty, that he was pleased to see me, he
did merrily, and in jest, tell me, <hi>That he perceived
my Lord's Credit could procure better Meat then His own;</hi>
Again, some other time, upon a merry Challenge play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Game at Butts with my Lord, (when my Lord
had the better of Him) <hi>What</hi> (said He) <hi>my Lord,
have you invited me, to play the Rook with me?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their Stakes were not at all considerable, but
onely for Pastime.</p>
               <p>These passages I mention onely to declare my Lord's
happiness in his miseries, which he received by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47770:54"/>
and kindness not onely of foreign Princes, but
of his own Master, and Gracious Soveraign: I will not
speak now of the good esteem and repute he had by
his late Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
the now Queen-Mother, who always held and
found him a very loyal and faithful Subject, although
Fortune was pleased to oppose him in the height of his
endeavours; for his onely and chief intention was to
hinder His Majesties Enemies from executing that
cruel design which they had upon their gracious and
merciful King; In which he tried his uttermost power,
in so much, that I have heard him say out of a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Zeal and Loyalty, That he would willingly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
himself, and all his Posterity, for the sake of his
Majesty, and the Royal Race. Nor did he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
either at his losses or sufferings, but rejoyced rather
that he was able to suffer for His King and Countrey.
His Army was the onely Army that was able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
His Majesties Power; which so long as it was
Victorious, it preserved both His Majesties Person and
Crown; but so soon as it fell, that fell too: and my
Lord was then in a manner forced to seek his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in foreign Countries, where God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make strangers his Friends, who received and
protected him when he was banished his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and relieved him when his own Country-men
sought to starve him, by withholding from him what
was justly his own, onely for his Honesty and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47770:55"/>
which relief he received more from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of those parts where he lived, then from Princes,
he being unwilling to trouble any foreign Prince with
his wants and miseries, well knowing, that Gifts of
Great Princes come slowly, and not without much
difficulty; neither loves he to petition any one but His
own Soveraign.</p>
               <p>But though my Lord by the civility of Strangers,
and the assistance of some few Friends of his native
Country, lived in an indifferent Condition, yet (as it
hath been declared heretofore) he was put to great
plunges and difficulties, in so much that his dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi> would often say, That though
he could not truly complain of want, yet his meat never
did him good, by reason my Lord, his Brother, was
always so near wanting, that he was never sure after
one meal to have another: And though I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of starving or begging, yet my chief fear was,
that my Lord for his debts would suffer Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where sadness of Mind, and want of Exercise,
and Air, would have wrought his destruction, which
yet by the Mercy of God he happily avoided.</p>
               <p>Some time before the Restauration of His Majesty
to his Royal Throne, my Lord, partly with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Brothers Estate, which was but little,
it being wasted by selling of Land for compounding
with the Parliament, paying of several debts, and
buying out the two Houses aforementioned, <hi>viz. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:47770:55"/>
and <hi>Bolsover;</hi> and the Credit which his Sons had
got, which amounted in all to 2400 l. a year, sprinkled
something amongst his Creditors, and borrowed so
much of Mr. <hi>Top</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (though without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
that he could pay such scores as were most pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing,
contracted from the poorer sort of Trades-men,
and send ready mony to Market, to avoid cozenage (for
small scores run up most unreasonably, especially if
no strict accounts be kept, and the rate be left to the
Creditors pleasure) by which means there was in a
short time so much saved, as it could not have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>About this time, a report came of a great number
of Sectaries, and of several disturbances in <hi>England,</hi>
which heightned my Lord's former hopes into a firm
belief of a sudden Change in that Kingdom, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Restauration of His Majesty, which it also pleased
God to send according to his expectation; for His
Majesty was invited by his Subjects, who were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
longer to endure those great confusions and encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
they had sustained hitherto, to take possession
of His Hereditary Rights, aud the power of all his
Dominions: And being then at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
to take shipping in those parts for <hi>England,</hi> my Lord
went thither to wait on his Majesty, who used my
Lord very Graciously; and his Highness the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> was pleased to offer him one of those Ships that
were ordered to transport His Majesty; for which he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47770:56"/>
returned his most humble thanks to his Highness,
and begg'd leave of His Highness that he might
hire a Vessel for himself and his Company.</p>
               <p>In the mean time whilst my Lord was at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> His Majesty was pleased to tell him, That
General <hi>Monk,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> had
desired the Place of being Master of the Horse:
To which my Lord answer'd, That that gallant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was worthy of any Favour that His Majesty
could confer upon him: And having taken his leave
of His Majesty, and His Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
went towards the Ship that was to transport him
for <hi>England,</hi> (I might better call it a Boat, then a
Ship; for those that were intrusted by my Lord to
hire a Ship for that purpose, had hired an old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Fregat, that was lost the next Voyage after; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that when some of the Company that had
promised to go over with my Lord, saw it, they
turn'd back, and would not endanger their lives in
it, except the Lord <hi>Widdrington,</hi> who was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to forsake my Lord.)</p>
               <p>My Lord (who was so transported with the joy
of returning into his Native Countrey, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not the Vessel) having set Sail from <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
was so becalmed, that he was six dayes and
six nights upon the Water, during which time he
pleased himself with mirth, and pass'd his time away
as well as he could; Provisions he wanted not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47770:56"/>
them in great store and plenty. At last being
come so far that he was able to discern the smoak of
<hi>London,</hi> which he had not seen in a long time, he
merrily was pleased to desire one that was near him,
to jogg and awake him out of his dream, for sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
said he, I have been sixteen years asleep, and am
not throughly awake yet. My Lord lay that night at
<hi>Greenwich,</hi> where his Supper seem'd more savoury
to him, then any meat he had hitherto tasted; and
the noise of some scraping Fidlers, he thought the
pleasantest harmony that ever he had heard.</p>
               <p>In the mean time my Lords Son, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord
<hi>Mansfield,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Ogle,</hi> was gone to <hi>Dover</hi>
with intention to wait on His Majesty, and receive
my Lord, his Father, with all joy and duty, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had been with His Majesty; but when he
miss'd of his design, he was very much troubled,
and more, when His Majesty was pleas'd to tell him,
That my Lord had set to Sea, before His Majesty
Himself was gone out of <hi>Holland,</hi> fearing my Lord
had met with some Misfortune in his Journey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had not heard of his Landing. Wherefore
he immediately parted from <hi>Dover,</hi> to seek my Lord,
whom at last he found at <hi>Greenwich;</hi> with what joy
they embraced and saluted each other, my Pen is too
weak to express.</p>
               <p>But all this while, and after my Lord was gone
from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I was left alone there with some of my
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47770:57"/>
servants; for my Lord being in <hi>Holland</hi> with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
declared in a Letter to me his intention of going
for <hi>England,</hi> withal commanding me to stay in that
City, as a Pawn for his debts, until he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
money to discharge them; and to excuse him to
the Magistrates of the said City for not taking his leave
of them, and paying his due thanks for their great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
which he desired me to do in his behalf. And
certainly my Lords affection to me was such, that it
made him very industrious in providing those means;
for it being uncertain what or whether he should have
any thing of his Estate, made it a difficult business for
him to borrow Mony; At last he received some of
one Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> now Sir <hi>Ioseph Ash,</hi> a Merchant of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> which he returned to me; but what with
the expence I had made in the mean while, and what
was required for my transporting into <hi>England,</hi> besides
the debts formerly contracted, the said money fell too
short by 400 l. and although I could have upon my
own word taken up much more, yet I was unwilling to
leave an engagement amongst strangers: Wherefore I
sent for one Mr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> now Sir <hi>Iohn Shaw,</hi> a near kinds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the said Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> intreating him to lend me
400 l. which he did most readily, and so discharged
my debts.</p>
               <p>My departure being now divulged in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the
Magistrates of the City came to take their leaves of me,
where I desired one Mr. <hi>Duart</hi> a very worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47770:57"/>
and one of the chief of the City, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
his Race from the <hi>Portuguez</hi> (to whom and his
Sisters, all very skilful in the Art of Musick, though
for their own pastime and Recreation, both my Lord
and my self were much bound for their great civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities)
to be my Interpreter. They were pleased to
express that they were sorry for our departure out of
their City, but withal rejoyced at our happy return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into our Native Country, and wished me soon
and well to the place where I most desired to be:
Whereupon I having excused my Lord's hasty going
away without taking his leave of them, returned them
mine and my Lord's hearty Thanks for their great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
declaring how sorry I was that it lay not in
my power to make an acknowledgment answerable to
them. But after their departure from me, they were
pleased to send their Under-Officers (as the custom
there is) with a Present of Wine, which I received
with all respect and thankfulness.</p>
               <p>I being thus prepar'd for my Voyage, went with
my Servants to <hi>Flussing,</hi> and finding no <hi>English</hi> Man of
War there, being loth to trust my self with a less Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
was at last informed that a <hi>Dutch</hi> man of War lay
there ready to Convoy some Merchants; I forthwith
sent for the Captain thereof, whose name was <hi>Bankert,</hi>
and asked him whether it was possible to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of having the use of his Ship to transport me into
<hi>England?</hi> To vvhich he ansvvered, That he question'd
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47770:58"/>
not but I might; for the Merchants which he was to
convey, were not ready yet, desiring me to send
one of my servants to the State, to request that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of them; with whom he would go himself,
and assist him the best he could; which he also did.
My suit being granted, my self and my chief ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
embarqued in the said Ship; the rest, together
with the Goods, being conveyed in another good
strong Vessel, hired for that purpose.</p>
               <p>After I was safely arrived at <hi>London,</hi> I found my
Lord in Lodgings; I cannot call them unhandsome;
but yet they were not fit for a Person of his Rank
and Quality, nor of the capacity to contain all his
Family: Neither did I find my Lord's Condition
such as I expected: Wherefore out of some passion
I desir'd him to leave the Town, and retire into the
Countrey; but my Lord gently reproved me for my
rashness and impatience, and soon after removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Dorset</hi>-house; which, though it was better then
the former, yet not altogether to my satisfaction, we
having but a part of the said House in possession. By
this removal I judged my Lord would not hastily
depart from <hi>London;</hi> but not long after, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to tell me, That he had dispatched his business,
and was now resolved to remove into the Country,
having already given order for Waggons to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
our goods, which was no unpleasant news to
me, who had a great desire for a Countrey-life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:47770:58"/>My Lord before he began his Journey, went to
his Gracious Soveraign, and begg'd leave that he
might retire into the Countrey, to reduce and
settle, if possible, his confused, entangled, and
almost ruined Estate. <hi>Sir,</hi> said he to His Majesty,
<hi>I am not ignorant, that many believe I am discontented;
and 'tis probable they'l say, I retire through discontent:
But I take God to witness, That I am in no kind or ways
displeas'd; for I am so joyed at your Majesties happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
that I cannot be sad or troubled for any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to my own particular; but whatsoever Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
is pleased to command me, were it to sacrifice my Life,
I shall most obediently perform it; for I have no other
Will, but Your Majesties Pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he kissed His Majesty's hand, and went the
next day into <hi>Nottingham-shire,</hi> to his Mannor-house
call'd <hi>Welbeck;</hi> but when he came there, and began
to examine his Estate, and how it had been order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the time of his Banishment, he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had left' any thing of it for himself, or not,
till by his prudence and wisdom he inform'd himself
the best he could, examining those that had most
knowledg therein. Some Lands, he found, could be
recover'd no further then for his life, and some not
at all: Some had been in the Rebels hands, which
he could not recover, but by His Highness the Duke
of <hi>York</hi>'s favour, to whom His Majesty had given all
the Estates of those that were condemned and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47770:59"/>
for murdering his Royal Father of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which by the Law were forfeited to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
whereof His Highness graciously restor'd my
Lord so much of the Land that formerly had been
his, as amounted to 730 l. a year. And though my
Lord's Children had their Claims granted, and bought
out the Life of my Lord, their Father, which came
near upon the third part, yet my Lord received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for himself out of his own Estate, for the space
of eighteen years, viz. During the time from the first
entring into Warr, which was <hi>Iune</hi> 11. 1642, till
his return out of Banishment, <hi>May</hi> 28. 1660; for
though his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Ogle,</hi> and his
eldest Daughter, the now Lady <hi>Cheiny,</hi> did all what
lay in their power to relieve my Lord their Father,
and sent him some supplies of moneys at several
times when he was in banishment; yet that was of
their own, rather then out of my Lord's Estate; for
the Lady <hi>Chieny</hi> sold some few Jewels which my Lord,
her Father, had left her, and some Chamber-Plate
which she had from her Grandmother, and sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the money to my Lord, besides 1000 l. of her
Portion: And the now Earl of <hi>Ogle</hi> did at several
times supply my Lord, his Father, with such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
as he had partly obtained upon Credit, and
partly made by his Marriage.</p>
               <p>After my Lord had begun to view those Ruines
that were nearest, and tried the Law to keep or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47770:59"/>
what formerly was his, (which certainly shew'd
no favour to him, besides that the Act of Oblivion
proved a great hinderance and obstruction to those his
designs, as it did no less to all the Royal Party) and
had setled so much of his Estate as possibly he could,
he cast up the Summ of his Debts, and set out several
parts of Land sor the payment of them, or of some of
them (for some of his Lands could not be easily
sold, being entailed) and some he sold in <hi>Derbyshire</hi>
to buy the Castle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which although it is
quite ruined and demolisht, yet, it being a seat which
had pleased his Father very much, he would not leave
it since it was offer'd to be sold.</p>
               <p>His two Houses <hi>Welbeck</hi> and <hi>Bolsover</hi> he found
much out of repair, and this later half pull'd down,
no furniture or any necessary Goods were left in them,
but some few Hangings and Pictures, which had been
saved by the care and industry of his Eldest Daughter
the Lady <hi>Cheiny,</hi> and were bought over again after
the death of his eldest Son <hi>Charles,</hi> Lord <hi>Mansfield;</hi>
for they being given to him, and he leaving some debts
to be paid after his death, My Lord sent to his other
Son <hi>Henry,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Ogle,</hi> to endeavour for so
much Credit, that the said Hangings and Pictures
(which my Lord esteemed very much, the Pictures
being drawn by <hi>Van Dyke</hi>) might be saved; which he
also did, and My Lord hath paid the debt since his
return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47770:60"/>Of eight Parks, which my Lord had before the
Wars, there was but one left that was not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
<hi>viz. Welbeck</hi>-Park of about four miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass;
for my Lord's Brother Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi>
who bought out the life of my Lord in that Lordship,
saved most part of it from being cut down; and in
<hi>Blore</hi>-Park there were some few Deer left: The rest of the
Parks were totally defaced and destroyed, both Wood,
Pales and Deer; amongst which was also <hi>Clipston</hi>-Park
of seven miles compass, wherein my Lord had
taken much delight formerly, it being rich of Wood,
and containing the greatest and tallest Timber-trees of
all the Woods he had; in so much, that onely the
Pale-row was valued at 2000 l. It was water'd by a
pleasant River that runs through it, full of Fish and
Otters; was well stock'd with Deer, full of Hares,
and had great store of Partriges, Poots, Pheasants, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
besides all sorts of Water-fowl; so that this Park af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
all manner of sports, for Hunting, Hawking,
Coursing, Fishing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which my Lord esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it very much: And although his Patience and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is such, that I never perceived him sad or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
for his own Losses and Misfortunes, yet when
he beheld the ruines of that Park, I observed him
troubled, though he did little express it, onely saying,
he had been in hopes it would not have been so much
defaced as he found it, there being not one Timber-tree
in it left for shelter. However he patiently bore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47770:60"/>
what could not be helped, and gave present order for
the cutting down of some Wood that was left him in
a place near adjoining, to repale it, and got from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Friends Deer to stock it.</p>
               <p>Thus though his Law-suits and other unavoidable
expences were very chargeable to him, yet he order'd
his affairs so prudently, that by degrees he stock'd and
manur'd those Lands he keeps for his own use, and in
part repaired his Mannor-houses, <hi>Welbeck,</hi> and <hi>Bolso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
to which later he made some additional building;
and though he has not yet built the Seat at <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
yet he hath stock'd and paled a little Park belonging
to it.</p>
               <p>Nor is it possible for him to repair all the ruines of
the Estate that is left him, in so short a time, they being
so great, and his losses so considerable, that I cannot
without grief and trouble remember them; for before
the Wars my Lord had as great an Estate as any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the Kingdom, descended upon him most by
Women, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Grandmother of his Father's
side, his own Mother, and his first Wife.</p>
               <p>What Estate his Grandfather left to his Father
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> I know not; nor can I exactly
tell what he had from his Grandmother, but she was
very rich; for her third Husband Sir <hi>Will.</hi> Saint
<hi>Loo,</hi> gave her a good Estate in the West, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
descended upon my Lord, my Lord's Mother
being the younger daughter of the Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> and sole
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47770:61"/>
Heir, after the death of her eldest Sister <hi>Iane,</hi> Countess
of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> whom King <hi>Charles</hi> the First restored
to her Fathers Dignity, <hi>viz.</hi> Baroness of <hi>Ogle:</hi> This
Title descended upon my Lord and his Heirs General,
together with 3000 l. a year in <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and
besides the Estate left to my Lord, she gave him
20000 l. in Money, and kept him and his Family at
her own charge for several years.</p>
               <p>My Lord's first Wife, who was Daughter and Heir
to <hi>William Basset</hi> of <hi>Blore</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>, Widow to <hi>Henry
Howard,</hi> younger Son to <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
brought my Lord 2400 l. a Year Inheritance, between
six and seven thousand Pounds in Money, and a join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for her life of 800 l. a Year. Besides my Lord
increased his own Estate before the Wars, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 100000 l. and had increased it more, had not
the unhappy Wars prevented him; for though he had
some disadvantages in his Estate, even before the
Wars, yet they are not considerable to those he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
afterwards for the service of his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
For example, His Father Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi>
had lent his Brother in Law <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
16000 l. for which, although afterward before
his death he setled 2000 l. a year upon him; yet he
having injoyed the said Money for many years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paying any use for it, it might have been improved
to my Lord's better advantage, had it been in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
own hands, he being a Person of great prudence
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47770:61"/>
in managing his Estate; and though the said Earl
of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> made my Lord his Executor, yet my
Lord was so far from making any advantage by
that Trust, even in what the Law allowed him, that
he lost 17000 l. by it; and afterwards delivered
up his Trust to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who both married two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the said Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> And since his
return into <hi>England,</hi> upon the desire of <hi>Henry How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
Second Son to the late Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and
Heir apparent, (by reason of his Eldest Brother's
Distemper) he resigned his Trust and Interest to him,
which certainly is a very difficult business, and yet
questionable whether it may lawfully be done, or
not? But such was my Lord's Love to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Shrewsburies,</hi> that he would rather wrong
himself, then it.</p>
               <p>To mention some lawful advantages which my
Lord might have made by the said Trust, it may be
noted in the first place, That the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s
Estate was Let in long Leases, which, by the Law,
fell to the Executor. Next, that after some Debts
and Legacies were paid out of those Lands, which
were set out for that purpose, they were setled so, that
they fell to my Lord. Thirdly, Seven hundred pounds
a year was left as a Gift to my Lord's Brother, Sir
<hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> in case the Countess of <hi>Kent,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Daughter to the said Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> had no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47770:62"/>
Children. But my Lord never made any advantage
for himself, of all these; neither was he inquisitive whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the said Countess of <hi>Kent</hi> cut off the Entail of that
Land, although she never had a Child; for my Lord's
Nature is so generous, that he hates to be Mercenary,
and never minds his own Profit or Interest in any Trust
or Employment, more then the good and benefit of
him that intrusts or employs him.</p>
               <p>But, as I said heretofore, these are but petty Losses in
comparison of those he sustained by the late Civil
Warrs, whereof I shall partly give you an account: I
say partly; for though it may be computed what the
loss of the Annual Rents of his Lands amounts to,
of which he never received the least worth for himself
and his own profit, during the time both of his being
employed in the Service of Warr, and his Sufferings in
Banishment; as also the loss of those Lands that are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from him, both in present possession, and in
reversion; and of his Parks and Woods that were cut
down; yet it is impossible to render an exact account
of his Personal Estate.</p>
               <p>As for his Rents during the time he acted in the
Warrs, though he suffer'd others to gather theirs
for their own use, yet his own either went for the use
of the Army, or fell into the hands of the Enemy,
or were suppress'd and with-held from him by the
Cozenage of his Tenants and Officers, my Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then not able to look after them himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:47770:62"/>About the time when His late Majesty undertook
the expedition into <hi>Scotland</hi> for the suppressing of some
insurrection that happened there; My Lord, as afore
is mentioned, amongst the rest, lent His Majesty
10000 l. <hi>sterling;</hi> But having newly married a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the then Lord <hi>Brackly,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi>
whose portion was 12000 l. the moiety whereof was
paid in Gold on the day of her marriage, and the rest
soon after (although she was too young to be bedded.)
This, together with some other expences, caused him to
take up the said 10000 l. at Interest, the Use whereof
he paid many years after.</p>
               <p>Also when after his sixteen years Banishment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>England,</hi> before he knew what Estate was
left him, and was able to receive any Rents of his own,
he was necessitated to take 5000 l. upon Use for the
maintenance of himself and his Family; whereof the
now Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> his Cousin German, once
removed, lent him 1000 l. for which and the former
1000 l. mentioned heretofore, he never desired nor
received any Use from my Lord, which I mention, to
declare the favour and bounty of that Noble Lord.</p>
               <p>But though it is impossible to render an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all the losses which My Lord has sustained
by the said Wars, yet as far as they are accountable, I
shall endeavour to represent them in these following
Particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47770:63"/>In the first place, I shall give you a just particular of
My Lords Estate in Lands, as it was before the Wars,
partly according to the value of his own Surveighers,
and partly according to the rate it is let, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>Next, I shall accompt the Woods cut down by the
Rebellious Party, in several places of My Lords E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shall compute the Value of those Lands
which My Lord hath lost, both in present possession,
and in reversion; that is to say, those which he has lost
altogether, both for himself, and his Posterity; and
those he has recovered onely during the time of his life,
and which his onely Son and Heir, the now Earl of
<hi>Ogle,</hi> must lose after his Fathers decease.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I shall make mention, how much of
Land my Lord hath been forced to sell for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some of his Debts, contracted during the
time of the late Civil Wars, and when his Estate was
sequestred; I say some, for there are a great many to
pay yet.</p>
               <p>To which I shall, Fifthly, add the Composition of
his Brothers Estate; and the loss of it for Eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47770:63"/>
A Particular of My Lords Estate in plain Rents,
as it was partly surveighed in the Year 1641,
and partly is let at this present.

               <p>That this Particular of My Lords Estate was no
less then is mentioned, may partly appear by the rate, as
it was surveighed, and sold by the Rebellious Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for they raised, towards the later end of their
power, which was in the year 1652, out of my Lords
Estate, the summe of 111593 l. 10s. 11d. at five
years and a half Purchase, which was at above the rate
of 18000 l. a year, besides Woods; and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47770:64"/>
Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi>'s Estate, which Estate was
2000 l. a year, which falls not much short of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
account; and certainly, had they not sold such
Lands at easie rates, few would have bought them, by
reason the Purchasers were uncertain how long they
should enjoy their purchase: Besides, Under-Officers
do not usually refuse Bribes; and it is well known
that the Surveighers did under-rate Estates according as
they were feed by the Purchasers.</p>
               <p>Again, many of the Estates of banished Persons
were given to Soldiers for the payment of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears,
who again sold them to others which would
buy them at easier rates. But chiefly, it appears by
the rate as my Lords Estate is let at present, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several of the mentioned Lands that are let at a
higher rate now then they were surveighed; nor are
they all valued in the mentioned particular according
to the surveigh, but many of them which were not
surveighed, are accounted according to the rate they are
let at this present.</p>
               <p>The Loss of my Lords Estate, in plain Rents, as
also upon ordinary Use, and Use upon Use, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
               <p>The Annual Rent of My Lords Lands, <hi>viz.</hi>
22393 l. 10 s. 1 d. being lost for the space of 18
years, which was the time of his acting in the Wars,
and of his Banishment, without any benefit to him,
reckoned without any Interest, amounts to 403083 l.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47770:65"/>
But being accounted with the ordinary Use at Six in
the Hundred, and Use upon Use for the mentioned
space of 18 Years, it amounts to 733579 l.</p>
               <p>But some perhaps will say, That if My Lord had
enjoyed his Estate, he would have spent it, at least
so much as to maintain himself according to his degree
and quality.</p>
               <p>I answer; That it is very improbable My Lord
should have spent all his Estate, if he had enjoyed it,
he being a man of great Wisdom and Prudence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well how to spend, and how to manage; for
though he lived nobly before the time of the Wars,
yet not beyond the Compass of his Estate; nay, so
far he would have been from spending his Estate, that
no doubt but he would have increast it to a vast value,
as he did before the Wars; where notwithstanding his
Hospitality and noble House-keeping, his charges of
Building came to about 31000 l; the portion of his
second Daughter, which was 12000 l; the noble enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
he gave King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, one whereof
came to almost 15000 l. another to above 4000 l, and
a third to 1700 l. as hereafter shall be mentioned; and
his great expences during the time of his being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to His Majesty that now is, he yet encreased his
Estate to the value of 100000 l, which is 5000 <hi>per
annum,</hi> when it was by so much less.</p>
               <p>But if any one will reckon the charges of his House-keeping
during the time of his Exile, and when he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47770:65"/>
had not the enjoyment of his Estate, he may substract
the sum accounted for the payment of his debts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in the time of his Banishment, which went to
the maintenance of himself and his Family; or in
lieu thereof, considering that I do not account all My
Lords losses, but onely those that are certainly known,
he may compare it with the loss of his personal Estate,
whereof I shall make some mention anon, and he'll
find that I do not heighten my Lords Losses, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diminish them; for surely the losses of his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Estate, and those I account not, will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the charges of his House-keeping, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them.</p>
               <p>Again, others will say, That there was much Land
sold in the time of My Lords Banishment by his Sons,
and Feoffees in Trust.</p>
               <p>I answer, First, That whatsoever was sold, was first
bought of the Rebellious Power: Next, although
they sold some Lands, yet My Lord knew nothing of
it, neither did he receive a penny worth for himself, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of what they purchased, nor sold, all the time of
his Banishment till his return.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the loss of My Lords Estate in
Rents: Concerning the loss of his Parks and Woods,
as much as is generally known, (for I do not reckon
particular Trees cut down in several of his Woods yet
standing) 'tis as follows:
<list>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:47770:66"/>
                     <item>1. <hi>Clipston</hi>-Park and Woods cut down to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

                     <item>2. <hi>Kirkby</hi>-Woods, for which my Lord was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
proferr'd 10000 l.</item>
                     <item>3. Woods cut down in <hi>Derbyshire</hi> 8000 l.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>Red-lodg</hi>-Wood, <hi>Rome</hi>-wood and others near
<hi>Welbeck</hi> 4000 l.</item>
                     <item>5. Woods cut down in <hi>Stafford</hi>-shire 1000 l.</item>
                     <item>6. Woods cut down in <hi>York</hi>-shire 1000 l.</item>
                     <item>7. Woods cut down in <hi>Northumberland</hi> 1500 l.</item>
                     <item>The <hi>Total</hi> 45000 l.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Lands which My Lord hath lost in present po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
are 2015 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which at 20 years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
come to 40300 l. and those which he hath lost in
Reversion, are 3214 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which at 16 years
purchase amount to the value of 51424 l.</p>
               <p>The Lands which my Lord since his return has sold
for the payment of some of his debts, occasioned by the
Wars (for I do not reckon those he sold to buy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
come to the value of 56000 l. to which out of
his yearly revenue he has added 10000 l. more, which
is in all 66000 l.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Composition of his Brothers Estate
was 5000 l. and the loss of it for eight years comes to
16000 l.</p>
               <p>All which, if summ'd up together, amounts
to 941303 l.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47770:66"/>
These are the accountable losses, which My Dear
Lord and Husband has suffered by the late Civil
Wars, and his Loyalty to his King and Country.
Concerning the loss of his personal Estate, since (as
I often mentioned) it cannot be exactly known; I
shall not endeavour to set down the Particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
onely in General give you a Note of what partly
they are:</p>
               <p>1. The pulling down of several of his dwelling or
Mannor-houses.</p>
               <p>2. The disfurnishing of them, of which the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
at <hi>Bolsover</hi> and <hi>Welbeck</hi> was very noble and rich:
Out of his <hi>London</hi>-house at <hi>Clarken-well,</hi> there were
taken, amongst other Goods, suits of Linnen, <hi>viz.</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Cloths,
Sideboard-cloths, Napkins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one suit cost 160 l. they being bought for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
which My Lord made for Their Majesties,
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and the Queen, at <hi>Bolsover</hi>-Castle;
And of 150 Suits of Hangings of all sorts
in all his Houses, there were not above 10 or 12 saved.</p>
               <p>Of Silver-plate, My Lord had so much as came to
the value of 3800 l. besides several Curiosities of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,
Cups, and other things, which after My Lord
was gone out of <hi>England,</hi> were taken out of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
house, <hi>Welbeck,</hi> by a Garison of the Kings Party
that lay therein, whereof he recovered onely 1100 l.
which Money was sent him beyond the Seas, the rest
was lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:47770:67"/>
As for Pewter, Brass, Bedding, Linnen, and other
Houshold-stuff, there was nothing else left but some
few old Feather-beds, and those all spoiled, and fit for
no use.</p>
               <p>3. My Lord's Stock of Corn, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was
very great before the Warrs, by reason of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and capacity of those grounds, and the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Granges he kept for his own use; as for example,
<hi>Barlow, Carkholston, Gleadthorp, Welbeck,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
more, which were all well manured and stockt.
But all this stock was lost, besides his Race of Horses in
his Grounds, Grange-Horses, Hackny-Horses, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage-Horses,
Coach-Horses, and others he kept for
his use.</p>
               <p>To these Losses I may well and justly join the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which my Lord hath been put to since his return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> by reason they were caused by the ruines
of the said Warrs; whereof I reckon,</p>
               <p>1. His Law-suits, which have been very chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him, more then advantagious.</p>
               <p>2. The Stocking, Manuring, Paling, Stubbing,
Hedging, &amp;c. of his Grounds and Parks; where it is to
be noted, That no advantage or benefit can be made of
Grounds, under the space of three years, and of
Cattel not under five or six.</p>
               <p>3. The repairing and furnishing of some of his
Dwelling-Houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:47770:67"/>
4. The setting up a Race or Breed of Horses, as
he had before the Warrs; for which purpose he hath
bought the best Mares he could get for money.</p>
               <p>In short, I can reckon 12000 l. laid out barely for
the repair of some Ruines, which my Lord could not
be without, there being many of them to repair yet;
neither is this all that is laid out, but much more which
I cannot well remember; nor is there more but one
Grange stock'd, amongst several that were kept for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
his House with Provisions: As for other
Charges and Losses, which My Lord hath sustained
since his return, I will not reckon them, because my
design is onely to account such losses as were caused by
the Wars.</p>
               <p>By which, as they have been mentioned, it may
easily be concluded, That although My Lord's Estate
was very great before the Wars, yet now it is shrunk
into a very narrow compass, that it puts his Prudence
and Wisdom to the Proof, to make it serve his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
he having no other assistance to bear him up;
and yet notwithstanding all this, he hath since his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
paid both for Himself and his Son, all manner of
Taxes, Lones, Levies, Assessments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> equally
with the rest of His Majesties Subjects, according to
that Estate that is left him, which he has been forced to
take upon Interest.</p>

did also raise Forces for His Majesty, yet they were
Brigades, rather then well-formed Armies, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
to my Lord's. The reason was, That my
Lord, by his Mother, the Daughter of <hi>Cuthbert</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:47770:68"/>
Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> being allyed to most of the most ancient
Families in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and other the Northern
parts, could pretend a greater Interest in them, then a
stranger; for they through a natural affection to my
Lord as their own Kinsman, would sooner follow
him, and under his Conduct sacrifice their Lives for
His Majesty's Service, then any body else, well
knowing, That by deserting my Lord, they desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves; and by this means my Lord raised
first a Troup of Horse consisting of a hundred and
twenty, and a Regiment of Foot; and then an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Eight thousand Horse, Foot and Dragoons,
in those parts; and afterwards upon this ground, at
several times, and in several places, so many several
Troups, Regiments and Armies, that in all from the
first to the last, they amounted to above 100000 men,
and those most upon his own Interest, and without
any other considerable help or assistance; which was
much for a particular Subject, and in such a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of time; for since Armies are soonest raised by
Covetousness, Fear aud Faction; that is to say, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a constant and setled Pay, upon the Ground of
Terrour, and upon the Ground of Rebellion; but
very seldom or never upon uncertainty of Pay; and
when it is as hazardous to be of such a Party, as to be
in the heat of a Battel; also when there is no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
but honest duty; it may easily be conceived that
my Lord could have no little love and affection when
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47770:69"/>
He raised his Army upon snch grounds as could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
them but little advantage at that time.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the rest of his Army, My Lord had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for his own Regiment of Foot, 3000 of such Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
stout and faithful men, (whereof many were
bred in the Moorish-grounds of the Northern parts)
that they were ready to die at my Lord's feet, and
never gave over, whensoever they were engaged in
action, until they had either conquer'd the Enemy, or
lost their lives. They were called White-coats, for
this following reason: My Lord being resolved to
give them new Liveries, and there being not red Cloth
enough to be had, took up so much of white as would
serve to cloath them, desiring withal, their patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he had got it dyed; but they impatient of stay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
my Lord, that he would be pleased to let them
have it un-dyed as it was, promising they themselves
would die it in the Enemies Blood: Which request my
Lord granted them, and from that time they were
called White-Coats.</p>
                  <p>To give you some instances of their Valour and
Courage, I must beg leave to repeat some passages
mentioned in the first Book. The Enemy having
closely besieged the City of <hi>York,</hi> and made a passage
into the Mannor-yard, by springing a Mine under
the Wall thereof, was got into the Mannor-house
with a great number of their Forces; which My Lord
perceiving, he immediately went and drew 80 of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47770:69"/>
said White-coats thither, who with the greatest Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
went close up to the Enemy, and having charged
them, fell Pell-mell with the But-ends of their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
upon them, and with the assistance of the rest
that renewed their Courage by their example, kill'd
and took 1500, and by that means saved the Town.</p>
                  <p>How valiantly they behaved themselves in the last
fatal Battel upon <hi>Hessom-moor</hi> near <hi>York,</hi> has been also
declared heretofore; in so much, that although most of
the Army were fled, yet they would not stir, until by
the Enemies Power they were overcome, and most of
them slain in rank and file.</p>
                  <p>Their love and affection to my Lord was such, that
it lasted even when he was deprived of all his power,
and could do them little good; to which purpose I
shall mention this following passage:</p>
                  <p>My Lord being in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> received a Visit from a
Gentleman, who came out of <hi>England,</hi> and rendred
My Lord thanks for his safe Escape at Sea; My
Lord being in amaze, not knowing what the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
meant, he was pleased to acquaint Him, that in
his coming over Sea out of <hi>England,</hi> he was set upon
by Pickaroons, who having examined him, and the
rest of his Company, at last some asked him, whether
he knew the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle?</hi> To whom he
answered, That he knew him very well, and was
going over into the same City where my Lord lived.
Whereupon they did not onely take nothing from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47770:70"/>
him, but used him with all Civility, and desired him to
remember their humble duty to their Lord General, for
they were some of his White-Coats that had escaped
death; and if my Lord had any service for them, they
were ready to assist him upon what Designs soever, and
to obey him in whatsoever he should be pleased to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them.</p>
                  <p>This I mention for the Eternal Fame and Memory
of those Valiant and Faithful Men. But to return
to the <hi>Power</hi> my Lord had in the late Warrs: As he
was the Head of his own Army, and had raised it most
upon his own Interest for the Service of His Majesty;
so he was never Ordered by His Majesty's Privy
Council, (except that some Forces of His were kept
by His late Majesty, (which he sent to Him) together
with some Arms and Ammunition heretofore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
until His Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> came from
His Majesty, to join with him at the Siege of <hi>York.</hi>
He had moreover the Power of Coyning, Printing,
Knighting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which never any Subject had before,
when His Soveraign Himself was in the Kingdom; as
also the Command of so many Counties, as is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the First Book, and the Power of placing and
displacing what Governours and Commanders he
pleased, and of constituting what Garisons he thought
fit; of the chief whereof I shall give you this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
list.</p>

                     <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Widdrington</hi> was President of the
Council of War, and Commander in chief of the
three Counties of <hi>Lincoln, Rutland</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
and the forces there.</p>
                  <p>When my Lord marched with his Army to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>
against the <hi>Scots,</hi> then the Lord <hi>Iohn Bellassis</hi> was

                  <p>As for the rest of the Officers and Commanders of

                  <head>2. Of His Misfortunes and obstructions.</head>
                  <p>ALthough Nature had favour'd My Lord, and
endued him with the best Qualities and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
she could inspire into his soul; yet Fortune hath
ever been such an inveterate Enemy to him, that she
invented all the spight and malice against him that lay
in her power; and notwithstanding his prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Designs, cast such obstructions in his way, that
he seldom proved successful, but where he acted in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And since I am not ignorant that this unjust and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47770:73"/>
partial Age is apt to suppress the worth of meritorious
persons, and that many will endeavour to obscure my
Lords noble Actions and Fame, by casting unjust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersions
upon him, and laying (either out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or malice) Fortunes envy to his charge, I have
purposed to represent these obstructions which conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to render his good intentions and endeavours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
and at last did work his ruine and destruction,
in these following particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. At the time when the Kingdom became so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated,
as to oppose and pull down their Gracious
King and Soveraign, the Treasury was exhausted,
and no sufficient means to raise and maintain Armies to
reduce his Majesties Rebellious Subjects; so that My
Lord had little to begin withal but what his own Estate
would allow, and his Interest procure him.</p>
                  <p>2. When his late Majesty, in the beginning of the
unhappy Wars, sent My Lord to <hi>Hull,</hi> the strongest
place in the Kingdom, where the Magazine of Arms
and Ammunition was kept, and he by his prudence
had gained it to his Majesties service; My Lord
was left to the mercy of the Parliament, where he
had surely suffered for it, (though he acted not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
His Majesties Commission) if some of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
party had not quitted him, in hopes to gain him
on their side.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47770:73"/>
3. After His Majesty had sent My Lord to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>
upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> to take upon him the Government
of that place, and he had raised there, of Friends and
Tenants, a troup of Horse and Regiment of Foot,
which he ordered to conveigh some Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to His Majesty, sent by the Queen out of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
His Majesty was pleased to keep the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
with him to encrease his own Forces, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was but of a small number, yet at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time it would have been very serviceable to my
Lord, he having then but begun to raise Forces.</p>
                  <p>4. When Her Majesty the now Queen-Mother, after
her arrival out of <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> had a purpose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
some Armes to His Majesty, My Lord order'd
a Party of 1500 to conduct the same, which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was pleased to keep with him for his own service.</p>
                  <p>5. After Her Majesty had taken a resolution to go
from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King then was; my Lord
for Her safer conduct quitted 7000 men of his Army,
with a convenient Train of Artillery, which likewise
never returned to my Lord.</p>
                  <p>6. When the Earl of <hi>Montross</hi> was going into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> he went to my Lord at <hi>Durham,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of him a supply of some Forces for His Majesties
service; where my Lord gave him 200 Horse and
Dragoons, even at such a time when he stood most in
need of a supply himself, and thought every day to
encounter the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:47770:74"/>
7. When my Lord out of the Northern parts went
into <hi>Lincoln</hi>- and <hi>Derby-shires</hi> with his Army, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and reduce them to their Allegiance and Duty to
His Majesty, and from thence resolved to march
into the Associate Counties, (where in all por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
he would have made an happy end of the
Warr) he was so importuned by those he left behind
him, and particularly the Commander in Chief, to
return into <hi>York-shire,</hi> alledging the Enemy grew
strong, and would ruine them all, if he came not
speedily to succour and assist them; that in honour
and duty he could do no otherwise but grant their
Requests; when as yet being returned into those parts,
he found them secure and safe enough from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Attempts.</p>
                  <p>8. My Lord (as heretofore mentioned) had as great
private Enemies about His Majesty, as he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Enemies in the Field, who used all the endeavour
they could to pull him down.</p>
                  <p>9. There was such Jugling, Treachery, and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in his own Army, and amongst some of his
own Officers, that it was impossible for my Lord to
be prosperous and successful in his Designs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
                  <p>10. My Lord's Army being the chief and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Army which His Majesty had, and in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
His prime Strength and Power; the Parliament
resolved at last, to join all their Forces with the Army
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47770:74"/>
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> (which when it came out of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was above Twenty thousand Men) to oppose, and
if possible, to ruine it; well knowing, that if they
did pull down my Lord, they should be Masters of
all the Three Kingdoms; so that there were Three
Armies against One. But although my Lord suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much by the Negligence (and sometimes Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery)
of his Officers, and was unfortunately called
back into <hi>York-shire,</hi> from his March he designed for
the Associate Counties, and was forced to part with
a great number of his Forces and Ammunition, as
aforementioned; yet he would hardly have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and his Army ruined by the Enemy, had he
but had some timely supply and assistance at the Siege
of <hi>York,</hi> or that his Counsel had been taken in not
fighting the Enemy then, or that the Battel had been
differ'd some two or three dayes longer, until those
Forces were arrived which he expected, namely three
thousand men out of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
drawn out of several Garisons. But the chief
Misfortune was, That the Enemy fell upon the Kings
Forces before they were all put into a <hi>Battallia,</hi> and took
them at their great disadvantage; which caused such a
Panick fear amongst them, that most of the Horse of
the right Wing of His Majesty's Forces, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their heels; insomuch, that although the left
Wing (commanded by the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi>) did their best endeavour, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47770:75"/>
beat back the Enemy three times, and My Lord's own
Regiment of Foot charged them so couragiously, that
they never broke, but died most of them in their Ranks
and Files; yet the Power of the Enemy being too
strong, put them at last to a total rout and confusion.
Which unlucky disaster put an end to all future
hopes of His Majesties Party; so that my Lord seeing
he had nothing left in his Power to do His Majesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further service in that kind (for had he stayed, he
would have been forced to surrender all those Towns
and Garisons in those parts, that were yet in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Devotion, as afterwards it also happen'd) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to quit the Kingdom, as formerly is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p>And these are chiefly the obstructions to the good
success of my Lord's Designs in the late Civil Wars;
which being rightly considered, will save him blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
from what otherwise would be laid to his charge;
for, as according to the old saying, <hi>'Tis easie for men to
swim, when they are held up by the chin:</hi> So on the other
side, it is very dangerous and difficult for them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it, when they are pulled down by the Heels,
and beaten upon their Heads.</p>

               <div n="3" type="part">
                  <head>3. Of His Loyalty and Sufferings.</head>
                  <p>I dare boldly and justly say, That there never was,
nor is a more Loyal and Faithful Subject then My
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47770:75"/>
Lord: Not to mention the Trust he discharged in all
those imployments, which either King <hi>Iames,</hi> or
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, or His now Gracious Master
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, were pleased to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, which he performed with such care and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that he never disobeyed their Commands in the
least; I will onely note,</p>
                  <p>1. That he was the First that appear'd in Armes for
His Majesty, and engaged Himself and all his Friends
he could for His Majesties Service; and though he
had but two Sons which were young, and one onely
Brother, yet they all were with him in the Wars:
His two Sons had Commands, but His Brother, though
he had no Command, by reason of the weakness of
his body, yet he was never from My Lord when he
was in action, even to the last; for he was the last
with my Lord in the Field in that fatal Battel upon
<hi>Hessom-moor,</hi> near <hi>York;</hi> and though my Brother,
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> desired my Lord to send his Sons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
when the said Battel was fought, yet he would
not, saying, His Sons should shew their Loyalty and
Duty to His Majesty, in venturing their lives, as well
as Himself.</p>
                  <p>2. My Lord was the chief and onely Person, that
kept up the Power of His late Majesty; for when his
Army was lost, all the Kings Party was ruined in all
three of his Majesties Kingdoms; because in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
lay the chief strength of all the Royal Forces;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47770:76"/>
it being the greatest and best formed Army which His
Majesty had, and the onely support both of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Person and Power, and of the hopes of all his
Loyal Subjects in all his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>3. My Lord was 16 Years in Banishment, and
hath lost and suffered most of any subject, that suffer'd
either by War, or otherways, except those that lost
their lives, and even that he valued not, but exposed
it to so eminent dangers that nothing but Heavens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
had ordained to save it.</p>
                  <p>4. He never minded his own Interest more then
his Loyaltie and Duty, and upon that account never
desired nor received any thing from the Crown to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
himself, but spent great sums in His Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
so that after his long banishment and return into
<hi>England,</hi> I observed his ruined Estate was like an
Earthquake, and his Debts like Thunder-bolts, by
which he was in danger of being utterly undone, had
not Patience and Prudence, together with Heavens
Blessings, saved him from that threatning Ruine.</p>
                  <p>5. He never repined at his Losses and Sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he lost and suffered for his King and Countrey;
nay, so far was he from that, that I have heard him
say, If the same Warrs should happen again, and he
was sure to lose both his life, and all he had lest him, yet
he would most willingly sacrifice it for His Majesties
Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:47770:76"/>
6. He never connived or conspired with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
neither directly nor indirectly; for though some
Person of Quality being sent in the late Wars to him
into the North, from His late Majesty, who was
then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with some Message, did withal in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
acquaint him, that some of the Nobility that were
with the King, desired him to side with them against
His Majesty, alledging that if His Majesty should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an absolute Conqueror, both himself and the rest
of the Nobility would lose all their Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
yet he was so far from consenting to it, that
he returned him this answer, namely, That he entred
into actions of War, for no other end, but for the
service of His King and Master, and to keep up His
Majesties Rights and Prerogatives, for which he was
resolved to venture both his Life, Posterity and Estate;
for certainly, said he, the Nobility cannot fall if the
King be Victorious, nor can they keep up their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
if the King be overcome.</p>
                  <p>This Message was delivered by word of mouth, but
none of their names mentioned; so that it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known whether it was a real truth or not; more
probable it was, that they intended to sound my Lord,
or to make, if possible, more division; for certainly
not all that pretended to be for the King, were His
Friends; and I my self remember very well, when I
was with Her Hajesty, the now Queen-Mother, in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> (although I was too young to perceive their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47770:77"/>
intrigues, yet I was old enough to observe) that there
were great Factions both amongst the Courtiers and
Soldiers. But my Lords Loyalty was such, that
he kept always faithful and true to His Majesty, and
could by no means be brought to side with the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Party, or to juggle and mind his own Interest
more then his Majesties Service; and this was the cause
that he had as great private Enemies at Court, as he
had publick Enemies in the Field, who sought as
much his ruine and destruction privately and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ould
cast aspersions upon his Loyalty and Duty, as the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
did publickly oppose him.</p>
                  <p>In short, that it may appear the better what loyal
and faithful services my Lord has done both for His
late Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and His now Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Master King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, I have thought
fit to subjoin both Their Majesties Commendations
which they were pleased to give him, when for his Great
and Loyal Services they confer'd upon him the Titles
and Dignities of <hi>Marquess,</hi> and <hi>Duke of Newcastle.</hi>

he was ready with Us in all Actions in</hi> York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
<hi>and governed the Town of</hi> Newcastle, <hi>and Castle
in the mouth of</hi> Tyne, <hi>at the time of that fatal Revolt of

bringing Armes to Us (then Our onely relief:) In
which Service so strongly going on, (which was of grand

to have stood to: Afterwards, having Mustered together a

now enjoying almost all</hi> York-shire, <hi>and the chiefest
Fortress of all the Country now appearing to have scarce

that he might timely relieve them in their desperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
And leading his said Army in the midst of Winter,
gave the Rebels Battel in his passage, vanquish'd them, and
put them to flight, and took from them several Garisons,

broke into the very rage of the Battel, and with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
fell upon the right Wing of those Rebels, That those
who were but now certain of Victory, turn'd their backs, and
fled from the Conqueror, who by his Wisdom, Virtue and
his own Hand, brought death and flight to the Rebels, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

and Religion call'd him off to make use of his further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and Valour. Rebellion spread abroad, he levied
Loyal Forces in great numbers, opposed the Enemy, won so
many and so great Victories in the Field, took in so many
Towns, Castles and Garisons, as well in Our Northern
parts, as elsewhere; and behaved himself with so great
Courage and Valour in the defending also what he had got,
especially at the Siege of</hi> York, <hi>which he maintain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
three Potent Armies of</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> English, <hi>closely
beleaguering, and with emulation assaulting it for three
Months (till Relief was brought) to the wonder and
envy of the Enemy; that, if Loyal and Humane Force
could have prevailed, he had soon restored Fidelity, Peace
and his KING to the Nation, which was then hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
to Ruine by an unhappy Fate; So that Rebellion
getting the upper hand, and no place being left for him to act
further valiantly in, for his King and Countrey, he
still retain'd the same Loyalty and Valour in suffering,
being an inseparable Follower of Our Exile; during
which sad Catastrophe, his whole Estate was sequestred
and sold from him, and his Person alwayes one of the
first of those few who were excepted both for Life and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
(which was offer'd to all others.) Besides, his
Virtues are accompanied with a Noble Blood, being of
a Family by each Stock equally adorn'd and endow'd
with great Honours and Riches. For which Reasons
We have resolv'd to grace the said Marquess with a
new Mark of our Favour, he being every way deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47770:80"/>
of it, as one who lov'd vertue equal to his Noble
Birth, and possess'd Patrimonies suitable to both, as long as
loyalty had any place to shew it self in our Realm; which
possessions he so well employ'd, and at last for Us and Our
Fathers service lost, till he was with Us restor'd. Know
therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>4. Of his Prudence and Wisdom.</head>
                  <p>MY Lord's Prudence and Wisdom hath been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
apparent both in his Publick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Actions and Imployments; for he hath such a
Natural Inspection, and Judicious Observation of
things, that he sees beforehand what will come to pass,
and orders his affairs accordingly. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I cannot but mention, that <hi>Laud,</hi> the then Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> between whom and my Lord,
interceded a great and intire Friendship, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a Legacy of a Diamond, to the value of
200 l. left to my Lord when he died, which was much
for him to bequeath; for though he was a great States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and in favour with his late Majesty, yet he was
not covetous to hoard up wealth, but bestowed it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Publick, repairing the Cathedral of
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which, had God granted him life,
he would certainly have beautified, and rendred as
famous and glorious as any in Christendom: This said
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47770:80"/>
Arch-Bishop was pleased to tell His late Majesty, that
my Lord was one of the Wisest and Prudentest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that ever he was acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>For further proof, I cannot pass by that my Lord
told His late Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and Her
Majesty the now Queen-Mother, some time before
the Wars, That he observed by the humours of the
People, the approaching of a Civil War, and that
His Majesties Person would be in danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
if timely care was not taken to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Also when my Lord was at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the Marquess
of <hi>Montross,</hi> before he went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> gave my
Lord a Visit, and acquainted him with his intended
Journey, asking my Lord whether he was not also go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>England?</hi> My Lord answer'd, He was ready
to do His Majesty what service he could, and would
shun no opportunity, where he perceived he could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
something to His Majesties advantage; Nay, said he,
if His Majesty should be pleased to Command my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person to go against the whole Army of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
although I was sure to lose my life, yet out of a Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Duty to His Majesty, and in Obedience to his
Commands, I should never refufe it. But to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(said he) the life of my Friends, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
them in a desperate action, without any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of doing the least good to His Majesty, would
be a very unjust and unconscionable act; for my
Friends might perhaps venture with me upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47770:81"/>
Faith, that I was so honest as not to engage
them without a firm and solid foundation; but I
wanting that, as having no Ships, Armes, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
Provision, Forts, and places of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and what is the chief thing, Money; To what
purpose would it be to draw them into so hazardous an
Action, but to seek their ruine and destruction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least benefit to His Majesty? Then the Marquess
of <hi>Montross</hi> asked my Lord's Advice, and what he
should do in such a case? My Lord answer'd, That
he knowing best his own Countrey, Power and
Strength, and what probability he had of Forces,
and other Necessaries for Warr, when he came into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> could give himself the best advice; but
withall told him, That if he had no Provision nor
Ammunition, Armes and places of Rendezvous
for his men to meet and join, he would likely be
forced to hide his head, and suffer for his rash un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking:
Which unlucky Fate did also according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befall that worthy Person.</p>
                  <p>These passages I mention to no other end, but to
declare my Lord's Judgment and Prudence in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Affairs; whereof there are so many, that if I
should set them all down, it would swell this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a big Volume. They may in some sort be gather'd
from his actions mentioned heretofore, especially the
ordering of his affairs in the time of Warr, with
such Conduct, Prudence and Wisdom, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47770:81"/>
at the beginning of his Undertaking that
great Trust and honourable Employment which His
late Majesty was pleased to confer upon him, he saw
so little appearance of performing his Designs with
good success, His Majesty's Revenues being then much
weakned, and the Magazines and publick Purse, in the
Enemies Power, besides several other obstructions
and hinderances; yet as he undertook it chearfully,
and out of pure Loyalty and Obedience to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
so he ordered it so wisely, that so long as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by his own Counsels, and was personally present
at the execution of his Designs, he was always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
in his Success. And although he had so great
an Army, as aforementioned, yet by his wise and
prudent Conduct, there appear'd no visible sign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
in any of the Countreys where he marched;
for first, he setled a constant Rule for the Regular le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of money for the convenient Maintenance of the
Soldiery. Next, he constituted such Officers of his
Army, that most of them were known to be Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of large and fair Estates, which drew a good part
of their private Revenues, to serve and support them
in their publick Employments; wherein my Lord did
lead them the way by his own good Example.</p>
                  <p>To which may be added his wisdom in ordering the
Government of the Church, for the advancement of the
Orthodox Religion, and suppression of Factions; as
also in Coyning, Printing, Knighting, and the like,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47770:82"/>
which he used with great discretion and prudence, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Interest of His Majesty, and the benefit of
the Kingdom, as formerly has been mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Prudent mannage of his private and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
affairs, appears sufficiently: 1. In his Marriage.
2. In the ordering and increasing his Estate before the
Wars, which notwithstanding his Noble House-keeping
and Hospitality, and his Generous Bounty
and Charity, he increased to the value of 100000 l.
3. In the ordering his Affairs in the time of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where although he received not the least of his
own estate, during all the time of his exile, until his
return; yet maintained himself handsomely and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
according to his Quality, as much as his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at that time would permit. 4. In reducing his torn
and ruined Estate after his return, which beyond all
probability, himself hath setled and order'd so, that his
Posterity will have reason gratefully to remember it.</p>
                  <p>In short; Although my Lord naturally loves not
business, especially those of State, (though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
them as well as any body) yet what business
or affairs he cannot avoid, none will do them better
then himself. His private affairs he orders without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noise or trouble, not over-hastily, but wisely: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he passionate in acting of business, but hears pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
and orders soberly, and pierces into the heart
or bottom of a business at the first encounter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all things, he considers well before he undertakes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47770:82"/>
a business, whether he be able to go through it or no,
for he never ventures upon either publick or private bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
beyond his strength.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot forbear to mention, that my
Noble Lord, when he was in banishment, presumed
out of his Duty and Love to his Gracious Master our
now Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to write and
send him a little Book, or rather a Letter, wherein he
delivered his Opinion concerning the Government of
his Dominions, whensoever God should be pleased to
restore him to his Throne, together with some other
Notes and Observations of Foreign States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
but it being a private offer to His sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
I dare not presume to publish it.</p>

                  <head>5. Of His Blessings.</head>
                  <p>ALthough my Lord hath been one of the most
Unfortunate Persons of his Rank and Quality,
which this later age did produce; yet Heaven hath
been so propitious to him, that it bestowed some bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
upon him even in the midst of his Misfortunes, and
supported him against Fortunes Malice, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as it seems, had designed his total ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
Of these Blessings I may name in the first
place,</p>
                  <p>1. The Royal Favours of His Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign's,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47770:83"/>
and the good esteem they had of his Fidelity
and Loyalty; which as it was the chief of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
so he esteemed it above all the rest. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them particularly would be too tedious, and they
are sufficiently apparent out of the precedent History;
onely this I may add, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, out
of a singular Favour to my Lord, was pleased upon
his most humble request, to create several Noble-men;
the Names of them, left I commit an offence, I shall
not mention, by reason most men usually pretend such
claimes upon the Ground of their own Merit.</p>
                  <p>2. That God was pleased to bless him with Wealth
and Power, to enable him the better for the service of
his King and Country.</p>
                  <p>3. That he made him happy in his Marriage; (for
his first Wife was a very kind, loving and Virtuous
Lady) and bless'd him with Dutiful and Obedient
Children, free from Vices, Noble and Generous
both in ther Natures and Actions; who did all that
lay in their power to support and relieve my Lord
their Father in his Banishment, as before is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>4. The Kindness and Civility which my Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Strangers, and the Inhabitants of those
places, where he lived during the time of his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for had it not been for them, he would have
perished in his extream wants; but it pleased God so
to provide for him, that although he wanted an Estate,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47770:83"/>
yet he wanted not Credit; and although he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and forsaken by his own Friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yet he was civilly received and relieved by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
until God bless'd him,</p>
                  <p>Lastly, With a happy return to his Native
Country, his dear Children, and his own Estate; which
although he found much ruined and broke, yet by
his Prudence and Wisdom, hath order'd as well as
he could; and I hope, and pray God to add this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to all the rest, That he may live long to encrease it
for the benefit of his Posterity.</p>

                  <head>7. Of the Entertainments He made for King
CHARLES the First.</head>
                  <p>THough my Lord hath alwayes been free and
noble in his Entertainments and Feastings, yet
he was pleased to shew his great Affection and Duty
to his Gracious King, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and Her
Majesty the Queen, in some particular Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he made of purpose for them before
the late Warrs.</p>
                  <p>When His Majesty was going into <hi>Scotland</hi> to be
Crowned, he took His way through <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi>
and lying at <hi>Worksop</hi>-Mannor, hardly
two miles distant from <hi>Welbeck,</hi> where my Lord
then was, my Lord invited His Majesty thither to
a Dinner, which he was graciously pleased to accept
of: This Entertainment cost my Lord between
Four and Five thousand pounds; which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
liked so well, that a year after His Return out
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> He was pleased to send my Lord word,
That Her Majesty the Queen was resolved to make
a Progress into the Northern parts, desiring him to
prepare the like Entertainment for Her, as he had
formerly done for Him: Which My Lord did, and
endeavour'd for it with all possible Care and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
sparing nothing that might add splendor to
that Feast, which both Their Majesties were pleased
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47770:85"/>
to honour with their Presence: <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi> he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in fitting such Scenes and Speeches as he could
best devise; and sent for all the Gentry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to come and wait on their Majesties; and in
short, did all that ever he could imagine, to render
it Great, and worthy Their Royal Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>This Entertainment he made at <hi>Bolsover</hi>-Castle in
<hi>Derbyshire,</hi> some five miles distant from <hi>Welbeck,</hi>
and resigned <hi>Welbeck</hi> for Their Majesties Lodging;
it cost him in all between Fourteen and Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds.</p>
                  <p>Besides these two, there was another small Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
which my Lord prepared for His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
in his own Park at <hi>Welbeck,</hi> when His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
came down, with his two Nephews, the now
Prince Elector Palatine, and His Brother Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi>
into the Forrest of <hi>Sherwood;</hi> which cost him
Fifteen hundred pounds.</p>
                  <p>And this I mention not out of a vain-glory, but
to declare the great love and Duty, my Lord had for
His Gracious King and Queen, and to correct the
mistakes committed by some Historians, who not
being rightly informed of those Entertainments, make
the World believe Falshood for Truth. But as I
said, they were made before the Warrs, when my
Lord had the possessiou of a great Estate, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing to express his Love and Duty to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
in that manner; whereas now he should be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47770:85"/>
much to seek to do the like, his Estate being so much
ruined by the late Civil Wars, that neither himself nor
his Posterity will be able so soon to recover it.</p>

               <div n="8" type="part">
                  <head>8. His Education.</head>
                  <p>HIs Education was according to his Birth; for
as he was born a Gentleman, so he was bred like
a Gentleman. To School-Learning he never shew'd
a great inclination; for though he was sent to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity,
and was a Student of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledg in
<hi>Cambridg,</hi> and had his Tutors to instruct him; yet
they could not perswade him to read or study much,
he taking more delight in sports, then in learning; so
that his Father being a wise man, and seeing that his
Son had a good natural Wit, and was of a very good
Disposition, suffer'd him to follow his own Genius;
whereas his other Son <hi>Charles,</hi> in whom he found a
greater love and inclination to Learning, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
as much that way, as possibly he could.</p>
                  <p>One time it hapned that a young Gentleman, one
of my Lord's Relations, had bought some Land, at the
same time when my Lord had bought a Singing-Boy
for 50 l. a Horse for 50 l. and a Dog for 2 l. which
humour his Father Sir <hi>Charles</hi> liked so well, that he was
pleased to say, That if he should find his Son to be so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
that he would buy Land before he was 20 years
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47770:86"/>
of Age, he would disinherit him. But above all
the rest, my Lord had a great inclination to the
Art of Horsemanship and Weapons, in which later,
his Father Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> being a most ingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
Master of that Age, was his onely Tutor,
and kept him also several Masters in the Art of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
and sent him to the <hi>Mewse</hi> to <hi>Mons. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toine,</hi>
who was then accounted the best Master in that
Art. But my Lord's delight in those Heroick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
was such, that he soon became Master thereof
Himself, which encreased much his Father's hopes of
his future perfections, who being himself a person of a
Noble and Heroick nature, was extreamly well pleased
to observe his Son take delight in such Arts and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
as were proper and fit for a person of Quality.</p>

               <div n="9" type="part">
                  <head>9. His Natural Wit and Vnderstanding.</head>
                  <p>ALthough my Lord has not so much of Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Learning as his Brother Sir <hi>Charles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendish</hi>
had, yet he hath an excellent Natural Wit
and Judgment, and dives into the bottom of every
thing; as it is evidently apparent in the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Art of Horsemanship and Weapons, which by
his own ingenuity he has reformed and brought to such
perfection, as never any one has done heretofore: And
though he is no Mathematician by Art, yet he hath a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47770:86"/>
very good Mathematical brain, to demonstrate Truth
by natural reason, and is both a good Natural and
Moral Philosopher, not by reading Philosophical
Books, but by his own Natural Understanding and
Observation, by which he hath found out many
Truths.</p>
                  <p>To pass by several other instances, I'le but mention,
that when my Lord was at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his Exile, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
one time, that he discoursing with some of his
Friends, amongst whom was also that Learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
<hi>Hobbes,</hi> they began amongst the rest, to argue
upon this subject, namely, <hi>Whether it mere possible to
make Man by Art fly as Birds do;</hi> and when some of the
Company had delivered their Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That
they thought it probable to be done by the help of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Wings: My Lord declared, that he deemed
it altogether impossible, and demonstrared it by this
following Reason: Man's Armes, said he, are not
set on his shoulders in the same manner as Bird's wings
are; for that part of the Arm which joins to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is in Man placed inward, as towards the breast,
but in Birds outward, as toward the back; which
difference and contrary position or shape, hinders that
man cannot have the same flying-action with his Armes,
as Birds have with their Wings; Which Argument
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> liked so well, that he was pleased to make
use of it in one of his Books called <hi>Leviathan,</hi> if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47770:87"/>
Some other time they falling into a Discourse
concerning Witches, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> said, That though
he could not rationally believe there were Witches,
yet he could not be fully satisfied to believe there
were none, by reason they would themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it, if strictly examined.</p>
                  <p>To which my Lord answer'd, That though for
his part he cared not whether there were Witches or
no; yet his Opinion was, That the Confession of
Witches, and their suffering for it, proceeded from
an Erroneous Belief, <hi>viz.</hi> That they had made a
Contract with the Devil to serve him for such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as were in his Power to give them; and that
it was their Religion to worship and adore him; in
which Religion they had such a firm and constant
belief, that if any thing came to pass according to
their desire, they believed the Devil had heard their
prayers, and granted their requests, for which they
gave him thanks; but if things fell out contrary to
their prayers and desires, then they were troubled
at it, fearing they had offended him, or not serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as they ought, and asked him forgiveness for
their offences. Also (said my Lord) they imagine that
their Dreams are real exterior actions; for example, if
they dream they flye in the Air, or out of the
Chimney top, or that they are turned into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
shapes, they believe no otherwise, but that it is
really so: And this wicked Opinion makes them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47770:87"/>
industrious to perform such Ceremonies to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that they adore and worship him as their God,
and chuse to live and dye for him.</p>
                  <p>Thus my Lord declared himself concerning Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> was also pleased to insert in
his fore-mentioned Book: But yet my Lord doth
not count this Opinion of his so universal, as if
there were none but imaginary Witches; for he doth
not speak but of such a sort of Witches as make it
their Religion to worship the Devil in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.
Nor doth he think it a Crime to entertain
what Opinion seems most probable to him, in things
indifferent; for in such cases men may discourse and
argue as they please, to exercise their Wit, and
may change and alter their Opinions upon more
probable Grounds and Reasons; whereas in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
matters both of Church and State, he is so
strict an Adherent to them, that he will never main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or defend such Opinions which are in the least
prejudicial to either.</p>
                  <p>One proof more I'le add to confirm his Natural
Understanding and Judgment, which was upon
some Discourse I held with him one time, concerning
that famous Chymist <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> who in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
is very invective against the School-men, and
amongst the rest, accuses them for taking the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
moisture for the fat of Animal Bodies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
my Lord answer'd, That surely the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47770:88"/>
men were too wise to commit such an Error; for,
said he, the Radical moisture is not the fat or
tallow of an Animal, but an Oily and Balsamous
Substance; for the fat and tallow, as also the watery
parts, are cold; whereas the Oily and Balsamous
parts, have at all times a lively heat; which makes
that those Creatures which have much of that Oyle
or Balsom, are long-liv'd, and appear young; and
not onely Animals, but also Vegetables, which
have much of that Oyle or Balsom, as Ivy, Bayes,
Laurel, Holly, and the like, live long, and appear
fresh and green, not onely in Winter, but when
they are old. Then I ask'd my Lord's Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Radical heat: To which he answer'd,
That the Radical heat lived in the Radical moisture;
and when the one decayed, the other decayed also; and
then was produced either an unnatural heat, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
an unnatural dryness; or an unnatural moisture,
which caused Dropsies, and these, an unnatural cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>Lastly; His Natural Wit appears by his delight
in Poetry; for I may justly call him the best <hi>Lyrick</hi>
and <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poet of this Age: His Comedies do
sufficiently shew his great Observation and Judgment,
for they are composed of these three Ingredients, <hi>viz.
Wit, Humour</hi> and <hi>Satyre;</hi> and his chief Design in
them, is to divulge and laugh at the follies of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
to persecute Vice, and to encourage Virtue.</p>

                  <head>10. Of his Natural Humour and Disposition.</head>
                  <p>MY Lord may justly be compared to <hi>Titus</hi> the
<hi>Deliciae</hi> of Mankind, by reason of his sweet,
gentle and obliging Nature; for though his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Experience found it impossible to please all
men, because of their different humours and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
yet his Nature is such, that he will be sorry
when he seeth that men are displeased with him out
of their own ill Natures, without any cause; for he
loves all that are his Friends, and hates none that are
his Enemies: He is a Loyal Subject, a kind Husband,
a Loving Father, a Generous Master, and a Constant
Friend.</p>
                  <p>His natural Love to his Parents has been so great,
that I have heard him say, he would most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without the lest repining, have begg'd for
his daily relief, so God would but have let his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
live.</p>
                  <p>He is true and just both in his words and actions,
and has no mean or petty Designs, but they are all
just and honest.</p>
                  <p>He condemns not upon Report, but upon Proof;
nor judges by Words, but Actions; he forgets not
past Service, for present Advantage; but gives a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Reward to a present Desert.</p>
                  <p>He hath a great Power over his Passions, and hath
had the greatest tryals thereof; for certainly He must
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47770:89"/>
of necessity have a great share of Patience, that can
forgive so many falfe, treacherous, malicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Persons as he hath done; but he is so wise, that
his Passion never out-runs his Patience, nor his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
his Prudence; and although his Private
Enemies have been numerous, yet I verily believe,
there is never a subject more generally beloved then
He is.</p>
                  <p>He hates Pride and loves Humility; is civil to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
kind to his Acquaintance, and respectful to all
persons, according to their Quality; He never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
Place, except it be for Ceremony: To the
meanest person he'll put off his Hat, and suffer every
body to speak to him.</p>
                  <p>He never refuses any Petition, but accepts them;
and being informed of the business, will give a just, and
as much as lies in him, a favourable answer to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
Party.</p>
                  <p>He easily Pardons, and bountifully Rewards; and
always praises particular mens Virtues, but covers
their Faults with silence.</p>
                  <p>He is full of Charity and Compassion to persons
that are in misery, and full of Clemency and Mercy;
in so much, that when he was General of a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he would never sit in Council himself upon Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Life and Death, but granted Pardon to many
Delinquents that were condemned by his Council of
War; so that some were forced to Petition him not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47770:89"/>
to do it, by reason it was an ill president for others.
To which my Lord merrily answer'd, That if
they did hang all, they would leave him none to
fight.</p>
                  <p>His Courage he always shew'd in Action, more then
in Words, for he would Fight, but not Rant.</p>
                  <p>He is not Vain-glorious to heighten or brag of his
Heroick Actions; Witness that great Victory upon
<hi>Atherton-moor,</hi> after which he would not suffer his
Trumpets to sound, but came quietly and silently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City of <hi>York,</hi> for which he would certainly have
been blamed by those that make a great noise upon
small causes; and love to be applauded, though their
actions little deserve it.</p>
                  <p>His noble Bounty and Generosity is so manifest to
all the World, that I should light a Candle to the Sun,
if I should strive to illustrate it; for he has no self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
or self-interest, but will rather wrong and injure
himself then others. To give you but one proof of
this noble Vertue, it is known, that where he hath a
legal right to Felons Goods, as he hath in a great part
of his Estate, yet he never took or exacted more then
some inconsiderable share for acknowledgment of his
Right; saying, That he was resolved never to grow
rich by other mens misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>In short, I know him not addicted to any manner
of Vice, except that he has been a great lover and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of the Female Sex; which whether it be so great
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47770:90"/>
a crime as to condemn him for it; I'le leave to the
judgment of young Gallants and beautiful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

Art of Weapons (in which he has a method beyond

of the Pedigree of my Noble Lord and Husband,
to the end of the History of his life: I shall now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my self; and though I could derive it from a
longer time, and reckon up a great many of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
even from the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror,
He being descended from the most ancient family of
the <hi>Gernouns,</hi> as <hi>Cambden</hi> relates in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> in
the Description of <hi>Derbyshire;</hi> yet it being a work fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Heralds, I shall proceed no further then his
Grandfather, and shew you onely those noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
which my Lord is allied to by his Birth.</p>
                  <p>My Lord's Grandfather, by his Father, (as is formerly
mentioned) was Sir <hi>William Cavendish,</hi> Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
and Treasurer of the Chamber to King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> who
married two Wives; by the first he had onely two
Daughters; but by the second, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was my
Lords Grandmother, he had three Sons and four
Daughters, whereof one Daughter died young. She
was Daughter to <hi>Iohn Hardwick</hi> of <hi>Hardwick,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Derby,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> and had four Husbands: The
first was—<hi>Barlow</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> who died before they were
bedded together, they being both very young. The
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47770:92"/>
second was Sir <hi>William Cavendish,</hi> my Lord's Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
who being somewhat in years, married her
chiefly for her beauty; she had so much power in his
affection, that she perswaded him to sell his Estate which
he had in the Southern parts of <hi>England</hi> (for he was
very rich) and buy an Estate in the Northern parts,
<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and thereabout, where her own
friends and kindred liv'd, which he did; and having
there setled himself, upon her further perswasion, built
a Mannor-house in the same County, call'd <hi>Chattes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
which, as I have heard, cost first and last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
80000 l. <hi>sterling.</hi> But before this House was
finish'd, he died, and left six Children, <hi>viz.</hi> three
Sons and three Daughters, which before they came to
be marriageable, she married a third Husband, Sir
<hi>William</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<hi>Gertrude,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Thomas Manners,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but died without Issue.</p>
                  <p>The second Son <hi>William,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi>

                     <p>That it is not so much unseasonable Weather that
makes the Countrey complain of Scarcity, but want
of Commerce; for whensoever Commodities are
cheap, it is a sign that Commerce is decayed; because
the cheapness of them, shews a scarcity of money;
for example, put the case five men came to Market
to buy a Horse, and each of them had no more but
ten pounds, the Seller can receive no more then what
the Buyer has, but must content himself with those
ten pounds, if he be necessitated to sell his Horse:
But if each one of the Buyers had an hundred
pounds to lay out for a Horse, the Seller might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as much. Thus Commodities are cheap or
dear, according to the plenty or scarcity of money;
and though we had Mynes of Gold and Silver at
home, and no Traffick into Foreign parts, yet we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47770:97"/>
should want necessaries from other Nations, which
proves that no Nation can live or subsist well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Foreign Trade and Commerce; for God and

more then they buy, do enrich a State or Kingdom

most commonly encrease their Enemies, and lose
their Friends; for first, it teaches men to observe, that
the onely way to Preferment, is to be against the State
or Government: Next, Since all that are Factious,
cannot be rewarded or preferr'd, by reason a State
hath more Subjects, then Rewards or Preferments,
there must of necessity be numerous Enemies; for
when their hopes of Reward fail them, they grow
more Factious and Inveterate then ever they were at
first: Wherefore the best Policy in a State or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
said my Lord, is to reward Friends, and
punish Enemies, and prefer the Honest before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious;
and then all will be real Friends, and profer
their honest service, either out of pure Love and
Loyalty, or in hopes of Advancement, seeing there
is none but by serving the State.</p>

                     <p>I asking my Lord one time, What kind of Fate
it was, that restored our Gracious King, <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, to His Throne? He answer'd, It was a
blessed kind of Fate. I replied, That I had observed
a perfect contrariety between the Fortunes of His
Royal Father, of blessed memory, and Him; for
as there was a division amongst the generality of the
people, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to His Destruction; so there was a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
and Agreement between them in King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second His Restauration; and as there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
malice amongst the people against the Father to
Depose Him; so there was a general Love for the
Son to Enthrone Him. My Lord answer'd, I had
observed something, but not all; for, said he, there
was a Necessity for the people to desire and Restore
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; but there was no Necessity
to Murder King <hi>Charles</hi> the First. For the Kingdom
being through so many Alterations and Changes of
Government, divided into several Factions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
was at last hurried into such a Confusion, that
it was impossible in that manner to subsist, or hold
out any longer; Which Confusion having opened
the Peoples Eyes, the generality being tyred with the
evil effects and consequences of their unsetled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
under unjust Usurpers, and frightned with the
apprehension of future dangers, began to call to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47770:105"/>
mind the happy Times, when in an uninterrupted
Peace they enjoyed their own, under the happy
Reign of their Lawful Soveraigns; and hereupon
with an unanimous consent Recall'd and Restor'd our
now gracious King; which, although it was opposed
by some Factious Parties, yet the generality of the
people outweigh'd the rest; neither was the Royal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wanting in their endeavours.</p>

                     <p>Asking my Lord one time, Whether it was easie
or difficult to govern a State or Kingdom? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
me, That most States were govern'd by secret
Policy, and so with difficulty; for those that govern,
are (at least, should be) wiser then the State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
they govern. I replied, That in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
a State was easily govern'd, if their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was like unto God's; that is to say, If Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
did Reward and Punish according to the desert.
My Lord answer'd, I said well; but he added, the
Follies of the People are many times too hard for the
Prudence of the Governour; like as the sins of men
work more evil effects in them, then the Grace of
God works good; for if this were not, there would
be more good then bad, which, alas, Experience proves
otherwise.</p>

aside when they had no more business or employment

mens actions falling out oftentimes contrary to their

twenty times in their Judgments. My Lord answer'd,
That his Judgment in that point seldom did miss, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he thought it weaker then theirs: The reason
is, said he, Because I judg most men to be like my self;
that is to say, Fools; when as you do judg them all
according to your self, that is, Wise men; and since
there are more Fools in the World then Wise men, I
may sooner guess right then you: for though my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

which yours will never do, except you can dive into

                     <p>I have observed, That my Noble Lord has always
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47770:110"/>
had an aversion to that kind of Policy, that now is
commonly practised in the world, which in plain
tearms is Dissembling, Flattery and Cheating, under
the cover of Honesty, Love and Kindness: But I
have heard him say, that the best Policy is to act just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
honestly and wisely, and to speak truly; and
that the old Proverb is true; <hi>To be wise is to be honest:</hi>
For, said he, That man of what Condition, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or Profession soever, that is once found out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
either in words or actions, shall never be trusted
again by wise and honest men. But, said he, A wise
man is not bound to take notice of all Dissemblers, and
their cheating Actions, if they do not concern him;
nay, even of those he would not always take notice, but
chuse his time; for the chief part of a wise man is to
time business well, and to do it without Partiality and
Passion. But, said he, The folly of the world is so
great, that one honest and wise man may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by many Knaves and Fools; and if so, then
the onely benefit of a wise man consists in the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he finds by his honest and wise actions, and that
he has done what in Conscience, Honour and Duty
he ought to do; and all successors of such worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

Skirmishes, then in, set-Battels, by reason those
happen almost every day, nay every hour in several
places.</p>

                     <p>Many in our late Civil-Warres, had more Title
then Power; for though they were Generals, or chief
Commanders, yet their Forces were more like a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
then a well-formed Army; and their actions were
accordingly, not set-battels, but petty Skirmishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
small Parties; for there were no great Battels
fought, but by my Lord's Army, his being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and best-formed Army which His Majesty had.</p>

of the World, to glorifie the present Power
and good Fortune, and vilifie ill Fortune and low
conditions; yet I never heard that my Noble Lord
was ever neglected by the generality; but was on the
contrary, alwayes esteemed and praised by all;

one that may be relied upon both for Trust and
Truth.</p>

                     <p>I have observed, That many instead of great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
make onely a great Noise; and like shallow
Fords, or empty Bladders, sound most when there is
least in them; which expresses a flattering Partiality,
rather then Honesty and Truth; for Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty

to mean Actions, when as ill Fortune darkens the

                     <p>I observe, That as it would be a grief to covetous
and miserable persons, to be rewarded with Honour,
rather then with Wealth, because they love Wealth,
before Honour and Fame; so on the other side, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Heroick and Meritorious Persons, prefer Honour
and Fame before Wealth; well knowing, That as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy

Fame and Honour is the best Reward of worth and

age, is grown to that height, that none will endure
the praise of any body besides themselves; nay, they'l
rather praise the wicked then the good; the Coward
rather then the Valiant; the Miserable then the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
the Traytor, then the Loyal: which makes

That Meritorious persons, for their noble actions, most
commonly get Envy and Reproach, instead of Praise
and Reward; unless their Fortunes be above Envy,
as <hi>Caesars</hi> and <hi>Elexanders</hi> were; But had these two

                     <p>I have observed, that many old Proverbs are very
true, and amongst the rest, this: It is better to be at
the latter end of a Feast, then at the beginning of a Fray;
for most commonly, those that are in the beginning of
a Fray, get but little of the Feast; and those that have
undergone the greatest dangers, have least of the

be the chief Governour of a Province, is not onely
a place of Honour, but much Profit; for they have a
great Revenue to themselves; whereas in <hi>England,</hi> the
Lieutenancy of a County is barely a Title of Honour,
without Profit; except it be the Lieutenancy or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Wars, whether Civil or Foreign, are not onely most
safe and free from danger, but most secure from Losses;
and though Heroick Persons esteem Fame before Life;
yet many there are, that think the wisest way is to be
a Spectator, rather then an Actor, unless they be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
