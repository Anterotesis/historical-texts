            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words as they are part of the Epistle for the day, so they do contain the chief Subject of our Labours, and of your Duty: we as <hi>fellow Labourers</hi> nor <hi>with him</hi> is not in the <hi>Greek</hi>) are to unite all our endeavours, to beseech you not to neglect this great Salvation, nor to receive in vain that <hi>Grace</hi> and Favour which is offered you in the Gospel: that is, not to hear it without the Impressions that it ought to make, and the effects that it ought to have upon you.</p>
            <p>In the end of the former Chapter St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to raise our Character very high.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> He calls us <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours for Christ.</hi> An Ambassadour is the second Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49413:4"/>
of dignity in the World, because it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the first. We come in the Name and stead of our Great Master. <hi>We pray men in Christs stead,</hi> and <hi>as tho God did beseech them by us.</hi> But that we might not swell too much upon so sublime a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, we are taken down again in the words of my Text: we are <hi>Workmen,</hi>

               </note> and <hi>Builders,</hi> and <hi>ought to be esteemed for our Works sake,</hi> as we labour faithfully, and diligently. We are called to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and not to authority, to perswade and not to command. The chief Subject that we are to be imployed in, is to perswade men <hi>to be reconciled to God,</hi> and not <hi>to receive his Grace in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One might think, that this was an easie task, in which we could not doubt of our success. What Criminal under the arrests of Justice, who has the time of his Execution in view would, need great perswasions to accept not only of a pardon, but of favour. This would go so naturally, that it would seem a superfluous labour to use strong arguments to prevail upon him. Were we but sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the load of sin, and guilt that is upon us, what humble supplicants would we be for <hi>Grace,</hi> in stead of needing motives to perswade us to accept of it.</p>
            <p>The best method for us both to maintain the dignity of our Character, as <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> and to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49413:4"/>
succeed in our Labours as <hi>joynt Workmen,</hi> is to live sutably to the station we are raised to, to represent as near as we can the vertues of him who sends us, and to direct the perswasions that we offer to others, so effectually to our selves, that the world may from thence believe, that we know our Arguments to be strong, because we our selves are convinced by them. If they observe not this, they will have little regard to all that we say: They will rather think, that it is for the sake of our Character, or rather as they will turn it, for the sake of our appointments, that we study to set out this matter with good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and a seeming strength of reason to others: but if we our selves do not yield to it, they will conclude, that we, who have oppo<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

The heart has a language peculiar to it self, which is well perceived by the hearts of others: how plain and neglect<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d soever it may be, as to the airs or graces of discourse. It will soften and melt more than laboured or artificial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures. Mankind will judge of our hearts by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49413:5"/>
our actions rather then by our words. That we may effectually beseech others, we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watch over our selves, that, according to the words which follow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>
               </note> we may <hi>give no offence in any thing,</hi> that we may neither give just grounds, nor even colourable pretences to others, to stumble by any thing that we may lay in their way: that so <hi>our ministry may not be blamed.</hi> The enemies of Religion will not think it enough to triumph over us, when we furnish them with such advantages; they will carry it further, and lay the blame, not where it ought to be laid, upon our persons: they will charge our Function with it, for they hate that more than our persons: we ought therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>our selves in all things</hi> in the conduct of our lives,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> and in the discharge of our function: in <hi>much patience,</hi> even tho we should fall under great <hi>afflictions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report</hi>: neither much cast down for the one, nor at all listed up for the other: and upon the whole matter we ought to behave our selves so, that tho impious and wicked men may study to make us pass for Impostors and <hi>deceivers</hi>; yet we may be found to be <hi>true</hi>: to be men of Integrity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>we beseech you also</hi>: that is, not only the Heathens, but the <hi>Saints</hi> or Christians of <hi>Corinth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49413:5"/>
not to receive this Grace in vain.</hi> They not only believed the Gospel, but were, when this Epistle was written to them, under deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Sorrow, for those Disorders and Scandals, for which he had treated them so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely in his first Epistle to them: yet no good temper of theirs, could supersede the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this exhortation: therefore he saies, <hi>we beseech you also.</hi> This is the end of our Ministry and the chief subject of our labours: therefore it is ever to be repeated, and to be alwayes insisted on, even to the greatest proficients, and in their best minutes. By <hi>the Grace of God</hi>: in the general si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification of the word, is to be understood the love and favour of God; but more particularly that goodness and mercy of God, which is revealed to us in the Gospel, which in opposition to the <hi>Law</hi> of Moses is called <hi>Grace: we are not under the Law but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace</hi>: and <hi>the Grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, teaching us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6 <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and godlily in this present world.</hi> To <hi>receive this Grace in vain,</hi> is not to have that sense of it, nor to make those acknowledgments for it, or returns to it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, and which it deserves.</p>
            <p>So then the Subject of this Discourse shall be,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I come therefore now to consider, what it is to <hi>receive this Grace in vain</hi>; and what sorts of men are guilty of it? I shall name three sorts.</p>
            <p>The 1<hi>st.</hi> those do certainly <hi>receive it in vain</hi>: in the highest degree, who treat it with scorn, who make it the subject of their prophane mirth, and diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> themselves with such Impieties, as an abused live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness can furnish them with from any of the parts of it. This is the peculiar unhappiness of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age, that men are not contented to <hi>receive this Grace in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 4.</note> but they <hi>turn it into lasciviousness</hi>: they are not satisfied with Indulgences to their Appetites and Passions, unless they gratifie them so far, as to sacrifice Religion and that Veneration, which by the consent of all Ages and Nations, has been payed to sacred things, to them. But if the men of that sort will bear so serious a thing, as the arguing closely; this may be asked them, would they have all Mankind set free from all restraints? If this is a right of Humane Nature, all men have an equal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49413:6"/>
claim to it: Now what a thing would the World be, if men were let loose; or rather if their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Passions were let loose, first on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and then on all the World about them. God knows the restraints of Religion are but feeble things: yet as to some Matters, and in some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances they have such influence, that without them the World would soon be turned into a Desart. Men would be as Beasts of prey, destroying and devouring one another: on the other hand what order and harmony, what confidence and mutual affection, what happiness in Families, and what peace in Neighbourhoods, would arise out of the sincere receiving of the Christian Religion and the submitting to its discipline? Every man would have all those Duties payed him, which arise out of the relation of others to himself; as he would become to all others every thing that in reason they could expect from him. The Doctrines of this Religion concerning God and his Attributes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Government of this World, and the prospect of another: the Theories concerning the Soul and a future State, and the Notions of good and evil, have in them such a majestick gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, such a sutableness, with the highest Ideas and the purest Thoughts that we are capable of, that in this respect there is nothing in Christianity, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49413:7"/>
does not well agree with the most elevated Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions that our Natures are capable of. The worship of this Religion is so free from all pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and vanity, so simple in the few Rites it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, so natural in the Acts that are commanded by it, and so easie in their performance, that take all the parts of this Religion together, the Morals, the Doctrines, and the Rituals of it, it is evident, that as every considering man will acknowledge, that the World could not be kept in order without any Religion; so there is no other that can be in any sort compared with this: and therefore every man must soon see cause to wish it were true: and to be inclined to believe a Doctrine that has nothing in it unworthy of the Divine Nature, and that does conduce so eminently to the perfecting of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. This is enough to dispose men to believe, that it may be true, even tho' they could not bring evident proofs to perswade them that it is so.</p>
            <p>But when that stands so clearly attested, when the Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles, were wrought in the sight of so many witnesses, and in such eminent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested Instances, which overcame the World so fast, that without any humane supports, nay in opposition to all the Powers on Earth, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

being received in so many remote Provinces, so early, by such numbers, who suffered much for it, and were ready to have suffered more; when I say, all this is well considered, here was a just reason once to receive this Gospel, upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that proved those, who delivered it, to have been sent of God. There is no reason to demand the continuance of such wonderful Works: such a rule of Life, and such a method of Worship, do so effectually recommend this Religion, that we ought to acquiesce in those Proofs that were once given: for whatsoever is once well and fully proved, ought never to be questioned again; unless there is somewhat in the nature of the thing, that gives a perpetual and just ground of doubting.</p>
            <p>So much in the way of Argument against this sort of men: As to perswasion, all that needs be offered to them, is to appeal to their own minds, if they do not feel a secret joy, when they do a good action, and as sensible a horrour when they commit some bad ones: if in dangers and fears, they do not feel somewhat within them, that drives them to God and Religion, if the prospect of death does not terrifie them at some times, and if the horrours of Conscience grow not someti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their Practices upon themselves to stifle and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the Rests of Education, and the dread of invisible Objects? If they will not hearken to those secret Intimations, that they feel within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they will neither consider what the World would be if there were no Religion in it, nor what it must be if men were sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; if they will neither consider the reasons that are offered for our Religion, nor the whole frame of it in it self, but will only fix on a few particulars, on which they think they can lay their censure and seed their mirth, all that remains to be said to such, is,<note place="margin">22 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. 4.</note>

            <p>A Second sort of those who <hi>receive this Grace in vain,</hi> are they who outwardly profess it, nay go into Parties and Factions, and become hot and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry about it, and yet do by no part of their whole behaviour shew that they inwardly believe it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> since they live as if they did not; and that with relation to many of the most express Rules and Principles of it. From hence it is, that the men of the former sort conclude, that these men believe it as little as they themselves do: and they infer from thence that since Religion does not bring its Votaries to that, which is both the clearest and the

most valuable part of it, therefore it can neither have that Truth, nor yet that strength in it, that is pretended, otherwise it would shew it self in more real effects.</p>
            <p>It is but too true, that the much greater part of those who are called Christians, are a reproach to their prosession: the higher their pretensions are, the reproach is the greater: and it never has such a certain effect for the hardning of others, as when any of our Prosession give just colour to this. The world observes us carefully as well as maliciously: and will lose none of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that we give them: they wait for our halting, and will not only Insult upon it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our selves, but will turn it against the doctrine that we profess with our mouths, while we deny it by our lives. These certainly who know their Masters will and do it not, shall be beaten with many stripes: they must expect the deepest portion in the miseries of the next State, even the portion of Hypocrites, who have been all their lives acting a part: for how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to make all the world conclude, that they believed nothing of it: but yet after all this is confessed,</p>
            <p>This ought not to strengthen the libertines in their Impieties: since it is certain, that men may be really convinced of some truths, and yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro want of attention to them, or thro the power of some of their appetites or Interests, they may pursue such a course of life as is most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to that, which they are well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of. Men do know, that a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their ill habits are gone too deep and becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49413:9"/>But after all, though such an outward form of Religion can be of little advantage to those who put it on; it is a great Blessing to a Nation to be brought under even the Profession of the Belief of it: For whatsoever is received as a National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if it is generally known, it must have such an influence on the Laws and Constitutions, the outward forms and decencies of such a Nation, that the Nation must come under another face, even by that outward appearance. In <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the two most refined pieces of Heathenism, though Wit and Eloquence, Reason and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy seemed to rise among them as high as any Age can pretend to: and a good Constitution; publick Liberty, a generous Education, Courage, the love of Vertue, and the love of their Country, seemed to raise them as high as Human Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted can go; Yet the Corruption of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Fables concerning their Gods, the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities of their Worship, together with all the ill consequences of it, were too hard for their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and good Government: the Corruption of their Religion went too deep, and was too early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to be overcome by Speculation or Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This their Philosophers saw well; and so they despaired of Reforming the World, unless those things could have been first Corrected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49413:10"/>The reverse of this appears, even in the most degenerated State of <hi>Christendome</hi>; which with all its faults, has another face than either <hi>Paganism</hi> or <hi>Mahometanism</hi>: and that appears yet more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as the Knowledge of this Religion has been spread. The outward appearance of <hi>Christendome</hi> is very far different now, from what it was before the Reformation; in which it was kept up from the world, and no more of it was let out than what was thought necessary to feed Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to maintain the Authority of those who had the Secret in their hands. Now things have another face; and though the greater part of those who are called Christians can expect nothing from it themselves, but an aggravated Condemnation, since they dishonour it more by their ill Practices, than they can pretend to support it by their Zeal; yet the publick Profession, and the general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, are great Blessings to Mankind.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> sort of those who <hi>receive this Grace in vain,</hi> are persons who with the Profession of Religion, do think themselves bound to join some Practice<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> agreeing with it; but by reason of some false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and through a vicious indulgence to their Sloth and other ill Inclinations, they form so low an Idea of a Religious life, and make such abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to themselves from that, to which at firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

view this Doctrine seems to oblige them, that they bring it down to a very small matter; to an external compliance with Forms and Institutions; to some outward Regularity; and some other easie Practices, by which they pacify their own Minds; they lay such Terrors as may be apt to arise upon them; and they form such Theories of the Attributes of God, and the Mercies of the Gospel, that they grow to be easie under those low degrees.</p>
            <p>It is certain, That the main design and chief effect of Religion, is to Purify our Hearts, to Reform our Natures, to Restrain our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our Appetites and Passions, and to spread such an influence through our whole Lives, through all our Powers, and in all our Actions, that the world may from thence, as from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentest as well as the powerfullest Argument, be convinc'd both of the beauty and force of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Christian Religion in its true Purity, and as it is received among us, is so stript of all those outward appearances of Pompous and Cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of severe or cruel Performances, that unless it reforms our Natures and our Lives, it has not enough in it to feed and support that false quiet that Superstition may give.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49413:11"/>A Heathen that Sacrific'd his Child, or Ruin'd his Fortunes to do honour to his Idol; a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that Fasts severely, that goes on chargeable Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, that exposes himself to all Dangers, believing the certainty of Fate; a Jew that paid Tythes of all his encrease, besides many costly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Oblations; that Travelled oft up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and that was not to lend upon Interest; and one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, that goes through severe Penances, and makes great Endowments for the Honour of a Saint, or the Redemption of a Soul; all these, I say, suffer so much in their Religion, it puts them both to so much Cost and Pain, that they may come to persuade themselves that it may be put to their Account, that God may be pleased, and Sins or Defects may be Forgiven upon their doing such Services, that put them to so great a Charge, and condemn them to such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities. But as to us and our Religion, What can we expect from it, if it has not a real influence upon our Hearts and Lives? Can we think that for our going sometimes (seldome God knows) to Prayers; our Assisting, that is being present, rather than joining with any Devotion at them; that our giving the Hearing, often a very wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, to a few Discourses; and our coming to Sacrament upon some great occasions, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49413:11"/>
with Law or Custom, rather than out of true Devotion; Can, I say, any man have such high thoughts of such Nothings, such mean and dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, or can he have such low thoughts of God and Religion, as to imagine that any value can be set on them? It is certain, that so simple and plain a Religion as ours is, which lays so little cost or trouble on us, can be of no value in the sight of God; it has not so much as an outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance considerable enough to give a false quiet: so that man who know that his Religion has not its real effects on him, has no reason to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon that account. Indeed such a half Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it lets in upon a man the belief of the Principles of it, so it lays him open to all the Checks and Terrors which arise out of these. It is strong enough to teach him his Duty, to make him know his Sins, and to apprehend the terrible Consequences of them; but it does not compleat its Work; it gives him only the Terrors, but lets him not in to the Joys of true Religion. He does not live in that purity, as to feel the Sense of a good Conscience; nor has he that right to the Promises of the Gospel, which may settle in him a firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, with a full assurance of his Love, and an entire dependance on his Providence. The Terrors of Guilt must make him start often, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49413:12"/>
the Corruptions that he feels still within him, are to him like those secret Pains and Diseases, that though they break not out into violent Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, yet are sensibly felt, and do imbitter our Lives, in spite of the highest affluence of wealth and pleasure that may compass us about on every side.</p>
            <p>After all, such a low state of Religion, though it is not to be rested on, yet is not to be neglected it may be a good beginning, and carry us on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

conformity to the Spirit of the Christian Religion. They become inwardly humble and modest, charitable and good natur'd, patient and gentle, serious and devout; they have moderate designs as to this world, and are contented with that state of life, and those Circumstances that God shall think sit to chuse for them: They consider this World as a Pilgrimage, and themselves as Strangers in it; and have their Eyes and Aims raised to a blessed Immortality beyond it; and so they lay down a stedfast Resolution to allow themselves in no sin, nor to compound for any one by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting higher degrees of zeal in any of the other parts of Religion. Thus their mind is framed within. To this Temper they join an exactness in their whole deportment, free from affectation or superstition. They begin at the most indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rules of Vertue; they are sincere and true, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in all their dealings, and faithful to all their Promises; they are harmless and innocent, shew neither envy nor spite to others, nor allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the liberty of Calumny or Detraction: They are chast, sober and temperate; ready not only to do good to all, but particularly to render good for evil: And in all these things they do not content themselves with low degrees, but study to shine; not to gratify Vanity, or to be observed; but to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49413:13"/>
set a pattern to others, and to do all the honour that they can to their holy Religion.</p>
            <p>But alas! if this is the extent of <hi>not receiving this grace in vain,</hi> how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ew are they who come within this Character? Oh where are they to be found? Some there are, God be thanked for it, in whom Religion shews both how amiable, and how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual it is. It is indeed an amazing and melancholy Consideration, that the number of them should be so small; nor does any thing prove more evidently the monstrous depravation of Human N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ture, than that a Religion composed of such Principles, and supported by such an Author, should prevail so little, and have so feeble an influence, even over those who seem to deliver themselves up to its discipline.</p>
            <p>This carries me to the second Point to which I proposed to speak, to wit, What are those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we have to offer the World, to persuade them <hi>not to receive this grace in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1<hi>st</hi> is imported in the very word it self; that it is <hi>Grace,</hi> and Favour. Generous minds va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue themselves on this; That how firm soever they may be against Terrors or Threatnings, they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conquer'd by the methods of love, and of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. They are rather too feeble here, and too apt to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49413:13"/>
be overcome by them. If we do either consider our own guilt, or the Majesty of that God who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this <hi>Grace</hi> to us, we will have tenderer impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this matter. I know the profane Tribe look upon all the sad reflections that men may be induced to make on their past lives, as the fumes of Melancholly, and as vapours that arise from cross Accidents, or uneasy Circumstances. If indeed we thought that a few sad Acts could compound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with God; be as sort of reparation to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all other Reckonings; this were a very mean thing, and a great foundation for Superstition. But when reflections on past Disorders are only meant in order to the humbling of our selves, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us claim to, and value the Mercies of God the more, and to the obliging us to be more watchful over our selves for the future, and more tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the failings of others; sad Reflections so managed, and so directed, must give us another view of things, and make us see our selves in other colours. These, while they sink us under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of what we have deserved, so they must raise in us a high sense of the Grace and Pardon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us in the Gospel;<note place="margin">7.

            <p>Another Consideration that may justly prevail on us to give this <hi>Grace</hi> a suitable reception, is the easy Conditions on which it is offered to us.

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s not, that we are only obliged to a sincere Obedience, and not to an entire one. The whole Law of God obliges us to the utmost extent that the Gospel has carried every branch of it; so that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49413:15"/>
and forsaking them in the main course of our life.</p>
            <p>Every man that deals honestly with himself, must soon be made to confess, That a sincere Obedience is not so far out of the reach of human Nature, but that he may hope to attain to it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the help of those Aids that are offered to him. And as every man knows what it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to mind his Health and his Affairs, even when he is guilty of some Errors and Omissions in it; he knows what it is to pursue a Science, or be employed in a Trade, even when he does not bend his utmost Application to it, nor use all possible Diligence in it; yet when it is that which he labours in, and does constantly follow, that becomes the Business of his life: He is sensible of many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that he makes, he corrects them, and studies to perfect himself by all the improvements that come in his way. From hence it will be easie to judge of our sincerity, whether we mind Religion with that honest care, and hearty application with which we pursue all our other concerns.</p>
            <p>The easiness of this condition, appears yet more fully in those supplies by which we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform it. Secret Assistances are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to us; but how they are conveyed, and how they have their effect upon us, is not easie for us to apprehend: Who can tell how it comes that our Food does animate and exhilarate our Minds? Or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49413:16"/>
that the Dew of Heaven should make the Earth Fruitful? So how much soever Prophane Minds may lay out their Wits, to make all this pass for the delusion of the Imagination, or for a false preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; yet all Good men may be appealed to, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not feel that upon their pursuing those methods that are offered in the Gospel; they do perceive such a change to grow upon them, that how insensible soever the steps of it may be, yet the whole, after some time becomes very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: They feel such a new turn in their Minds, such an alteration in their Inclinations and Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they become, as it were, moulded a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>new<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> their Thoughts have another ply, and their Mind another form. The unaccountableness of the way in which this is brought about, is no just prejudice against the truth of it: For as Air, though the weakest and most yeilding of all the bodies we know, yet is sometimes driven with such mighty force, that nothing can resist it; so our Saviour has compared the unseen motions of the Divine Spirit, to the invisible direction of the Air:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> Such opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have those secret Influences, that men are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them; and since what exalts the power of our Faculties, does at the same time weaken the opposition that can be made to them, by the difficulty of any performance; this removes the prejudice that may be raised from the feebleness of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49413:16"/>
our Natures, and the hardness of the conditions that are laid upon us. It is our sloth and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to undergo those Labours that we know our selves capable of, that makes the difficulties appear to be Insuperable.</p>
            <p>We must confess that we have seen such instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Power of Religion, in some Persons rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the highest Circumstances of Life, and who lived under the most constant observation; that by those we may be convinced how far Human Nature can go, or rather how far Religion can carry it. We have seen them shine with such a lustre, as well as influence, that by those apparent proofs we are forced to acknowledge, That those who attend to the methods that this Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, and do closely pursue them, rise up to a pitch that would scarce be credible, if it had not been evident beyond contradiction. To those instances we appeal the more confidently, that from them the world may judge how amiable a thing true Religion is; how excellent in it self, and how beneficial to Mankind. Such Impressions it is to be hoped will stick long, and will let us see what we may grow to be, if we are not wanting to our selves, and to those Assistances that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us so freely, that we may have them if we but ask them earnestly, and use them carefully.</p>
            <p>A third Argument by which we are to besecch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49413:17"/>
you to <hi>receive this grace,</hi> and to pursue the designs of it with due care, is, that our <hi>labour shall not be in vain.</hi> There is a vast reward laid up for them that walk worthy of this Gospel. And since it is of such infinite value, it is but suitable that our acceptance of the Gospel, and the effect it has upon us, should bear some proportion to our expectations from it, and to those hopes that are held forth to us by it. There is nothing more certain, than that in every wise Constitution there ought to be a proportion kept between the Rewards that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and those Services for which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; as the due encouragements to them, and as returns for them. Even the highest Generosity and Magnificence of bounty, must be conducted by this rule; for the proposing vast Rewards for slight matters, will always betray great want of judgment, in not setting a true value on things, either on the Rewards, or the Services, or perhaps on both: The Rewards may rise vastly above the true value of the Service; and it is fit they should do so, that men may be duely animated and heated by them; but then the Services must with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him that does them, be in proportion as great for him to do, as the Rewards are for him who gives them.</p>
            <p>The Rewards that our Religion proposes, are certainly far above all the Services that we can do:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49413:17"/>
And yet it does not derogate from the Infinite Wisdom of God to offer them to us; because the Services that he Commands in order to our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, are the highest that we are capable of. But to offer such Rewards to such slight Services, as the taking up of a Name, and a Profession, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>spousing of some Opinions, the being regular in some Forms, and the exteriour parts of our deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all this, as it is a mean thing in it self, so it is the insincere acting of a part; and therefore it cannot be supposed, that a God who is Infinitely Wise and Holy, would propose such a Reward to such Services that are so far below the Capacities and the Faculties that he has planted in us. But when we apply our selves sincerely to his Service, when we do set all our Powers to it, and give up our thoughts and studies, our time and our care to know and to do his Will; when we perceive that we make Religion the business of our Lives, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
