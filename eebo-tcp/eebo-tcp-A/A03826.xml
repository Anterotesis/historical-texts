            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:6667:3"/>
to see a Ladie, a tender youth, sad, solitare, and sanctified, oft sighing &amp; weeping through the conscience of sinne. Would to God that all the Ladies of this Land, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they of the greatest ranke, were of the like modest and godlie disposition: for the most part of them we see, to delite mair in couetousnes &amp; in oppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the puire for the intertainement of their pride, or else to spend their dayes in chambering, wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, decking of their bodies in delicat feeding, and in satisfying their lustes, nor to haue ane incorrupt and holie hart, with a meik aud quiet spirit. Araying themselues in cumly apparel, with shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes and modestie, and with good workes, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Iesus Christ hath commanded them. 1. Tim. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 3. 3. Let such women remember that a day they shall appeare &amp; giue a compt before the judgement seat of Christ, and shall receaue a rewarde in their bodies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their workes. I would wish them to haue this weightie saying of the Apostle euer recent in memorie, as a dicton: <hi>Shee that liues in pleasure, is dead vvhile shee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. But yee liue more in murmuring and in paine: Therefore yee shall rejoyce eternallie. Now to come to the point, hauing composed in my youth a few songes in verse to the glorie of God: seeing the custome of men is to dedicate their workes to their fauorites and patrones: Shall it not be lawfull to me also, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, to present vnto you (a faithfull and beloued Ladie) a part of my little labours? And sa meikle the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because I know ye delite in poesie your selfe; and as I vnfainedly confes, excelles any of your sexe in that art, that euer I hard within this nation. I haue seene your compositiones so copious, so pregnant, so spirituall, that I doubt not but it is the gift of God in you. Finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so little a worke as this is, requires a short epistle, I
<pb facs="tcp:6667:3"/>
take my leaue, not doubting but my good meaning shall be fauorablie accepted. Continue (good Ladie &amp; sister) in that Godlie course which ye haue begun: let nothing be done vpon ostentation. Loue your Husband: haue a modest care of your familie, and let your cheefe care be casten vpon the Lord Iesus, who will recompense vs at his comming.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S It is a thing verie customable vnto thee, O cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious youth, greatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to delite in poesie, ather by playing the parte of a poet thy selfe, or by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy spirit in reading and proclaiming the compositions of other men: So is it as common to thy indiscreit age to make a chuse of that naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie subiect of fleshly and vnlawfull loue. In such sort that in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces courts, in the houses of greate men, and at the assemblies of yong gentilmen and yong damesels, the cheife pastime is, to sing prophane sonnets, and vaine ballats of loue, or to rehearse some fabulos faits of Palmerine, Amadis, or other such like raueries &amp; such as ather haue the art or vaine poetike, of force they must shew themselnes cunning followers of the dissolute ethnike poets, both in phrase and substance, or else they shall be had in no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Alas for pittie! Is this the right vse of a Christians talent to incense the burning lustes of licentions persons by such euill ex amples and allurements? Art thon (O miserable man) well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, that day &amp; night busies thy braine to invent these things which may foster the filthie vice and corruption that naturallie is seased in the harts of all men? Was ii to this end, that thy mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sent thee in the world, to be an instrument of wickednes? or hes he giuen thee such gifts, and viuacitie of spirit, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in vanitie, and prouoking others to vncleannes? knowes thou not that thou must render account of euerie idle word that proceedes out of thy mouth? And that thy vngodlie conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion banishes the spirit of GOD from thee? suffocats thy gude giftes, rottis thy conscience, and makis thy GOD to become ane Enemie against thee, What count thinkes thou to giue vnto the,
<pb facs="tcp:6667:4"/>
iust and fearefull iudge of the world (who doubtles will craue it of thee, thou knowes not how suddainely) that hath employed thy time, and abused his good giftes after this manner? I think the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of it the more terrible, because sometime I delighted in such fantasies my selfe, after the maner of riotous young men: and vvere not the Lord in mercie pulled me a backe, &amp; wrought a great repentance in me, I had doubtlesse run forward and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my time &amp; studie in that prophane and vnprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, to my owne perdition. For vvhat seekes man by that kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of studie? nothing but a name, but a vaine praise, and an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued commendation. Why shuld thou not then (aspiring youth) rather bestowe thy gude gifts to the right vse, to wit, to the glory of god, and to the weil of thy brethren? which thow sall do when by thy poesie or prose thow declares the mercie, the iustice, the power, the providence, the wisedome, the holines, the gudenes, or wondrous works of thy God vnto the world: Whereof thow may haue so large a field in the scriptures, that al thy pithie words, thy figures of Rhetoricke, thy subtile argumentes, thy skill in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, metaphysicke, mathematicke, or morall philosophie, shal not be sufficient to expres the dignitie thereof. Would thou intreat of prodigious miracles? luke the bookes if Genesis and Exod, or the workes of our sauiour, of the Prophets and Apostles? Would thow haue a subiect of valiant deids of armes? read the buikes of Iosua and the Iudges. And of the Kings of Israel &amp; Iudah? Wald thou haue store of wise sentences, read the Prouerbs, and Ecclesiastes? walde thou haue a subiect of loue? looke the song of songs, of the loue betuixt Christ and his kirk. Would thow reioyce, or lament praise or disprais; comfort, or threaten; pray, or vse imprecation Imitat the ald Hebrew Dauid in his Psalmes, as a paterne of all heavinly poesie. In a word, the high &amp; holy mysteries, &amp; felicitie of the life to come, conteined in the auld &amp; new testament, may be a more noble and worthie subiect, vvhere vpon the hole cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Eloquence of mans loftie Spirite should be employed
<pb facs="tcp:6667:5"/>
nor vpon these trifles, &amp; sensuall villanies. But thou will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture say, that such a subiect is ouer graue, and that a light &amp; merrie matter were more agreable to yong folks: I answere thee, that indeede vanitie and corruption are most agreeable to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature: But let that mirrines wherein is sinne, be far from all good Christians. But if thou would meditate on this spirituall subiect, and exercise thy selfe in the Law of the Lord with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, thou should with time alter thy fleshlie affectiones, and nourish thy spirituall gifts: In such sorte, that thou shal detest that which is sensuall and brutish, and delight in that which is holie and pleasant in the sight of the Lord, and by thy example shall sturre vp others to doe the like: Heirefore, I haue heere set downe before thee, a few spirituall songs, begun in my youth, and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in my wraslings with the world, and the flesh, whereby thou may cleerely see what aboundance of good matter is offered, which the most parte of Poets foolishlie reiectes, and dedicates their hole studie to things moste vile and contemptible. Farther, I contemne not the moderate and trew commendation of the vertuous, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes of good men: nor yet the extolling of liberall sciences: But thou hast notable examples in the French toong set foorth by <hi>Salust</hi> of <hi>Bartas.</hi> Onely thus much haue I written in rude Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and hask verses, to prouoke the more skilfull in that art to flee higher, and to encourage the meaner sort to follow. To the effect, that the spirits of men in all their actions may be applyed to the right end, euen to glorifie God, who must euer sanctifie &amp; prosper the interprises of his owne.
