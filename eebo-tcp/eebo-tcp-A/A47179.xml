            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is it not as he is both God and Man, and as being Man, as he dyed for us, and roſe again, and is in Heaven, our Advocate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator with the Father?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not therefore a great error in them, who teach that it is ſufficient to our Salvation, to believe in Chriſt, only as he is God, and as he is the word, and light, that lightens every Man that comes into the world, without all knowledge of Chriſt crucified, and raiſed from the dead, and without all faith in him as ſuch?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a lively operative faith, that worketh by love, and is fruitful in good works, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alone, but is always accompanied with hope, charity, temperance, juſtice, humility, meekneſs, patience, holy fear, and other Evangelical Virtues, and fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. 22.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, for although in God's ordinary way, it hath pleaſed God to ſave Men by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, and that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, as outwardly taught by preaching or reading, yet God is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to work that faith in any, by his Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is not the neglect of hearing the word outwardly taught, and of uſing other outward means of grace, where they can be had, ſuch a hainous ſin, that if continued in, takes away all ground of hope of Salvation?</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth it appear, that Baptiſme with Water is an Inſtitution and Ordinance of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From his Command to the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Go therefore and teach all Nations Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and the general practiſe of it, in the Apoſtles days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſome ſay, it was not outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with Water that is there commanded, but the inward Baptiſme with the Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is a great error, they might as well ſay, it was not outward teaching, with audible words, that was there commanded, but inward teaching by the Spirit; we find not any where in Scripture, a command or power given to Men, to Baptiſe with the Spirit, that power only belonging to God, and to Chriſt, but we find a promiſe given by God, that Chriſt ſhould Baptiſe with the Holy Ghoſt, as was accordingly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>John</hi> 1.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the chief end and uſe of Baptiſme with Water?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a Seal of Gods receiving us into the Covenant of Grace, a badge or token of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, a means of Grace, a ſign of our waſhing from ſin, and the forgiveneſs of our ſins, and of our regeneration, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from being Aliens and Strangers to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt and of his Church; therefore it is, that Baptiſme, (by a figure of the ſign receiving the name of the thing ſignified) is called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing Baptiſme is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, are not all baptiſed Perſons, ſolemnly

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What proof is there in Scripture, for the practiſe of the Supper, by the outward Elements of Bread and Wine with Prayer and Thankſgiving?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Command of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. and practiſe of Believers in obedience to that Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſome ſay, Chriſt did Command it, but until he ſhould come again, and now that they witneſs him come, the ſubſtance and thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied they need not the ſign or ſhadow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is alſo a great error in them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it only of his inward coming. The Bread and the Wine in the Supper were real ſigns of his Body outwardly broken, and his Blood outwardly ſhed, and did reſpect the Man Chriſt, who is not come again, ſince he aſcended.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is another Seal of the Covenant of Grace, a ſign of our being ſpiritually nouriſhed by Chriſt as by Meat and Drink, that we eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, by Faith, that ſo we may receive of his Spirit ſtill more, to quicken, refreſh, and nouriſh us, a memorial of his Death and

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How ought Perſons to be prepared for the receiving the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By ſerious examination, of the ſincerity of their Faith, and whither they are in true Charity, alſo with earnſet Prayer, and true ſpiritual hunger and thirſt, to enjoy and feed upon Chriſt in that Divine Inſtitution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
