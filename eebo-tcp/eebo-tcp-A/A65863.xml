            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <body>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> WHether do the Scriptures speak of Three Persons in the God-head, according to your own Rule, in these express words; let us see where it is written? Come do not shuffle, for we are resolved that the Scriptures shall buffet you about, and that you shall be whipped about with the Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Where doth the Scripture speak of Christ's Righteousness imputed unto Unrighteous men, who live in their sins; and that in their Unrighteousness and Sins they shall live and die? seeing that Faith purifies the heart from unrighteousness; And he that believes passes from Death to Life, and so from Sin that brought Death. And he that receives Christ, receives Righteousness it self by Faith in him, the Lord, the Righteousness, this is Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> And where doth the Scripture say, That a man shall not be made free from sin? and that it is not attainable in this Life? Let us see where ever Christ, or the Prophets, or Apostles, preached such Doctrine? Give us plain Scripture, without adding or diminishing, for Christ's, bids men be perfect; and the Apostle spoke Wisdom among them that were perfect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> You that deny Perfection, do ye not deny the One Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Christ Jesus, who hath perfected for ever them that are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Do you not deny the Blood of Christ Jesus, in trampling it under your feet, and the Blood of the new Covenant; which Blood
<pb facs="tcp:58882:3"/>
of Christ cleanseth from all sin; and whose garments are made white by the Blood of the Lamb; and he throughly purges his floor with his Fan, and gathers his Wheat into his Garner.</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> And did Christ make Satisfaction for the sins of men, that they should live and die in their sins? for he came to save his People from their sins; and so he Died for them, that they should not live to them, but to God through him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Where do the Scripture speak of a Trinity of distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation?</hi> give us plain Scripture for it, without shuffling, adding or diminishing, you that talk so much of Scripture to be your Rule; for the Father, Word, and Spirit, this is owned according to Scripture, and they agree in One. And we charge you to give us a plain Scripture that saith there are three sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Persons; let us see Scripture, we will have Scripture for it, or otherwise be silent.</p>
                  <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> And where do the Scriptures say, That Christ the Light of the World (which enlighteneth every one that cometh into the World) is not sufficient to guide men to Salvation? Christ saith, Believe in the Light, that you may become Children of the Light, and Children of the Day; and who walk in the Light, there is no occasion of stumbling; And this is the Condemnation that Light is come into the World, and men love Darkness rather than Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their deeds be evil; And is not the Light sufficient, that lets a man see whether his deeds be wrought in God, read <hi>John</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> Where doth the Scripture say, from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> That the true Faith of God is without Works? Hath not Faith works that purifies the heart? Doth it not give Victory? Will you deny the Works of Faith, because the Works of the Law was denyed by the Apostle?</p>
                  <p n="9">9<hi>thly.</hi> Where doth the Scripture say, That it self is the Word of God? Do you not belye the Rule here? For, doth not the Scripture say, That Christ is the Word? and the Scriptures are Words: read <hi>Exodus</hi> 20, and <hi>Revelation</hi> 22. He that adds to these Words, and takes from these Words, the Plagues of God are added to him. So see whether you are not adders to these Words, as it is made appear before? And Christ saith, My words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and Life, &amp;c. And in many places of Scripture God saith, My Words: Doth not Scripture signifie Writing? For all your high
<pb facs="tcp:58882:3"/>
Schollar-ship, you may go to the <hi>English School-Master,</hi> and it will tell you what it signifies; What is all the writing in Peoples hearts? Is Paper and Ink in Peoples hearts? Come, do not cheat People, but confess truth; you affirm Scripture to be the Rule, but are found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rule. But, what is all the Scripture the Rule, from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to walk by and practice? Or, what part of Scripture is the Rule? are <hi>Herods</hi> words, <hi>Pharoahs</hi> words, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezars</hi> words, <hi>Judas</hi> words, the <hi>Jewes</hi> words, <hi>Jobs Friends</hi> words, the <hi>Devils</hi> words, the <hi>Offerings</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices? &amp;c.</hi> Come, what part of Scripture is your Rule? Distinguish: For you say the Scripture is your Rule? Is it all a Rule for practice? Must we obey every tittle of it? for we own the Scriptures more then you do, which Holy Men of God gave forth, Christ Jesus, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets; and they made a distinction, but you make none: Do not go with your Malice and envious minds, to possess the People, and say, That we dis-esteem the Scriptures, for we esteem Scripture more than you do, that have kept People under your Teaching, that they might be paying of you, and so make a Trade of them.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures speaks plentifully concerning Christ being the Word of God: God is the Word, is not this Scripture? And in the Beginning was the Word, and all things were made by the Word: and, were all things made by the Scriptures? — And we say the Scriptures are a better Rule than your Directory; for if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the Rule, why do you set up a Directory to be your Rule? What! will you bore out Peoples eyes, that they shall not see how you dissemble: And why did you make a Church Faith at <hi>Savoy</hi> in eleaven dayes time, if the Scriptures be your Rule? But it seems the Scriptures are not a sufficient Rule for you; but your Directory and your Church Faith, it seems, is your Rule; Scriptures are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be your Rule. And, why do you deny Common Prayer, and set up a Directory and a Church Faith of your own making? And there, in your Directory, do you not set up your Imaginations and Meanings above Scriptures? Come, People will not sell their Wits, Reason, and Understanding: Come, People, you all know that when you come to discourse with these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants</hi> about Scriptures, who say it is their Rule, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fall, and give it a meaning, and say it is their Opinion and
<pb facs="tcp:58882:4"/>
Judgement, and conceive it to be so. — And so then the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> Meanings, and Opinions, and Thinkings, and Conceivings, and Imaginations, and Judgements; this must be the Rule, and not the Scripture: then you must not take it as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speake The <hi>Quakers</hi> will take it Literally, cry they, and these have been the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> tricks, this long time. — What think you, do we not know your tricks? And so you would make People believe what an Esteem you have of Scriptures; when it is nothing but Meanings, and old Directory, and Church Faith! Do you think we have forgot your old Malice and Envie, when you haled above three thousand of us to Prison in the other Powers dayes, and persecuted to Death about thirty three, which stands upon Record to this day, whose Blood you have drunk, and mingled with your Sacrifice, and whose innocent Blood lies upon your heads; Was the Scripture your Rule to do thus? Nay, Christ bids you love Enemies, let Scripture be your Rule! Have you not been like <hi>Judas,</hi> and the Persecuting <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the true Christians? You have banished the Rule which is to love Enemies, and love one another: And Christ saith, Freely ye have received, freely give: But you will not give freely, for you have not received freely; You will have the Club and the Bagg; For, what havock have you made of them that could not put into your mouths! what Imprisoning and spoyling of Goods did you make when you had Power! this is not Gospel; this is besides the Rule: You are worse than the outward <hi>Jewes,</hi> for where did they ever take trebble damages of them that did not hire them? It was time for the Lord to bring you down, who are judged by your own Rule.</p>
                  <p n="10">10<hi>thly.</hi> And why do you belye the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with saying, That your good Works (that is of self) are the Meritorious Cause of Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ Works all our Works in us, and for us, who is our Justifier; <hi>S. F.</hi> hath sufficiently cleared this matter, and answered you.</p>
                  <p n="11">11<hi>thly.</hi> And where doth the Scripture say, The Works of Faith, and the Works of Grace, and the Fruits of the Spirit, are sinful?</p>
                  <p n="12">12<hi>thly.</hi> And where do the Scriptures hold forth the Sprinkling of Infants, and call it an Ordinance; and tell of a Sacrament, and call

it an Ordinance. Let us see Scripture for these things, and that the Apostles practised them as you do; and whether your practises were according to theirs? And have you the same Power and Spirit as they had that gave forth Scriptures? Answer plainly in plain words of Scripture, that you do not err from the Words and Rule which you say is your Rule.—But do you not remember, you <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> what havock you made of the Goods of the People of God, whom in scorn you called <hi>Quakers,</hi> because they would not pay for the Bread and Wine you eat and drunk; you drunk it your selves, and eat it your selves, and made them Pay for it; did the Apostles ever do so, to spoyl any ones Goods, because they would not pay for their Bread and Wine they eat and drunk? Come, let us see your Scripture, your Rule, which you boast so much of for these things, who make People believe it is your Rule; let us see a Rule for this: But you grumble, because you have not Power to fall upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to make them pay for your Bread and Wine you eate and drink, as you have done formerly; and then when you have done, boast that Scripture is your Rule, and you say this is Gospel, this is Glad Tydings, is it? and then you spoyl their Goods for your Bread and Wine. Where were you in the time of Persecution? we could see but few of you then; for then you slunk into Holes and Corners, &amp; had out your Scouts; and now when you have a little Liberty, what a bawling you make against <hi>Quakers?</hi> You are a little hungry bitten, because you have not Tythes, and Easter Reckonings, and Midsummer Dues, and Money of the <hi>Quakers</hi> for your Bread and Wine; will you avenge your self of the <hi>Quakers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13<hi>thly.</hi> And do you not say, That your Sanctification, and Justification, and your Prayers, and Graces, and Faith, all are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect? (as manifest in you) Is not Christ Justification, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? And must you not Pray in the Spirit of God? And is it not perfect? What darkness is this! Must not Christ be in you? And, is not he in you? and Faith in you? and the Spirit of God in you to Pray by? And so if it be imperfect, then it is your own Praying, and your own Justitication, and Sanctification, and Faith, and Application; it's of your own making, and not Christ's; for Christ is perfect, who Sanctifies and Justifies, and his Spirit is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:58882:5"/>Priest <hi>Danson, Presbyterian,</hi> how now! Dost thou not bring Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to prove thy Assertions, and thy Imaginations? it seems Scripture is not sufficient: Thou wouldst make People believe, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were against the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> both; but now they must be the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Patrons, and yet could make People believe that the Scriptures were their Rule; but this must be their Rule, the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Heathen:</hi> Read <hi>Danson</hi>'s <hi>Synopsis</hi> of his <hi>Quakerism,</hi> what a bundle of Lyes he hath drawn up together; he may take them home to himself.</p>
                  <p n="14">14<hi>thly.</hi> And why do you <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cry against the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light, which is Christ, as being but an Heathenish light? and now to oppose them, you are fain to run to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> to find Arguments; and then tell People the Scripture is your Rule (O Deceipt!)</p>
                  <p n="15">15<hi>thly.</hi> Where doth the Scripture speak of an Humane Nature of Christ in Heaven? Is not Christ and his Body Glorified, and he the Lord from Heaven; for is not Christ's Nature Divine, and his Soul Divine, which comes out from God? And where is his Soul called Humane? Come to the <hi>Accidence</hi> again, thou that professes thy self to be a great Schollar, tell us what Humane signifies.</p>
                  <p n="16">16<hi>thly.</hi> Thou speaks of Three Persons; and a man is a Person; What doest thou infer from this? Is God a Man? No, he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I tell thee the Scripture sayes so: Is the Holy Ghost a Man? It is call'd the Holy Spirit; and Christ was a man, the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. — So it seems the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> can say little of himself, but he hath learned something of the Learned <hi>Wotton,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> the second, but he doth not tell us what he is, whether a <hi>Papist</hi> or an <hi>Heathen.</hi>

                  <p n="17">17<hi>thly.</hi> Thou sayest the Soul is part of man's Nature; Where doth the Scripture, thy Rule, say so? For the Scripture saith, <hi>God breathed into man the breath of Life, and man became a Living Soul.</hi>

                  <p n="19">19<hi>thly.</hi> The Priest saith concerning that distinction in the God-head, it cannot be apprehended by us; — and yet he will call them Three separated Persons, and a Trinity; and gives them Names which are not apprehended by you; you might have been silent then in what you did not apprehend: And yet you will lay Principles down concerning God, the Son, and Spirit, which you do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend your selves, but presume above what is written, and so go contrary to your Rule.— Should you not call the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as the Holy Men did call them in the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p n="20">20<hi>thly.</hi> In the 4th <hi>page</hi> thou sayest, The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are said to be Three, yet but one God; and yet thou sayest we do not know what to call those Three, but Three Persons; and there is that ascribed to them (thou sayest) Properties, which agree not simply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Father, Son, and Spirit agree; but that which you do ascribe, do not agree with Scripture with them, nor among your selves about them. — And if you do not know what to call the Father, Son, and Spirit, but Three Persons, you might have holden your Tongues then, till you did know, who calls them and gives them Names contrary to Scriptures, and the Holy Men of God, who called them Father, Son, and Spitit, who were wiser Men then any of you.</p>
                  <p n="21">21<hi>thly.</hi> And again, in thy 4th <hi>page</hi> thou sayest Thre Subsistents (that is Persons, though not strictly, yet proportionably, or Anologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally so called) in the God-head.</p>
                  <p>People! Did you ever hear such a Mash? We do charge this <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to make these words good by plain Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Subsistents, Three Persons, and Analogically; Is this a Scripture word People? Where did the Apostles use any such dark words? Hadst
<pb facs="tcp:58882:6"/>
thou not this word from the <hi>Heathen</hi>? Well, Mark Reader, he sayes there are Three Persons, and Three Subsistents in the God-head; and hath not he made Four here? If there be Three in the God-head he hath made Four; for, what is the God-head? God is One, and he hath made Three besides; see <hi>pag.</hi> 4. of his Book. — And so, in the <hi>Title</hi> of his Book, he speaks of Three Persons in the God-head; Are there not Four then? And in the said 4th <hi>page,</hi> he sayes, he thinks he hath answered all the Arguments of the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi>; he doth but think so, it seems.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scripture saith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. That <hi>there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.</hi> But he doth not say that they are separated nor distinct, neither doth call them Persons. — And thus we call them, as the Scriptures call them, Father, Word, and Holy Ghost; and the Apostle doth not say they are separate, nor distinct; and we are not to presume above what is written.—</p>
                  <p>We charge you, <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to give us printed Scriptures for these following words; and let us see in what Chapter and Verse they are printed; Come to the Rule, and do not presume above what is written: <hi>Concreet, Abstract, Predicate, the Relative, Co-eternity, Co-essentiallity, Co-equallity, Communication of Properties, Co-essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allities, Modallities, Suppossitallities, Incommunicable Subsistances,</hi> and <hi>Hypostatical Unions.</hi> — Come, are these words spoken in the Rule, the Scriptures? let us see the Chapter and Verse, that we may see where such terms are spoken of the Father, Word, and Spirit, which are one; Had you not them rather from your old Logical and Philosophical Books? And have not they been your Rule for such words, and not the Scriptures, which the Holy men of God spoke forth.</p>
                  <p>Thou sayest in the 12th <hi>page</hi> of thy Book, That we must not take Man here for a Person, but a Nature, as you do God, &amp;c. And yet before, thou saidst, That Man was a Person; and so it is the Nature that is a Person, and not the Man, nor God: but thou hast not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to us what a Person is, nor what the word Person signifies, for all thy Schollar-ship. —And thou sayest, Ye mean no more then the Name Man to be attributed to <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; because the same human Nature specifically agrees unto them; and so is the Name God attributed to each Person, because the same Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture subsists in each of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58882:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a dark thing, to whom will you liken me, saith God? [like <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> or like unto some corrupt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son] The Saints were partakers of the Divine Nature; What do you say of them therefore; And where do the Scriptures speak that the Nature of God is so simple, &amp;c. where learned you this word? And where doth the Scripture use these words <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Integrals</hi> of the God-head? and this is your Conceptions and Notions of God, and the Word, and the Spirit, as it's said in the 13th <hi>page</hi> of <hi>Danson</hi>'s Book; It's a Conception and Notion indeed: — For you say in the same 13th <hi>page,</hi> The Conception or Notion that we have of the Father, &amp;c. so it's but a Notion and Conception, it seems, that you have of the Father; — and then sayes (suppose) as a subsistent, or Person, &amp;c. But which of these terms it is, this Notionist hath not declared to us in his 13th <hi>page</hi>; — And this Notionist goes on in the said 13th <hi>page,</hi> and sayes, Nor can we say that the Notion of the Father, as one Person in the God-head, includes the Son; nor the Notion of the Son, as one Person in the God-head, includes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Didst thou ever hear the like! This is but a Notion of the Father, and a Notion of the Son indeed. — And are these <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Priests like to interpret Scripture with their Notions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and Suppositions; no, no. No one knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him; — Nor none knows the Son but the Father; and to know God, and Jesus Christ, is Life Eternal; and none can call him Lord but by the Holy Ghost.—And so this Knowledge is beyond all your false Conceptions, Suppositions, and Notions; And if the Holy Ghost, the Saints bodies be the Temple of it, which Holy Ghost leads them into all Truth: And if the Holy Ghost be a Person, then have not the Saints a Person in their bodies? And why did not the Apostle say, That their bodies were the Temples of a Person, according to your Doctrine and Rule,— the Holy Ghost is a Spirit, — and so let us see that Scripture which gives the Holy Ghost the Name of a Person.</p>
                  <p>And he speaks again in his 14th <hi>page</hi> of Three distinct Persons are one with the God-head; — Now Reader, is not here Four? to wit, Three Persons and the God-head; But Reader, we charge him to give us Chapter and Verse for this Doctrine, for we must order him with the Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58882:7"/>And then he tells us of a Notion of the Father and including the Son, it's but his own Notion; — for if he had known him he would have spoken in a form of sound words, whereby he might not have been reproved.</p>
                  <p>And again, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> sayes, the Three Persons are distinct, and the Rule is to be understood that they are One among themselves only in respect of that, wherein they agree not simply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Reader take notice, he sayes, The Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, which he calls Three Persons, doth not agree simply; Is not this contrary to Scripture? What agreement is this which is not simply? What! separate distinct Persons, not agreeing simply! — Come, what is this agreement then, if it be not an agreeing sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? Tell us what it is by Chapter and Verse; thou sayes the Scripture is the Rule?</p>
                  <p>Where doth the Scripture say, That the Father, Son, and Spirit doth not agree simply? — Didst thou not say, That God was so simple, that he admitted of no parts; what agreement is this if it be not simple? What is it then? tell us.</p>
                  <p>Dost thou not abuse the Father, Son, and Spirit, and Scriptures? clear thy self; and make this good, That the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not agree simply; if not simply, then tell us how; and give Chapter and Verse for it out of the Scriptures, or else acknowledge thy self to be of a <hi>Sandy Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing thou sayst, A Man is a Person, and God is a Person; and the Scripture saith God is a Spirit, and Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost, the begotten of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Was Christ the Image of the Father, as he was of the Generation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Adam?</hi> or according to the <hi>Spirit?</hi> —Whether of these was he the express Image of his Father's substance, because thou calls the Father a Person; — And the Scripture sayeth, He suffered according to the Flesh,— which he did not die as he was God; and the Scripture calls him Son of Man, and Son of God, and he being the express Image of his Fathers substance; see the Old Translations.</p>
                  <p>And dost thou not, in thy 16th <hi>page</hi> of thy <hi>Synopsis,</hi> bring the Greek Philosophers to prove the Persons? Yes: How now <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Priest, thou hast run beside thy own Directory and Scripture both, but the Greek Philosophers must be thy Rule, and Leader;

surely People will not alwayes have their Eyes blinded by you, Christ is come to open them.</p>
                  <p>And in the 17th <hi>page</hi> of his Book, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> saith, that <hi>Hypostasis</hi> must be rendred Person, or Subsistent, or some word to that Effect, he sayes. —</p>
                  <p>So People see it must be some word, but what it must be he knows not; and so in this manner they are giving Names to Christ and God, besides the Rule of Scripture; we charge thee shew us a Verse in Scripture that speak such Language, and where one word may be put for another by <hi>Metalepsis?</hi> and so leave People in Doubts and Questions; you are going beside your Scripture and Rule, that at last People shall not know what to call God and Christ. — So the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> must give us Scripture; For we will not be satisfied with your Notions, and Whymsies, and false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which you have from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Philosophers,</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi>; We do command you to give us Scripture, Chapter, and Verse, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> for these things plainly,—seeing you are of late perked up in a way of scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against us (not like the Holy Men of God, Patient and Meek, and apt to Teach) as you may see in the latter end of your Brother <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>'s Book; Is that the Language of a Christian? No; He hath declared what spirit you are of, <hi>Rabshecha</hi>'s spirit, railing, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of the way of Truth; he thinks to overcome by Railing, and complaining, not by Love; nay, the Lamb must have the victory.</p>
                  <p>Whether or no was Christ's Blood shed for All men, and by it Justifies All men, they living in their sins, and not believing in it; are they saved by their saying they believe in the Blood, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Light (which Christ Commands) and become Children of the Light; and they say they believe, and yet not pass from Death to Life, and from sin that brings Death? And whether or no any are cleansed from all sin by the Blood of Christ, but such as walk in the Light of Christ, as in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. And so whether or no are those Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified who believe not in the Light of Christ, nor passes from Death to Life, nor walks not in the Light, whether or no are those Justified by Christ's Blood, and have not the Testimony of Justification in them, as in the accompt to God Christ's Blood was shed for All men; but for a man to come to partake of this Justification, is it not to feel the Blood sprinkling the Heart and Conscience? — For the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Figure, had Blood sprinkled upon them in the outward Offerings; — Come answer us by Scripture? Do not daub up People with untempered Mortar; do you know the Mortar that is tempered?</p>
                  <p>Whether or no was Christ an Offering for the sins of the whole World, and died for the sins of the whole World?</p>
                  <p>Whether or no all the sinners and ungodly of the whole World are Justified by his Death, and by his offering up once for all? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in plain words.</p>
                  <p>And whether or no you will make a Sect, that he died for some ungodly and some sinners only; for the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> were the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ungodly: But he that believes, is born of God, and they receive Christ, and he gives them Power to become the sons of God, and they know he died for them, and have the Testimony of it, and have the Benefit of his Death and Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>And what was the Light that shined in the Darkness, and the Darkness comprehended it not?</p>
                  <p>What was the Spirit that the Wicked grieved, vexed, and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? Where is it? and what is the Spirit of Truth that reproves the World of sin? Where is it that leads the Saints into all Truth? Come, we must have plain Scripture for these things.</p>
                  <p>What is the Law that God will write in the Heart, and put in the Mind, that all shall know Him from the greatest to the least, that they shall not every one teach his Brother; and shall all know the Lord?</p>
                  <p>What is that Light that shines in the Heart, to give the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:58882:9"/>
the old Mass-houses. Oh! your filthiness comes to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all men, and you have made your selves ridiculous; who are fighting against an innocent People, that wishes hurt to no man, but the good of all men. And do you think that the Lord will nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and reckon with you for all these things? Dare you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Book of your Actions and Consciences, and see what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there, and see if they be not Recorded.</p>
                  <p>How now <hi>Presbyterians, High Priests!</hi> What, is this your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that you now Preach up, for your Hearers, to go to a <hi>Bawdy-house,</hi> as <hi>Thomas Vincent</hi> speaks? What Liberty here, do you give to Youth, and your Hearers? who sayes, <hi>It's worse to go to the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meetings, than to a Bawdy-house:</hi> You pleaded for a body of sin as long as you live, but now it's com'd out indeed, when you plead for a <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> rather than <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings; it's like the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Priest knows where they are, it appears, as if he thought more of a <hi>Bawdy-house,</hi> than of Christ and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>So it's clear here, you are Them that turn the People to Vice, and from the Lord and his Truth (<hi>Ellimas</hi> like) seeking to pervert; For the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings are in the Fear, and Power, and Spirit of God, who meet together in the Name of Christ Jesus: so it's like you love Meetings at <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> more then the Meetings of the People of God? who meet to Worship God. And if this be your Doctrine, then you must enlarge your <hi>Brothel</hi> and <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> as they do at <hi>Rome, Legorn,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and other parts in <hi>Italy</hi>; and then they will give you Tythes, and Easter-Reckonings, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer-Dues; For, have you not called <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> People, good Church Members? And have you not taken Tythes of them? And would you not say, <hi>The Peace of God</hi> to them, for paying you Tythe?</p>
                  <p>Who would have thought that we should have had such Unvertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Expressions from the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that this stinking savour should have lyen covered under their Weeds; — Well, the <hi>Quakers</hi> must Declare against all your <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> which thou, <hi>Vincent,</hi> sayes, Thou hadst rather thy People should go to, than to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings, where the Word of God is Preached; — And so <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> if this be your Doctrine to your People, to send them to <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> rather then to send them to a Meeting of the People of God; we utterly deny you, and your <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> too.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:58882:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>And is it not a shame to put in Print, to tell the World, That thou wouldst rather have thy People go to a <hi>Bawdy-house,</hi> than to a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Meeting? For it's like, if thou wilt set up that House, thou mayst have a yearly Revenue (like thy Father the Pope) out of your <hi>Bawdy-houses</hi>; it's like, if you were there, you might get some gain, if you had <hi>Bawdy-houses</hi>; but if you go to the People of God's Meetings, then you will get no gain. Well might <hi>William Pen</hi> say the Priest prayed whiningly, and looked pale, when you had lost your Easter-Reckonings, and Midsummer-Dues. — Is not the Great Bason holden at Door? What, this is a new way? Is it? Whether brings in more profit to the Priests mouths, Tythes, and Easter-Reckonings, and Midsummer-Dues, or the Great Platter? Now do you not cry up <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> or any way, so that you can get gain?</p>
                  <p>I wonder for all this idle time you have had, that you could not Answer <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s Book amongst you, for it stands upon your heads; he hath Answered all your Principles, and more then you have questioned: Have you forgot your Regiment of Fighting Priests? and how the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> beat the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Read the Book of <hi>Fighting Priests,</hi> how they tore the Cloaths off Lasses and young Men, and drew their Rapiers upon them, and broke their heads, and shed their blood, and yet you must have the Title of <hi>Gospelers,</hi> but more like unto <hi>raging Heathens,</hi> who imagine vain things against God, and Christ, and his People; but the Lord hath broken your horn, the wild beast, and put him under a chain: So we looked you would have given out a Book of Repentance for all your wicked Actions in the other Powers dayes, and shewed forth a work of Reformation; Do you not remember how you came with your Drums and Fiddles?</p>

                     <hi>Independants</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> Is it not clear here to all People, That you deny God, and Christ, and the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, in your saying, That God hath ordained some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be damned, when God saith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. <hi>He desires not the death of him that dieth.</hi> And in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.18. it's said, <hi>Come let us reason together, saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; and though they be red like crimson, they shall be like wooll:</hi> And, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> — And the Apostle saith, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.

and to come to the knowledge of the Truth</hi>; And Christ <hi>hath given himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due time</hi>; And Christ <hi>tasted death for every man, and is a Propitiation for the sins of the whole world.</hi> And <hi>his Blood was shed for all men.</hi> And <hi>the Gospel is to be Preached to every Creature</hi>; And, <hi>Go and teach all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. Now is it not clear, That these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> who say, That Christ died but <hi>for some,</hi> and offered but <hi>for some</hi>; Have they not denied Christ's Blood <hi>for all men,</hi> and his Propitiation <hi>for all men?</hi> — And in doing this, they deny God's Will, who would <hi>have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> And would they not lay the fault in God, when the fault is in man by not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? And do they not make Sects here, in saying he died but for <hi>some,</hi> and would have but <hi>some to be saved,</hi> and he shed his Blood but <hi>for some.</hi> — And the Scripture saith, That <hi>all are gone astray, both Jew and Gentile, that he might have mercy upon All:</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. And they say, That he will not have mercy upon <hi>all</hi>; and do not you say, That he will have mercy upon <hi>some?</hi> contradicting the Apostle and the Rule. — For the Scripture saith, <hi>Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every man that cometh into the World</hi>; and you say that he enlighteneth but <hi>some.</hi> — And the Scripture saith, That <hi>the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men</hi>; and you say, The Grace of God that brings Salvation, hath appeared but to <hi>some,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> have not received Grace. And the Scripture saith, <hi>God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son into the World, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life:</hi> — And do not you say he gave him but for a <hi>few,</hi> and loved <hi>some</hi> of the World? And, do not you Contradict Scripture, and God, and Christ, and the Prophets and Apostles words, and so are found in an Erronicus Principled Spirit? —And so, is it not clear, that you deny Christ, who died without the Gates at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whose Blood was shed for <hi>all</hi> men, and denies the Propitiation and Attonement for <hi>all</hi> men, and denies <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, who prophesied, That <hi>the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Nations shall be to</hi> Shilo.— And you say, That <hi>some</hi> of the Nations shall be saved, not <hi>all</hi>; and here, do you not deny the very Scripture it self, and God, and Christ, and the Prophets and Apostles words, and denies their Doctrine? And also, Is it not clear that you deny the true Faith of God's Elect, that the Just lives by? And is not Faith the Gift of God? And do you not say, That Faith is not
<pb facs="tcp:58882:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perfect? Do not you hold Justification without, and that it is without Man and Woman? And doth not Faith heal? See <hi>Matth. Mark, Luke,</hi> and the <hi>Acts.</hi> And was not the Church Established in the Faith? <hi>Acts</hi> 16.5. Is it not called the Righteousness of Faith? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.

And have not you made shipwrack of this Faith in Christ Jesus, and God, to say Christ's Blood was not shed for <hi>all men,</hi> and God would not have <hi>all men to be saved</hi>; and hath ordained <hi>some</hi> to damnation? Is not Faith called a Mystery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. Were not the Saints to fight the good Fight of Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. — Are not you among them that have erred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Faith, and have overthrown the Faith of some in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the one Offering once for <hi>all,</hi> his Blood for <hi>all,</hi> his Death for <hi>all,</hi> and so are become Reprobates concerning the Common Faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. — And without Faith it is impossible to please God, who is the Author and Finisher of our Faith; — which you made yours at <hi>Savoy</hi> in eleven dayes time, in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s dayes. — And the Just shall live by his Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. and hearts purified by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. — and Sanctified by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. a man is Justified by Faith.— So it's clear, Reader, that Faith Justifies, Sanctifies, — and Faith purifies rhe heart, and so this Justification is within, and the Mystery of Faith is held in a pure Conscience, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science must be within, must it not Reader? And so here thou mayst see how these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> have erred from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Doctrine. — And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and being Justified by Faith, —by whom we have access to God by Faith, and Justified by Faith in Christ Jesus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.

                  <p>And our knowledge of the only true God, and our Faith in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and his Name, unto our Salvation, doth not consist in the traditional Names, humane Inventions (nor in Philosophical terms, and nice School distinctions, derived from Heathenish Metaphysicks; which since the Apostles time, men have put upon the God-head) but in the living sense, and feeling of his Divine Power, Life, and Love, revealed in us by the Spirit of the Son of God; whereby we have (in his gift of Divine Light and Spirit) received Life and Salvation, from sin and death; see <hi>Matth. 11.27. Luk. 10.22. Matth. 16.17. Rom. 1.17. ch. 8.18. Gal. 1.16. Eph. 3.5. 1 Pet. 15.12. ch. 4.14. ch. 4.13. ch. 5.1. 2 Pet. 1, 3. Matth. 1.21.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also we judge, That such Expressions, and Words as the Holy Ghost taught the true Apostles, and Holy Men mentioned in the Scriptures, are most meet to speak of God, and Christ, and not the words of mans wisdom, or humane inventions, and devised distinctions since the Apostles dayes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, We have received an Unction, or Anointing, from the Holy One, which as it doth teach us, we know a continuance in the Father and in the Son, <hi>1 Joh. 2.</hi> And for whom we know the Father is well pleased, and in him we know the true Satisfaction, Justification, and Peace, which all that abide in him, enjoy and witness.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Answer, wherein <hi>Thomas Vincent's</hi> railing and sinful Doctrines for <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Imperfection,</hi> are Refuted, and his <hi>Contradictions</hi> discovered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi> his Title Page, and Introduction, a storm of bitter railing, aspersing, and slandering the Innocent People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> hath proceeded from him, <hi>as Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouths, most hideous Blasphemies, Socinian and damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical opinious Doctrines, and the like</hi>; with several false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and slanders cast upon <hi>G.F. I.N.</hi> and others, which hath been long since Answered and Refuted, both in verbal Testimonies and in Print; And the envious ridged Spirit of several <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> against us therein plainly discovered. And let the impartial Reader judge, Whether such-like railing Language against us, as <hi>T. V.</hi> hath vented, doth become one pretending to be Christ's Minister, or one that would have People believe he hath built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock, or hath Christ Jesus for his Foundation; whereas they that learn of Christ, learn meekness, lowliness, humility, and not railing, reviling, and slandering, which proceeds from bitter envy in the heart, which where it is, there is confusion, &amp;c. as plainly appears in <hi>T. Vincent</hi> and his Brethren's Work, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the Wisdom which is from above, which is pure and peaceable, but from that which is earthly, sensual, &amp; devillish. So let the unbyassed judge, whether <hi>T. V.</hi> be a competent man to write about such high Mysteries, about God and Christ, which are concern'd in our Controversie, yea or nay, when he hath shewed himself to be in a contrary Spirit to that of Christ and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> scornfully reflects upon the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> touching <hi>W. P.</hi> saying, <hi>He being counted among them one of their chief,</hi> (this is false) <hi>because of some smattering of Learning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58882:16"/>
which they conceit he hath.</hi> This is also both false and scornful, for we lay not such a stress upon <hi>smattering of Learning,</hi> nor on natural Learning it self, as to make that the supereminent virtue to make men chief amongst us, our esteem does depend upon that which is of a higher nature than either mens Natural parts, Arts, or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even upon the Spirit and Power of God, which gives the right understanding, and is not limited or tyed to mens Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Learning and Knowledge, but gives Understanding and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto the simple, to see beyond all their corrupt Knowledge and beggarly scraps of Learning and Inventions of men, wherein they are puft up. But so far as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath a discovery both of the envious Spirit, and <hi>Babylonish</hi> Confusion, and dark un-scriptural Doctrines of <hi>T.V.</hi> and others of his ridged fraternity; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he doth not impute that discovery to his Natural Learning nor Parts, but to the gift of God's Power and Spirit, and desires to magnifie that over all the other.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>T. V.</hi> his going to shelter himself with a pretence <hi>of those Doctrines which Protestants generally believe to be essential</hi>; this will neither cover his weakness and confusion, nor hide the envy of his heart, that hath vented its self in his Pamphlet against an innocent People; Neither do I believe, That any of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byassed Protestants (that are accounted competent in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) will either own many of <hi>T. V.</hi> his Principles, or his shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low way of managing those that are owned amongst them. And as to his accusing us of <hi>more grossely erring in the Fundamentals of Religion than the Papists themselves.</hi> It may be justly charged upon himself, as in divers things hereafter will appear; and <hi>T. V.</hi> hath more absurdly than the Papists, argued for <hi>Three distinct separate Persons, subsistents or subsistences, or rather subsistants, saith</hi> T.D. <hi>in one single divine Essence</hi>; but more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>One of <hi>T. V.</hi> his main Accusations against our Doctrine is, <hi>That two</hi> Quakers <hi>asserted the Perfection of Saints in this Life, and that the proof was</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>Whosoever is born of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin</hi>; To which <hi>T.V.</hi> answered, <hi>That the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifie, He doth not make it his business to sin</hi> [whereas it is onely, He doth not do, or commit sin. But he should have read a little further <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he cannot sin,] <hi>The meaning,</hi> saith he, <hi>was, that such as are born again did not make a trade of sin,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58882:16"/>
did not go on in a course of sin, did not commit sin with the full bent of the will as the wicked do, but that it could not be understood of not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin at all, from</hi> ch. 1.8. <hi>If we say we have no sin, &amp;c. there he speaketh of himself, and others, that were born again, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Let every impartial Reader judge, whether <hi>T. V.</hi> his meaning, contrary to the plain words of the Apostle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. be any sufficient proof to evince that our Doctrine of <hi>the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints in this Life,</hi> is either damnable or heretical.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For, first; whereas <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is born of God.</hi> Now <hi>T. V.</hi> his Doctrine and meaning speakes as much, as that <hi>he that is born of God doth commit sin,</hi> (shall we believe <hi>John</hi> or him?) <hi>but not so as to make a trade of sin, not go on in a course of sin, with the full bent of his will, as the wicked doth:</hi> How hath he herein accused the Child of God, whom <hi>John</hi> saith <hi>cannot sin, because he is born of God</hi>; his being born of God (and so being related to God in his Spirit, Nature, and Image) is made the reason that he commits not sin; but if a man should say, <hi>He commits sin, but not to make it his business, or to go on in a course of sin, with the full bent of his will as do the wicked,</hi> because he is born of God; Doth not this reflect upon that pure Relation he hath with the Father, and so upon the Nature of God for begetting and bringing forth such an impure birth? And is not this to frustrate the end of the Son of God, in being made manifest to destroy the works of the Devil; whereas, <hi>he that abides in Christ sinneth not</hi>; see further, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 <hi>verses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> his contrary meaning to plain Scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> and others that were born again, with committing sin, from that <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. that doth not prove it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>John,</hi> and such as he hath so accused (whereby he hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>John</hi> to be of the Devil, for he that commits sin is so, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.) no more then <hi>James</hi> his saying, <hi>With the same Tongue bless we God, and curse we men,</hi> doth prove himself to be one that so cursed, which he said ought not to be; for <hi>John</hi> writes to divers states and degrees of growth, as to them that had sin to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from, that they might walk in the Light, to know the Blood of Christ to cleanse them from all sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. As also he said, If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58882:17"/>
cleanse us from all unrighteousness, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Surely <hi>John</hi> was come further then a Confession of sin at that time; besides, <hi>having sin,</hi> may relate either to a former state, or to its besetting the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the temptations when it is warred against, and in the Faith withstood in its motions, in order to a Conquest, when the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not commit sin, but withstands it, as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Its not I that sinneth</hi>; so that having some sin, and committing sin, are two things; for it doth not appear that the beloved Disciple or Apostle <hi>John</hi> was a committer of sin in that state when he wrote that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle; for he saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>If we say we have not sinned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us</hi>; which relates to a state that was past: If we say <hi>we have not sinned,</hi> is not all one as to say, if we say <hi>we do not commit sin, &amp;c.</hi> Yet he saith, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little Children, these things I write unto you, that ye sin not:</hi> Now had <hi>John</hi> been of <hi>T. V</hi>'s perswasion, that such a state of Perfection, or not Sinning, is not here attainable, why should he exhort them not to sin, and so plainly shew the difference between him that is born of God, and him that is of the Devil? See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. throughout.</p>
            <p>And then as to <hi>T. V.</hi> his supposed Consequence from our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perfection, <hi>That whoever found any sin in them, were not born of God:</hi> which, I say, that its neither our Assertion, nor the Consequence of our saying, <hi>That he that's born of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin, for having sin, when it is withstood and warred against by that which is born of God, and committing sin, are two things</hi>; yet we know that <hi>that which is born of God overcomes the World</hi>; and this is the Victory, even our Faith, and the end of Christ's manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to destroy sin, that it may not have a being, so long as we live, in us.</p>
            <p>And <hi>T.V.</hi> further adds, <hi>That if they should die with any sin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would certainly go to Hell, and so none there, yea, none in the World would be saved he saith</hi>; Hereby he still takes it for granted, That there's no such Perfection here as a freedom from all sin, but that all God's Children die with sin remaining in them; I then ask, How long after death shall sin remain, and when and where is the time and place of being fully cleansed after death, is it in the Grave, or is it in some Purgatory? For if God's Children must be cleansed after death, they must be cleansed somewhere, and then in the mean time, betwixt death and this supposed time and place
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58882:17"/>
of cleansing and purging, where lyes the sin, and pollution, and the stain of it, is it in the Soul, or in the Body? Surely not in the Body when dead, neither can the Soul go to God with sin or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in it, for no unclean thing can enter into his Kingdom, or dwell with him; so then the Question still remains, where the Soul is after death, and where is the place of its purging and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleansing? If <hi>T. V.</hi> and his Brethren are not Papists, let them answer, and clear themselves and Principle, from the Popes Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T. V.</hi> his reviling and calling us, <hi>Audacious</hi> Quakers, <hi>who have not the least degree of true Grace, because of damnable Opinions.</hi> This his harsh language, and railing, signifies little to us for any proof against us, or what we hold, but only shewes his own peevishness and implacable enmity, as one vexed and fretted in his mind, and so not fit to intermeddle with things of so high concernment, as he hath presumptiously attempted to stir in, as about <hi>Perfection, and the Deity, and Satisfaction of Christ, &amp; Justification, Righteousness, &amp;c.</hi> nor yet to call and exhort others, whilst he himself had need to be called and exhorted to repent of his hard and uncharitable speeches and censours, and to come to meekness and moderation, which would better become his Profession. And his confidence, that <hi>we have not the least degree of true grace,</hi> is both a false and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table confidence, and charge against us; as also his flaunting and jearing <hi>W. P.</hi> as having but <hi>some smattering of Learning,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>little of a Scholar, never to have read nor understood Logick, or to have forgot, or laid it aside.</hi> Herein hath he manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self both scornful and ridiculous, to make so much use of his own pretended Learning, Arguments, Logick, Demonstration, &amp;c. to such as he reckons hath neither <hi>true grace,</hi> nor <hi>Learning</hi>; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>T.V.</hi> had a mind to shew himself in a vain flourish and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over such whom he hath endeavoured to render contemptible, mean, and ignorant, as he hath done us; all which doth but the more manifest the pride of his heart, vain-glorying &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And then he adds, <hi>I told them that all true Believers were perfect in a sense, they were Evangellically perfect, but not legally, not absolutly perfect; they had perfection of parts, but not of degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, What confusion is here, and what contradiction to his former Doctrine of Imperfection and Sin in this Life; for first
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58882:18"/>
an <hi>Evangelical Perfection</hi> he grants, but not a <hi>Legal</hi>; as if either the Law, or the state under it, were above the Gospel; or else that the state of the Gospel is not a state of Perfection exceeding that under the Law, but rather inferiour; both which are false and absurd. For this Doctrine doth not only charge Imperfection upon the Creature under the Gospel, but upon the Gospel it self, whilst <hi>Evangelical Perfection</hi> is deemed either Imperfection, or not a Freedom from sin or transgression of the Law, whilst here; and then judge whether Imperfection and Sin <hi>be Evangelical.</hi> Surely all, who have any true spiritual knowledge of the Law, Gospel, and new Birth, may easily see beyond this man, and also see his Ignorance and Contradiction to himself: for the state of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is so far from being inferiour to that under the Law that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; for God finding fault with his People under the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, saw it needful to establish a second, in which forgiveness of sin, destroying sin, and the Devil's works; taking it away, and making an end of it, and remembring sin no more; (and so Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) are to be known by the enjoyers and subjects of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; as also the Gospel is not short of the Law, nor the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of it, for <hi>Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fullfil it</hi>; and the Righteousness of Faith is so far from coming short of the Righteousness of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that true Believers do not make void the Law through Faith, but establish it; and the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ, makes free from the Law of Sin and Death. So that the Righteousness and Obedience brought forth in the true and living Faith, which stands in the Power of God, doth answer the righteous Law of God in the heart, and exceeds and surpasses all self-righteousness, and all mens outward immitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law in the letter of it; but this none knows but those who comes to own the Light and Spirit of Faith inward, and the Law of it. It is not known to such as these men, who count <hi>the Light within an Idol,</hi> and reckon <hi>that it guides contrary to the Light of the Word and Spirit,</hi> as in their <hi>pages</hi> 15. &amp; 53.</p>
            <p>But as to his <hi>Perfection of parts, but not of degrees,</hi> this is strange Doctrine; for if it be a <hi>Perfection of parts, but not of degrees, what parts</hi> are they, and wherein consists their Perfection not of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees?</hi> but if he had said there is a Perfection of kind but not in the full height or highest degree of it, then he had said something,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58882:18"/>
though to his own contradiction: But where he adds, <hi>That in this sense the work of Grace, though the work of God, was not perfect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our selves, but by degrees was carried on unto further Perfection.</hi> Now in contradiction to himself, he hath confest the Work of God by degrees carried on unto further Perfection; which if so, here is both Perfection in its degrees, which vary not the property or kind, as also the work of Grace, in its carrying on unto further Perfection; so then there is a time of perfecting or working the work of Grace in order to Perfection, and a time wherein it comes to be wrought and perfected. And now the kind and nature of that Perfection which we believe and plead for, is that which God requires, and Christ worketh, who doth the Father's Will therein in all that truly believe, the which consists in Righteousness and true Holiness, not in any imagined, conceited, or self-righteousness brought forth in man's will, which is not real nor perfect either in man's will-worshipping, self-performing, or applications, which are neither from living Motions of true Faith, nor Evidence of the Spirit of God within, but from men's self-will imaginations and traditions.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> tells of some <hi>that were established in the wayes of Truth,</hi> intending <hi>by his Ministry</hi>; Herein again he hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself, for <hi>Establishment in the wayes of Truth,</hi> is a high state of Perfection; and such admits not of his Preaching up sin, nor of moving from any of Truth's wayes, which his Doctrine for Sin and Imperfection, term of Life doth not at all tend too, but rather to keep People in thraldom and captivity, and in a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering tossed estate in the wayes of sin, which are all contrary to the wayes of Truth, for the wayes of Truth do not admit of a continuance in the wayes of Errour, either in Principle, or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> complains so sadly, <hi>That two of his Friends, Mother and Daughter, that went off to the</hi> Quakers <hi>in his fortnights absence.</hi> It appears that they were not <hi>Established</hi> by him, as also that he hath led his Hearers to depend more upon himself, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teachings of God, or his Light within, which is the cause of many's wavering and uncertainty who have followed him, so that if their Teacher or Shepherd <hi>T. V.</hi> remove into a corner, or if upon Persecution he should flee, or hide himself for fear, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58882:19"/>
many of them have done, then his flock (or at least many of them (would be lyable to be scattered; but who comes to wait upon God in his Light and Spirit, to know him their Shepherd and Leader, their Teacher will not be removed into a corner, nor their Shepherd flee from them.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> further adds, in an angry reviling manner, against the Mother and Daughter, <hi>That the Mother should so much indulge a perverse Will in her, unbefitting a Parent, that it's like to prove the destruction of Mother and Child, &amp;c.</hi> His thus openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling of them in <hi>Print,</hi> may tend to set them further against him then ever; and now they may see more of his Spirit than before, and if they abide in the Light, to which their minds have been directed, and by which their understandings have been opened since they came amongst us, they will further feel, and see cause for ever to bless the Lord for bringing them out from amongst such false Teachers and Ministers of Sin and Imperfection, as <hi>T.V.</hi> and his Brethren have manifested themselves to be; as also seeing what follows from his corrupt Heart and unclean Spirit, it may set all sober minds, and modest Persons against him and his Doctrine more than ever, as they take a view thereof, which most sordid reviling of his was the chief cause and occasion of these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies between us.</p>
            <p>T. V. <hi>I acknowledge I did say it was worse to go to the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meettings than to a Bawdy-house, because the defilement of the Soul with their damnable Errors, was more deep and more hard to be washed off, than the defilement of Whoredom or Adultry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which, I say, let all sober-minded Readers but mark the wickedness and grosseness of this man's Doctrine, thus to set an esteem of <hi>Bawdy-houses</hi> above our Meetings! What but Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wickedness could have vented such Doctrine publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! It is no marvel that he can so plead and contend for Sin and Imperfection, whilst he deems it worse to go to our Meetings (where Sin, Wickedness, and Uncleanness is openly Preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst) than to go to a <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> where it's committed; What abominable Doctrine is this! and Infamy, and a ground of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against himself hath he given hereby, and how contrary to the Spirit and Doctrine of the true Ministers this of his is, for they were so far from such Doctrine, that they reckoned such
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58882:19"/>
things not meet to be named amongst them, as becometh Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. And how corrupt and grosse is <hi>T. V</hi>'s reason for his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unsavoury Doctrine before, in saying, <hi>Because the defilement of the Soul is more deep and more hard to be washed off, than the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Whoredom or Adultry</hi>; As if they did not defile the Soul, but the Body only; this is a Doctrine that may gratifie Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers, and not only to reject the wholsom Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Reproofs against all such Wickedness, which both in their own Consciences, and in our Meetings, is declared and Preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; but also, it tends rather to incourage them to go to <hi>Bawdy-houses,</hi> than to our Innocent and Godly Meetings, wherein the Truth, Righteousness, and Power of God, which cleanseth and frees from sin and unrighteousness, is exalted, and born witness to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.V.</hi> having so manifestly discovered his Spirit, he had now bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter go and sit down under the Common Prayer, and confess himself <hi>a miserable Sinner</hi> among the rest, and not remain in a separation with his whewling and whineing Prayers, feigning himself as one more Holy and Humble than they: What sober People could have thought that such foulness should lie under these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as is mentioned before, and after!</p>
            <p>And <hi>T. V.</hi> further adds, to explain his gross corrupt Doctrine, these words, <hi>viz. I told her, if there stood a Cup of Poyson in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, I would rather drink it, than drink in their damnable Doctrines; because poysoning of the Body is not so bad as poysoning and damning the Soul.</hi> By which the Reader may further see how his prejudice and envy hath blinded him thus to imply, as if Persons might commit either <hi>Whordom or Murder</hi> upon their Bodies, and their Souls not be defiled, or damned thereby; and then what actual wickedness may not People commit, and their Souls not be damnified nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by it from this Doctrine; whereas the wicked slayeth his own Soul; lifteth up his Soul to vanity; the Peoples lusting after evil things, caused leanness to enter their Souls; tribulation and anguish is to come upon every Soul of man that doth evil: And it is only the Power and Life of God which purifies the Soul, sanctifies the Creature throughout, in Body, Soul, and Spirit, and so leads into Righteousness, and thereby saves and brings the Soul to God, and gives it Life, and indues it with the Image of the Heavenly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58882:20"/>But after this, <hi>T. V.</hi> hath uttered such corrupt Language and Doctrine as before, he is so bold as to justifie himself in these words, viz. <hi>I am sure I neither did, nor spake any thing unbecoming a Minister of the Gospel.</hi> That I refer all modest and sober Readers to judge of, Whether <hi>T. V.</hi> hath spoken Truth herein, yea or nay? and, whether or no it had not been more prudence for him to have studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quietness, and quietly to have followed his Devotion with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for the Liberty they are permitted to enjoy, then thus to have shewed himself in outrage with clamorous reproaches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling against us (who mean him no harm) to the great disgrace both of himself and his Religion, and them that adher to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>And as for his accusing me with <hi>confused Discourse, and indirect Answers</hi> to his <hi>Arguments,</hi> and with <hi>filling my Mouth and the Peoples Ears with a multitude of words, wherein was so much ambiguity</hi> and <hi>obscurity, that the sentiments of</hi> my <hi>mind were not easily to be perceived</hi> as he saith. Wherein I have as much cause to complain of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving direct Answers from him, as he seems to have against me, whilst he was so puzled and put to it with what I said, though I answered them in plain Scripture-language; And wherein their Questions, or pretended Arguments, were either indirect, or in terms, which accorded not with Scripture-language, I did not judge my self ingaged so far, to admit of the stating their matters (as being infallible in the manner and terms of them) as to be tyed to <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> denial of <hi>Major</hi> or <hi>Minor,</hi> without further scruple. Their Arguments appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> pleads for using some words in explaining Scripture which are not in the Scripture, saying, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>(in their Books) use many words which are not in the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, We neither contend with words or matters which are not contrary, or do not tend to vail or darken the Truth's (or simplicity of the innocent language) contained in Scripture; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we go about to impose one manner and form of expression upon others, or limit them therein whilst they speak the Truth, or what is in, or according to Scripture; We are not of Kin to the narrow Spirit of the ridged <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that will count a man a <hi>blasphemous Heretick, Socinian, Arian,</hi> and what not, if he can't repeat his Creed of the Deity, or Father, Word, and Spirit, in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58882:20"/>
invented School-terms, although he really believeth and confesseth according to Scripture, unto the only true God, the eternal Word and Spirit; or, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that they are One, and in Unity inseparable.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> saith, <hi>That</hi> W. P. <hi>puts forth the sting of the Serpent in tearming his Prayers strangely affected Whines, what more opprobious terms,</hi> saith he, <hi>would the Damn-me Blades of the Times have used, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I say, That he did not only use a strange affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of Whineing in his feigned Praying, but also therein most falsely accused us for <hi>Blasphemers,</hi> in telling God, <hi>That we compared Him, and his Son, and Holy Spirit, to three finite Creatures,</hi> which more justly, was charged upon himself and his Brethren, from their distinction of Persons in the Deity. <hi>T. V</hi>'s lye to God was so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in this matter, that some that were by, said, The next time he Prayed, he had need to ask God forgiveness for telling him that Lye; for our comparison was to evince the natural consequence of their own distinction, and the gross tendency of it, as further is mainfest; and not to represent the infinite God like unto man, or finite Creatures, as they have done about their <hi>Personalities</hi>; And his comparing <hi>W. P</hi>'s words to such <hi>tearms</hi> as those use he calls <hi>The Dam-me Blades of the Times,</hi> he should rather have began at home, and judged himself for his own wicked opprobious terms, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It was worse to go to the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meetings, than to a Bawdy-house</hi>; what more gross terms could the Damners and Sinkers have used! but evil words corrupt good manners.</p>
            <p>And as for his Confidence <hi>that it is a falshood</hi> that they did use such words as <hi>impudent villain,</hi> &amp; that there was striking among some of <hi>T.V</hi>'s Hearers. There are Persons of repute and credit, who can testifie both against them; and to my knowledge an honest sober Women did affirm, That one of his Hearers thumpt her on the Breast when we were about that Dispute with them; besides the malice, envy, and rudeness that appeared amongst them, in clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, railing, and reviling us (like the <hi>Billings-gate</hi> folks) though without any just cause, both then, and when we were afterward at their Meeting, to clear our selves from <hi>T. V</hi>'s and <hi>W. M.</hi> their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and slanderous accusation of <hi>Blasphemy</hi>; yea, even in the time when I sate silent amongst them, some of their Hearers, both Men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58882:21"/>
and Women would be railing and clamouring against me, when I gave them no seeming (much less real) occasion at all, I being silent. So that of all the Assemblies I have been in, I never met with any that shewed less Christianity, Civility, or good Education.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> is neither so honest, nor yet so ingenious, as to acknowledge his apparent and palpable Contradictions in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, set down and observed by <hi>W. P.</hi> but rather would out-face us and the Readers, as though they were no Contradictions. Let the Reader therefore take a short review of them; as first,<note place="margin">T.V. <hi>his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That a Person that is born of God overcomes the World,</hi> and yet <hi>the Victory in this Life incompleat.</hi> Is not here an evident inconsistency and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is his Doctrine, and ignorance of the Child of God, and the Saints Victory, which was their Faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. For if he have alwayes enemies or sins unsubdued in this Life, how are they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and victory obtained? Or, is there a Victory over Enemies, and they not overcome? What false glosses would he set upon his Contradictions? And his instance of the <hi>Canaanites among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel, <hi>being like Thorns, doing them mischief.</hi> This was when they did not as God commanded; drive them out before them, which is no proof in this case to him that is born of God, for the wicked one cannot touch him, much less mischief him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>T. V.</hi> his saying, That <hi>such as are in Christ, and cast off the old Man, and known a change altogether New,</hi> and yet <hi>worldly Lusts cannot be extirpated out of God's People in this World</hi>; Do but mark his plain Contradiction again here, and how doth he clear himself by questions, <hi>May not, Have not, Worldly Lusts a being, and some power to oppose in God's People, where they have lost their rule?</hi> But how then are they in Christ, and have cast off the old man, and known a change altogether new, what must the old worldly Lusts still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unextirpated, in this Life in Christ? Where then is the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life <hi>altogether,</hi> or the Grace of God in its teaching to deny those things, obeyed? And how then are such as be in Christ new Creatures? Or, how have they that are his, crucified the flesh with the Affections and Lusts? Which to accuse all God's People of worldly Lusts all their life time, what an abuse is it to them? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> see and attain a state beyond that wherein he had seen a Law in his members warring and leading him captive, &amp;c. Did not he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58882:21"/>
see the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ, to make him free from the Law of Sin &amp; Death, when through Christ he became more than a conqueror? And could he be in all those states he mentioned to the <hi>Romans</hi> then, at one and the same time (to wit) carnal, sold under sin, led captive, having a will to do that which was good, but knew not how; and also to be freed from the Law of Sin and Death, by the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus; one dead to sin that could not live any longer therein, and more than a conqueror, &amp;c. could these states be consistent, or all <hi>his</hi> at one and the same time? <hi>viz.</hi> To be Carnal, Wretched, a Captive, ignorant of his Duty, and yet a Delivered, Freed, Spiritual man, more than a Conqueror, and an Apostle that then knew how to write that Epistle, Instruct others, and Preach to them in the Fulness of the Gospel? Were not these Latter his Attainments at that time wherein he shews his deliverance from the former Bondage, Servitude, and Thraldom under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Sin, and the Law and Body of it, which is not to remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but to be ended, abollished, and destroyed, by the Power and Operation of Jesus Christ in them that believe; <hi>For if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is Life because of Righteousness.</hi> And where <hi>the old man is crucified, with him, it is to the destruction of the body of sin, that henceforth sin should not be served,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.10. And <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to the <hi>Romans, after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of their flesh,</hi> ch. 6.19. And his so condescending to speak of several states that he had passed through, was not to encourage any to plead or contend for sin term of life, as most injuriously his Intention is perverted by these Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Sin and Antichrist, whilst that he also shews his Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Conquest; but rather that men should believe as he had done, in order to their obtaining perfect Victory and Conquest by the same Power and Spirit of Christ, in which true Believers confide and trust, against all the powers of Darkness, Temptations, and evil Motions, knowing that Christ's Power is stronger than the Devil's power. And it's for Christ's Power and Work, that we contend both against the Devil, his Work, and Messengers, who dispute and contend for sin term of life, which is their great injury both against Christ, his Work, and People, and that which hath greatly streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the hands of evil-doers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58882:22"/>And <hi>T.V.</hi> his telling, That <hi>Sin may tyrannize over Believers, and yet not have Dominion, but be in Captivity, in Chains.</hi>

            <p>Who is so blind that cannot see his Contradiction herein, and his silly come off, in instancing that a Slave <hi>in Chains</hi> may sometimes break loose and <hi>Tyrannize</hi>; what then is this <hi>Captivity</hi> and these <hi>Chains</hi> under which the sin is held, and how doth it <hi>tyrannize,</hi> and yet not have <hi>dominion,</hi> what silly work is this?

               <hi>Three increated Persons</hi> are thy own words and terms; but the Father, Word, and Spirit, we really own, and bear witness to, both as mentioned in the Scripture, and as knowing the absolute Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Eternal Power thereof manifested, where that which may be known of God is manifest (even within) both in creating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, and quickening us again to God out of death and darkness. And these Three which are One, which bear Record in Heaven, to wit, The Father, the Word, and the Spirit, as I could not own the title of Three <hi>distinct and separate Persons</hi> to be put upon them, as thy Brother Erroniously did (being not Scripture-language) so it was never my intent, nor Principle, to compare them to three Apostles, or finite Creatures, as most falsely and injuriously thou accusest me. But to endeavour to make the People understand both the grosseness and falseness of <hi>Tho. Danson</hi>'s and <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of three <hi>distinct separate Persons</hi> in the Deity, you naming each <hi>Person God,</hi> which renders them Three Gods (whilst but One God) by shewing the Consequence of this your Principle; After I had from Scripture shewed how inseperable the Father and the Son were,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58882:23"/>
and the Oneness of the Father, Word, and the Spirit; but if I had simply compared them to three Apostles, who were distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Persons, then had I owned your own Terms and Principle, and then the Controversie had fallen between us: But instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I am accused for opposing your Doctrine of <hi>distinct separate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>; and thus you confound your selves in wronging of me; for were not the three Apostles, <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> three distinct separate Persons (did I ever deny that they were) how like then to <hi>finite Creatures</hi> doth your own Doctrine render the Eternal God, his Word, &amp; Spirit; which to shew, was my end in instancing three Apostles, for we never believed the Eternal God to be like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, since we knew any thing of his Divine Power. But <hi>T. Danson</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis,</hi> pag. 12. plainly instanceth three Apostles, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; as also his instance of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> for their Trinity, or <hi>three Persons in one nature</hi>; Was not this an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>finite Creatures,</hi> and such an indignity put upon God as I never intended: How can such men but blush for charging that on others, which so evidently they are guilty of themselves?</p>
            <p>Madox. <hi>We call the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Persons, or Hee's, according as they are held forth in the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, had you stood to Scripture-language, there had not been any Controversie between us therein; but it would not satisfie you, but you must obtrude your Popish unscripture-like terms and distinctions, or rather worse, in telling not only of <hi>distinct</hi> but <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Persons,</hi> which being plainly refuted from Scripture, you may remember I several times called to <hi>T. D.</hi> and <hi>T. V.</hi> to confess their Error, I shewing how inseparable the Father and the Son were, reflecting chiefly on the words <hi>separate Persons,</hi> which, how you come off about, will appear hereafter. And as for their being <hi>Three Hee's,</hi> thou <hi>W. M.</hi> durst not keep to any Argument from thence; or to make that any Cause, or Reason, why we must own them to be <hi>Three Persons,</hi> though here thou seem'st to make the terms equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, <hi>viz. Three Persons, or Hee's</hi>; so then it appears that either will serve, if the Three that bear Record in Heaven be but own'd under the Name of <hi>Three Hee's,</hi> it will serve instead of <hi>Three distinct Persons</hi>; but then, are all <hi>Hee's</hi> or Males, <hi>Persons</hi>; and all Shee's or Females, <hi>no Persons?</hi> What strange Logick is implyed here? And where doth the Scripture mention <hi>three increated Persons</hi> thou tell'st
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58882:23"/>
of, are they three distinct increated Persons? If so, then mayst thou not as well say they are three distinct Infinites, three Eternals, and so three Gods. Where is now the blasphemy, and blasphemer? And Christ's speaking of another Comforter, which was the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. was not another Person distinct from him, for that Spirit was then in him; neither doth he use those words, for the same Comforter, or Spirit, was in him, and was that divine Life that then spoke in him, when he was personally present with them; He doth not say, he would send them another Person to Comfort them, but speaks more spiritually, for though they had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in his outward Presence and Ministry, yet his spiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was that other Comforter, for ever to abide with them; for in that <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. Christ speaking of the Spirit of Truth, or that other Comforter, saith, he that dwelleth with you, shall be in you, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you</hi>; which clearly explains his former words, which to say this Comforter was a Person distinct from Christ, is all one, or as absurd as to say the Spirit or Life that was in him, was a distinct. Person from him, or that he was a Person distinct from himself; for, <hi>I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you</hi>; or were it not gross to say, That Christ in his People, is a Person distinct from Christ, or the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word.</p>
            <p>And as to thy telling of another Comforter, <hi>i. e. Another as to subsistence, or manner of being:</hi> What manner of being, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can it differ from Christ's spiritul manner of being? Had he ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of being distinct from his own? Who cannot see the ignorance and confusion of thy blind distinction? For it appears, that thy distinction of <hi>three distinct Persons, subsistences, or manners of being,</hi> is attributed to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, before Christ's Bodily or Personal Appearance in the form of a Servant, thou telling us (<hi>they being of an infinite nature, are three persons</hi>) Is this a good Argument for thy turn (whereas <hi>T.V.</hi> saith, <hi>Christ, as man, was not fifty years old,</hi> pag. 31.) whilst thou argues from <hi>John</hi> 14.16. for their being <hi>three distinct persons, subsistences, or manners of being</hi>; For, were they <hi>three distinct</hi> Comforters of an <hi>infinite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> Or, <hi>three distinct separate persons</hi> of an <hi>infinite nature?</hi> And was Christ's manner of being in the Flesh of an <hi>infinite nature?</hi> Or was he therein a Fourth Person? Surely when Christ had taken
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58882:24"/>
upon him the form of a Servant, and that he said, <hi>My Father is greater than I</hi>; (now <hi>W.M.</hi> confesseth, that <hi>the form of God was his divine nature,</hi> which is above the form of a Servant) and he being in the likeness of sinful flesh, made a little lower than the Angels in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Sufferings, humbling himself to the Death of the Cross. In this manner, and in these capacities he was not declared to be from Eternity (but as he was equal with God in his Glory, before the World was <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity owned.</hi>
               </note>; neither can <hi>three coeternal, coequal distinct persons,</hi> be argued from thence; for the Controversie runs higher, as before, they being of an <hi>infinite nature, are three increated persons</hi>; he should rather have said, are one divine substance, or <hi>being,</hi> which is of an infinite nature. But in plain Contradiction these <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> tells us, in their 45. <hi>pag.</hi> That in the <hi>abstract, infiniteness is not aplicable to the subsistence</hi>; what then is become of their <hi>three infinite increated persons, or subsistences?</hi> Are they now chang'd from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to finite? What sad work is this! Where are the Blasphemers now? Are they not herein found guilty of that, which most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly they have charg'd on us, <hi>viz.</hi> Of that which is plainly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Glory of the Infinite God, by going to fasten the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of finite Creatures upon him? For, if there be a <hi>subsistence,</hi> or <hi>personallity,</hi> or <hi>manner of being</hi> (as he defines subsistence) in the God-head, which is <hi>not infinite</hi>; then something finite is in God which is no less than blasphemy to affirm. And if there be three such <hi>distinct subsistences in the relative Property of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> as <hi>W. M.</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. to which <hi>infiniteness is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable:</hi> Then have they denied the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be Infinite; and by this the Reader may see what their unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural distinctions of Persons and Subsistences in the Deity amount to, and how most derogatory to the Glory of the Infinite God they are. But the remarkableness of their gross Contradictions is so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, <hi>that he that runs may read it</hi>; for one while the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, being of an <hi>infinite nature, are three distinct persons three increated persons</hi>; which renders them three distinct Infinite and so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three Gods. Another while <hi>infiniteness is not aplicable</hi> to them as such, or as <hi>subsistences,</hi> which renders them under the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of finite Creatures. Do you think that the wiser sort, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among Papists, or Protestants, or Church of <hi>England,</hi> own
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58882:24"/>
these men's management of this matter; or will their Work stand them in any stead, or be to the advancement of the Christian Faith in other Nations? If these men should go into <hi>Turkey,</hi> and also among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and pretend to Preach the everlasting God, or the Father, the Word, and Spirit, under such Names, Terms, and Distinctions, as being <hi>three distinct and separate persons, or subsistences,</hi> to which <hi>infiniteness is not aplicable</hi>; what would be the effect and consequence of such Preachings do you think? Would it not bring a reproach upon the Name and Profession of Christianity, and render the Christians as believing and expecting Salvation from finite Persons, or Creatures? Or else, if they should Preach them to be three distinct or separate Persons, as being of an infinite nature, might not they reasonably conclude that they were Preaching three Gods? Would not this kind of Preaching more stumble the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> from believing in Christ, than ever; and the more streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Heathen in their Idolatrous Imaginations (especially whilst they oppose the Light within as <hi>an Idol</hi>) for whilst a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is Preached implying three Gods, may they not suppose many more? As also, how have many ignorant People, in the time of Darkness, been begotten into vain Imaginations touching the God-head, by such Doctrine aforesaid (contrary to Scripture-language) as to think God to be like unto a Man, or Person; whereas he is a Spirit, he is Invisible, even that Eternal Word, or Spirit, which made all things, and Christ is the Image of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible God, not divided nor separate from him whose Image he is <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>. And <hi>though in the World there are Gods many, and Lords many, yet to us there is but One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and One Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. So that it was never any Design, or Plot of ours, to endeavour to prejudice the minds of any against the Deity of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, as falsely and blasphemously we are accused by this our prejudiced Opposer.</p>
            <p>W. M. <hi>What you mean by separate, I know not; if you mean so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate as to destroy the unity and simplicity of the divine Essence, I own no such separation; if you take it to be all one with distinct, then it was no begging the Question.</hi> And in their 39. <hi>pag.</hi> it's said, <hi>viz. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58882:25"/>
word Separate Person I disown any further then we may conceive it to signifie no more then dictinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It appears then, that <hi>T. D.</hi> and their using the word <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate persons,</hi> was to explain their meaning of <hi>distinct persons,</hi> for it was used after <hi>distinct,</hi> viz. <hi>distinct and separate persons</hi>; which word <hi>separate persons,</hi> they know I chiefly reflected upon at the Dispute, I proving the contrary from Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Oneness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separability of the Father, Word, and Spirit; but seeing they own no such separation as to destroy the Unity of the Divine Essence, why did they make use of the word Separate at all in the case, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are <hi>three distinct and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate persons,</hi> which they confess are <hi>of one divine Essence.</hi> Now they disown <hi>separate</hi> any otherwise then it signifies <hi>distinct</hi>; but they should not have own'd it at all in this case. Is it not sad Doctrine that supposeth any Separation, Finiteness, or Limitation, in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being? But if the separation relate to the <hi>Personallity,</hi> or their <hi>distinctions of persons,</hi> and not to the Essence, then doth not this tend to divide God, or to separate Father, Son, and Spirit, who are in each other, and how then are they <hi>three distinct, coeternal, coessenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, coequal Persons?</hi> Or how are they <hi>three distinct increated persons of an infinite nature,</hi> as before? but another while not <hi>infinite in the Personality</hi>; what wonderful confusion and gross contradictions are here! and what strange boldness is it for men, so dark in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, discomposed in their minds, confused and incongruent in their Principles, thus ignorantly to attempt to define or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the infinite Power, or God-head, which is out of their sight, and beyond their earthly capacities, who are so ignorant of God who is Light; they count the Light within <hi>an Idol of our own brains,</hi> as <hi>W.

            <p>And notwithstanding this great stir they have made with their distinctions of <hi>separate persons, incommunicable properties, &amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>W.

And how have you gone with your vain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural distinctions to darken Counsel, to darken Scripture, to darken the minds of People by words without knowledge, thereby going to demonstrate that to others, which you cannot clear to your selves by demonstration; As <hi>T.

But how then shall we receive your bare Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Divine Authority, when we have neither Scripture, nor Reason, nor yet any immediate Revelation from you for them, must we pinn our Faith upon your sleeves? or will you supply the places of so many Popes, by Imposing an implicit Faith in those matters which you cannot demonstrate, nor clear to your selves: which then, how can you clear them to others? Which if this be the course you take to convince gain-sayers of your Doctrine, you might have spared a great deal of labour in going about so confusedly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate your case to us, and only have laid down your Doctrine of <hi>three distinct separate Persons</hi> in the Deity, to which <hi>infiniteness is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58882:26"/>
not ascribed</hi> as you have said in <hi>pag.</hi> 45. And so you might as well have said, That we <hi>T.V. W.M.</hi> and <hi>T.D.</hi> do affirm it, and therefore you must believe it, or otherwise you are blasphemous Hereticks, and so damned. But we must have better ground for our Faith, and a better Authority than Affirmations, Revilings, and Threatnings of men, that are untaught themselves in those things which they presume to teach others.</p>
            <p>W. M. <hi>I called them three Hee's, to try</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>if you would own the Deity of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, under any title.</hi> As the subject of this Tryal is very mean and weak (to wit) the calling them <hi>three Hee's</hi> to prove the Deity; so his trying of us hereby, was altogether groundless, since that we never disowned the Deity of Christ, or Holy Ghost, as falsely and injuriously is insinuated against us. And since that <hi>three Hee's</hi> will now serve instead of <hi>Persons,</hi> (he saying they <hi>are three Persons, or three Hee's</hi>) to prove the Deity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: Why have they made such a pudder for their distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Persons? But would it be a strong Reason to induce Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to the belief of the Deity of each, because they are <hi>three Hee's</hi> as he saith; for, are all <hi>Hee's</hi> either God, (or yet <hi>Persons</hi>) or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?</hi> But I need say little to the shallowness of this Work; Let the ingenious Reader judge of it. But when he thinks he mends the matter, by calling them <hi>three divine Hee's,</hi> his intent is, that the Father is called Hee, the Son is Hee, the Spirit Hee; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves them <hi>three separate,</hi> nor <hi>incommunicable Persons, distinct subsistences,</hi> or <hi>bottoms</hi>; whilst both the Father's a Spirit, the Lord is that Spirit, Christ a quickening Spirit; all inseparable.</p>
            <p>W. M. <hi>You by refusing to call them Three Divine Hee's, have made it manifest, that your Quarrel is not with the word Person, as some then apprehended; but with the Doctrine or Fundamental Truth, expressed by the three Persons,</hi> viz. <hi>the Modal Distinction, and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vnion; or Oneness of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It's manifest, that some of the Hearers that were present at our Debating this matter, had a better apprehension and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of us than you prejudiced Teachers and Opposers had: for some of them apprehended that we opposed your unscriptural terms and words put upon the Deity, and not that we opposed either the Divinity or Union of Father, Son, or Holy Ghost; neither did we

in the least go to quarrel with any Fundamental Truth, as most grosly and slanderously we are accused and misrepresented by thee <hi>W.M.</hi> who hast shewed thy self (so far from either Truth, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or Reasonableness in this matter) as one swallowed up with Envie and Prejudice: And thy taking for granted, that thy <hi>Model distinction</hi> and terms, are Fundamental Truth, and joyning them with the Oneness of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is but a begging the Question, and presumption in thee, especially whilst by your vain Philosophy some of you have either rendered them as Three Gods, or denied them to be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 45. Yea, and it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to many, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Father, the Word, and the Spirit, truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by us, according to the Scriptures; but these Priests mis-calling them, denyed.</hi>
               </note> That we found fault with your mis-calling and mis-represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Father, the Word, and Spirit; and never in the least opposed nor que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned their being Three such as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but there openly confessed to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truth of them in Scripture terms.

But nothing would serve you, but an Answer to your vain babling and School-terms, with such a limitation as <hi>Aye or No</hi>; as if the Scripture terms and expressions were in this to be waved and slighted as insufficient, and your confusion, vain <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as for <hi>W. M.</hi> his so much talk of <hi>three Hee's, each of which</hi> (he saith) <hi>is by nature God:</hi> We do not read in Scripture, that God is called <hi>three Hee's, or three distinct Hee's</hi>; and therefore three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct separate Persons (indeed Children in the <hi>Accidence</hi> call <hi>Hee</hi> the third Person singular) But that both the Father and Son speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves, use the word <hi>Hee,</hi> as I am <hi>Hee</hi>; and he that is with you, shall be in you; Christ speaking of his own manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which was that other Comforter) <hi>I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, I will come unto you.</hi> But each of these <hi>three Hee's</hi> he tells of, he hath told us <hi>is by nature God</hi>; so then they are One, as God, the Word, and Spirit, are.</p>
            <p>And as to his charge of Ignorance of Philosophy about <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi> which he sayes, <hi>is not a form of a Hee, but the manner of his being.</hi>

            <p>His Charge of Ignorance, of his kind of Philosophy, and such nice distinctions (as this between <hi>manner and form</hi>) we can easily bear, and pass by, and leave them to feed upon it, who will choose such chaff for their food, knowing that the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, consists not in such trifles.</p>
            <p>W.M. <hi>The form of God the Father is his Divine Nature, but his Subsistence is his manner of being in the relative Property of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; and so he speaks of the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Subsistence</hi> of the Son and Holy Ghost (as his terms of them are.)

               <hi>That infiniteness is not applicable,</hi> and that there be <hi>three distinct Personallities, unto which infiniteness is not ascribed:</hi> Here they have given People to understand what their meaning is about their <hi>three distinct Subsistences, or Personallities,</hi> that they are not <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi> What then! Is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Finite? What gross darkness is this? Let the impartial Reader judge,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58882:27"/>
whether we have not sufficient ground and cause to oppose them and their vain Philosophy in this so high a matter, and whether herein their Doctrine doth not blasphemously oppose the Divinity of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit; and they go about to eclipse (and detract from) the Glory of the infinite God-head, whilst at other times, in contradiction, they confess each to be God, and tell of the Eternal Son of God, and say, That <hi>in the concret, every subsistent is infinite, but not the subsistance or personallity in the abstract.</hi> What darkness is here? Is God divided, or Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, separate or abstract from their Essences? and where then is this finite <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonallity</hi> so much contended for? Is it in God, yea or nay; or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Divine Being, or Substance? But if these <hi>distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonallities or subsistances,</hi> which they say <hi>are not infinite,</hi> be the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Properties of the Father, Son, and Spirit, then I ask, Hath not this Doctrine denied both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite? Let the unbyassed Readers judge. And yet in Confutation of themselves again, there's <hi>God the Father the first Person, God the Son, a Person distinct from him; God the Holy Ghost, a Person pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from both.</hi> How to make sense of these three distinctions, comparing them together, or how to make them hang together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rendering them Three Gods, and not only so, but such as are not Infinite, doth not yet appear to me. And whether my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of not understanding <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> could be three Persons (each of them an Apostle) and yet all but one Apostle, was not suitable to detect these mens unscriptural Doctrines and Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to shew the absurdity of the consequences thereof, which whilst this railing angry man, <hi>W. Madox,</hi> doth so often take it as a comparing the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to three Apostles; herein he hath grossely wronged and abused me, and his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. And his Charge of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against me (for that he intimates that I should say) <hi>That God is but equal with man.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back upon him as a most malicious horrid slander, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Lye against me. It was never my intent nor saying; for if I had said, That God is but equal with man, or compared the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost to three Apostles, then had I and these ridgid <hi>Presbyterians</hi> accorded nearer than we did, for then had I owned their Dostrine and terms of <hi>three distinct and separate persons</hi> in the God-head, which are not <hi>infinite</hi>; which I can never own,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58882:28"/>
nor believe, nor depend upon any God, or thing, which is finite, for Salvation. Besides, I never denied finite man, nor three distinct A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles (as <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) to be distinct and separate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; so if I had really compared the Deity to such, we had not differed about the distinction of separate Persons, or finite sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances in the God-head, which is no less than Blasphemy. But then, how poorly, maliciously, and falsely this <hi>W.

               <hi>Blasphemers, and blasphemy, and damnable speeches,</hi> are hideously cast upon us, but most unjustly, and falsely; for no such design ever had we, as either to blast or over-throw the Deity of Christ, or Holy Spirit, we having openly professed and declared the contrary, both in words and writings. As also his accusing us <hi>with boldly spitting in the face of God,</hi> is a gross and malicious slander, and a presumptuous taking for granted, that our opposing their corrupt unscriptural distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vain babling, was <hi>a spitting in the face of God</hi>; as if we must believe all what these men say, in this matter, to be as true as God is, and his Glory to be so deeply concern'd in their vain Philosophy: Judge whether they 'herein are competent Disputants, yea or nay? and whether these our opposers, or we, have compared God, or the Father, Son, and Spirit, to men; let the Reader judge by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>In their Answer to that Argument of <hi>W.

            </argument>
            <p>NOw let us a little observe some Passages and Arguments in <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi>'s Work; For their distinctions about <hi>Trinity of Persons</hi> (as they call them) <hi>distinguished one from another by incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable personal properties.</hi> But such kind of distinctions and terms he hath not learned from Scriptures, but from humane Inventions;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58882:29"/>
by which they have darkned the simplicity of Truth; as also he hath appeared as one in self-contradiction, when he saith, <hi>That one should be in another; the first should be in the second, and the second in the first, and both in the third, and all one and the same individual Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> Now if they be in each other, they are not separate Persons as at the Dispute was affirmed; and if one be in another, where are the personal incommucicable properties, wherein they are not Infinite as they have told us? Is there finiteness in each person, and yet each person God; what gross darkness and blasphemy is this? But then to mend the matter, <hi>T. V.</hi> tells us, <hi>This is such a Mystery as doth exceed the weak and narrow understandings of most inlightned and clear sighted Christians fully to comprehend; Some by gazing too long upon the Sun, become blind.</hi> Surely then, if it be such a Mystery as exceeds the understanding of the clear sighted, it must needs exceed the dark understanding of <hi>T. V.</hi> and his Brethren; And seeing, as appears, he was conscious to himself of his own dimness or darkness herein as by what follows; also, he should have let it alone and not troubled his head with things beyond his reach, for he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and marr'd his cause, and not at all mended nor cleared it; but if he hath assayed to demonstrate this Mystery, as he calls it, as one more clear sighted than the most inlightned, his Work doth manifest the contrary; And that <hi>God cannot represent himself other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he is</hi>; It's true: but where doth he thus represent himself as these men do, with such invented terms, vain tautologies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion? We do not read such in all the Scriptures of Truth: howbeit <hi>T. V.</hi> takes the boldness to Assert his Doctrine herein to <hi>be of Divine Authority, and to be the Truth of God revealed in his Word; and that if the Scriptures have revealed that there are Three distinct Persons in one Divine Essence, it is a certain Truth, &amp;c.</hi> This is sooner said, than proved; if that Word of God, and Scripture could be produced that doth so reveal their Doctrine, and say, <hi>there are three distinct Persons in one Divine Essence:</hi> Produce us such a Scripture among all the Writings of the Holy men of God (in all the Bible) and it shall end the Controversie; otherwise let <hi>T. V.</hi> be ashamed of his Asserting it to be revealed in the Word of God. And of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in his Sylogism, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. <hi>There is not a word but what is to be found in the Scripture</hi>; whereas neither the matter, manner, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of his Arguments are to be found in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58882:30"/>As for Instance his Argument;</p>
            <p>Pag. 13. <hi>The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, are either three Substances, or three Manifestations, or three Operations, or three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or something else; but they are not three Substances, nor three Manifestations, nor three Operations, nor any thing else; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are three Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first part; Indeed they must be something; to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> if they be neither three Substances, Manifestations, &amp;c. nor any thing else, this renders them nothing, and contradicts both the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> and Conclusion where they are something else, which is three Persons (he saith) so the tenour of his Argument runs thus, they are something; but they are nothing (he meant nothing else but three Persons) therefore they are three Persons. It would have held better thus, but against himself, If the Father, the Word, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, be not three distinct Substances, then not three distinct Persons; but they are not three distinct Substances, Ergo. unless he can shew us a distinct person without its own substance: But his Brother <hi>T.D.</hi> saith, A person is <hi>rationalis naturae individua, substantia,</hi> an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual substance, of a rational nature; see how flatly <hi>T.D.</hi> and <hi>T.V.</hi> have Contradicted one another herein; one affirming they are three Persons, because not three Substances; the other, That a person is an individual substance: But if <hi>T. V.</hi> by saying, There is not a word in his Syllogism, but what is to be found in Scripture; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that every word particularly is to be found in Scripture; the word <hi>Substance,</hi> the word <hi>Manifestation, Operation, Person, &amp;c.</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractively, what proves this of his matter? for the contrary may as well be asserted from bare words; I never met with more silly kind of Arguing before: And if so be his other Argument from the Property of the Father to beget, of the Son to be begotten, of the Holy Ghost to proceed from them both, &amp;c. be an Argument sufficient to prove Three distinct Persons in the God-head, with three incommunicable Properties, &amp;c. Then doth it not follow as well, That every spiritual perfect Gift that proceeds from God to man; must needs be a Person, and then so many Gifts, or manifold Graces as proceed from him (or are begotten by him) are so many Persons in him, which would be numerous indeed, and amount to a Plural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Trinities; for the Spitit is given variously, and in divers Manifestations, and the graces &amp; gift of God are many and manifold;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58882:30"/>
but the shallowness of this mans arguing, who is it cannot see? besides that Christ being the express Image of the Fathers substance, and the Spirit the Life of both; it's neither scriptural nor reasonable to say that the Image and Life of One and the same thing, should be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Two distinct and separate Persons from it, or from their own substance; so that still it follows, that if the Three bearing Record in Heaven, be One divine substance, and not Three substances; then not Three distinct or separate Persons: As also, God is called both the Word and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Farther, Mark the manner of <hi>T. V.</hi> his expressing his Doctrine, viz. <hi>The Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Divine Essence, and the Unity of the Divine Essenee in the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that three should be one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Here you may see</hi> T.V. <hi>his invented un-scriptural rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and that one should be three; that three should be distinguished but not divided, that one should not be another; the first should not be the second, nor the second the third, nor the second or third the first; and yet the first second and third the same that the first should be in the second, and the second in the first, and both first and second in the third.</hi> Thus far <hi>T.V.</hi> for his separate persons.</p>
            <p>Reader, Do but mark his Jigg here, and what a whirling he has made like one distempered; but where is his Scripture for all this? see how he manages it, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. he saith, <hi>Reason it may be will leave us in our search after the Deity in the Trinity, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp;c. but where Reason faileth, Faith must supply its room:</hi> And then tells us <hi>of Mysteries which Reason cannot demonstrate to us, and that in this Mystery of the Trinity we must Exercise our Faith, though we cannot clear it to our selves by demonstration, &amp;c.</hi> But sure whilst Reason hath so much failed <hi>T. V.</hi> and his Brethren in this matter, that thereby they cannot clear it to themselves by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, its very strange and unreasonable they should make such a stir in the dark, as they have done, to Impose it on the Faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and what tends this to, but to force People to Exercise an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith, whilst they have neither Scripture, Reason, Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, nor Revelation (for that's ceased they say) to ground a Faith upon in this matter, as he argues, <hi>viz. If the Divine Essence, or God head, can be but One, and the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Ghost God, and they three distinct Subsistents, or Persons, then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58882:31"/>
they are three distinct Subsistents or Persons, in the same single Divine Essence, but the Essence can be but One, and the Father is God, the Son God, &amp;c. and they are three distinct Subsistents or Persons; therefore there are three distinct Subsistents, or Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the moderate Readers but mark this Argument, and whether it carries any matter or weight of any proof or Argumentation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it any more than an Empty Assertion: (Tautologies) begging the Question in the sequel of the <hi>Major,</hi> and so along still, taking the matter in Controversie for granted, which cannot be without better proof, and more convincing Arguments than <hi>T.V.</hi> hath patched up and produced; But as for the beginning of his Argument, That the Divine Essence, or God-head, can be but One, and this in each of the Three, we never denied; and <hi>T. V.</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <hi>it is not denied by us,</hi> pag. 28. But as for the rest of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it runs in the substance of it thus; <hi>If they be three distinct sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistents or persons, then there are three distinct subsistents or persons; But they are three distinct subsistents, therefore, &amp;c. Or, if they be so, then they are so; but they are so, therefore they are so.</hi> I shall not need to say much, to shew what mean Logick this is, since it is from a Person whom Reason has so far failed, that he can neither clear nor demonstrate that to himself, which thus pitifully he has assayed to demonstrate to others: And so let the Readers judge if he be not such an one as he tells of, that by attempting to bring that Mystery to the Modal of his Reason, hath lost the sight, and sunk into grosse Apprehensions.</p>
            <p>And as for his fierce Railing against <hi>W. P.</hi> and calling him, <hi>wretched Blasphemer,</hi> accusing him with <hi>denying that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, and with denying the Divinity of Christ and Holy Ghost, and with thrusting the Lord Jesus Christ off from the Throne of his God-head, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not yet perceived any strength or weight of Argument from either <hi>T.V.</hi> or his Brethren, that has convicted <hi>W. P.</hi> as guilty herein; but rather the more they strive with him, and thus grossely revile him, and rail against him, the more their Folly, Confusion, and Weakness appears: And indeed if <hi>W. P.</hi> be supposed to be so grossely Erroneous as he is represented, it must be more Competent Antagonists than <hi>T. V.</hi> or such Railers as he, that must Convince him: But his shewing the absurdity of <hi>T.V.</hi> his Doctrines, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58882:31"/>
both unscriptural and unreasonable Distinctions; and his denyal thereof, is neither a denyal of the Son, nor Spirit, nor the Divinity of either; but the apparent falseness of these railing and slanderous Accusations before, with the Consequences thereof against <hi>W. P.</hi> in this thing, touching the Divinity of Christ, &amp;c. appears in his own Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 14
<q>Of Christ being the only God, and the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being inseparable to each (whom they call) Person, have the whole Divine Nature, the Son in the Father, and the Spirit in the Son, unless the God-head be as incommunicable to the Person (so called) as they are reported to be among themselves,</q> saith <hi>W.P.</hi> Doth not <hi>W.P.</hi> herein own the Divinity of Christ and Holy Spirit, let the indifferent judge how <hi>T.V.</hi> has wronged him.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>W. P.</hi> his Admonition, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. saith,
<q>Apply thy mind unto the Light and Grace which brings Salvation; that by obedience thereunto, those mists Tradition hath cast before thy eyes, may be expel'd, and thou receive a certain knowledge of that one God, whom to know is Life Eternal, not to be a divided, but ONE pure, intire, and eternal Being; who in the fulness of time sent forth his Son, as the true Light which enlightneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man; that whosoever followed him (the Light) might be translated from the dark Notions, and vain Conversations of men, to this Holy Light, in which onely sound Judgment and eternal Life are obtainable; (he) testified the virtue of it, and has communicated unto all such a proportion, as may enable them to follow his Example. </q>[thus far <hi>W.P.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Now mark, whether herein he has not owned the Divinity of the Son, when thus plainly he hath confessed to his Light, both as to its Extent and Virtue. And so as for <hi>T. V.</hi> his railing against us so bitterly, calling us, <hi>black-mouth'd Blasphemers</hi>; accusing <hi>W. P. with Heathenism, abominableness, foulness</hi>; falsely comparing him to <hi>Arius &amp;c.</hi> These are but mean Arguments to Convince <hi>W.

What cruel work would they make if they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their hands to persecute such as cannot be tyed up to their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Spirits and Principles, which is the same old persecuting Spirit that cryed for Fire and Faggot, after it put these names, <hi>Blasphemer and Hereticks,</hi> upon the Martyrs: And indeed, if any should be

so disingenious and drowned in their understandings by prejudice, as to think that the Absurdities that <hi>W. P.</hi> draws from his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries Principles, are his own; they may be apt to charge him with Blasphemy, and what not, though falsely: But farther, how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hath <hi>W.P.</hi> in his 18, 19, 21 <hi>pag.</hi> owned and confessed Christ the Son of God, and his Light, and Grace, both for Remission of sins, Reconciliation, Salvation of men, Life Eternal; and as he is the only begotten of the Father, the Gift and Expression of Eternal Love for Salvation; Now can any thing have (or work) these Effects that is not Divine? Is not Christ's Divinity, Virtue, Divine Light and Power, plainly confest by <hi>W.P.</hi> herein, as also to his being God, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. How grossely have these angry <hi>Presbyterians</hi> wronged him in so hidiously charging the contrary upon him; and are not they rather justly chargeable herein, with denying the Divinity of Christ, in setting so slight by his Light in every man, as they have done, one calling it <hi>an Idol</hi>; another Cautioning not to follow its guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; But the Divinity of Christ, and the Honour due to him, far be it from us to deny, as these men have done; and the Scripture-instances in that case, we both know and own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.58. But we are not convinced, that mens invented distinctions put upon Christ, does add any thing to his Honour, but rather diminish from it.</p>
            <p>And where in <hi>pag.</hi> 31. it is said, <hi>In regard of his humane Nature, the</hi> Jewes <hi>spoke true, Thou art not yet fifty years old; as Man, he was a Son of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and born many generations after him, &amp;c.</hi> Now I ask if he was not a Person as Man, and so born? And if there were three Coeternal Persons before, whether this doth not make a fourth? For as he was not fifty years old, this had not reference to his Divine Nature, as is confessed; But then, where in <hi>pag.</hi> 36. <hi>The generation of the Son must be Eternal, the Son being so:</hi> (they say) How is his Personallity, with reference to his being begotten, denyed to be Infinite? in <hi>pag.</hi> 45. What gross and apparent Contradictions are these?</p>
            <p>And as to his instance, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.16, 17. how that Jesus went up out of the Water, and the Spirit descended like a Dove, and lo a Voice from Heaven, to prove a <hi>distinction of all the Three Persons; the Son was cloathed in Flesh, the Spirit in the shape of a Dove, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58882:32"/>
Father was in the Voice, he saith, &amp;c.</hi> Let the Reader but mark how far short of proving his Distinction, this instance is: Surely he will not say, That the Son was cloathed in Flesh from Eternity, nor the Spirit in a bodily shape like a Dove from Eternity; for if their Personallities did consist in these visible Appearances, how were they Coeternal, Coessential, Coequal with God, &amp;c? And surely Personallity doth not consist in the shape of a Dove, neither do we read of the Person of a Dove, besides the Spirits appearing in a bodily shape like a Dove, doth not prove that the Spirit was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or separate Person from Jesus, for he had the Spirit in him, and was not separate from the Spirit, though that appearance like a Dove, was for a Confirmation to <hi>John</hi>'s belief of him, <hi>John</hi> 1.32, 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.V.</hi> (Isa. 6.3.) <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts: the three Holies, signifies the three persons; the Lord of Hosts, the One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must confess I never heard this Argument before; if each Holy signifie a Person, how then are they spoken to the One God? And if so many Holies as are given in praise to him, do signifie so many distinct Persons in him, then they will amount to a great many Trinities; for it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. <hi>They rest not day nor night, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, &amp;c.</hi> Now if all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies they give day and night to him, be so many Persons, then they will amount to Persons <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; but the absurdity of this Argument who cannot but see? As also his Argument from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Names, is little better; for God is denominated under many Names more than Three; And also his arguing from <hi>John</hi> 14, 15, &amp; 16. <hi>chap.</hi> from <hi>personal Acts,</hi> as he calls them, as sending the Comforter, his speaking and guiding, &amp;c. Where doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call them Personal Acts? Were they not Spiritual Acts of the Divine Spirit and Power of God? And was there any Act but what was brought forth in time? And was the Father's begetting the Son a Personal Act? (however was it not an Act in time) if so, how sayes <hi>T. V.</hi> That the Generation of the Son must be Eternal? What distracted confused work is here!</p>
            <p>And as to that Cavil in <hi>pag.</hi> 40. at the word ONE, as not being in the Hebrew, in all those Scriptures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.25. <hi>chap.</hi> 48.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.22. where Holy One is mentioned in the English, which

            <p>And as to <hi>W.

V.</hi> nor <hi>T.

P.</hi> is so far unvail'd, as to have a sight and discovery of, though this dark ridged <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Spirit hath sought by Persecution, false Reports, and Slanders, to vail and obscure both him and others, in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree, breakings forth, or glimerings of true Light have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; where they could not do it by slandering, grossely villify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and traducing them, they would endeavour to bring Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Cruelty, and outward Restraint upon them, to their Power.</p>
            <p>And as for their taxing <hi>W.P.</hi> for instancing <hi>Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Origen, Theophil.</hi> and others, as appearing forreign to the matter in Controversie, &amp;c. they telling us, <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity is plainly enough to be gathered from several passages in</hi> Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us lib. 1. ch. 2. <hi>Ecclesia accipit fidem quae est in unum Deum Patrem Omnipotentem &amp; in unum Christum filium Dei incarnatum &amp; in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Sanctum qui per Prophetas praedicavit:</hi> And then our Opposers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58882:33"/>
ask, <hi>Do not these words hold forth a distinction of those three persons?</hi> To which I say, However he gathers or imagines such a distinction of their being three Persons, he does but beg the Question in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them three Persons, which their words no not prove, nor so call them; <hi>but God the Father Omnipotent, Christ the Son of God, and the Holy Ghost (in whom the Faith of the Church is)</hi> Neither do the latter words prove any thing for this purpose, which mention <hi>the God of all things, making and governing all things by his word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> If he had asserted no otherwise herein then <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath done, there had not been this Controversie between us, and them. And as for the rest of the Authors they mention, I do not find that they called them <hi>three distinct separate persons</hi> (as <hi>T. D.</hi> did) in all these Passages mentioned and quoted by them; And its known that <hi>W.P.</hi> his Controversie was principally against them for unscriptural Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>the God-head subsisting in three distinct and separate persons</hi>; which also their own Instance of <hi>Theophil. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Com. in Evang.</hi> doth contradict, <hi>viz. Margarita pretiosa est Sancta Trinitas quae dividi non potest nam in unitate consistit</hi>; the Holy Trinity is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel, which cannot be divided, because it consisteth in Unity: To which I say then, the Glorious Three that bear Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are not three separate Persons; howbeit we are not bound to believe the determinations of Fathers and Councils any farther than they accord with the pure Language of Scripture.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T.V.</hi> and his Brethren, supposing that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the weakness and absurdity of <hi>W.

(truly) <hi>saith is communicated unto all, and forsake the true Light of the Word and Spirit, which alone can guide men into all truth.</hi> This is a groundless Caution, and false as it reflects upon the Light; for suppose <hi>W.P.</hi> were in Weakness as they say, yet the Light is not the cause thereof; however his Weakness (as they call it) hath brought forth much of their Folly; for the Light which is communicated unto all, which People should follow the Guidance of, is the Light of Christ, which inlightens every man coming into the World; and therefore to render weakness, absurdity, falshood, and folly, as the Products of it, is both grosse Ignorance and Blasphemy; for the Light never changeth, however the Creature may; neither is this Light contrary to the Word, Spirit, or Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58882:34"/>And as for their so much Railing against the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and malitiously comparing any of us with them, it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable way to Convince either us or them, if we were as ill as they render us; for they have gone the way to animate and encourage both <hi>Socinians,</hi> and others, against them, and their absurdities, and ridged inveterate Spirits, and Railing against many that are of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spirits (as men at least) than themselves. As for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> they have given ground to some to think the better of them, because they have shewn so much hatred and reviling against them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Socinians</hi> (if there be any that own themselves by that Name) may answer to their Accusations, it is not my work to maintain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Quarrel, nor yet to reflect upon their Persons, nor either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or excuse them, to gratifie such incompetent Judges as these our Revilers.</p>
            <p>I am not going about to gratifie Parties, or private Opinions (or man's Wisdom) on any hand, but to vindicate the naked Truth; yet, it's true, I have heard of some, beyond the Sea, that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Name <hi>Socinians,</hi> who were accused with denying the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ; but I know of none here, that either deny the Divinity of Christ, or Him to be of one Substance with the Father; if our Opposers do know of any such, they may tell them of it, and not accuse the Innocent with the Guilty, as they have done to us. However, it is but a mean way of Arguing, to accuse or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call any for owning any Truth that any sort (if they do Err in some things) do hold; for by that way, I may as well be reckoned a <hi>Papist,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Turk, Episcopal,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or what not? because some Truths are held by them all, in words: But we had not our Principles either from <hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Socinias,</hi> neither did we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny the Divinity of Christ (or his being of the same Substance with the Father) as <hi>Arius, Socinias,</hi> and others, are accused; so that therein we are very unjustly compared and mis-represented, for which I can say, <hi>The Lord forgive these our prejudiced Opposers.</hi> But it is no strange thing for us to be called by nick-Names one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, by these and such false Accusers and incompetent Judges; for one while they were wont to Revile us for wanting Learning, being Illiterate, Lay-men, Preachers, &amp;c.

            <argument>
               <p>Touching the Love of God in Christ, the One Offering, and how his being a Sacrifice for Sin is owned by us, according to the Scripture, and for what end construed or applyed by these our Opposers, and their corrupt Doctrines, and Inferences to cover and maintain Sin and Imperfection tearm of Life, under the notion of Satisfaction and Imputation, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>SOme <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Priests, and Professors of other sorts also, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, <hi>That man having transgressed the Righteous Law of God, and so exposed to the Penalty of Eternal Wrath; It's altogether impossible for God to remit, forgive, or save men without a plenary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, both by full Payment and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid on Christ the same that sin and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deserved,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Yet [in Contradiction] they other whiles state it as an Act of Law, and Contract between Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Surety, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Christ as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person; but [in Contradiction again] 'tis as God-Man, (as their words are.)</hi>
               </note> which (they reckon) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <hi>for sins past, present, and to come</hi>; So that though People live in sin, all their dayes (as Priests plead) yet they sooth up themselves in sin, under this opinion, that all's done for them at once. But whether it be for all men, or but for some, <hi>T. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> hath not discovered, nor ingeniously opened the extent of their Belief and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in this matter, but has catched and snatched here and there, and then gone to his wonted course of grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and snarling, by Reviling and Railing, having not Asserted, nor yet minded the End and Intent of his Opposer's Reasons (from Scripture) and Cautions in this matter, on the behalf of God's infinite Love, Mercy, and Grace towards lost man, which is judged
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58882:35"/>
(and not without cause) these Priests Doctrine doth eclipse and lesson [which we do not concerning the Sacrifice of Christ, as <hi>T.V.</hi> falsely thinks] as their laying <hi>an Impossibility</hi> on God in the case; against which many Scriptures were urged, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 31.31. <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 32 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. whereby, with many others, is proved;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord God to be Merciful, Gracious to forgive Sin and Iniquity, and to pardon Transgression upon man, return and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of his evil way, and that he retaineth not his anger for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That it was Gods free Love and Grace to the World, to give his only begotten Son, that none should perish, but have everlasting Life, who believed in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That it was God's Work to Reconcile the World unto himself, in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That the Benefits and Effects of Free Grace, and Love in Christ Jesus, as Pardon, Remission, Reconciliation, Redemption through his Blood, &amp;c. are of the nature and riches of this Grace, to all that truly receive it.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. That this Free Grace of God, with its blessed Effects in the true Receivers, are not of Debt, Purchase, or Merit on the Creatures part, but Free according to the nature of Free Grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. That the Love, Kindness, and Goodness of God is perfect and infinite in him, and so in its self not be added to, or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. That the Goodness of God where it takes impression, or is received in man in the free tenders of it in Christ Jesus, it is the principal inducement, or cause of Repentance, and forsaking of Sin.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. And the Tenders of Grace and Salvation in Christ, are free to all, so that man's rejecting and slighting of it, and of God's Kindness therein, is the cause of his being rejected of God. <hi>O man, thy destruction is of thy self, but thy help is in me, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9thly. Seeing that many of their own Brethren have confessed God to be infinite in his Power, and in all Perfections, and to his Divine Attributes (as their term is) and that he is free in them, and so his Love, Goodness, and Mercy, which attend his Judgment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58882:35"/>
being felt in the way thereof, by them that wait therein upon him; Why should any Doctrine or Supposition be brought forth, that doth at least seem to diminish his Love and Good Will, by either mis-representing it in its self, or render it partially in its extent, as only design'd (or but free) for a few, &amp; that upon full payment, and also the same full punishment and wrath that sinners deserved, by a Person distinct and separate from himself as Jesus Christ hath been mis-represented, He being One with the Father, who said, <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father worketh, and I work, and the Son doth nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but what he seeth the Father do, that he doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10thly. Christ being the Brightness of the Glory of God, and the express Image of his Divine Substance, as also truly called the Son of his Love; by him is exprest, and clearly signified, God's Free Love, Goodness, and Mercy towards Mankind, both in his Life, Ministry, and Sufferings, in the dayes of his Flesh.</p>
            <p n="11">11thly. It being the Love, Patience, Long-suffering of God, and Riches of his Grace that leads to Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. all which were truly expressed, signified, and bore Testimony unto, by Christ Jesus, both in his Ministery, Suffering, and Death on the Cross, as also by his Resurrection, and most Glorious Ascention. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God, which is unto Salvation to the true Believers, was shewed forth, and born witness unto; and blessed are they that receive the true sense thereof in its operation and effects.</p>
            <p n="12">12thly. I also know, and confess, That it was in God's Infinite and Free Love, that Christ gave himself a Ransom for all, to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of in due time.</p>
            <p>And that in the same Love he hath given himself for us, an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. and therefore God is to be followed, and Christ obeyed, by all that receive his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now to <hi>T. V.</hi> his Terms and Assertion; seeing he has not been plain, nor given any ingenious nor satisfactory Answer; I ask and Query;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st. WHere doth the Scripture say, That it is <hi>impossible</hi> for God to pardon or forgive without a plenary Satisfaction, as an act of Law, made to his offended or vindictive Justice by another?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58882:36"/>2dly. And if this Satisfaction depend upon a second Person, or God equal with the Father, as (<hi>T.V.</hi> saith) Christ is proved to be, and not upon any finite Creature, Is not this all one as to say, that God satisfied God; and then what non-scence is it to lay it upon a second Person distinct from him, and yet coequal with him? where doth he prove these words in Scripture? Doth not this, like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine, either render them two distinct Gods, differing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselves, the one abounding in Judgement, the other in Mercy; or else God to differ from himself, and so to give Christ for his own Pacification, and not Man's real Reformation; whilst the Notion of plenary satisfaction is made a cover or pretence for Peoples continuing in, an imperfect, sinful, polluted state, which the Priests Plead for the continuance of, in all, term of Life? And does not this their Doctrine lead People to trample the Blood of the New Covenant under foot, and this is to deny the one Offering?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. And was that the end of Christ giving himself a Ransom, being an Offering, and Dying for All, that men might live in sin all their time, and say they are Pardoned and Redeemed, whilst they are still in Bondage?</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Is God fully satisfied that any should live in sin, or is his infinite Justice satisfied so, as not to lay hold on them in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful state?</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. If the Wrath of God be revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, and every disobedience shall have a just Recompence of Reward; How then is Divine Justice fully satisfied and answered for All in that state, without their coming under the sence of it in themselves? For if so, then nothing is to be done within them; and then how did the Believers know the terrors of the Lord, the sentence of Death in themselves, the Law that Ministers Wrath, the Ministration of Condemnation, which in his time was Glorious, and the Righteousness of the Law fulfilled in them by Christ Jesus, who came to condemn sin in the Flesh for that end, wherein still, we confess to the one Offering, and the blessed effects thereof.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. And if All must live in sin all their time, does not this tend to settle People upon their Lees, and set them at ease in a false security in Sin and Transgression, and so to deny the one Offering and Sacrifice that puts away sin?</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58882:36"/>7thly. And if such a plenary Satisfaction (as it is called) be made for <hi>some</hi> in that sinful state, why not for <hi>all?</hi> Do ye not here render God partial, whereas Christ died for All, tasted Death for Every man, gave himself a Ransom for All, which you <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (to wit, <hi>T. D.</hi> and others) have denyed (and so you make Sects) and therein have opposed Scriptures, and the Extent of God's Love and Good Will to all men; but we Testifie to it, and own Christ's Death and Sufferings, and Effect of his Righteousness to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest within by the Spirit, to every one that believeth.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. Why doth <hi>T. V.</hi> so vilifie a man for Confessing according to Scripiture, to the infinite Love and Mercy of God towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and his reasoning for it from Scripture; seeing that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth the impossibility of any finite Creature to make any plenary satisfaction to his offended Justice; And many of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have confessed the Divine Attributes to be in God, and he free in them, as infinite Love, Goodness, Mercy as well as Justice. As also he may find in the Common Prayer Book, That the Gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercifulness of God, is confessed unto more then he has done.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> accuseth <hi>W.P.</hi> with <hi>seeming to insinuate, that he denys only the impossibility of Gods pardoning sin without satisfaction, but that his Arguments are against Satisfaction it self,</hi> he saith: Whereas <hi>W. P</hi>'s own Testimony stands against him in this matter, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 32. which <hi>T. V.</hi> to his own Contradiction is also made to confess, that <hi>W. P.</hi> confesseth,
<q>That Christ offered unto God a satisfactory Sacrifice, &amp;c. yea, a most satisfactory Sacrifice; but not to help God as being otherwise unable to save men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However it is evident that <hi>W. P.</hi> has, according to Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to God's Power, Omnipotency, Infiniteness; and also, That Jesus Christ in Life, Doctrine, and Death, fulfilled his Fathers Will, and offered up a most satisfactory Sacrifice; so that he hath been wrongfully accused concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> saith, That <hi>God's Righteousness and Truth, obliegeth him to take vengeance upon all that have transgressed his Law; and his will to punish sin and sinners according to their desert, his Justice doth ingage him, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> How then is God free in his Attributes, as they confess? and his Good Will shewed by Christ unto men for their good, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation; or hath God two contrary Wills, the one obliging him to take Vengeance, or execute Judgement to the uttermost upon All; <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Where then is his absolute Power and soveraignity so much profest?</hi>
               </note> and the other, to Exercise Patience, Forbearance, and shew Mercy, and so not to Will the Death of Sinners, but rather their Return that they may Live: Is there any variableness or shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Change in God, or rather, is not the Love and Good Will of God held forth in Christ to all men in the first place, and that then when he Chasteneth, Corrects, &amp; Reproves any for sin, it is not in Vengeance or Fury, but in Love and Good Will; for his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is to fall upon his Adversaries, that have rejected and turned against him, and the free proffers of his Love in Christ Jesus, and who have Crucified Christ unto themselves a-fresh, and trampled upon the Blood of the Covenant, and so despised the one Offering which was offered up once for all, as a real Witness of God's Good Will, Patience, Forbearance, Long-suffering towards all.</p>
            <p>And now to <hi>T. V.</hi> his saying, <hi>That Sinners must have Divine help to inable them to their duty, or in doing good; and when they have done their duty, their works are but imperfect, and they unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table servants; and for it brings</hi> Luke 17.10. <hi>When you have done all the things commanded, say we are unprofitable servants, our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is as filthy raggs,</hi> Isa. 64.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Professors,</hi> were come to know a Divine help in what you do, and to do all the things Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you would give us a better account of those Works and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances brought forth by Divine help, than to compare them to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Raggs: Divine help would cloath you with better Garments than filthy Raggs: What sad Doctrine is this, to say the Good that is done by Divine help, and that doing all things Commanded of God, are but as filthy Raggs? What darkness is this, not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between self-Righteousness, which are but as filthy Raggs, and the good that's done by Divine help, that hath a beauty and splendour of God's Righteousness with it: Is this the construction you make of Christ's Satisfaction, or being a Sacrifice to God, that you must be cloathed upon, all your Life time, with your own filthy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58882:37"/>
Raggs of self-Righteousness. And then to cover over all these your <hi>Babylonish Brats,</hi> with a pretence of Christ's Satisfaction, paying your Debt for you, imputation of his Righteousness, deceitfully and feignedly applyed by you to your selves in your filthy Raggs, whilst you have no share in it, nor feel in you the Effect of his sufferings, as if you were only to believe, and apply, and sin all your time, you are far from the state of the unprofitable Servant that did all that he was Commanded: You are daily breaking the Commands of God, and Plead for it: much more farther from the state of those whom Christ called no more Servants, but Friends.</p>
            <p>T. V. <hi>That God never doth, nor will, nor can pardon any sinner without satisfaction made to his offended Justice for their sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But then in Contradiction to himself, he saith, <hi>I shall not concern my self to inquire what God could, or might do, if he pleased</hi>; Why then doth he say, he never will, nor can; and seem to lay such an Impossibility upon God in the case, as if he could not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pardon; whereas he could do whatsoever he pleased; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he could both please and satisfie himself.</p>
            <p>And then I Query, How is this Satisfaction made by Christ?</p>
            <p>T. V. <hi>It depends upon him as the second Person in the Trinity, pag.</hi> 54.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query.</hi> Does it depend upon him as Man, or as God and Man?</p>
            <p>T. V. <hi>It was necessary that the Person that should make Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be Man, because none but a Creature could suffer:</hi> But then he adds, <hi>It were necessary he should be God, othewise the sufferings and satisfaction would have been but finite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query.</hi> What then, were the Sufferings Infinite that the Wicked inflicted upon the Body of Christ, seeing nothing but a Creature could suffer, he saith, and yet as a Creature could give no proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Satisfaction to Infinite Justice: What Confusion is here? For as God, he could not Suffer nor Die, as is confessed; but God did strengthen the Manhood to bear up <hi>under such opressure of Wrath:</hi> But where doth the Scripture say, That Christ the second Person in the Trinity, did suffer under infinite Wrath, either as God or Man, or both? He should have produced his plain Scripture, for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we own, and Christ's Satisfaction as rightly stated, and what a most acceptable Sacrifice he was to the Father for All; yea, his Suffering as Man, or in the Flesh, without the Gates at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:58882:38"/>
was all acceptible to God; his Soul was also made an Offering for sin, and that he was a Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World; the Mystery, Virtue, and Effects of his Sufferings, none knows but they that believe in his Name, and receive the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith. But indeed the manner of <hi>T.V</hi>'s stating the business, I do not see that sense can be made of it, whilst he makes it a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a second Person distinct from God, and yet not as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for as such the Sufferings were finite as he faith, that could not bear a proportionable Satisfaction to infinite Justice, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as God united that did bear up and strengthen the man under opressure of Wrath that made this Satisfaction, as he hath stated it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> What amounts this to, that God made a satisfaction to, and paid himself either by inflicting infinite Wrath upon Christ as God (which cannot be) or else that he satisfied himself by the finite Suffering of Christ as man,<note place="margin">

               </note> when as that which was finite could not satisfie infiniteness (they say) And as <hi>God-man</hi> can, they say he was the subject of Wrath or vindictive Justice (as their term is) How these things should be reconciled, I leave to the ingenious Readers to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes still we know that God was ever satisfied and well-pleased in Christ Jesus and in all his Works, and it was God that was in him reconciling the World unto himself, and Christ is the Son of his Love; and it was out of his Free Love that he sent him into the World: His sending Christ surely was his own Free Grace, and no man's Purchasing, and then his Love was openly testified of, when Christ was come, who came in that Free Love of God which was testified and held forth in Christ Jesus to man, and he gave himself a Ransom to Redeem and Purchase man out of Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and not to let him lye in sin and imperfection all his life time; the Good Will of God in sending Christ, in delivering him up for man, and giving him for a Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, and his tenders of Free Pardon, Remission, and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, was, that man might receive Christ, and come into the Living Faith, and be partaker in himself of those precious benefits, &amp; Heavenly Priviledges tendred in Christ, &amp; not that man should live in sin <note n="*" place="margin">

his time; for an Act of Free Pardon is not granted, that men may take liberty to live in Sedition and Treason all their life; but for those Offences past: Nor that men should Plead, that all Offences past, present, and to come, are Pardoned; therefore they cannot be free from Rebellion, Sedition, and Treason all their Life time; this were a sad Consequence and not to be born; then you that plead a Satisfaction made to God, extending thus far your sin and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection term of Life, being in you the ground of this Plea, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that which you cover and maintain by it, and then when God and Christ require true Repentance, perfect Obedience, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c. you tell God the Debt is paid, and all satisfied by another without you; How then do you Answer the pure Law and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings of God within?</p>

               <hi>Query.</hi> What then, Do you think that God will be satisfied on your parts with your filthy Raggs, rotten Clouts, Dross and Dung, which you offer to him; or will he not rather take it as a mockery or wrong at your hands, thus meanly to requite him? what do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58882:39"/>
you signifie for him? Was this the end of Christs suffering for Man, and his being a Sacrifice well-pleasing to God, and a Propitiation for the sins of the whole World; did he appease Wrath, fulfil Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, bear the Sins, or the burthen of them, in his own Body, that men might take this liberty to Sin, Pollution, Rebellion term of Life, and so live all their time in Disloyalty, and without subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; and then, when he requires Obedience of you, and to answer his pure Law in the heart, you go and offer a few rotten Clouts, filthy Raggs, Dross and Dung, and such nauceous stuffe to him; will not he return it upon your own faces as a mockery and contempt done to him? <hi>Behold, I will spread Dung upon your faces, even the Dung of your solemn Feasts,</hi> Mal. 2. So it may be justly said, Even the Dung of all your best Performances, feigned Humility, feigned Confessions, feigned Prayers, feigned Pretences, feigned Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, feigned claiming an Interest in the Satisfaction and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righteousness and Obedience of Christ, whilst you are out of it, cloathed with your own rotten Clouts, and filthy Raggs. And if a People should deal thus with their Prince, after he has granted and given an Act of Free Pardon and Indempnity, that they should both take liberty to Rebellion and Treason, and not only so, but Plead for it as you do for sin term of Life, and tell People, they must lay hold, and apply this Pardon; but they must not expect to be free from actual Rebellion against their Prince while they live; How would this be taken, and what ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unworthiness would this import on their parts? How would they be acquitted before him? Nay, if they should go to requite their Prince by spreading a deal of rotten Clouts before him, and a deal of Dross and Dung under his Nostrils, every day, upon his Table; and not only so, but publickly in the sight of the People once or twice a Week at least (as you do your sinful Prayers and Performances) would not this be taken as an high Affront and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity put upon a Merciful Prince? Judge what would be the effect hereof? Nay, if you should present an Oblation before him mixt with Poyson and Infection, and he know it to be so, what would be your recompence! And do you not present your sinful Prayers and Performances before the Lord, from your sinful polluted hearts, which are deceitful, and desperate wicked above all things, and therefore full of deadly Corruption and Poyson; will your

            <p>That the Son of Man came to give his Life, a Ransom for many, and that he is the Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, and that in due time he died for the ungodly, bare our sins in his own Body upon the Tree, that he was wounded for the Transgressions of the People, that he hath loved us, and given himself for us an Offering and Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour: See <hi>Matth,</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. yea, we own and confess to Christ in his Suffering, being an Offering dying for the ungodly, more than you <hi>Presbyterians do.</hi> First, as to the Universal Love of God shewed forth therein. Secondly, As to the Vertue, Power, and Effects of his Death, Sacrifice, Blood, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, In that he Died for <hi>All men,</hi> for the Ungodly in general; tasted Death for <hi>every man,</hi> gave himself a Ransom for All, to be testified of in due time; that he is the Propitiation for the sins of the whole World, which you say is but for a few, only, for a select number, the World of Believers, &amp;c. as both <hi>T. D.</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> both in Words and Writings; and <hi>T.V.</hi> brings 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. and mentions only <hi>gave himself a Ransom,</hi> and leaves out the words for <hi>All</hi>; pag. 56. And thus minces, as if he had no mind to hear that Grace is free for All as well as himself, but only for a few perhaps <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and such-like, whom there is no reason or equallity for God to take such special notice and regard of, more than others; for their Spirits and Hearts are as perverse and corrupt as others, if not more ridged and envious; and their Garments of Self-Righteousness, are as polluted, ragged, and filthy as others, or worse; Thus much they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in their Prayers; but perhaps they'l take it ill that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should tell them of it.</p>
            <p>Then Secondly, The Power of Christ and his blessed Effects in his Death, acceptable Sacrifice, &amp;c. we own more than they; for he gave himself to Redeem Man from Sin and Transgression, and the servitude of it; and his Blood purgeth the Conscience, cleanseth from all sin; his Flesh is given for the Life of the World, that Man may come to rise out of sin, and live again to God in perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; God hath set him forth to be a Propitiation, through
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58882:40"/>
Faith, in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness for the Remission of Sins past, through the forbearance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. He doth not say, for sins past, present, and to come; and that all must be sinful and imperfect all their dayes, and yet all forgiven, God being satisfied in Christ for all, whilst he is not satisfied in them, but his Spirit daily grieved, where as Christs Appearance was to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sin by the Sacrifice of himself; and if it was to put sin away, to cleanse man from it, and not that he should say, that only the Guilt is done away, but not the Act and Pollution of Sin, which is the gross corruption and false construction of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>T.V.</hi> his wonder at <hi>W.P.</hi> his challenging any Person to give him one Scripture phrase which doth approach the Doctrine of Satisfaction. But <hi>T.V.</hi> has deceitfully left out his following words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>Considering to what degree it is stretched (the degree whereto it is stretched by these Priests, is mentioned before) not that we do deny, but really confess, that Jesus Christ in Life, Doctrine, and Death, fulfilled his Father's Will, and offered up a most satisfactory Sacrifice, but not to pay God (as otherwise being unable to save men (he saith.)</q>
And further adds,
<q>And for a Justification by an imputative Righteousness, whilst not real, it's meerly an Imagination, not a reality, and therefore rejected; otherwise (that which is real, which is the Righteousness of Faith really received and injoyed in the true and Living Faith) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and known to be justifying before God, because there is no abiding in Christ's Love, without keeping his Commandements; I therefore, saith he, Caution thee in Love, not longer to deceive thy self by the over-fond imbraces of Humane Apprehensions for Divine Mysteries, but rather be informed, that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a measure of his Grace on thee and me, to shew us what is good, that we may obey and do it; which if thou diligently wilt observe, thou shalt be led out of all unrighteousness, and in thy obedience shalt thou receive Power to become a Son of God, in which happy estate God only can be known by Men, and they know themselves to be justified before him, whom experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know by Jesus Christ, is Life Eternal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that the infinite God, in his infinite Love, Good Will, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Patience, Forbearance, Long-Suffering, fully expressed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

            <p>T.V.

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Where doth the Scriptures use these Expressions, or this distinction of an Electing Love, and Complacing Love in God? Is there any Love in God that is not well pleasing unto himself? or that is not of his Good Will, or Benevolence, which is confest to be saving? Or if this Love of Complacency (so termed) was the Effect of Christs Satisfaction, and not the other, then was it not in Being in God before? But if you say his Love of Benevolence (so called) or Good Will; was only intended for a few, or a certain select num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for them only he received Satisfaction, or was Pacified, doth not your Doctrine herein render him partial and unequal in his wayes? whereas he willeth not the Death of sinners, but rather their Return, that they may Live; and God's Love, Good Will, Patience, Long-suffering, Forbearance, and Goodness is towards all, in the first place, till men reject it, and is manifest in Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankind, and evidently testified both in his Sufferings, Dying for all men, and giving himself a Ransom for all, to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of in due time, and that by his Righteousness the free Gift of God came upon all men; It's not said in Scripture, that God's Love of Benevolence was to the Elect only, or that Christ died for a few only, or was given a Ransom for Believers only, but for All, though All do not accept of the Good Will of God towards them, nor of the Offering or Price which would purchase them to God, out of their sins, and thraldom.</p>

            <p>And if Grace and Justice be very well consistent, as is confess'd from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. I ask how this consists with your sence of Vindictive Justice else where? And the Lord saith, <hi>I am a just God, and a Saviour, there is none beside me,</hi> Isa. 45.21. So he that is a just God, is a Saviour, and in this was manifest the Love of God towards us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the World that we might Live through him, herein is Love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a Propitiation for our sins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10. Now we knowing the Life and Power of Christ, and having partaken both of the saving Vertue, and blessed Effects of his Sufferings in the fellowship thereof in Spirit, as also of the benefit of his Mediation and Intercession; we must needs Confess him in all, and the Love and Graciousness of God through all.</p>

Soul can see without an Organ: And who is it that God cannot satisfie? Is it himself? Can he not satisfie or please himself? Is he ever divided or displeased with himself?

            <p>And as to his telling, <hi>That the Soul cannot see without an Organ</hi>: in one sense that's not true, though he meant outwardly, yet it hath a spiritual sight.</p>
            <p>As to his saying, <hi>That God cannot suffer,</hi> is in one sense not true, though he intended as to Death, yet the Spirit of God hath suffered, and hath been grieved by man's Transgressions: The Rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> grieved and vexed his Holy Spirit, until he became their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and fought against them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.10.</p>
            <p>And did not the Lord say, <hi>Behold, I am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves,</hi> Amos 2.13. So did not he suffer in being pressed by them then, and did not he say, <hi>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy</hi> Ephraim, <hi>for I am God, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee,</hi> Hos. 11.8, 9. Did not herein his Suffering and Forbearance declare him to be God, the Holy One, and not man, rather then the Execution of the fierceness of his Anger? And was not God's being grieved by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>Jews</hi> a Suffering, when they hardened their hearts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him in the Wilderness; for he said, <hi>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation,</hi> Psal. 95. therefore <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart:</hi> And did not God suffer long by the old World before he destroyed them, seeing when he saw their wickedness, <hi>it grieved him at his heart,</hi> Gen. 6.6. Also he said, <hi>His Spirit should not alwayes strive with them,</hi> vers. 3. So that his Spirit did suffer, and was grieved by them before they were destroyed. Again, How oft did they provoke him, and grieve him in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart? <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.40. And did not he Complain against the People
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58882:43"/>
when they were Rebellious and Polluted, saying, <hi>Your new Moons and your appointed Feasts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them:</hi> Was not this trouble, and being weary with them, matter of Suffering? and was not this his Suffering for some time before he did ease himself of his Adversaries, and avenge him of his Enemies: See <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. And also it's said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Hear ye now ye House of</hi> David, <hi>is it a small thing to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.24, 25. <hi>Neither hast thou filled me with the Fat of thy Sacrifices, but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities; I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own sake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy sins.</hi> (Mark) <hi>for my own sake</hi>; So then surely God could satisfie himself, seeing it was for his own sake that he blotted out Transgressions; and here the infinite Value, Ransom, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction was in himself, and what Patience, Forbearance, Long-Suffering, and Forgiveness, as was signified by Christ (and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of by his outward Suffering and Death) was really in being in God before, and in the fullness of time a signal testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of given to man <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>T.V. <hi>Who do ascribe more Grace and Mercy to God than we, who do apprehend it in his Son,</hi> pag. 65.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Indeed your apprehensions in that matter, are sufficiently manifest before; had <hi>T.V.</hi> added, Who do apprehend more Grace and Mercy in God, then we that say he cannot Satisfie himself, and Christ as man, could not satisfie him by finite Suffering; and the Grace we ascribe, we apprehend it, only to extend to a few, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect number, &amp;c. Had <hi>T.V.</hi> spoke this plainly together, People might the more easily have judged, whether he has truly ascribed or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended concerning the Grace of God, and whether many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands do not ascribe more Grace and Mercy to God, that own it in the free and general Extent of it to all men, than he hath done.</p>
            <p>Again his confessing, <hi>That God doth execute his Justice freely, as he doth love his Image in his People freely, yet both are necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Natural, and neither forced nor compelled by any External A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> So, here's a better Confession then much of his Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it contradict much of it: For, 1st. If his Love be as free
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58882:44"/>
as his Justice, and neither compelled, neither fotced by any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agent, how then is he obliged to take vengeance upon all that have transgressed, when upon Repentance he readily pardoneth and passeth by former offences; and how then is it impossible for God freely to Pardon. 2dly. What is that Image in his People he loves freely, is it perfect or imperfect? if perfect, then how do they deny the perfection of any thing within, or that's inherent in the Believers; and if he loves his Image in his People freely, then he is satisfied in his own Image, and that which brings to know and injoy this Image, and the renewing of it within, is that which brings into Love and Union with God, which is his Divine Spirit and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that renews man into the Heavenly Image and Righteousness of the Everlasting God, which they that injoy, have the acceptable Sacrifice, and from thence can present Living Sacrifices unto God, to his Eternal Praise.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>T. V</hi>'s saying, <hi>That if Christ were not punished for us to satisfie God's Justice, it would follow from</hi> W. P<hi>'s words, that Christ should be a sinner, and that he was punished for his own sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That's a blasphemous Consequence indeed, but not truly charged upon <hi>W. P.</hi> for he never intended by his words to render Christ a sinner, nor that he was punished for his own sins, for he never sinned, but he was Punished and Suffered by sinners, who by wicked hands (and so by their injustice) put him to Death, and under the buden and weight of their Transgressions he Suffered, as also his tender Spirit that made Intercession, and suffered for Transgressors, from a fore-sight of the Wrath that should come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rebellious; and was not the Wicked the Instruments that wounded, bruised, and afflicted him, and that oppressed his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Soul? And did not his Innocent Life, and Righteous Soul, suffer under a great oppression and weight of man's Transgression, when he was in his Agony, and sweat drops of Blood, before his being Crucified? And so was not his Suffering two-fold, both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Outward? And then if so, that the pure Life and holy Spirit suffered, as bearing the burthen of their sins, and if the God-Head being in Christ so nearly united, as to bear up the Manhood under the Suffering (as is confessed) How then can it be deemed that God inflicted the punishment of Eternal Wrath or Vengeance on his Son? Surely his permitting wicked men, by their wicked hands,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58882:44"/>
to punish him with a Temporal Suffering and Death, could not be his Eternal Wrath or Vengeance, which is supposed to Answer and Satisfie Divine Justice for man, and so to acquit man Living and Dying in sin (a great Error) from Eternal Wrath; whereas Christ Jesus was the Son of his Love; were it not inconsistent to say, That God's Justice did punish or execute Wrath upon his Love? Seeing that it's confest, <hi>That Grace and Justice are very well consistent, and that there is a free Exercise both of Justice and Love, without force or compulsion:</hi> How does <hi>T.V.</hi> his matter hang together! let the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, judge. But had he stated it in the Language and sense of the Scriptures of Truth, there had not appeared this Contrariety nor Opposition, either between us, or with himself: For Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>counts concerning Christ and his Sufferings (for sinners) both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, I do own, and Confess to, and have a reverend Esteem of all his Sufferings, and the worth thereof; and do greatly prize his Meekness and Humility, who hath freely condescended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Good Will and Pleasure of God (not from Wrath nor Compulsion) to offer himself a Lamb without spot to God, to bear our griefs and sorrows; <hi>yet</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, chap.</hi> 53) <hi>we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted; but he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed; he was oppressed, he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth, he was brought as a Lamb to the slaughter; he made his Grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had not done no violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any deceipt in his mouth; yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him,</hi>

And he saith, <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwayes wroth, for the Spirits should fail before me, and the Souls that I have made,</hi>

               <p>Touching the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Priests (and Professors) Doctrine of the Justification of the Ungodly, by an imputed Righteousness; and <hi>T. V.</hi> his Plea, and Proofs for it, Examined.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FIrst, he brings 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. for his Proof, <hi>viz. He hath made him to be sin for us, that knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him</hi>; (to which he adds) <hi>as Christ was made sin for us, though Innocent, by the imputation of our sin to him, for which he was condemned and punished; so we are made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him, though guilty, by the imputation of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto us, whereby we are Justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here <hi>T.V.</hi> has given us their sense of Imputation, <hi>viz.</hi> That Guilty Persons are made the Righteousness of God in Christ, and so Justified, whilst in their sins, by the Imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; as much as to say, when they are really unrighteous and actively sinners, yet imputedly Justified, and made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in Christ, which is a false and corrupt meaning put upon the Apostles words; for there's no Unrighteousness, no Guilt, nor Impurity in Christ, for in him is no sin, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>It was Christ's Persecutors that charged, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Sin, Guilt, and Blasphemy to him; and so such they are that impute Righteousness to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or sinful Persons.</hi>
               </note>and he that abides in him sins not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as Christ was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58882:47"/>
made a Curse, or Sin for us; the Scripture doth not say <hi>So</hi> we are made the Righteousness of God in him: For if these words, <hi>As he, So we,</hi> which are added, were true, the Consequence would be <hi>As he</hi> was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin, nor ever could sin, <hi>So we</hi> are made the Righteousness of God in him, who never knew Righteousness, nor ever can be Righteous: What a gross corruption and perverting of Scripture is this, and how contrary to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, to suppose guilty, and sinful Persons to be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, whilst such; as if God's Righteousness, or Workmanship, were impure: This Doctrine has led many in the way to Hell and Destruction; But <hi>T.V.</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. should have read <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature; old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> Which is a real change in that man that is in Christ, from sin and transgression, and not a Justification therein; for the Spirit of God both discovers to man his sin, and reproves him as a transgressor, and one Guilty whilst therein; and surely God does not accept of men, as his own Righteousness, and in Christ, whilst his Spirit in them judges them to be both unrighteous and out of Christ; for if he did, that were to make God contradict himself, and to speak quite contrary to his own Spirit, which were very absurd, and blasphemous to assert: But had <hi>T.V.</hi> rightly minded and understood that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might have seen how contrary it is to his Doctrine before, and himself therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: For, 1st. They that are in Christ Jesus, walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; and its to such only to whom there is no Condemnation, therefore Justification; and this is not a sinful, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or guilty state. 2dly. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made such free from the Law of Sin and Death. 3dly. God sending his Son to condemn sin in the Flesh, was not to look upon man Justified in the sinful state, or whilst he walks after the Flesh. But, 4thly. That the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in such who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; and this doth absolutely confute <hi>T.V.</hi> and his Brethren. And whereas for the proof of his Doctrine of Guilty Persons being the Righteousness of God, he citeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. where it is said, <hi>David</hi> described the blessedness of that man to whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works; to which I say, not without the Works of the True and Living Faith in Jesus, nor yet without a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58882:47"/>
subjection to the Law of Faith, but without that, the Works or Deeds of the Law of Works, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. the Apostle did not exclude the Works, Obedience, or Righteousness of the true Faith, from a justified state; for if <hi>Paul</hi> had so done, it had been contrary to <hi>James</hi> his Testimony, who said, <hi>Was not our Father</hi> Abraham <hi>justified by Works, when he had offered up</hi> Isaac? See <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteousness</hi>; We say, That Faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 9. which Faith was not without its own Works, although it be not the Works of the Law, as Circumcision, and others, that were Types or Signs, wherein the Righteousness of Faith doth not consist, which they that are in the uncircumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as the Gentiles that were the ungodly, spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.29.) do receive through Faith in Christ, and become really partakers thereof, being Justified from all those things from which they could not be Justified by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And so such are Justified or made Just, or truly so Accepted of God, not in sin, or ungodliness, but as Redeemed out of it, and Sanctified from it. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin</hi>; This is no Proof for <hi>T. V.</hi> his sinful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for them whom the Lord doth bless, and imputeth not Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to, are in the way of God, and partakes of his Righteousness through Faith, &amp; cannot feed upon an imagined Imputation or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in sin; for in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>David</hi> describeth the blessedness of such in these words, <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no guile:</hi> These words (<hi>in whose Spirit there is no guile</hi>) the Priests use to leave out in their talk of Imputation, but as their Faith without Works (or a real Obedience on the Creatures part) is but a dead, empty, and feigned Faith: So their laying a claim to, and pretending a Justification by the imputed Righteousness of Christ, whilst they are sinners, and polluted, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Imperfection whilst here, 'tis but a false imagination of their own; for, though we confess that Justification is in the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, by Faith in him, and that this True and Living Faith, and the Righteousness of it, is reckoned to the true Believer; yet we do not therefore grant that Sinners, or Polluted Persons in that state, are cloathed with this Righteousness, nor that 'tis imputed to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58882:48"/>
them as theirs, whilst they are out of it; for they that have put on Christ, are translated from sin and unrighteousness, and so are made partakers of the Righteousness of Faith, which <hi>T.V.</hi> saith is without us, and so puts it a far off, and yet cites <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. which plainly Contradicts his Doctrine; for <hi>Paul</hi> having confessed Christ Jesus to be his Lord, and suffered the loss of all things, that he might win Christ, it was that he might be found <hi>in him,</hi> not having his own Righteousness, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith, that (said he) I may know him, and the Power of his Resurrection, and the Fellowship of his Suffering, being made conformable to his Death, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. (Mark) his winning Christ, being found in him, his not having his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but that of Faith extends to a real injoyment of Christ, and his being in him, and not to an imagined Imputation in sin, but to his knowing Christ, and the Power of his Resurrection, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his Suffering, and Conformity to his Death; this was a blessed estate, which all you that plead for Sin, and Imperfection, and a Justification, whilst you are out of Christ, or strangers to him, being both unacquainted with his Power and Fellowship of Suffering, and never came ye so to be conformable to his Death, you being yet alive in your sins.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>T. V.</hi> his Argument, or Syllogism, it proves nothing of his Doctrine <hi>of impure or guilty Persons being Justified by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for Justification by Faith in Jesus Christ, and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we never denied; but this Faith is not a dead Faith, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its own Works, for it purifieth the heart, but so does not your Faith, who plead for sin, by which you apply Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whilst you are out of it, and it <hi>without you,</hi> as <hi>T.V.</hi> confesseth <hi>pag.</hi> 17. How hath he, and the rest of you that own this his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, soothed and daubed People up in their sins, flattering them with a Pretence of Imputation and Justification therein, when your Faith is but dead, and empty, as a body without a Spirit is dead.</p>
            <p>That <hi>we are Justified by Faith, without Works</hi>; By what Faith, and without what Works, is mentioned and manifest according to Scripture, both in that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as also in that to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> that they were the Works of the Law (and not the Works of Faith)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58882:48"/>
without which they were Justified. And as of his telling of the <hi>Deficiency of Righteousness inherent</hi>; I say, that Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness within, is not Deficient, who works both perfect Sanctification and Righteousness in true Believers; and what is the end of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Righteousness without (as <hi>T.V.</hi> saith) if they must not really injoy Christ's Righteousness within? And where do the Scripture say, That they may seek for Christ's Righteousness Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without themselves? How proves he this by Scripture, &amp;c. his saying they can be Justified only by Faith, whilst he excludes (its Works) it's contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. Faith if it hath not Works is dead being alone, and ye see how that by Works man is Justified, and not by Faith only, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.24.</p>
            <p>T. V. <hi>Which Faith he putteth in opposition to all Works, not only of the Ceremonial and Moral Law, but also to all Works wrought in Faith, which are works still, such as</hi> Abraham's <hi>Works, and</hi> David's <hi>Works were,</hi> pag. 70, 71.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Justifying Faith which is Living and Real, was never put in opposition to its own Work (by either Christ, his Apostles, or Ministers) nor to all or any Works wrought in it self, by any, but Antichrist, and his Ministers, such as <hi>T. V.</hi> and his Brethren have manifestly shewn themselves to be, in this and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. For the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was so far from putting Faith in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to all Works wrought in it, that he saith, <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith, God forbid; yea, we Establish the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.31. And if while we seek to be Justified by Christ, we our selves also are found sinners; is therefore Christ the Minister of sin, God forbid, and I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I may live unto God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17. Now this Living unto God, being Crucified with Christ, was by the Faith of the Son of God, which Living unto God, was in the Righteousness of Faith, and not in sin, for Christ is not the Minister of sin; so that he doth not set Faith in opposition to its own Works, as most falsly is affirmed; but to those Works, whether of the Law, or other self-Works, or Righteousness, that were out of the True Faith, which purifies the heart, gives Victory, Sanctifies, and Justifies; and the Saints knew the puting off the body of the sins of the Flesh by the Circumcision of Christ (so that they did not carry a body of sin all their time about with them) and a being buried with him in Baptism, wherein also they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58882:49"/>
they are risen with him through the Faith of the operation of God, who haith Raised him up from the dead, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. And that God would fulfil the Work of Faith with Power, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.11. This <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for; so he did not set Faith in opposition to its own Work; As also <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. how amply is the true Faith (without which it's impossible to please God) demonstrated by the many Works, and blessed Effects of it, which did attend it in God's People, in their acceptable obedience and subjection to him, both in Doing and Suffering, concerning which, both <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Joseph, Moses,</hi> and many others, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced for their faithful obedience and subjection.</p>
            <p>As also the Apostle <hi>James, chap.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. plainly Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth <hi>T.V.</hi> his putting Faith in opposition to its own Works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might as well have put it in opposition to it self: Who farther adds, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 5. touching God's Justifying the ungodly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T.V.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>no Persons, being the subjects of the Gospel Justification, but as ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Herein again he has wrested Scripture; for the Apostle doth not say, he Justifies them <hi>AS</hi> ungodly, but <hi>he that believeth on him that Justifieth the ungodly</hi> (it's not <hi>as</hi> ungodly) which were the believing Gentiles that were so ungodly (there intended) before they came into the Work of Faith, and to partake of its Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness within, for they were not Justified in ungodliness, but from it; <hi>Justifieth</hi> is not <hi>Justified</hi>; the one being the Work <hi>a doing,</hi> the other <hi>done</hi>; which where it is so Effected by Faith, that purifieth the heart, therein the real Subjects of Gospel Justification are manifest, not <hi>as</hi> ungodly, but <hi>as</hi> Righteous, being Washed, Sanctified, and Justified by the Spirit of our God, and that in the Name and Power of the Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>T.V.</hi> hath Confessed, <hi>That God doth not leave them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; where he removeth the guilt of sin, he removeth also the filth of sin; Justification and Sanctification being inseparable companions, and that Justification is never without Sanctification,</hi> pag. 70.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It's well he has somewhat inclined to Confess to Truth, though to the manifest break-neck and overthrow of his own Cause; For now, What's become of his Justification of the ungodly, of the Guilty <hi>as</hi> ungodly, &amp;c. by the imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ? (as his words are) And when was that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58882:49"/>
or wrought? Now, not till Sanctification be known, that the filth of sin is removed; Justification and Sanctification being inseparable companions, and the one never without the other. And surely people are not the subjects of Sanctification, or Sanctified, <hi>as</hi> ungodly, or <hi>as</hi> in the filth or pollution of sin; let the Readers but mark here how flatly this <hi>T. Vincent</hi> hath overthrown and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself, and his corrupt Doctrine; for an Imputation of Righteousness to the Unrighteous, and a Justification in Sin and Transgression, <hi>as</hi> ungodly, &amp;c. whereas he that Justifieth the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he that Condemneth the Just, they both are abomination unto God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. And of this our Adversary is greatly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Tho. Danson</hi>'s <hi>Synopsis,</hi> which he so highly commends, as that <hi>the use of it may be great, for the Establishing of Christians in the Truths, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this he does but shew his own shallowness and weakness, to Commend thus highly of such a silly confussed piece (which hath also many Lyes and Falshoods in it) as that sorry Pamphlet of <hi>T.D</hi>'s, as it will further be manifest; and how apparently both <hi>T. V.</hi> and <hi>T.D.</hi> have Contradicted themselves, and each other, even in their principal Points.</p>
            <p>And as for his putting off <hi>S. E.</hi> his Challenge to <hi>Fast and Watch,</hi> as <hi>a Tempting of God, and a God provoking sin, to endanger self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And judges him, <hi>as being Mad, and numbred amongst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this is as smooth a put off, and excuse, as he could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have imagined, to excuse himself from Fasting, &amp;c. so that his Accusing <hi>S.E.</hi> as being Mad, Distracted, &amp;c. does neither prove him to be so, nor does it destroy either <hi>S.E.</hi> his Confidence or Motion in the matter, but sets it the more over <hi>T. V.</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns heads, who are afraid their God should fail them, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this Engagement; especially whilst <hi>T.V.</hi> Confesseth, That <hi>the Scripture Instances of Fasting many dayes together were Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:</hi> And surely, whether <hi>S. E.</hi> had not Power, or a particular Motion (not Imitation) to have Answered his own Proposition in that case, of Fasting (if he had been tryed) <hi>T.V.</hi> does not know, because he durst not put it to the tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58882:50"/>And as for <hi>T.

Or his severe Judging, harsh Censuring of us, to be taken as for one in Christ's stead and Judgement Seat, whom partly he presumes herein to personate, as he saith, <hi>If our Saviour were on Earth, he would stile us as he did the Pharisees</hi>; but in this he has presumed in Christ's Name, and in his Name uttered his own slanders against the Innocent, for which a day of accompt will come, which will be heavy upon him, and such false Accusers, if they do not Repent; and if his eyes were open, he might see himself guilty of the same things, whereof he hath accused and judged others: Who in the end of his Book repeates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain what he did before Assert, <hi>That it were better for you to drink a Cup of Poyson, than to suck-in the</hi> Quakers <hi>damnable Opinions, &amp;c.</hi> If People will be such silly Women, as to be affrighted with <hi>T.

            <head>An Answer to <hi>Thomas Danson's Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of Quakerism,</hi> as he falsly and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilously calls it.</head>
            <p>BEfore I come to treat about the many particulars mentioned in <hi>Tho. Danson</hi>'s Pamphlet that relate to matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I may not omit some passages of his to the Reader as to matter of Fact wherein he shews his prejudice and peevish spirit against the Innocent People of God, called Quakers.</p>
            <p>As first, and chiefly, where he accuseth <hi>W. P.</hi> of <hi>attempting to shake the Rock Christ Jesus in his God-head and Offices,</hi> which is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute falshood and slander, as hath been proved over and over; the Divinity of Christ being still owned by <hi>W.P.</hi> so that what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from such a one as begins his work with a palpable Lye, as <hi>T.D.</hi> hath done, and all to render the Quakers as odious as he can; he adding, <hi>how well he</hi> (W. P.) <hi>hath immitated the Leaders of his Party in their respects to other like truths, that so the Christians of these Parts may no longer be imposed upon by the Quakers seeming innocence.</hi> Hereby he hath added to his falshood and slander before, and struck at the Innocency of the Quakers, which he scornfully and falsly counts but seeming; as also the Leaders of his Party (as he calls them) never denied the Divinity of Christ, nor ever held any Principles tending thereto since they were raised up to be a People, and to preach the Name of Christ: and if so be that Innocency be not really found among the Quakers, why are they so hated, persecuted, and brought under Sufferings and Reproaches by such as be in the Woolfish nature tending, and tearing whilst no real oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion hath been given them by Quakers? who have patiently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered both under the ridged spirit of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and since; and as to their Principles. <hi>T. D.</hi> is no competent judge over them, whilst he hath perverted them, both in the former Powers days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now also; and whilst in those days he did indeavour to insinuate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58882:52"/>
into the Powers that then were, against the Quakers, he was plainly manifested, and his Errors and Falshoods detected by those faithfull Servants of Christ <hi>Samuel Fisher, Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> (and my self) he might now have been silent from raking over his old silly confused stuff, so long since answered and confuted, since that from the ample Confutation, and just reproof and discovery given against him by <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi> he could never yet clear himself, nor hath essayed a Replication thereto, but only a slight put off, as will appear, without either Truth or Reason: and as for his commendation <hi>of the pains of his worthy Friend Master Thomas Vincent,</hi> as he calls him, he has little ground to applaud his pains; for he has sufficiently manifested his envy, errors, confusion and shallowness, as any unbyassed may see; as also the palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions both to himself and <hi>T. D.</hi> so that they should first have studied to see a reconciliation and harmony between their own Principles before they had come thus publickly to engage; but it is the Judgement of God upon them, and such giddied spirits, that one should oppose and contradict another, till they are both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and broke to pieces in their war; but if his worthy Friend <hi>Thomas Vincent</hi> hath done so worthily against the Quakers, why doth <hi>T. D.</hi> take so much pains again after him? why doth he <hi>actum agere,</hi> as he saith? his Answer is, <hi>because of some reflections upon him, also that as experience hath shewed there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of intellectual gifts, and that the Method, Phrase, and Notions of scarce any one man are acceptable to all</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he saith; by which it appears that he was conscious, or at least jealous that his worthy <hi>Master Vincent</hi>'s work would not be so acceptable as his own, but would give distaste; and therefore he has endeavoured to smooth it over, and to new moddel it in another phrase, according to what he has imagined and learned out of Writers and old Authors, both Popish and others; but what saith he for not answering <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s Book against himself, <hi>Jo. Owen, Baxter</hi> and <hi>Tombs,</hi> Entituled <hi>Rusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ad Academicos</hi> (which they were never able to answer, nor to reply to) <hi>T. D.</hi> excuseth himself as followeth, <hi>viz. If any Quaker shall demand why I do not answer.</hi> Samuel Fisher<hi>'s Book against me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of writing against a new man? I answer, that I am guided in my neglect by the judgment of abler Persons then my self, that that Book is but a Bundle of impertinent cavils, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58882:52"/>Indeed this is a very easie way of answering, which, if we should deal so with <hi>T. D.</hi> what would he say to it, and to such neglect? but this doth not clear himself from <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s Answer, but it stands over his head; and if he was guided by abler persons then himself in not answering <hi>S. F.</hi> those abler persons for ought as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears might see <hi>T. D.</hi> so baffled and confuted, that it was in vain for him to strive any further; and if abler persons then himself did advice him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that case he should have followed the example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so as not to have meddled, as he hath done, to the further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting his weakness and folly; and as for his instance of <hi>Biddles twelve Articles against the Holy Ghost's Diety,</hi> tis no president nor instance for us, as is most falsly insinuated against us, whilst we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied the Diety or Divinity of either, Father, Word, or Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And how doth he advise the Reader <hi>to be at pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the positive grounds of the great Truths opposed by the Quakers,</hi> as he falsly saith; what must give the understanding thereof, if not the Light of Christ within? and how must sacred mysteries be known? and what must bring to the right use of reason, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures, if immediate Revelation or Inspiration be supposed not attainable in these days? Can the natural man with his natural understanding know the things that are spiritual, (surely no) or know the right use of the Scriptures without the guidance of that infallible Spirit that gave them forth? no sure; for it is the Inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding. And Seeing also that <hi>T.D.</hi> confesseth, that <hi>Reason tells us the Nature and Works of God are above our reach, and that God were not Gof if he could be comprehended by a Creature</hi>; which, if so that the Nature and Works of God are above his and their reach and comprehension, why has he essayed so much by his natural understanding to define and distinguish the Godhead <hi>into three distinct Persons,</hi> which he has no Scripture for, nor yet Reason to demonstrate, nor Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ground a Faith upon in that case, whilst the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were wont to affirm Revelation to be ceased? and to be sure God will not put the Seal of his immediate power to a falshood, as is confessed, so that whilst we have neither Revelation, Scriptures, Reason nor Seal of immediate Power for their Doctrines and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions put upon the <hi>Diety,</hi> we have ground at least to question them, if not positively to oppose them as unscriptural, irrational,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58882:53"/>
implicite Doctrines and Traditions, which hath tended to vail both the glory of God, Christ, and holy Spirit (which we confess) from people.</p>
            <p>And now to <hi>T. D</hi>'s definition of the word <hi>Person</hi>; first, from <hi>Aquinas as being an individual substance of a rational nature</hi>; but his worthy Friend <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi> hath denied the Father, the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Spirit to be three Substances; then I ask how they can be three distinct Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilst a Person is an individual Substance? what contradiction is this! But then <hi>T. D.</hi> saith, <hi>Some think it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (viz. Aquinas his Explanation of Person</hi>) liable to some exception, and therefore he chuseth to borrow that of learned <hi>Wotton</hi> on 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2. pag. 2. that <hi>a Person is an individual Subsistance or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, rather in an intellectual nature, or a several or singular thing that subsists by it self, &amp;c. A Man we call a Person; a Person notes some one endued with Reason and understanding; which is several and distinct from another; a Person is intire of it self, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Concerning which I query first, whether the Father, the Word, and holy Spirit be three several and singular things, that subsist each by himself, each one from another yea or nay?</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether a man being a Person is a competent instance for proof of his Maker being three several Persons? and whether a man subsists by himself?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether Christ be several and distinct by himself from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the holy Spirit several and distinct from both? If yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where, or in what place of the whole world (or out of it) is the one entire and severed from the other? and how far distant one from another?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, And if the Father Son and Holy Ghost, do not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in a several and distinct nature of the same kind (so as they are not three Gods) as is confessed pag. 3. how are they three distinct or separate persons, subsisting each by himself?</p>
            <p>These things being considered by the impartial Readers, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Doctrine and Comparison, touching the Deity, will easily appear.</p>
            <p>And what was this <hi>Aquinas</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoted as <hi>T. D</hi>'s Author, so much cited and commented by him, as a <hi>wise Observant,</hi> pag. 19? Was not he a great Writer for the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and the Pope's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation; and so a promoter of Popery in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58882:53"/>
time, and canonized <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Saint among them? see his large Volums, his <hi>Sums,</hi> and others; he is highly applauded by the Papists, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>an industrious Promoter of their Faith and Religion</hi>: and was he not a Dominican Fryer? To whom it appears that <hi>T. D.</hi> is very much beholding for his Doctrine, [of three distinct (or sever'd) Persons in the Godhead] more then he is to Scripture; for that is silent concerning it; but I have of late Read it in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his <hi>Sums,</hi> who is <hi>Tho. Danson</hi>'s <hi>wise Observant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further (mark) that after <hi>T. D.</hi> has confessed, <hi>that the word Person cannot be properly attributed to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that the Names common to God and the Creatures do signifie som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein the Creatures bears some anology to God, and three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not strictly, yet anologically in the Godhead,</hi> pag. 3, 4. Where proves he this by Scripture? and wherein doth man bear a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or likeness in his Person with his Maker? this is strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, importing that the Diety hath the resemblance or likeness of persons, but not properly; which, if improperly, why do they stand so much upon their improper distinctions in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet,</hi> saith <hi>T. D. may this word Person be used by us to distinguish the Father, Son and Spirit in the Godhead, and one from another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> So it appears he pleads for a liberty to put improper names upon God from his pretence of anology; the Scripture he mentions <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. makes against him, it being, <hi>the express Image of his Substance,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but as it is in some English Copies, <hi>express Image of his Person</hi>; however, it is not <hi>the express Person of his Person,</hi> much less <hi>the express singular Person, or rational Substance, subsisting by it self, distinct from the Father</hi>; For I and my Father are one, said Christ, and the Son doth nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; and the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father; and if so be <hi>that the Soul separated from the Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called a Person,</hi> as T. D. saith, pag. 2, 3. how can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to call the Spirit, which is the Life or Breath of God <hi>a Person distinct from God,</hi> whilst God is never distinct and separate from his own Life? But then it appears that T. D. is necessitated to call the Glorious Divine three in Heaven somthing; and therefore he saith, <hi>that distinction in the Godhead cannot be apprehended by us by any other notion or resemblance, (then Person)</hi> and saith he, <hi>we know not what to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58882:54"/>
call these three, but Persons,</hi> pag. 4. <hi>For the conception or notion that we have of the Father (suppose) as a Subsistent or Person is,</hi> in adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus conceptus <hi>in respect of the Divine Essence, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> But by what doth he and his Brethren apprehend this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, surely, neither by the Scripture not by immediate Revelation or Inspiration, nor yet by reason for that has failed them in this matter; as also the nature and works of God is above their reach and the comprehension of the Creature; so that their conceptions and notions being unscriptural, we have no ground to believe them, whilst we have but their conceptions, words and notions for what they say derived from Popish and Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and not from any immediate Power, Revelation or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and his saying, <hi>they do not know what to call these three, but Persons</hi>; shews, they were hard put to it, as being necessitated to call them something: but, what are they ignorant of the Scripture? or would not the Scripture satisfie them, and yet profess it their Rule? they had better search the Scriptures instead of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and see what they are called there; viz. <hi>The Father, the Word, and Holy Ghost, which are One</hi>; besides these three bearing record in Heaven, T. D. hath elsewhere called them <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> pag. 5, 7, and 10. and thus he contradicts himself; one while he knows not what to call them, but Persons, and another while calls them three <hi>Witnesses,</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Three Witnesses.</hi>
               </note> from their bearing Record; and thus in contradiction he knows what to call them besides Persons: but then he saith, <hi>all Witnesses (properly so called) are Persons:</hi> How proves he that? Are not all things that bear record Witnesses? Are Heaven and Earth Persons? and are the Water and the Blood Persons, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they bear record in the Earth? and is Conscience in a man a Person distinct from the man, seeing Conscience beareth witness? if it be, how then, <hi>is the Soul distinct from the Body no Person,</hi> page 3, 5.</p>
            <p>T. D. upon 1 John 5.9. <hi>the Witness of God is greater referring to the Witness concerning Christ, verse</hi> 7. <hi>not to verse</hi> 8. <hi>for none of those Witnesses are God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> And yet those Witnesses verse 8. are the Spirit, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Blood; herein T. D. hath denied the Spirit to be God contrary to their former pretence; and so is come under that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58882:54"/>
they have so unjustly charged us withal; but we own the Divinity of that Spirit that bears record in the Earth, and know the Water and Blood which agree in one with it, to be therefore Spiritual, and of this water and Spirit a man must be born, or else he cannot enter the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.5. and by this Blood his Conscience must be sprinkled from dead works, who ever comes to enter the Heavenly Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>And we may further observe how dubious T. D. in his Work hath appeared from what he saith pag. 83. viz. <hi>If my Answers seem not so clear as the Objections, which I hope I need not fear, unless in the point of the Trinity, that being a Mystery; so by that it rebates the sharpest edge of humane understanding, &amp;c.</hi> By which the Reader may take notice, that he was conscious to himself, that his Answers in this case might not seem so clear as the Objections, and that he has but made use of his humane understanding (and not of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) therein, the Edge of which is so rebated, and grown so dull, that it will take very little impression upon any that are in a right mind and understanding; even none at all upon such who rely not, nor lean to their own understandings, but upon the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth; which it appears he has refused and gone from, whilst he is now fain to make use of his humane understanding, and his own notions and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are not grounded on Scripture; and therefore we may not have our Faith imposed upon by them, as to accept of his humane conceptions and notions (which cannot reach the nature of God) for divine verities.</p>
            <p>And how says T. D. <hi>That infiniteness being a property of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, agrees to each Person subsisting in that Nature</hi>; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his worthy Master <hi>Vincent</hi>'s saying, that <hi>infiniteness is not ascribed unto the Personality</hi>? but such like confusion and conrradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have enough of from them.</p>
            <p>And indeed such nonsensical stuff, as is in both their Pamphlets, I have seldom met withal; as one while T. D. saith, <hi>We do not affirm the Person in the Godhead to be finite but infinite</hi>; another while T. V. saith, <hi>infiniteness is not ascribed to them</hi>:<note place="margin">Page 14.</note> another while T. D. saith pag. 14. <hi>That they are one among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, only in respect of that wherein they agree not simply</hi>: What kind of oneness or agreement doth he reckon is in the Diety, if it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58882:55"/>
be not simply? Was there ever such darkness and confusion utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and what blind Sophistry, and silly Logick and babling do these men use, and put upon the Immortal God? whom with all their inventions, airy notions and vain conceptions they can never reach the knowledge of; neither will, nor can their Heathenish Phylosophy, tearms of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor apostate Christians and Papists demonstrate or discover the Knowledge of either Father,<note place="margin">

            <p>And his saying, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> equivolent, or apply both to Father, Son and Spirit? Is not here a manifest contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Brethren unto themselves, and their own Doctrine in this matter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58882:55"/>As for T. D. his Discourse about satisfaction, there needs not much to be said unto it, for that the matter hath been answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as also in part he assents to W. P. in what he hath said; for he T. D. doth not affirm any impossibility of forgiviness without a plenary satisfaction made, [as in the sence and notion some of them have] &amp;c.
And though he knows some worthy Persons do deny W. P's Affirmative, yet he cannot joyn with them therein: <hi>He saith also,</hi> 
               <q>God is free in his determinations what attribute he will manifest, and in what degree and manner, and that between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Justice and Mercy, and their effects, and all of his meer will interveens, &amp;c.</q>
By all which, in a great measure, he hath confest to what W. P. hath writ in that case, though in contradiction to his Brother <hi>Vincent,</hi> as is evident.</p>
            <p>But where he speakes of <hi>Vindictive Justice that God might onely have manifested, when man fell, as he does upon the reprobate Angels or Devils, &amp;c.</hi> Now I query then, Is this Vindictive Justice, that which Christ under-went at God's hand, (and satisfied according to their Doctrine?) if they say it is; where do the Scriptures say so? or that God inflicted the same revengefull justice (as I think they mean) upon Christ, that he doth upon the reprobate Angels or Devils, and then make this the means and manner of full satisfaction for mankind? let us have plain Scripture for this Doctrine; was God's Love to man purchased by such revenge upon his innocent Son as he lays upon reprobate Angels or Devils? or is it not rather blasphemous to suppose that Christ could ever be so far out of Gods favour, as to construe his Sufferings to the height of revenge as goes against reprobate Angels and Devils? and doth not this also accord with T. V. his Doctrine? whereas Chrit was the beloved of the Father, even his onely begotten, the Son of his Love, in whom his Soul delighted, and was always well pleased, both in his works and Sufferings, both in his life and death for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but angry with the wicked, such as persecuted him and crucified him afresh unto themselves, as he was also crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Spiritual <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>; such Adversaries God will be avenged of: but his pleasure shall prosper in the hand of his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seed Christ; but these things T. D. his weak judgement (as he confesseth it to be, pag. 18.) cannot reach. And indeed in much of his Discourse about this matter, he has talked more like a Lawyer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58882:56"/>
then a Divine; and has brought several similitudes which will not hold in matters of such high concernment: But I shall not need much to take notice of his dark kind of reasoning in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which proceeds but from his weak judgemnt and private conceptions, since the matter is answered elsewhere, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his and their Principles therein is further manifest, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about his (and their) Doctrine of Imputed Righteousness, and his Arguments for Sin and Imperfection in all, tearm of life: yet a little to some particulars I may observe by the way (of this point) after he saith, <hi>he shall give us his sence, confessing that Satisfaction is not a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase,</hi> pag. 19. However, we will chuse Scripture phrase rather then T. D's weak judgment and conceptions therein; having plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Scripture Phrases for <hi>pardon, forgiveness, remissions,</hi> (upon a true Repentance.) And I query what Scripture he hath for his expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Satisfaction; viz. <hi>a compensation made to God for our sin by Christ doing or suffering, or both, Justice that is Vindictive?</hi> p. 19. What Scripture hath he for these words and this Doctrine? Is not this a confirmation to what is queried before concerning this he calls <hi>Vindictive Justice?</hi> the same that God punisheth the reprobate Angels or Devils with, the same he reckons Christ to have suffered; and so hath numbred Christ among reprobate Angels and Devils; but yet another while Christ's being under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. T. D. construes, <hi>as not lying barely in the smart of sence, but in the brand of infamy thereby set upon us,</hi> pag. 20. But then how was it the same revenge or punishment that reprobate Angels and Devils un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, and Sinners deserved, which surely is more then the brand of infamy? is not here manifest contradiction? and did the brand of infamy proceed as revengefull Justice from God, or rather from the envy and injustice of the wicked against him.</p>
            <p>Again, he was not ashamed to call us Brethren, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.11. that is (saith T. D.) <hi>Fellow Subjects, for being one in nature with us, he becomes one with us in an obligation to the same Law</hi>; to which I say, if we are fellow Subjects, and one in nature with Christ, and he one with us in obligation, &amp;c. and that the brand of infamy he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent be set upon us; then it is to be minded, first that such as be Christ's Brethren one in nature, and fellow Subjects with him are Sanctified, and not remaining in a polluted nature, nor yet in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imperfect state all their life time; seeing both he that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58882:56"/>
and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Fellow Subjects with Christ that are bound with him, and partake of his Sufferings, are not rebellious, nor disobedient to him or his Law, but faithfull followers of him, by whose Power, Aid and Assistance they are incouraged in their obedience and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to him; and this is the effect both of Christ's Manfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, Obedience and Righteousness to and in every one that believes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Christ's condescension and union with his Followers, and their being Fellow-Subjects with him be the thing that Christ tenders to God for Satisfaction, as T. D. in his Answer intimates, then, if he had held to this we should not much have differed; but how this agrees with their Doctrine for the continuance of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Sin in all, (covered over with a pretence of full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made for them, which still leaves all in sin) I do not yet understand, nor doth it appear how he and his Brethren can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled herein.</p>
            <p>But whereas T. D. confesseth that <hi>Christ both by doing and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did satisfie, and that the satisfaction may be made as well Agendo as Patiendo</hi>; therein hath he contradicted many of his Brethren, who lay it upon his Suffering and Death <hi>onely</hi>; another while upon his under-going <hi>Vindictive Justice,</hi> as they call it, the same that is laid upon Devils.</p>
            <p>But then, if his Satisfaction be as well <hi>agendo</hi> as <hi>patiendo,</hi> whether or no he did do all in the dayes of his Flesh, in his own person, that was to be done for man? or whether his work is not experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be known and wrought in every man, for the destruction or ending of Sin and Trangression, before full satisfaction and peace be enjoyed with God? seeing his coming in the likeness of sinfull flesh, was to Condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled <hi>in us,</hi> that walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; and is not this Law Spiritual which we are bound to obey? for can it be supposed that all mankind (or the Nation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) were bound under the Law that was given to the <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly. And then would it be good Doctrine to say, that we, or all Nations, were Fellow-Subjects with Christ bound under the Law of the Jews, which had the Shaddows of good things to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58882:57"/>
come? or is it not more meet to say that all ought to be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law of Christ, the Law of Faith, the Law of he Spirit of Life in him, and that he was made a surety (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.22.) therein of a better Testament, which is Spiritual, and the Righteousness of the Law which he fulfils within, is also spiritual and inwardly known; its judgment, sentence and condemnation known inwardly, where sin is condemned in the Flesh; seeing that the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was ordained to Life the Apostle found to be unto death in him, as it is in all that come to Life; and is not this the effect of Christ's Coming, Obedience, Sufferings, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how can these things be experienced but by waiting in his Light and Spirit within? and if Satisfaction consists as well <hi>Agendo</hi> as <hi>Patiendo</hi>; are not Christ's inward and spiritual operations included in his doing or works for mans Salvation? how then can man exclude them, and think himself wholy acquitted (and yet in his sins) by the Suffering and Death of Christ without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a full compensation and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his stead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for whom was Christ a Propitiation, <hi>for the appeasement of wrath, relaxation of the Law, purchase of freedom from punishment,</hi> pag. 23. If it consist in his Personal Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering onely, without the knowledge of his work within? then are not all men so free and acquitted for whom he did suffer? and doth not this extend to all that were dead? for he is a propitiation for the Sins of the whole world; but this <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> deny; <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Here they deny the full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (or plenary, as they call it.)</hi>
               </note> what effect then do they put upon Christ's Sufferings; viz. that he suffered any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then for a small select number; (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Doctrine) whereas his Suffering was for all men, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (who were dead in sin) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his confirmation of that Spiritual and Living Dispensation and Testament which extends both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is to be believed and obeyed. But to <hi>T. D</hi>'s matter (for these things are out of the reach of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conceptions.)</p>
            <p>As concerning <hi>the precious Blood,</hi> which he confesseth <hi>to be the real Price that hath made a Purchase,</hi> 1 Pet. 18, 19. I ask, if the effects of that Blood are not known within, in its purging the Conscience, and cleansing from all sin, &amp;c? And seeing he confesseth it to be the <hi>Blood of God,</hi> pag. 26. What Scripture hath he then to call it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58882:57"/>
               <hi>humane?</hi> and doth the Satisfaction consist in humane Blood? how then doth it satisfie Infinite Justice? Is not humane Finite, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to T. D. and T. V. their Doctrine? But if this Blood of God, which was shed for all men, have an inward effect in the Conscience, in order to the answering of Gods will, and his pure Law within, and thereby being to his satisfaction; how can men continuing in their sins, truly plead they are fully acquitted at once without them, and they onely in the implicite belief thereof, received from the ridged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Presbyters,</hi> rest satisfied in their sins all their life time?</p>
            <p>And where doth T. D. prove his Doctrine of <hi>Christ's being holy by a true inherent righteousness of the humane Nature?</hi> pag. 25. what Scripture hath he for this, or these Expressions? was not his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness from the Divine Nature? and was it not Everlasting? but is not that which is humane Finite?</p>
            <p>And T. D. saying, that <hi>the Socinians vomit, the Quakers have now lickt up</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Here T. D. hath shot at us in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Bow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as formerly he confessed he did.</hi>
               </note> pag. 27. herein hath he spoken scornfully and falsly against us, which will not at all tend to convince <hi>Socinians,</hi> if they were as bad as rendred, but to that they can answer him.</p>
            <p>And his saying, <hi>the Elect, whilst Sinners in state</hi>: where proves he this, that the Elect are Sinners in state, seeing the state of the Elect is a sanctified and chosen state out of the World, and its wayes, chosen in Christ through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13. the impossibility of deceiving the Elect is signified <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. where the Calling and Election is made sure, they shall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p>And that Christ was made surety of a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. And came to do his Fathers Will, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.7. And that his being a Surety is an Act of Grace, pag. 28. This we confess and own more then you that contend for Sin, for the Will of God is our Sanctification, and the better Testament and Covenant which Christ is the Surety, Mediator and Establisher of, is that of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Life and Peace, wherein Sins and Transgressions are done away, and wherein true Believers live to God.</p>
            <p>And as for T. D. his so often comparing God to a Creditor, Christ to the Surety, and Sinners as the Debtors; telling <hi>of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58882:58"/>
considered as a Creditor, and as a private Person,</hi> pag. 32. But where doth the Scripture so call him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> He does not speak from a true sence of God or Christ, or of Gods Covenant, but a Notion he hath learned by Tradition; and as to Sinners, their case is worse then meerly Debtors; they not onely owing obedience to God and Christ, but are disobedient and rebellious, as the case of Fellons, Traytors and other Malefactors is worse then that of Debtors; yet Christ is our Surety, Mediator and Intercessor, to make agreement between God and man, and to deliver man from the Punishment and Wrath to come, [by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Sin, the cause of it, and destroying the Devil the Author of Sin;] not for us still to live in Sin, and daily both contract more Debt, and incur tribulation and anguish upon our Souls: Howbeit, the Wayes of God extend beyond T. D's comparison; his Wayes are not as man wayes, nor his Thoughts as mans thoughts: for as the Heaven is higher then the Earth, so are my Thoughts higher then your thoughts saith the Lord, whose graciousness also to poor deceived lost man, for his restoration, is infinitely beyond mans le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and exactions; as the Lord said, I will not execute the fierceness of mine Anger, I will not return to destroy <hi>Ephraim</hi>; for I am God and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee, <hi>Hosea</hi> 11.9.</p>
            <p>But is there not perfect obedience now for men to perform? must they all live in Sin and Imperfection tearm of life, and say all our Debts is paid? and if all their Debts be paid, why are they not out of Prison? <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>But man in the faln state is worse then meerly a Debtor; for he is a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, guilty of high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and Crimes against the pure Law of God, for which he must feel Justice in the Ministration of the Law and Sentence of death inwardly upon the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor, before he receive and enjoy the attonement, ransom and peace with God.</hi>
               </note> Are not all that are in Sin and Bondage of Corruption in Prison? and would it be glad Tydings to tell them that though Christ has paid all their Debts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their release, and ransomed them, that they must not expect personal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom out of Prison, nor out of their Chains and Fetters so long as they lived here? or if one should tell the Slaves in <hi>Turkey</hi> that they are ransomed, and yet they must not expect personal freedom from their Vassalry and Slavery so long
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58882:58"/>
as they live here, would this be glad tydings? no sure, but rather sad news; and is just like these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to people, and the tendence of their Gospel, and pretence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Redemption, Ransom, &amp;c. whilst they hold none of them in Truth nor Righteousness, nor in the same Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures of Truth, and Testimonies of Christ or his Apostles.</p>
            <p>T. D. pag. 29. <hi>He is satisfied, and the debt paid too, by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which being grounded upon his Satisfaction, supposes it to be what it pretends, full and compleat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> Here it is to be observed, that notwithstanding this his Assertion of the Satisfaction [both by payment and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] being compleatly made, and <hi>the debt fully paid</hi>; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to Christ's Intercession: but what does he ever live to make Intercession for, if all be fully done, paid, satisfied at once by Christ's personal subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Though God was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well pleased and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in Christ, in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Suffering, and as he was a Sacrifice for Sin; yet this is not enough for us to profess and believe, without knowing the Work of Christ, and Effect of his Sufferings and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness within, and his Spirit to make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8. Phil. 3.9.10.</note> must there ever be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for that which is already so fully and dearly paid for, (as they reckon Christ hath done) and God hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? how will this hold consistent? But then it appears, <hi>it supposes it to be what it pretends full and compleat,</hi> saith T. D. pag. 30. So here is now supposition and pretence put upon Christ's Intercession and Satisfaction; what sorry shallow work is this; but it appears. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one that hath followed his own conceptions, notions, weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and humane understanding; as also one that by his Logick and Traditional borrowed Notions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines goes about to make People to believe that from him, that he hath no Scripture phrase for, as that of God being a private person, and other things. And therefore like a Lawyer is fain to patch up his work as well as he can, though in many things it be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant and repugnant to it self.</p>
            <p>And whereas our confessing Christ both in Life and Suffering to be a perfect and real Example, is so much struck at by these Priests
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58882:59"/>
and Professors; (we still withal confessing both to his Power and Living Effects through all) and of all his Sufferings, Afflictions, Death and Life, which we reverently esteem; touching which I testifie, in the Lord, that if Christ be not really owned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, as he was a real Example, both in Life, Conversation, and in Patient Suffering; neither the Fellowship of his Suffering, nor the Power thereof, is truly known or experienced; for they who would partake of the Benefit and blessed Effects of Christ's Death and Sufferings, and yet will not own him for their Example, shall never enjoy him therein; seeing that Christ also hath suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we should follow his steps, who did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Again, Forasmuch then as Christ hath Suffered for us in the Flesh, arm your selves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the Flesh hath ceased from sin, that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the Flesh to the lusts of men, but to the Will of God, Chap. 4.1, 2.</p>
            <p>Now the ceasing from Sin, and following of Christ's steps in the harmless sinless state, is the right use and end of his Suffering for man, and his Example to man. But then mark T. D's Doctrine as followeth, what an example and subject of Wrath and Vindictive Justice (so tearmed) he renders Christ, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>T. D. pag. 36.4. <hi>Christ when he suffered was not innocent, and when God required satisfaction of him, it was due from him; Christ was guilty of our sin, when he suffered for it; for guilt is but</hi> obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ad paenam, <hi>an obligation to undergo punishment, which Christ was under by contract,</hi> Hebr. 7.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Its no wonder that these <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and those of their affinity accuse all Christ's Followers of being Sinners, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect all their life time, since that T. D. (one of their Leaders or Chieftains) hath accused Christ not to be innocent when he suffered; saying also, Christ was guilty of our Sin when he suffered for it, which how false and blasphemous this charge is against Christ, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all sober and moderate Professors of Christianity, who have any real esteem and reverence to the Name of Christ and his Glory, and how contrary to plain Scripture-testimonies plentifully given of him, as being a Lamb, yea, the Lamb of God, which declared his innocency and purity, being without sin or guile, who offered up
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58882:59"/>
himself by the Eternal Spirit, a Lamb without spot to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.32. Now his being a Lamb without spot, and without blemish, manifests him to be a perfect Offering, and Sacrifice for Sin; as also how guilt is more then barely an obligation to undergo punishment, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imputed to the Transgressors and disobedient for sin, and not to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.13. and 21.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7.</p>
            <p>Although tis true those chief Priests, false Witnesses, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of Christ among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and such as accused him for a Blaspemer, they said also that he was guilty of death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.65, 66. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.64. whose example <hi>T. D.</hi> hath followed in accusing Christ of being guilty, and not innocent. But if T. D. should say he meant not that Christ was really, or inherently, or personally guilty of sin, but by imputation, and so not innocent, but guilty of our sins; by this we may perceive then what he means by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; that on the one hand an innocent person is made guilty, and is not innocent whilst he hath no sin, nor guile or evil in him: and so on the other hand, by their own rule of contraries (<hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria contrariorum ratio</hi>) persons are to be reckoned imputatively righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and innocent in God's sight, whilst there is neither righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness nor innocency really in them, which is both unreasonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural, and apparently false. It was a false imputation of the persecuting <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Tho. Danson</hi> to impute guilt of sin to Christ, and to accuse him with not being innocent, when no sin, evil, nor guilt was in him; and it is as false an imputation of theirs to impute Christ's Righteousness to sinfull persons, who are not in it, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of it, in them; so its neither God's imputation nor Christ's; for had <hi>Abraham</hi> no righteousness really in him, when his Faith was reckoned to him for righteousness? where then was his Faith, and the righteousness and obedience of it, if in reallity he was not a partaker and an enjoyer thereof within? from whence did his acts or works of real obedience proceed and flow, if not from his living Faith, and its righteousness within? Surely they are of very mean capacities that cannot see T. D's absurdities ignorance in these matters; And his vain imaginations and conceits about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation further will appear, and that the stress and drift of all his and his Brethrens work in these invented Doctrines <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in their sins and imperfections all their dayes, and so their work in rendring Christ the subject of guilt, and so of vengeance that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Devils, and their rendring people the subjects of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Justification by imputation, whilst unjust and sinful in themselves; it all centers in their sinfull Doctrine for sin and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection term of life.</p>
            <p>Pag. 37. As to <hi>T. D</hi>'s telling of the Son of God's Incarnation, <hi>the creation of his Body and Soul, the parts of that nature he subsisted in, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I say, if the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both Created, doth not this render him a Fourth Person? for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in time, which contradicts their Doctrine of Three <hi>distinct Increated, Co-eternal, Co-essential Persons in the Deity</hi>; seeing that which was created was not so: but herein whether doth not his and their ignorance of the only begotten of the Father, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Christs Divinity plainly appear yea or nay? where doth the Scripture say that his Soul was created? for was not he the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Fathers Glory, and the express Image of his Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? But supposing the Soul of Christ was (with the Body) created in time; I ask, if from Eternity he was a Person distinct from God and his holy Spirit, without either Soul or Body? and where doth the Scripture speak of any Person without either Soul or Body? lets have plain Scripture.</p>
            <p>Pag. 38. Whilst T. D. grants <hi>our actual freedom from sin and wrath depends on what Christ did and suffered, as on and upon its means</hi>; what becomes of his Doctrine and Pleas for sin and imperfection which they that continues in term of life cannot be truly said to be Actually freed from sin, nor yet imputatively righteous in Gods sight, whilst actually and really sinfull: And if Christ's obedience was not intended to exempt us from a personal obedience to the Law, as is confest in pag. 38. then its contrary to the end of his Obedience to live in sin and disobedience term of life, and for any to be reckoned imputatively righteous, when actually disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And if we be only <hi>so far made righteous by Christs Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as unrighteous by our own disobedience</hi>: how far is that? have we not been actually unrighteous, and shall we so far be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by Christ's Righteousness? Is not this more then your Doctrine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58882:60"/>
of Imputation (whilst personally sinfull) amount to; but your flat contradictions in these matters are evident.</p>
            <p>Pag. 39. And though Christ is our Surety, this doth not exempt us either from following him, or walking in the Way of God; but the more ingage us therein; and herein we know acceptance in the Beloved of God, in that holy conversation which his pure Law within enjoyns, without obedience to which God is not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, nor satisfied on man's part, though he was even well pleased and satisfied in his own Son, both in his doing and suffering; the benefit whereof they only receive who believe in, and obey him in his Light within: and to such only he is the Author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as do obey him; though the free proffers of Gods Love in him towards all mankind, God commended his Love to us, in that whilst we were Sinners Christ died.</p>
            <p>So that we do faithfully acknowledge the Love and Goodness of God in Christ, and would not at all have it diminished or suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor yet have Christ's Offices, Works, or end of his coming brought into question; however we do oppose mens confusions and misapprehensions concerning God, Christ's Righteousness, Faith, &amp;c. which none rightly know, or apprehend, but they who are led by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And now touching Justification by Imputed Righteousness, where it is known in reallity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Justication.</hi>
               </note> we never denied or opposed, seeing that where God imputes or reckons righteousness as he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and still doth to his Seed of Faith, that hath a real sence and enjoyment of it, as every one hath, that is in the exercise of the true and living Faith: But we do still oppose and deny the vain Conceits and Imaginations of the <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and all of their affinity touching their false Imputation and Justification to sinful and wicked men, (whilst such) which he that justifieth is abomination to the Lord, as he is that condemneth the Just.</p>

to make <hi>Just,</hi> then tis a real work effected by the Spirit of God, Sanctification and Justification being inseparable Companions, as <hi>T.

            <p>Then first, if it hath relation to Gods imputing righteousness to the Believer, the account he casts therein must needs be true; for he doth not account wicked men righteous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Impute signifieth to <hi>think, imagine</hi> and <hi>reason</hi>: as to <hi>imagining,</hi> it cannot have relation to God, for his Account is beyond Imaginations, and his thoughts above mans thoughts; and then it is not safe nor true in man to depend upon his own think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or imagining, or imputation; for where God accounts a man righteous, his Spirit doth evidence it beyond thoughts or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for many imagine and think <hi>themselves</hi> righteous, when they are unrighteous; <hi>as there</hi> is a Generation that is pure in their own eyes, yet are not clensed from their filthiness: and when Christ's Righteousness is esteemed any ones, it is not without the works of <hi>her</hi> own, as it is falsly asserted pag. 39. no more then <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was without its own works or obedience.</p>
            <p>Pag. 40. T. D. Argues first <hi>from the proportion which our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ's Righteousness bears to our condemnation by</hi> Adam<hi>'s sin; but our condemnation was by imputation of</hi> Adam<hi>'s sin; therefore our Justification is by the imputation of Christ's Righteousness</hi> Rom. 5.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This Condemnation that is come upon all men, is because all have sinned and partaken of the fall, being in <hi>Adam</hi> in the Earthly state, really bearing his Image, and this is not a thinking or imagining a condemnation from, or for an imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, (according to their notion of it) but <hi>really a partaking of the disodience of one upon all; every man shall die for his own iniquity, the Soul that sinneth, it shall die, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58882:61"/>And if our Justification by Christ's Righteousness bears a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our Condemnation, then must we as really partake of Christ's Righteousness, being converted, as we have of sin being unconverted; and this is not a thinking or imagining our selves righteous, but a true enjoyment and bearing his Image, and being conformable to it, as really as we have born and been conformable to the Image of the Earthly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48, 49.</p>
            <p>T. D. Argues secondly, <hi>from the proportion of our being made righteous bears to Christ being made sin; but Christ was made sin by imputation; therefore so are we made righteous,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. ult. <hi>for he was made sin for us, who knew no sin</hi> (i. e. <hi>by an experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its operation in himself he did no sin,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21.) <hi>that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here T. D. hath but brought over his old Arguments long since answered and confuted by that Servant of the Lord <hi>S. Fisher, as may be seen at large</hi> in his Book <hi>Rusticus ad Acadaemicos</hi>; which T. D. J.

               </gap> proportion to his being made to be sin for us, when he knew no sin by its operation in himself, nor did sin; then it follows by this proportion that we are made (or rather thought or imagined) to be the Righteousness of God in Christ, whilst we neither knew his Righteousness, nor experienced his work in our selves, nor did righteousness; which is altogether false, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apostles Doctrine and intent, seeing that it is Christ in whom is no sin, that we are made Gods Righteousness, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the new Creatures state in Christ, which in him is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto good works, which God hath ordained we should walk in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.10. and this is more then thoughts or imaginations of being righteous, or in Christ; for it is in truth and reallity, which admits not of your imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or claiming an interest in that which you are out of, and which is none of yours in the true enjoyment.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is his apprehension of the Sureties payment of the Debt, as appears before, which is a very easie put off, to evade per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, or real and perfect obedience on the Creatures part; but it will not be so accepted of God, as the end of Christ's Obedience; seeing that it was to make man righteous, as his condemning Sin in the Flesh was, that the righteousness of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us that walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; which righteousness fulfilled <hi>in us</hi> T. D. formerly said was to be meant <hi>in Christ's Person,</hi> and <hi>not in ours,</hi> by which likewise he hath both exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man from the real enjoyment of Christ and his Righteousness, and from that obedience and sanctity which he requires, and answers the end of his coming and manifestation; and by this means the Professors have made the Law and Commands and Teachings of God ineffectual as to the Creature, whilst Christ only is made the subject of them, and not man; and this gives a liberty to people to live in sin all their time, and to pervert Gods Laws, and neglect the teachings of his Grace, and vainly to excuse themselves in their disobedience, like as T. D. hath done; as where the Grace of God and his pure Law requires perfect obedience from us, and that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and that we should live godly, righteously and soberly in this present world; now if any man should say, that this was not intended to us, but to Christ, as if God did require him to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all sin, and live righteously, when he never did nor could sin, nor had the Prince of the world any thing in him; this would be a strange put off, and gross perversion of the Law of God, to lay it all upon Christ, and put it from themselves: whereas Christ's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is perfectly to be followed, and where he is manifest, and his Life brought forth in man, there is a conformity to his Heavenly Image, and not a living in sin, nor to the lusts of the world, but to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>Pag. 42. But as to T. D's confessing <hi>to the Creditors cancelling the B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, letting the Debtor out of Prison, giving a legal Discharge upon the Sureties payment of the Debt, as he could have done upon his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58882:62"/>First, Hereupon I do enquire, if man that hath been in Prison and bondage under sin and corruption be let out of that Prison upon Christ's Obedience? if he be, then he must not remain in personal bondage all his life time, from partaking of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Obedience; for if he be released from the servitude of sin, and be let out of that bondage, then he is made free from it by the Law of the Spirit of Life, to serve, obey and walk in the Law of Righteousness by Faith; and this is not an imagined fixion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Freedom or Justification, whilst people are in real bondage, which your Doctrine tends to keep people in.</p>
            <p>Though it be true, as amongst men, that the Act of one Person may by contract, or Act of Law become the Act of another, as the Sureties payment of the Debt is accepted for the Debtor; yet in this case it doth not reach the real and full intent of Christ's Coming, Obedience and Righteousness, which is to bring man into his Image, and to fulfil the righteousness of the Law in man, that he may follow his Steps, and have the same Mind, Spirit and Righteousness in him that was in Christ, that he may walk after his Example in all purity and holiness of conversation.</p>
            <p>Yet so far as releasement out of Prison is imported in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, or any thing tending to a real Deliverance of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Sin and Corruption, and so from Condemnation, it may be admitted of so; for then it contradicts their pleading for sin and imperfection term of life: and surely God doth not legally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any to be righteous, whilst his Spirit and Law within reproves them for sin, and declares them unrighteous; for God and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do not contradict one another; neither doth God declare people to be out of Prison, whilst they are really in bondage to their sins, lusts and vanities, as the carnal Priests and Professors have falsly done; but the Liberty which Christ proclaims to the Captives is really to be injoyed and received by every one that believes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him, his Message and Testimony.</p>
            <p>And this is not a false Imputation, or an imagined Application of Righteousness and Freedom to People in their personal bondage of Sin and Corruption, such as T. D. and such false Guides have led people into.</p>
            <p>And that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. the Son shall not bear the iniquity of the Father, T.D. saith, <hi>Imports Gods gracious recession from his right,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58882:63"/>
because of their more then ordinary Audacity in charging his Ways with inequality</hi>: This is his false construction.</p>
            <p>For God sheweth his Way to be equal <hi>vers.</hi> 25, 26, 27. which is no recession from his right, as his condemning such as turn from righteousness, and Justifying and giving Life to such as turn from wickedness; for both Graciousness, Mercy, and Judgement are his right, and he rewardeth every man in Righteousness according to the Equality of his Wayes.</p>
            <p>T. D. <hi>Nor doth God Justifie what is opposite to his pure Nature in Justifying a person who in himself is impure upon the righteousness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother imputed to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Is not a person that is in himself impure opposite to God's pure Nature? Surely purity and impurity are opposite; and whilst the impure Person is rendred the subject of Justification upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's righteousness imputed, he then it seems is accounted pure by T. D. and not opposite to God's pure Nature, though he be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but surely God doth not then account him pure, whilst in impurity; for God cannot lye, nor account as the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Hypocrites do, who are pure in their own eyes, though not washed from their filthiness; and here we may see T. D. and his Brethrens false notion and conception of <hi>Imputation</hi> and <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and how contrary it is to <hi>Justum facere,</hi> which the word <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> signifieth, as by him before confest, (viz. <hi>to make Just</hi>;) when now he falsly renders an impure person not opposite to the pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, from his notion of Imputation and Justification in that state.</p>
            <p>Pag. 44. Arg. 3. Sin came not by Imputation, but by actual Transgression, [This is laid down as the <hi>Quakers.</hi>]</p>
            <p>To which T. D. Answers, <hi>The sin of</hi> Adam <hi>was made his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Imputation,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 14. <hi>Adam was a common Root of Mankind by nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Herein hath he perverted the Scripture, which doth not say that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was made his Posterities by Imputation; neither doth he hereby prove his notion of Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to impure persons; for sure he cannot prove that all <hi>Adam's</hi> Posterity were pure, and sin not actually theirs, but only imputed to them whilst not partakers of it; this is contradictory, and as false as their Imputation of Righteousness and Justification to men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58882:63"/>
whilst unjust; but the Scripture he mentions <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. saith, As by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; so Death past upon all men, for that all have sinned; (mark that) for until the Law Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed where there is no Law, verse 13. But now (mark) there is a Law trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, whereby Sin and Transgression is imputed to them that are guilty of transgression, as all in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the earthly state and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are; and therefore on the other hand righteousness is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to persons out of Christ, or to such that are not partakers of his righteousness.</p>
            <p>Pag. 45. Arg. 4. <hi>Quaker.</hi> A man cannot be said to be actually sinfull, and imputatively righteous; he may as well be said to be actually damned, and imputatively saved.</p>
            <p>To which T. D. answereth; <hi>Why not? as well as to say a man is actually poor and not worth a groat, but imputatively rich, as having by Surety paid his debt of thousands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here he hath plainly discovered their notion of Imputation, and the falseness of it, (viz.) that a man is <hi>imputatively righteous when actually sinfull, or actually damned and yet imputatively saved</hi>: what gross Corruption and Ignorance is this? and what an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Comparison doth he bring to back it (let the wise judge) and we do not admit of it in this case; as that a man should be actually damned and imputatively saved, or actually guilty and yet imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively innocent, but that such to whom righteousness and true riches are reckoned as being theirs, have right therein and are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof; and what he asserts herein by his <hi>simile</hi> is but a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the question, and taking that for granted which is still opposed as both unscriptural and unreasonable; viz. men being actually damned and imputatively saved, or actually guilty and imputatively innocent; by the same reason he might as well say, persons really Theeves are innocent, or persons really and actual trecherous and rebellious are true and good Subjects; or actually Devils and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively Saints: But Christ being or becoming our Suerty was not to impute righteousness to men in transgression, but to bring them into Covenant and Peace with God, which stands in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousness, and not in sin; for he was also a perfect example to be followed as well as profest; and he is the Surety of the new Testament and Covenant which is spiritual, and is manifested and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58882:64"/>
enjoyed in his people. And T. D's instance [<hi>that nine men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mutinous Army are actually guilty, and yet imputatively innocent; when the tenth man is admited to sustain the punishment due to the rest</hi>] is as sottish and impertinent as the rest before, for neither is a mutinous Army innocent, nor is Christ any of the mutinous or guilty Persons.</p>
            <p>And where proves T.D. that <hi>Imputation is an Act of Law and makes a Relative, and not a real change?</hi> I ask what Law it is an act of? is it real or true, or no? if it be of God it must be true; if not, then false; and it is a false imputation which is not real, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apostles Doctrine, who knew that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was imputed or reckoned to him for righteousness, and to that state to which there was no condemnation (but justification) which was a state of being &amp; walking in Christ, and not a walking after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; and this they that experience and witness, know a real change from death to life, from condemnation to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, from sin to righteousness, from the wayes of death and darkness to the wayes of Life, Light and Peace.</p>
            <p>Pag. 45. T. D. saith, <hi>There is no need of inherent Righteousness for Justification, bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet there is need of it for other ends, as to make us meet for Heaven,</hi> Col. 1.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It appears that he means by this inherent righteousness that of Sanctification, (or the work of Gods Spirit within) which he afterwards calls <hi>personal righteousness</hi>; and is there no need of this for Justification? what darkness is here! as if men were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied while in the unsanctified state; this is like the rest of his sottish stuff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quite contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, which is, But ye are Sanctified, but ye are Justified in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And also what contradiction hath T. D. brought to himself herein, whilst he hath <hi>confessed,</hi> that the word Justifie signifieth <hi>to make Just</hi>; as also he hath confessed that <hi>inherent Righteousness,</hi> as he call it, <hi>gives a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of enjoying the Heavenly Inheritance, it lying in Communion with God,</hi> pag. 46. then it follows, that it gives a fitness for Justification, whilst Justification and Sanctification are unseparable Companions; and God loves his Image in his People freely, saith his Brother T. V. Thus without Washing, Clensing and Sanctification men are not Justified, seeing the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58882:64"/>
God, and they that live in unrighteousness cannot be accepted of him; It being not the Hearers of the Law, but the Doers that shall be <hi>Justified.</hi>

            <p>Pag. 46. And now concerning <hi>good works</hi> that are acceptable to God, which T. D. accuseth us with placing <hi>Merit</hi> for Justification, or as a deserved cause thereof, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Concerning this particular, that faithfull Servant of the Lord <hi>S. Fisher</hi> hath very fully answered T.

Fisher</hi> about this point; and how contrary to his intent he construed <hi>good works,</hi> as being ours, relating to self works, or <hi>imperfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which <hi>S. Fisher</hi> never intended, but with Relation to those works which are perfect, which Christ is the Author of, (which if Christs Works be not deserving, whose are?) and to those which God hath wrought in us, who having ordained Peace for us, hath wrought all our works in us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. now we never placed a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon self-acting, nor upon mans best works in the faln, sinfull and corrupt state; so that there is not a correspondency betwixt us and the Papists in this particular, as falsly we have been accused; see <hi>S. Fisher</hi>'s <hi>Rusticus ad Accademicos,</hi> where the point is fully explained, which you <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> are never able to answer.</p>
            <p>Where did we ever profess or hold forth, that we were able, or could fulfil the Law our selves, or merit or deserve Salvation by any thing that we could do? but we do profess and witness, that through the Power of Christ we are enabled to faithfull and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, not of our selves, knowing, that good works (how ever rejected and undervalued) are ordained of God, and without them your faith is dead, as a body without a Spirit is.</p>
            <p>And it is true enough, as T. D. saith, <hi>That you are averse to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through corruptions</hi>; who plead for sin term of life, and yet would cover over all your filthy raggs with a pretence of Christ's Righteousness, Satisfaction, Imputation, Justification and Merit, whilst you are yet in your sins and corruptions, and in the weakness of your flesh, but as under the Law of works) wherein you are in no perfect obedience.</p>
            <p>Pag. 47. Seeing the Law of Faith is acknowledged, I ask, how far it extends, whether to enjoyn to the perfect obedience of Faith,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58882:65"/>
yea or nay? seeing sin and corruption is so prevalent amongst you, and so contended for, surely where the excercise of the true and living Faith is experienced, there is obedience to the Law of it; or else what doth it signifie whilst persons remain in disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>Further, T. D. confesseth, <hi>that we have an immediate dependancy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in our operations,</hi> John 15.5. <hi>without me ye can do nothing,</hi> (Siorsima me) <hi>separate or apart from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its well he hath at some time assented to the Truth; but how doth this contradict the greatest part of his own and his Brethrens work elsewhere, in their pleading for imperfect obedience, and their imagined imputation of Righteousness and Justification to the unrighteous and unjust? for those operations which have a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an immediate dependence upon God, which he that is in Christ doth experience and bring forth, do accord with the mind and will of God, which is the Sanctification of those that believe, and with that most holy Faith which purifies the heart; and these are not imperfect, nor to be slighted as undeserving, according to the vain notions of Priests concerning Faith, its works and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteousness, as they term it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 47. T. D.. <hi>Their dependancy upon Christ in all the good they do, is as near and intimate, as the Branches upon the Vine by vertue of their natural union in bearing Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is also a Truth that grants a perfect obedience in them that have such a near intimate dependency upon Christ, as the Branch hath that grows upon the Vine, by vertue of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Union thereof; this also contradicts their pleading for imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and sin in all obedience and works, which also shews that they do not flow nor spring from Christ the true Vine, as also, that they have not union with him, nor are Branches of him; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how they have not immediate dependency upon God in Christ whilst they deny Immediate Teaching, Revelation and Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be attainable in those dayes.</p>
            <p>But seeing without, or apart, or separate <hi>from Christ</hi> men can do nothing; how then can they <hi>be</hi> any thing without him, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, or acceptable, or justified? For men must be something in that Relation before they can do any thing acceptable; and it is the Spirit and Power of Christ which sanctifieth and maketh just,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58882:65"/>
and bringeth into the true Obedience, Works and Righteousness of Faith, and to live by Faith, as the Just doth.</p>
            <p>Pag. 48. But Faith as a work is not <hi>opposed</hi> to (nor excludes) it self, as T. D. saith, because in one sence it is opposed to the deeds of the Law; for true Faith, as a Work, is the Work of God, which is not opposed to it self; besides, it being the work of God, to believe in Christ, this hath not relation to those deeds of the Law that the <hi>Jews</hi> wrought out of him, and out of, (or besides) that Faith wherein they fell short of the Righteousness of the true and living Faith, and of the perfect Obedience or Righteousness of the Law.</p>
            <p>Now seeing he confesseth pag. 49. to a righteousness bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men by Faith; I ask, if that man is not a partaker and enjoyer of that righteousness by Faith? Surely Faith and its Righteousness are not separate nor divided. Also he confesseth, <hi>Faith in God, through the Messias is called a walking humbly with God,</hi> Micah 6.8. To this I say, whilst he thus considereth Faith as such a walking; were it not very gross nonsence and contradiction to say that it excludes it self, as before? or that those works or effects of Faith, (viz.) Walking humbly with God, were opposed to the Faith it self, which is the Root thereof? But this is even like <hi>T. Vincent</hi>'s affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Faith to be opposite not only to the works of the Law, but to its own Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 51. I find T. D. upon <hi>James</hi> 2.24. doth not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Works of Faith, and the Works of the Law, and so talks like an ignorant blind Guide, with his vain babling, and perverting of the Scripture to exclude perfect Obedience and Perfection from the Believers.</p>
            <p>And seeing he granteth, that <hi>Justification imports the Absolution of Sinners, and the Approbation of a Believer</hi>; which he distinguisheth betwixt: Then it is to be minded, that a Believer, that is approved of, is absolved, being Justified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what from, if not from Sin and Transgression? Otherwise Faith that stands but in a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, without a living work of purifying the heart, overcoming the World, &amp;c. is but a dead Faith, as T. D. <hi>in fine</hi> confesseth.</p>
            <p>And we are Justified by works, as our Faith is made perfect by works, <hi>James</hi> 2.22. but these are not the works of the Law, but the Works of the Living Faith, which manifesteth Fruit to God,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58882:66"/>
and demonstrates the nature of the Living Faith: But his telling of <hi>a Sinner being Justified in the sight of God</hi>; where doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture say so? he quotes <hi>Rom</hi> 3.23. to prove it, but it doth not; but only that a man by Faith is Justified without the deeds of the Law, which deeds of the Law a man may be Justified without, and yet not a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor without the Obedience, Works or Righteousness of the True and Living Faith which Purifieth the heart, and Justifieth from all those things from which they could not be Justified by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to his saying, <hi>That we are made free meritoriously, by the Law of the Spirit in us, from the Law of Sin and Death</hi>: (The word meritoriously, he addeth) But the freedom of the Law of the Spirit in us from the Law of Sin and Death, we do confess; and that it is the same Law of the Spirit of Life that is in Christ and the Saints, according to the Apostles Doctrine; the Freedom of which we te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie is of Everlasting worth; for that it is not wrought by our selves, but by Christ and his Law and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Pag. 52. T. D. saith, <hi>That we observe that the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in the Persons of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed we do observe it, believe it, and experience it, and do not wholy put it off from us, to be fulfilled in the Person of Christ, as T. D. and some of his Brethren have corruptly done; though we do confess that the Righteousness of the Law was fulfilled in Christ's Person; but not therefore to exclude it out of us, since that he was a faithfull Example to be followed, as well as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Leader to guide in all the Wayes of Peace and true Holiness.</p>
            <p>Pag. 52. And as we do observe that the Righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in the Persons of the Saints, contrary to T. D. and his Brethrens observation, and thereupon not only suppose, but really assert a state of Freedom from Sin attainable in this life; we do not place the Merit of Justification upon the Creatures imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience or works; but origionally on the Spirit of Truth, and its perfect work, in which Spirit Christ perfectly obeyed, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up himself a Lamb without spot to God; and we know that it is the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ that makes us free from the Law of Sin and Death, <hi>Romans</hi> 8. which Freedom is effected with in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:58882:66"/>Pag. 53. If there be a connexion between Justification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and that the same Christ Jesus that Justifieth by his Blood, Sanctifieth by his Spirit, as is confest, (from <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Loc.</hi> 2.) then men are not Justified whilst in an unsanctified state, seeing, that <hi>it is also evidenced by a holy life</hi>; but then herein T. D. seem doubtfull, as rather enclining to lay it upon the active obedience of Christ; but then is not he that is Sanctified and Justified, being in an holy life, a partaker of Christ's Righteousness, Obedience, and Subjection in the Spirit of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the pure Law of it? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that makes free from the Law of Sin and Death. But then he wavers again to the understanding of some <hi>who suppose the end of Christ's coming into the World is, that God's Righteous Laws might not be absolutely contemned, but might be observed (though imperfectly) by Believers</hi>; others, (saith he) of the <hi>Imputation of Christ's Surety, Righteousness, &amp;c.</hi> This imperfect observation of God's Righteous Laws is that he would fain center in, and which indeed the tenor of most of his discourse amounts to, though it be not the end of Christ's sending into the World, nor yet the work of the Spirit and Law of Life within; for the end thereof was to destroy sin, and to work mans perfect freedom from it, which they that experience are only the true and real subjects of Christ's Righteousness, and know the true imputation thereof, and effect and real benefit of his being a Surety of the new Testament, wherein the Promises of God are fulfilled to and in man, and man brought under the obligation of that Law and Covenant which tends to the exaltation of Truth and Righteousness in the Earth, and the bringing the Creature into a perfect and peaceable subjection unto its Maker: So Christ's being both our Surety, Advocate, Intercessor and Mediator betwixt God and man, is to make both Unity, Reconciliation and Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; a Mediator being not a Mediator of one, but betwixt two, &amp;c. to bring into mutual agreement.</p>
            <p>T. D. <hi>Our good and our evil works are not perfectly contrary, for our evil works are perfectly evil, for,</hi> malum fit ex quilibet defectu, <hi>any one defect make our works evil, but our good works are but imperfestly good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If good works and evil works be not perfectly contrary, where and what then are the good works, whilst defect and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is pleaded for, which makes them evil? Surely good and evil
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58882:67"/>
are perfectly contrary; but by this man's consequence, there is no good works whilst defects and imperfections remain in them; and then why doth he call them good works? It appears he gives them that name which is improper to them; but if good works be really acknowledged, as we know they are in Scripture, and that they that are truly so, are wrought in the Light, and so in God, these are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly contrary to evil; but such T. D. &amp; his Brethren with their sins and imperfections are strangers to, whilst they shew themselves to be out of the Light wherein the good works are wrought: and as to the condignity he speaks of, (or worth) as with relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite reward, we do, as before, place it in that Heavenly Image, Spirit and Life which brings forth the good works which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and it is that Spirit which leads its Followers to the infinite reward of Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Arg. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. Not the Hearers of the Law are Justified before God, but the Doers of the Law shall be Justified; to this T. D. saith; <hi>The words give a reason of the Jews perishing who had the Law,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the old Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> The reason of their perishing was their Disobedience unto the Law; but this, of the Doers of the Law, wherein both the Just and Justified state is intimated, according to the Gospel, verse 14, 15, 16. relates to those <hi>Gentiles</hi> which had not the Law outwardly, and yet did by nature the things contained in the Law, which the Apostle renders as a reason and proof of their Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who shewed the Work of the Law written in their hearts, which Law was pure and Spiritual, converting the Souls, and here it is also evident, that the matter or things contained in the Law, they had both in Power and Operation, who had it not in the Letter of it; but the extent of this is and hath been much opposed by T. D. and such as he, who have grosly perverted the Scriptures for their own sinfull and corrupt ends to their own and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>And now that a state of Freedom from sin is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Perfection.</hi>
               </note> this T. D. erroneously sets down as an <hi>Error,</hi> and argues against it as followeth.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. <hi>If no meer man ever attained to any such state, then it is not attainable, but no meer man ever did, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> His term <hi>meer man</hi> is his own, and not ours; what he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58882:67"/>
means by <hi>meer man,</hi> is a question; for it may be taken variously, as first, he may be deemed a meer man, that is, without God, Christ or the guidance of his Spirit, who lives to himself; in which state we never said that freedom from sin was attainable by any meer man; for without Christ we can do nothing. Secondly, if <hi>meer man</hi> be taken singly, as <hi>purus homo,</hi> or man purely or intirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of those things which are either contrary to him, <hi>as Man,</hi> or not proper to his being Man, (as sin and transgression were improper to him) for so he was in his first Creation in Innocency and primitive Purity; as so considered, to deny him Perfection, or Freedom from sin, were to deny him that which God did invest him with whilst he was in his Maker's Image, which was proper to him, and to which Christ comes to restore man again out of the Fall: But then T. D. explains what he means by <hi>meer man</hi>; viz. <hi>such as the eminently holy Persons in the Scriptures, whom he denies to have ever attained a state of Perfection</hi>; by which he has accused all the holy Men of God at once, as but <hi>meer men,</hi> in the worst sence; and such were they that were carnal, and walked as men, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.3. and he hath therein both opposed God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Promises, and Works, as also the end of Christ's manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was perfectly to restore man out of sin and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness unto God, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. and 10.12. and 11.1. and 13.18. and 19.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.32. and 37.37. and 119.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16. <hi>John</hi> 13.8. <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.4. and 60.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, 33. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. and chap. 10.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Hosea</hi> 14.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28, 29. ch. 4.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. <hi>James</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>But what sin or sins he can charge upon either the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets or Apostles that they were not freed from perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before their decease, this he hath yet to shew and evince to us, concerning all them that died in the Faith, who finished their Testimony with Joy and Peace.</p>
            <p>T. D. Arg. 2. <hi>That there is a continual need and use of Faith and Repentance in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That there is a continual need of Repentance, this I deny; for true Repentance, where it is wrought, and the fruits of it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58882:68"/>
brought forth, this is unto Salvation never to be repented of, and is attended with a real forsaking of sin and transgression, this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your fained repentance humility, which is still to be repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, as the sins of your best performances are: also True and Living Faith purifies the heart, and is the Saints Victory, and the exercise of it through that Divine Power and Love by which it works against temptations and the fiery darts of the Devil, after the mind and heart is cleared from sin and pollution: it being one thing for man to sin, and another Only to be tempted to sin; so that it is a false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to say, <hi>that there is a like reason for a continual need of Repentance in this life, as there is for the use of Faith</hi>; neither doth that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> prove that Repentance abideth with Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as falsly T. D. reasons; might he not as well say, there is the same reason for repentance to abide, that there is for Charity to abide, seeing that Faith, Hope and Charity abide; whereas Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the Bond of Perfection, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. and Love is the fulfilling of the Law; and the end of the Commandment is Love out of <hi>a pure Heart,</hi> which positively opposeth T. D's sinfull Doctrine for sin and imperfection, which tends greatly to pervert people, and to keep his Hearers in unbelief, whilst he doth not only deny that ever any attained to perfection but affirms Freedom from Sin not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life, which is his gross ignorance and unbelief of Christ and his Power, which is greater and stronger then the Devil and all his attempts, and is able to overcome him, and to destroy his works; and in this Power of Christ the Faith of the Righteous stands, and this we contend for against the Devil and all his sinful Agents, who thus mannage and maintain his work.</p>
            <p>And how falsly is it for T. D. pag. 56. to say, <hi>that Charity or Love suits our present imperfect state</hi>; [as he also saith, Faith and Hope doth,] whereas Charity or Love which is the Bond of Perfectness, and is known in the pure heart suits that State which is of its own nature, as <hi>Perfection and Purity</hi> is, which is also effected through the true Faith that purifies the heart, and that hope which he that hath purifieth himself even as he is pure, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. which admits not of <hi>sin and imperfection term of life</hi>; for he that abideth in Christ sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not. And as to that of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; to which T. D. saith, <hi>He denies in one verse what he affirms in another; if the word perfect be in both
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58882:68"/>
places understood in the same sence,</hi> verse 12.15. To vers. 12. I say, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not say that Perfection was <hi>not attainable</hi> in this life; neither doth it appear to be his judgment, for then why should he follow after, reach forth, or press forward unto those things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and plainly say, Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded? Whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same Rule: Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so, as you have us for an Example, vers. 15, 16, 17. Surely he was not an Example of sin and imperfection, but of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holiness; yet notwithstanding he then both expected and believed a growth in the Spiritual and Divine Understanding and Apprehension of that for which he was apprehended of Christ; so the Perfection he had not already (then) attained, relating to such an apprehension as he speaks of, doth not exclude that state of Perfection and integrity that he was then brought and apprehended into of Christ Jesus, as to the Purity and Righteousness which he was a partaker of in Christ; for the <hi>Child of God</hi> its growth <hi>in Strength, Wisdom and Spiritual Vnderstanding</hi> doth not render it sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or impure in the nature and properties of it, but rather shews its Purity and Innocency the more in that its truly capable of such a growth.</p>
            <p>Page 56, 57. But then, when is this freedom from Sin, or state of Holiness (which T. D. saith will be in a proper sence perfect) attainable, if not in this life?</p>
            <p>T. D. <hi>The Saints shall be invested with it at the Resurrection, called, The Resurrection of the Dead, Metonimically, in the Life to come indeed we shall be like God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> By this we may understand that he has put off Freedom from sin from all Gods People till the life to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not only so, but till this <hi>Metonimical Resurrection</hi> (according to his terms) which he may understand is not as yet to any of the deceased, though the Life to come that's Everlasting, (as intended) is by the Righteous enjoyed after this life. I do not intend here to dispute his terms of the Resurrection, but admitting it in his sence, my end is to shew how he has excluded all the Saints both deceased, and yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from a state of freedom from sin, as not being yet attained to it, if this Resurrection he intends be yet to come; and then, where are they in the mean time? where are their Souls? where are their

sins and pollutions and imperfections, if all be yet uncleansed and not freed from sin? will not T. D's Doctrine herein meer, and be one with the Popes touching a Purgatory; for if none be perfectly cleansed here, and yet none come to God, or into his Kingdom unclean, they must be clensed somewhere; he should have told us the Place of Purging, which is not in the Grave, not in Hell, not in the Pit; and it must be before Heaven be entred into; what place then between both, if T. D's Doctrine must be owned for Catholick on Authentick? but, who is it that are not meer Papist, or that have nor drunk up his corrupt Doctrines, that cannot see him, his Popery, Ignorance, Confusion and Error herein. And what Popery he hath at unawares run himself into, is now obvious.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect; to this T. D. saith, <hi>Such Commands are the Measure of our Duty, not of our Attainments in this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Thus he perverts and diminisheth the righteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, as if God had either required a thing not attainable; or as if being perfect, as he is perfect, were but the measure of our Duty, and so to be put off till the Life to come, wherein the Saints had not such Commands given to them, seeing they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of sinning in the Life to come; but <hi>John</hi> said, As is he, so are we in this world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. And herein they knew their Love made perfect; and this is more then either the small resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Children to their Parents which T. D. speaks of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his imperfect sinfull state and Doctrine; for the perfect Love which they had, was in them a perfect resemblance of God, who is Love, verse 16. But this way of T. D. his slighting and diminishing, and falsly interpreting the Commands of God, which require such perfection, only as the measure of our Duty, is like his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, saying, <hi>That a Child of God, his not committing Sin is to be meant, he doth not make a trade of Sin</hi>; which indeed is a very easie way they have taken to pervert the Commands of God, and to give ease and liberty to the Transgressors in their sins; as if when a thing is absolutely required of them, they should put it off with this, <hi>It is meant only as but in part to be obeyed; and so if they should deal thus with God, and say, Lord, then requires us not to Steal, or not to commit Adultery, or not to Covet; but we are to understand it, as that we cannot altogether abstain from Stealing, Adultery or Covetousness,

only we are not to make a trade of these things, nor wholy make it our business to be imployed in them</hi>; what acceptance do they think such a Plea would have before the Lord? and what Answer would he make them to this their corruption? and what resentment would such Doctrine have in the minds of sober people, if they should preach them, and give such meanings to the Scriptures; and tell them that where Stealing, and Adultery, and worldly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>usts and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness are forbidden, that they are not to go to the extent of the Commands, but only not make a trade or a common practice of Stealing, or these things &amp;c? for thus they have dealt with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God's Commands enjoyning perfect Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but then they have an easie way to lay all upon Christ, as having paid their debt, and fulfilled the Righteousness of the Law in his Person in their stead, so that they must not expect its fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their persons; for where the Scripture speaks of its being fulfilled in us, we are to understand by <hi>in us,</hi> that it is in <hi>Christ's Person</hi>; and this is the manner of their course from time to time, both to shut Christ his Works and Righteousness out of People, so much as in them lies.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit Sin. T. D. saith to this, <hi>We may interpret it, as he is born of God he doth not sin; every Child of God is</hi> mixta persona, (Pag. 57.) <hi>as our Law sayes of the King, consists of an old and new nature; and so his new nature is</hi> Principium quo, <hi>the Principle from which he acts graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; and the old nature, the Principle from which he acts sinfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here again he hath palpably perverted plain Scripture, and contradicted the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> as may be seen in that 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. For he that is born of God, who doth neither commit sin, nor can sin, because he is born of God, has put off the old nature, and is not acted by that Principle which leads to act sinfully, because he cannot sin, and that gracious Principle in him hath overcome the sin, and the nature of it; and so to tell of his being <hi>mixta persona</hi> is T. D's gross blindness: For first, that which is born of God, that overcomes the World, is not mixt with sin, nor with the old sinful nature. Secondly, He, or whosoever is born of God, whose Seed remains in him, who abideth in Christ is not acted by that old sinful nature, because he is born of God, and abideth in Christ, in whom is no sin, neither is mans having divers parts, as Body and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58882:70"/>
Soul, &amp;c. or his being liable or not liable to death, any reason to shew that he that is born of God doth act sinfully from the old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for the Bodies of the Saints were the Temples of the Holy Ghost; and their Bodies were sanctified, and so brought into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the Divine Spirit or Principle in them, so as they might glorifie God in their bodies, and in their spirits, which were his.</p>
            <p>Again, T. D's meaning to that first of <hi>John</hi> 3.9. is, <hi>That it may intend the manner of sinning, so the</hi> 8<hi>th verse seems to limit it; be that committeth sin is of the Devil, for the Devil sinneth from the beginning; the Comparison</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is not between the act simply, for then it should have been said only, for the Devil sinneth, but from the beginning, implies a Comparison between the manner of man's sin and the Devils, in respect of which he is said to be of the Devil, because he immitates his example, who from the day he began never ceased to sin, nor ever did one truly good action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> By this we may gather T. D's limitation put upon that of 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. and the Comparison he makes between not the act simply, but the manner of mans sin and the Devils, still taking it for granted that he that is born of God doth sin, and acts sinfully from the old nature, but not in that manner as he that is of the Devil, who intimates his example; so that his meaning and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison seems to amount to this, that he that is born of God doth sin, but not always, or not as the Devil sinneth, he is somewhat better then the Devil, in that he doth some good actions, but the Devil doth none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Surely our opposer hath come off but very poorly in his arguing for the Devils work, contrary both to the state and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of such as were born of God, whom he hath here very meanly debased, and sadly abused the Scriptures, misrepresenting Gods Children whom he by his Eternal Power hath delivered from the power of Sin and Satan, and given them a Heavenly place in Christ, where the Devil cannot come, and in whom the Prince of the World hath nothing, nor his sinfull Ministers any part or interest whilst they plead against God's Promises, holy Commands, and against the very end and purpose of Christ's manifestation, as T. D. and his Brethren have done, wherein they have shown themselves to be Antichrist's Agents and Ministers, and not the true Christ's.</p>

               </note> this is set down as <hi>an Error</hi> by T.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is an apparent Slander cast upon us, as our Books and Writings do shew, that we never denied Christ to be God, or his Divinity; still affirming, That in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and that in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, and that was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the World, as in <hi>John</hi> 1.1.4, 9. Now to detect us as being in an Error herein, T.

Yet still I grant

that there is a state in which all are ignorant of God, and in which the Mystery, to wit, Christ within, the hope of Glory, hath been hid from Ages and Generations, but is shewed, revealed and made manifest to the true Believers in his Light, who said, Believe in the Light, that you may be the Children of the Light; and Christ said, I am come a Light into the World, that whosoever believeth in me might not perish, but have Eternal Life; and this we testifie to, against all Opposers of his Light, as it is in every man.</p>
            <p>Pag. 59. And where T. D. argues <hi>that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>for a time had no Promises of Christ; therefore knew of none, and consequently had not a Light, or Knowledge sufficient to bring them to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> What time was that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had no Promise of Christ and how long was it? Was not the Promise of God after the Fall (that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head) of a general extent, as well towards <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Jews?</hi> For was not <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> the first Parents of both, to whom this Promise was made? Secondly, The Promise that was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> whilst in the uncircumcision, did not this relate to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> see <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Galat.</hi> throughout? And thirdly, Was not Christ's Death for all, still a confirmation, or evident Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the fore-going Promises and Covenant of God towards both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>? but, and if there was some time or Ages in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had no Promises of Christ, and therefore not a Light sufficient to Salvation, according to T. D. then it follows that none of them in that time, or those Ages could be saved; and why? but because God did not afford them a sufficient Light, which assertion and consequence lays the blame upon God; but the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereof, who is it that know the Scriptures that cannot see? Again, where he puts <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Knowledge,</hi> herein he doth not reach our Principle, for many have a true Light in them, that are not come to the true Knowledge; for it is the Light that shines in the heart that gives the knowledge of the Glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. so the Light is there before the Knowledge is given; and in that its able to give that Knowledge, it is sufficient to save.</p>
            <p>And where he brings 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. ver. last, for proof, <hi>That the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>neither had, nor knew any Promises of Christ for a time,</hi> where (he saith) <hi>God manifested in the Flesh, and as such, preach'd unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>are made two parts of the Mystery of Godliness,</hi> which in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58882:71"/>
other Ages was not made known unto the Sons of men, as its now revealed to his holy Apostles and Prophets, by the Spirit, &amp;c. Where note, first, that this manistation of God in the Flesh, and preaching unto the Gentiles, is no proof that either they had no promises of Christ before, or that they had no Light in them sufficient to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if so, then all Gentiles in all Ages before that time were condemned for want of saving Light being given to them; which were a gross errour to assert. 2dly, As to the manifestation of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of God and Christ, I grant that it was more large and open in the Apostles days then for Ages before, as also, that was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest then, which was hid for Ages and Generations; yet still it doth not follow that the Gentiles before had not a Light sufficient to save, or to manifest the mystery of Godliness in some degree. 3dly, But yet <hi>T.

            <p>But yet the better to inform our Opposers of the Light, let them read <hi>John</hi> 1. where speaking of the Word that was God, that made all things, its said, In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, verse 4. and this Light and Life of men which proceeds from the Word, though it was before Christ's comming in the Flesh, yet it was still the Light and Life of Christ born witness of, and more fully manifested through his coming, or being sent in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of time.</p>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. but <hi>Lighted,</hi> as <hi>when Candle is carried before us, as a Blind man,</hi> P. 62. which Comparison is impertinently, and very improperly brought in this matter; for he was not speaking before of an outward Light, as that of a Candle before a Blind man; for it is absurd amongst men to offer a Blind man a Candle to light him, or shew him his way into a Room, when he is out of all capacity of seeing or receiving any benefit by it; but thus T. D. renders Christ's lightning men, when before he granted it to be Supernatural, the Light of the Gospel, wherewith the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58882:72"/>
enlightens men; which as it is not outward and natural, so it is only seen and known inwardly and spiritually: But then T. D. to come off saith, <hi>The meaning can be no more then this, that whosoever are enlightened are enlightned by him</hi>: What a silly shuffle and evasion is this, from his former granting that it was every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World that he enlightens, when now, but in the very next page it is, <hi>whosoever are enlightned are enlightned</hi>; and a little before that, <hi>many that are lighted are not inlightned, but are like a Blind man, so lighted,</hi> that sees never the better when a Candle is carried before him; so, by this he makes God's offering men Light neither to be of any effect to them, nor yet like to be, if they can have no more benefit by it then a Blind man hath by the Light of a Candle. What then can be God's end in lightning them? what doth it signifie to them, if they be so wholy uncapable of seeing ever the better? Doth he then bid them look, bid them walk aright in the strait Path? and doth he condemn them for not walking therein, when they are altogether uncapable of it, as from Sight or Light sufficient, as his Comparison before implies? Alas, alas, what a cruel unjust and unequal Master would this render God? and how unlike to himself doth it represent him whose Wayes are equal, Love universal, and Grace free; (who first gives Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and opens the Eye within, before man can walk aright) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Light within be gainsayed by such Blind Guides, as T.

            <p>Pag. 62. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. T. D. saith, touching those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that shewed the Work of the Law writ in their hearts, <hi>That it cannot be understood of a Saving Knowledge; and it is not the Law in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> (but yet a little after confesseth) <hi>that the Law may be said to be in their hearts, in their understandings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> How then were they excused according to the Gospel? and how then did the Apostle bring them as a Proof of Justification? verse 13, 14. Could they be Justified without a Saving Knowledge? But of T. D's ignorance in this much have been manifested both by <hi>S. Fisher,</hi> and some others. And how saith he in page 63. <hi>That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>in this sence had not the Law in their hearts</hi>; (viz.) <hi>a suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposition to the Law,</hi> as his words are? what nature was it by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58882:73"/>
which they did those things contained in it? how was it unsutable to the Law? or how could that do those things contained in the Law without a sutable disposition to it? Surely, a mean understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may perceive T. D's ignorance and Error in this particular as well as in the rest; for the Law of God in their hearts was Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and so was its effects in them; and that nature by which they obeyed it, was not opposite to it, but in unity with it; which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was contrary to that in the Jews which led them to break and violate the Law of God; But as for those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that liked not to retain God in their Knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. and those that said to God, Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy Wayes, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. These Instances do not at all prove that those <hi>Gentiles</hi> which obeyed the Law of God wanted a surable disposition to it; for this was in the rebellious state that they said, depart from us, and liked not to retain God in their knowledg; howbeit, this proves (against our Opposet) first, that some knowledge of God was afforded even them that liked not to retain it. And secondly, that God was nigh them that said to him, depart from us; and that also he would have afforded them the knowledge of his Wayes; and also it is evident that they were troubled, condemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his Witness in their Consciences, or else, how should they say depart from us, if he never came nigh them, nor ever touched their Consciences? or why should they say, we desire not the knowledge of thy Wayes, if the knowledge thereof was not tendred to them?</p>
            <p>And further, If so be that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as confessed) were those in whom that which might be known of God was manifested and shewed unto them from the Creation, to the being of God and his Eternal Power, which discovery did leave them without excuse; what was it that brought them to this understanding of the Eternal Power and Godhead from and through the Creation? was it Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al yea or nay? surely this clear sight and discovery in them did rise from that which might be known of God, that was manifest in them: and if this had not a sufficiency in it to save, how were they left without excuse? surely the fault was not to be laid upon God, nor on his Light in them, but to and upon themselves for disobeying it, and not liking to retain him in their knowledge.</p>
            <p>And seeing Christ is confessed, page 63. to be set for a Light to

the <hi>Gentiles, Isa.</hi> 49.6. which, saith T. D. <hi>is but a Prophesie of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>mercy in the time of Christ's actual exhibition in the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, this Mercy is of a large extent, and for ever to be prized, as in the fulness of time it is more manifest then before; and now especially since it is thus openly declared and manifested, it ought not to be thus opposed and slighted by men of corrupt minds which affirm it is an error to say that Christ enlightens ever man that cometh into the World, and yet at length are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it, as in these words; viz. <hi>That it is Supernatural, the Light of the Gospel, of the Messias, &amp;c.</hi> And thus they are confounded and broken to pieces, and their wisdom turned backward by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Light, this stumbling stone, this Rock of offence, which they cannot avoid stumbling at, and falling upon and breaking to pieces, who set themselves against it, and bring forth their vain imaginations to eclipse its glory, as too many of this Generation hath done.</p>
            <p>And now touching the Scriptures being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Word of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </note> but not the Word, nor the only Rule of Faith and Life; which T. D. sets down <hi>as an Error,</hi> wherein he hath no less then accused the Scriptures themselves with being Error. For, first, we in calling them a <hi>true Declaration,</hi> we call them what they call themselves, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. as also that they are <hi>Writings</hi> given forth by <hi>the holy</hi> men of God; and <hi>that</hi> which they call <hi>the Word,</hi> we do also, the <hi>Word was in the beginning with God,</hi> John 1. and his Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> yet both the Doctrinal part, and Historical part of the Scripture, contained in the Books of the Old and New Testaments we own, and never sleighted nor denied; yet if we should look upon them as the only Rule of Faith and Life, this would exclude the Rule and guidance of the Spirit (for the only Rule must be infallible, certain, incorruptible, obvious, &amp;c.) which leads into all Truth, as either not sufficient so to guide, or not to be owned as the Rule of Faith and Obedience to God, &amp;c. and this would be contrary to the Testimonies of the holy men of God concerning it, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and directed others to it, and to walk in this Spirit, and therein they knew their several attainments and measures, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Rule of the new Creature, who worshipped not in the oldness of the Letter, but in the newness of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, 16. And we know that without the guidance of this Spirit of Truth men can never come to a right judgment nor understanding of the holy Scriptures, or Spiritual things.</p>
            <p>And how <hi>then doth</hi> T. D. go to <hi>prove the Scripture</hi> to be <hi>the Word,</hi> and the only <hi>Rule of Faith and Life,</hi> whilst he hath granted, that <hi>to bring a testimony of Scripture concerning it self, were</hi> petitio principii, <hi>a begging the question, and were insignificant for their conviction which deny its Divine Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What course then will he take to convince such? seeing he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth but follow his notions, conceivings, and humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, while Divine Revelation, and immediate Inspiration are laid aside and opposed in these dayes by such as he: Pag. 65. he saith <hi>he will give a taste of our Arguments, and leave our tenents to the judgment of the understanding, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What understanding and what Judgment must be the Guide and Rule of mens judgements and undertandings, if the Light within must not be the Rule? for after he hath asserted the Scriptures to be the only Rule of Faith, presently he hath put himself upon a Hanck, and shakes his own Foundation, in confessing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures insufficient for the conviction of such who deny its Divine Authority; otherwise, its but a begging the question, to go to prove the Scriptures by themselves; and now what he will erect as a Rule instead thereof, for the conviction of such, whilst he hath opposed the Light within, and asserted the insufficience of the Scriptures (shewing them not to be the only Rule) is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whether he knoweth himself, if he doth, let him tell it to them that desire it.</p>
            <p>And Pag. 66. It is to be observed, one while he tell us of the <hi>Judgment of the Vnderstanding</hi>; another while the <hi>matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures was the Rule before it was committed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that the Gospel was preached to</hi> Adam. And again, when they affirm the Scripture to be the only Rule; its intended <hi>to them who have the Scriptures, and not to them that have them not,</hi> Pag. 67. And presently after we must understand this <hi>point with connexion with the former, the Light within</hi>: So do but mark what confusion here is: First, 'tis his own confession that the matter contained in the Scripture was before it was written: Secondly, That to them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58882:74"/>
who have not <hi>the Scriptures</hi> something must be the Rule; and what, is it <hi>the Light within,</hi> having no other way as he saith? Now, if the Light within and the matter contained in the Scriptures be a sufficient Rule to them which have them not in the Writing, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, its sufficiency is not diminished by the writing, but rather testified unto; neither is it the intent of the Scriptures to draw people from either the matter, or Light within, which opens them, nor to set up Scriptures as the only Rule instead thereof.</p>
            <p>But then saith T. D. <hi>that very Scripture,</hi> Rom. 10.8. <hi>speaks not of the Light within, but of the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It speaks of the very same Word which <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets spake of which was before the Scriptures were written; in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time much of them was unwritten, and yet he directed the people to the <hi>Word</hi>; and the Apostle called it the Word of Faith which was nigh them in their mouthes, and in their hearts: but saith T. D. <hi>It is not the Light within, but the Scriptures,</hi> as if he should say the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament were in their mouthes and hearts; but this Word of which they give testimony, was in the hearts of all the holy men of God, that gave forth the Scriptures before they writ them; and it was a Lamp to <hi>David</hi>'s feet, and a Light to his path; and he hid it in his heart, that he might not sin, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; verse 115. and the <hi>Word</hi> is for ever setled in Heaven, verse 89. this was that which quickned sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and saved the Righteous in and thorow all Generations, and of this the Scriptures or <hi>Writings</hi> do testifie; in which are words of God, but the Word was before they were spoke or writ.</p>
            <p>And T. D.'s accusing the Quakers <hi>for not owning the Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> is false, for we are in the Spirit that gave forth, and openeth, and brings to the right use and end of them, and in the same Spirit can and do make use of them, not only to prove our Tenents, and to Confute our Opposers, but also to obey and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the things contained in them (which are truly moral and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) as the Spirit of Truth doth direct and enable.</p>
            <p>T. D. <hi>We are not now to expect any new discovery of Truth, as to the matter revealed, but only as to the person whom God enlightens gradually to discern the evidence of what is revealed in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, If no new Discovery, then what is in Scriptures; then no need of Popish and Heathenish Authors to prove distinct
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58882:75"/>
and separate personal Subsistances in God, nor any other such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional distinctions which obscures the simplicity of Scripture Truth, and darkens the minds, of People, but people should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be referred singly to the Scripture Phrase and Language, and to search them in the Light of Christ within.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the discerning of the Scripture is from God's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning them, people ought to be recommended to God, to wait in his Light to know his Counsel and direction therein, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they will remain ignorant of the Scriptures and Revelation of the things declared.</p>
            <p>Again, its well that T. D. <hi>confesseth that there are Prophesies and Histories of things done before the Pen-mens birth, as also personal expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, &amp;c.</hi> So now at length he doth a little assent, to Truth, as if he were a little convinced by <hi>S. Fisher</hi>'s Answer to him, that he doth not now bind up all to the Scriptures, but confesseth that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, Histories, and personal experiences to be before the Pen-mens birth</hi>: But herein he hath but manifested his uncertainty and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to and again, one while opposing the Sufficiency of the Light, and placing all upon the Scriptures as the <hi>only Rule,</hi> another while upon the <hi>matter contained</hi> in the Scriptures, which was before the Scriptures were written, and was <hi>written on the heart of the Gentiles</hi>; another while the <hi>Light within</hi> he seems to assent unto, as in pag. 67. for them that have not Scripture; another while <hi>Prophesies</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> where before the Scripture; and thus at length the Spirit or Light that gave forth the Scriptures must be preferred as the most certain and universal Guide and Rule; as indeed it is to all them who follow, obey and believe in it; and this Light the blind, corrupt imaginary Teachers (whose knowledge and profession is but natural and traditional) cannot corrupt, as they have done the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by their false glosses meanings and private interpretations contrary to the intent and end of the Spirit of God which gave them forth, and which leads into all Truth and Righteousness: for a further Answer to T. D. touching this matter, I do refer the Reader to <hi>S. Fisher</hi>'s Book, titled <hi>Rusticus ad Accademicos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for his accusing Quakers with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror touching Baptism and the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Baptism and the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </note> (as to their ceasing) and setting up the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ within, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58882:75"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The one Baptism, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.5. into the one Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and the eating, drinking and supping with Christ at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord in his house and Kingdom we own and experience; but what Baptism it is he intends, whether sprinkling Infants, or <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, he hath not discovered; neither indeed doth it concern him now to make such a frivolous pudder against the Quakers upon this account; for indeed, we do not look upon him either as a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, nor as having a call either from God or man, as one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to impose things he calls Ordinances; its probable, when he was Parish Priest at <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, he could shew a greater force for his impositions then now he can in Houses and Corners, where he and his Brethren can creep, and not only so, but be ready to obscure and hide themselves, if but a little Storm and Trial come: He stiles himself sometime <hi>Minister of the Gospel at</hi> Sandwich; <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rather Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at</hi> Sandwich.</note> but is not rather that report of him true, that there he was given to Gaming, Bowls, and Nine-pins, &amp;c? But as to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and enjoyment of Christ within, we do confess him to be the Substance, and the Living Bread, and in him we are kept not only in a Living remembrance, but also in a real Possession of the Power and Vertue of his Life, having known a conformity to his Death, which is more then a remembrance of it; and we know him to be the enduring Divine Substance, which ends all Types, Shaddows and Figures, and his Coming, and Appearance in the Flesh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he went through the Types and Shaddows; as Circumcision, John's Baptism, observing the Passover at his Supper, and his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, did make way for his coming in the Spirit, as he consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a new and living way through the Vail, that is to say his Flesh: now the coming of Christ, until which, his Dispiples were to shew forth his Death in the observation of the figure; this coming they did not put afar off, as our Opposers yet do, how long they know not, it being already above Sixteen hundred years since; and yet this his coming is still put off: whereas the Disciples, after they were with Christ at his last Supper, were Witnesses of his coming after his Resurrection, and also of his Spiritual Coming and Revelation in their hearts, and now to suppose that what the Disciples did to shew his Death, was till a third Coming, not yet manifest, is to overlook the two former as no Comings, as also to render Christs own
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58882:76"/>
words and Promises ineffectual, who said, <hi>Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here which shall not taste of Death till they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 16.28. Mark 9. Luke 9.27.</p>
            <p>And as to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25. wherein the Apostle repeats what Christ did the same night he was betrayed, in giving the Bread and Cup to shew his Death till he came, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>However T. D. construes this, it doth not prove the figurative or outward part or sign to be imposed as of absolute necessity upon all. Believers, till some other coming of Christ, not yet come; for his coming in the Spirit T. D. owns not to be the end thereof; but where then is the mystery and inward and Spiritual Grace signified by the outward Sign? (so much talked of in your Catechisms) but its evident T. D. is ignorant of the Mystery of the Body and Blood of Christ, and Cup of the new Testament in his Blood, which the outward Bread and Cup was but the sign and figure of; we oppose the Popish opinion of Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>And however, as to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at that time, among them there was strife and division, contention and disorder, one being hungry, another drunk, another asleep; one being of <hi>Paul,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Apollo,</hi> another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> which the Apostle reproved therein, as being carnal, walking as men, so that he could not speak unto them as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 30. Now suposing that wherein the Apostle might or did condescend to their low capacity, as not grown to that Spirituallity, so as to see through the outward Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, this their Example was not to be a President, not could it in Reason or Truth be enjoyned to all other that succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who were come truly to know the glory of Christ's appearance in Spirit, and Spiritually to enjoy the Communion of the body and Blood of Christ, where none of these disorders aforesaid have any place.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> in his second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 13.15. bids them, examine and prove themselves, saying, Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you except you are Reprobates; So here was the Bread he then referred them to, which indeed was always the intent and end of his Labour and Travel, to bring those that were weak to a Living and Spiritual sence even of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58882:76"/>
this Spiritual Bread; however, because of their weakness, and low capacity he might condescend unto them, as in some things he did.</p>
            <p>And whereas T. D. pleading for his Ordinances, as before; saith, Pag. 72. <hi>They do not cease as to our need of them, because it is not to be supposed, consistant with Christ's Wisdom to continue an obligation upon us to the use of a means, when the end is obtained</hi>; viz, <hi>the appearance of Christ within, that is a full appearance or state of Perfection</hi> (saith he) <hi>but we having proved that there is no such state attainable in this life; then if those Ordinances oblige till we be arrived at perfection, they oblige, and so are of use during term of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Where observe, first, however, he hath granted that they are not obliging where the end is attained, or not continued by Christ as an obligation where this his appearance is Witnessed which brings to a state of Perfection. Secondly, T. D. having <hi>not</hi> proved that such a state is not attainable on this side the Grave, but the contrary being proved before against him and all his Brethrens sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pleas, Doctrines and Arguments for Sin and Imperfection in this life; therefore this Spiritual appearance of Christ brings man beyond all mens Traditions and outward Ordinances, (so called) and indeed who do know a beginning in the Spirit ought to wait for this Spiritual Appearance and Coming of Christ according to the Spirit's direction which is most perfect, and not to turn back again into the Types, Shaddows and Figures, nor into the weak and beggerly Elements of the World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Chapters.</hi>
               </note> nor yet subject themselves to mens Traditions, carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, imposed Doctrines and Preceps, but to wait upon God in Spirit, to serve and worship him in the newness of the Spirit, that thereby they may know the Spiritual Washing, the Baptism in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ's Death, and be Baptized by the one Spirit into one Body, and so come into the House of God, and to feed at his Table, and partake of the Living Bread which comes down from Heaven, and to drink of the Fruit of the Vine with Christ in his Fathers Kingdom, which Kingdom he promised to his Disciples should come with Power even in their Age, or before some of them that stood by should taste of death, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.27.</p>
            <p>And as for T. D's saying, <hi>The Apostle calls the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism a Foundation</hi>; (these are not the Apostles words, neither did
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58882:77"/>
he teach Sprinkling) Infants) for, saith he, <hi>but leaving the Principles (or beginning of the Doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto Perfection, not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards Gods, and the Doctrine of Baptisms, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Perfection which was the end of those Baptisms was the thing they were to go on unto, as he exhorted; surely, then it was attainable; for the Apostles exhortation was in the Faith, and did not oppose Perfection, as T. D. erroniously hath done, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and led them forward out off and beyond the Shaddows and Figures unto the Substance, and preached to present men perfect in Christ.</p>
            <p>And whereas T. D. hath charged us yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>a great Error,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the Resurrection.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>which is, that there is no Resurrection from the Dead</hi>; and to prove us guilty hereof, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>a Letter of one R.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> How apparently T. D. hath belyed, slandered, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us, in accusing so positively <hi>that we hold there is no Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Dead,</hi> is evident in many printed Books of ours; and he hath neither mentioned my words, nor <hi>G. F</hi>'s; I say his slander and false accusation herein against me in particular may be plainly detected out of that very Book of my own, wherein Pag. 67. I have expressed these very words; <hi>But the Resurrection according to the Scriptures of Truth, and Testimonies of Christ and the Apostles we do believe and own, as Recorded in John</hi> 5.21, 24, 25, 28, 29. and Chap. 11.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.30, 31, 32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34, 35, 36, 37, 38. and so on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Many other places might be cited.</hi> These very words and Scriptures are thus set down in my Answer to <hi>William Burnet,</hi> after which are some passages of a Dispute I had upon the same subject with that busie (yet sorry) Contender <hi>Matthew Caffin</hi> the Baptist; whose impertinencies and ignorance at the Dispute was fully manifested, as others of his Brethrens have been when they have appeared in the same unprofitable work against us.</p>
            <p>And as concerning what <hi>G. F.</hi> the younger saith (in his Books collected) clears him also from <hi>T. Danson</hi>'s impudent slander of holding <hi>there is no Resurrection from the Dead</hi>; for <hi>G. F.</hi> affirmeth the contrary in pag. 209, 210. in these very words,
<q>Touching the

            <head>Some Observations upon <hi>John Owen's</hi> Book, [Entituled, <hi>A Declaration, &amp;c.</hi>] including a brief Answer and Reply to the same.</head>
            <p>AS We the People of God, called Quakers, are but little concerned in <hi>John Owen</hi>'s Declaration, we need concern our selves the less; and let them that are chiefly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Accusations make him answer. But in that he hath in some few <hi>places</hi> hinted, and falsly insinuated against us as being one with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> (as he calls them) or seduced into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism: Lest any should give credit to these and such like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations, and thereby be prejudiced against us, or the Truth professed by us, meerly upon <hi>John Owen</hi>'s overly Reports, I judge it meet a little to appear in Truth's Vindication, and our <hi>clearness</hi> in answer to some particulars in his Book.</p>
            <p>As first, where in his Preface Pag. 6. he saith, <hi>There is now a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible accession made by that sort of People whom men will call Quakers, from their department from the first erection of their Way long since desertted by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We have not made any accession contrary to the Truth first received by us; nor have we deserted its Way, which so long since the Lord God by his Power gathered us into out of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wayes, Inventions, Traditions, and false Worships of the World, to worship him in the Spirit and in the Truth, wherein we have been gathered to be a peculiar people to God, being delivered from the many Sects, Wayes, and Professions set up since the dayes of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Socinianism,</hi> as he calls it, we are neither Discipled in it, nor Baptized into <hi>Socinus</hi> his name, neither do we own him for our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58882:78"/>
Author or Patern in those things which we Believe and Testifie; nor yet do we own several Principles which <hi>John Owen</hi> relates, as being from <hi>Socinus,</hi> and principally that of <hi>Christ's being</hi> (God, but) <hi>not the Most High God,</hi> pag. 54, 55. It was never our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; for though we do confess to his condescention, humility and Suffering in the dayes of his Flesh, wherein he appeared in the form of a Servant, being made in fashion as a man; but his being in the form of God, in the Divine Nature of God, wherein he was equal with God, and being glorified with the same glory he had with the Father before the World began, and his being God over all blessed for ever; these things we professed and believed in the beginning, and do the same still, it never being in our hearts, in the least, to oppose or desert them; therefore, as to the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on J.

            </p>
            <p>Herein he hath charged a double falshood upon us; first, such a Conjunction and Opposition either to the Person or Grace of Christ which we absolutely deny; neither is our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of mens corrupt meanings of Scripture and invented names and terms put upon the Deity any opposition either against God, Christ, or Spirit, nor yet against the Grace or Love of either.</p>
            <p>J. O. Pag. 6. <hi>However they may seem in sundry things as yet to look divers wayes, yet like</hi> Sampson<hi>'s Foxes, they are knit together by the tayl in these firebrand Opinions, and joyntly endeavour to consume the standing Corn of the Church of God, and their joynt management of their business of late, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I suppose he intends <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> wherein both his Accusation and Comparison are false and scornfull, for there's no such conjunction, nor joynt endeavours between them; neither ever was it the <hi>Quakers</hi> intent or principle, in the least, to endeavour to consume the standing Corn of God's Church, (as we injuriously are accused) but such vain and false imaginations, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perverting Scripture, as J. O. and his Brethren are guilty of, which have no growth nor reception in the Church of God; for his Church is in him, and led by his Spirit into all Truth, which no Lye nor Deceit have any part in. Besides, as for <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Foxes, they were not set to destroy the Corn of the Church or <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:58882:79"/>
but of the <hi>Philistines</hi>; neither can we believe that the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> are the true Church, till we see better Fruit appear among them then is yet: for look into their Assemblies, and see what pride and vanity they are gotten into in their apparel; behold also, how gaudy in their habits their women are; and what an example of pride and pomp they shew to the profane, to the shame of their profession; certainly God hath yet Viols of Wrath unemptied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pour down upon that proud and persecuting Spirit, which hath so much shewed it self in many of them.</p>
            <p>But what he <hi>means by those words holy Trinity,</hi> he further explains <hi>in pag.</hi> 26, 27. in these words, viz. <hi>Now the sum of the Revelation in these terms, is, that God is one, that this one God is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that the Father is the Father of the Son, and the Son the Son of the Father; and the Holy Ghost the Spirt of the Father and and the Son</hi>: Now had this Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> and his Brethren but kept to these, and such like expressions, and have left out their unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural scholastick terms and distinctions about Trinity, <hi>distinct Subsistances</hi> and <hi>Personalities,</hi> we should not need to have had such controversies with any of them about them, but have taken their confession that God is one, and that Father Son and holy Ghost are God; and that <hi>the Father is Father of the Son, and the Son the Son of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> according to this great Doctors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who pretends very much to Scripture, and makes many large Repetitions of Scripture to prove his matter, counting them the Revelation; but then being again not willing to keep to the terms, expressions and phrases of Scripture, but writes his own conceivings, sences and meanings, as men of his Coat and Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity use to do; as in Pag. 31. he pleads for making use of <hi>other words expressions and phrases, that neither are litterally nor formally contained in Scripture,</hi> and so makes use of his conceptions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of what is contained therein, see pag. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then again another while</hi> he saith, <hi>Let us nakedly attend to what the Scripture asserts,</hi> as in pag. 42. And in pag. 110. he tells us of <hi>manifesting what was revealed expresly in Scripture concerning God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi>; so that many times he would make people believe, as if he would nakedly and, exactly keep to the Scriptures; but then at other times his notions, conceptions, meanings, and odd invented terms must be put upon them, and

men must either confess to those, or else <hi>be liable</hi> to his and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns censures of being <hi>Socinians, Hereticks, Blasphemers,</hi> and what not? And though he hath appeared a little smother then his Brother <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi> hath done in his railing Pamphlet, yet he hath wronged us by his false insinuations against us, as if we denied the Diuinity of Christ, and deserted our former Principles; also he hath represented us as being in conjunction with those whom he accuseth of opposing or denying the oneness of the Deity, and the Grace of Christ, or the Father, Son, and holy Ghost to be God, which we are not at all concerned in, nor guilty of; and our Books and Writings now, and from the very beginning evince the contrary.</p>
            <p>But then in Pag. 129. he confesseth, <hi>That the objections these men principally insist upon, are meerly against the explanations we use of this Doctrine, and not against the primitive Revelation of it, which is the principal object of our Faith &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if by <hi>these men</hi> he intends us, called Quakers, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he doth by his present discouse, he hath then very much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from other of his and his Brethrens Accusations, and thereby hath also plainly contradicted both himself and them; for here our objections are meerly against their explanations, and not against the primitive Revelation or principal object of Faith; so whilst the Revelation which is according to the Scriptures, and the principal object of Faith is not objected against, but owned and professed by us according to the Scripture, it is very unjust and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious either in him or his Brethren to insinuate against us, as if we denied either the Divinity of Christ or the holy Spirit; though as to their distinctions about <hi>Personalities, Subsistances, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallities,</hi> and the like invented terms and names which they put upon the Deity we must needs except against as not scriptural, nor proceeding from any naked attention to what the Scripture asserts, (which <hi>J. O.</hi> doth but pretend to) but from mens conceptions and traditions which are upheld by the wisdom which this world teacheth, and not that which the Holy Ghost teacheth.</p>
            <p>And then in Pag. 89. he goes to accuse and vilifie us in these words; viz. <hi>Our Quakers for a long time hovered up and down like a swarm of Flyes, with a confused noise and huming,</hi> (what falshood and scorn is here for such a Doctor to express) <hi>begin now to settle in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58882:80"/>
Opinions lately by them declared for</hi>; (this is a false insinuation again) <hi>what their thoughts will fall to be concerning the holy Ghost when they shall be contented to speak intelligeably and according to the usage of other men, or the pattern of Scripture, the great rule of speaking or treating about spiritual things, I know not, and I am uncertain whether they do themselves or no.</hi> Thus far <hi>J. Owen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I say, in the first of these expressions he hath scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and falsly accused us, as also with beginning now to settle in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for we are neither so beginning, nor so to begin, but are set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Truth out of and above mens invented Opinions, about which are so many Divisions and Sects among them; but if by <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> he intends <hi>Socinianism,</hi> (as he calls and represents it) his own testimony shall testifie against him as a false Accuser of us herein, as in pag. 129. where he confesseth our objections to be meerly against the explanation they use, and not against the primitive Revelation of it; so then we are not guilty of such Opinions, as either deny the Divinity of Christ, or that tends to lessen him in any respect or offices relating to man's Salvation; for our desire is, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour hath been the exaltation of his Name, Power and Glory over all; neither have we been hovering, nor in confusion, as falsly he hath represented us; and if he knows not what our thoughts will fall into concerning the Holy Ghost, but is uncertain whether we do our selves or no, he should therefore have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of accusing or reviling us, as he hath done, because it appears it is in his ignorance and uncertainty that he hath thus vilified us, and insinuated against us; he should have received a better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and knowledge of us before he had thus reviled us; and not to have gone and bespattered and vilified a whole Body of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to render them odious from his own uncertain thoughts of them; for he would not be so dealt by himself: and the Reader may take notice that a great part of his Book, (wherein he goes about to prove the Divinity or Deity of Christ and the Holy Ghost) in which he appears as one opposing some great Enemies, (among whom we are numbred) we are unconcerned therein, having never denied Christ's Divinity; and if his own testimony may be of any value, we are cleared by it (as before) in pag. 129. Alas! poor man, <hi>J. 0.</hi> has missed his mark in shooting thus uncertainly, and at random against the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58882:80"/>And where he adds touching the Holy Ghost, <hi>Whether he may be the Light within them, or an infallible</hi> afflatus, <hi>is uncertain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it be uncertain to <hi>J. O.</hi> it is certain to us that have the Testimony and evidence of the holy Spirit in us, which gives us both Life, Light and Power, and we know him to be infallible, how deridingly soever he speaks of it, as also according to the precious Promises of God which hereby we know in a large measure the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of; we experience Christ to be in us, and in that the Father <hi>Word and Spirit</hi> are confessed to be one Power, Wisdom and Love, and to be of one <hi>Divine Substance, Nature and Essence</hi>; this we neither do nor ever did deny: and God is in his People, and dwels in them, and walks in them, and the Spirit is sent into our hearts; so they are not divided, distinct and separate persons, &amp;c. <hi>as may be read in</hi> John 17.21, <hi>to the end, where Christ said, that they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou hast sent me; and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, &amp;c. And God said, Let us make man in our own Image after our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Gen. 1, 26. Now, if by <hi>us,</hi> here is intended Father, <hi>Son and Holy Ghost</hi> (which is called <hi>Trinity</hi>) then it follows that he was made in the likeness of all three, and yet we do not read that God did consist in three distinct Persons, nor that man was made in the Image of three Persons, nor yet that three distinct and separate persons dwelt in him, though God did promise after the Fall to dwell in his people: and he and his Son and Spirit we do really own, confess to, and have a living sence and experience of to our Souls Comfort and everlasting peace; So when we cannot well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nor accept of mens invented terms put upon the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, it is unreasonable and injurious to accuse us with opposing any of them, or denying their Divinity, and the Unity of the Deity.</p>
            <p>And where <hi>John Owen</hi> in pag. 91, 92. to prove the Holy Ghost a <hi>Person, and an existing Substance,</hi> which he calls also a <hi>distinct and divine Person,</hi> he quotes many Scriptures, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters; <hi>Psalm</hi> 33.6. by the Word of the Lord the Heavens were made, and all the Host of them by the Spirit of his Mouth; these, with many he urgeth for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58882:81"/>
proof of the Personallity of the Holy Ghost. So <hi>according to his</hi> Principle and terms which he puts upon the Holy Ghost (as a <hi>distinct Person, &amp;c.</hi>) and according to <hi>J. O</hi>'s meaning we must read the Scripture thus, the [<hi>Person</hi>] of God moved upon the face of the Waters: By the [<hi>Person</hi>] of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Host of them by the [<hi>Person</hi>] of his mouth: and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. by his [<hi>Person</hi>] he hath garnished the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and in like manner upon the rest of the Scriptures he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this case: Now let the Reader judge whether such a meaning &amp; alteration put upon the Scriptures doth either look clear, or sound well; and whether it be not a corrupting Scripture, and addition, contrary to the plain innocent Language thereof; and if such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and alteration upon Scripture may be admitted of, how are they the <hi>only Rule,</hi> or <hi>great Rule</hi> of speaking and treating about spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things? <hi>J. Owen</hi> and his Brethen had better refer people to the Scriptures, and leave them to a naked attention to what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture asserts, rather then thus to pervert them, or puzle and darken peoples minds with their humane inventions, and Scholastick terms imposed in the time of Apostacy and Popery.</p>
            <p>And concerning the Son of God, and some accounting him the Light within men; this <hi>J. O.</hi> numbers among the <hi>monstrous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> pag. 87.</p>
            <p>Wherein he hath not only struck at us who testifie to Christ, as the Light of the World, that lighteth every man, and as being in the true Believers both their Light, Life and Salvation; but also <hi>J. O.</hi> hath herein opposed both the former Saints and Scriptures of Truth, who testified unto Christ the Light as we do; as also he owned himself, <hi>to be come a light into the World, and to be in his Followers, He that is with you shall be in you; I in them and they in me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 103. J.O. queries <hi>how can the Power of God, or a quality be said to be sent, to be given, to be bestowed on men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, very well it may be so said, Christ gave them power to become the Sons of God, who believed on his Name; and was not this God's Power? had Christ any thing but what was Gods? and the Saints knew the Power of God to work mightily in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that this Doctor hath shewed himself very ignorant of the Power of God, and its work, which doth beget and restore man into the Image, Righteousness and true Holiness of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58882:81"/>
God, and this is given and bestowed on such as believe in the Light within, the Light of the Divine Power of God, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto us all things appertaining to Life and Godliness.</p>
            <p>And now touching their distinctions of Persons or Personal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances in God, <hi>J. O.</hi> saith pag. 114. <hi>The distinct apprehension of them, and their accurate expression is not necessary unto Faith, as it is our Guide, &amp;c. nor are those brief explanations before mentioned so proposed as to be placed immediately in the same rank or order with the original Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If they be not necessary unto Faith, nor yet to be placed in the order with Revelations, (meaning Scripture) why then are these men so strict in going about to impose their terms, expressions and explications which they have not in the Scripture upon peoples Faith and Conscience, as if it were a matter of damnation not to receive a Faith concerning God under their traditional notions and terms: However we believe what the Scriptures saith both of God, Christ and holy Spirit, who are one; laying aside all these mens invented confused amusing Sophistry, Cavils, and their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning terms (as <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>separate Personallities, Substances, Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, Modallities, &amp;c.</hi> of which they themselves are guilty, though <hi>J. O.</hi> accuseth others therewith pag. 116.</p>
            <p>And whilst these pretended accurate expressions are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto Faith, why doth J. O. press them as <hi>proper expressions of what is revealed to encrease our light?</hi> pag. 115.</p>
            <p>What apparent contradiction is this; not necessary unto Faith, as our Guide, and yet proper to encrease our light, as if the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of light had not a necessary relation unto both Faith as Guide and Principle, both in and unto religious worship; but to be sure that instead of encreasing light, their dark invented scholastick Heathenish and Popish terms have encreased much darkness in the minds of people, and kept many in great ignorance both of God and the mystery of godliness.</p>
            <p>And whereas J. O. gives order or instruction, <hi>that they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or oppose their explications, are to be required positively to deny or disapprove the oneness of the Deity, or to prove that the Father, or Son, or Holy Ghost are not God, before they be allowed to speak one word against the manner of the explication,</hi> pag. 115.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A very unreasonable imposition and requiring, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58882:82"/>
any to deny the oneness of the Deity, or to prove the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son or Holy Ghost not to be God, because they may except against such invented explications as J. O. and his Brethren have brought out of their Heathenish Store-houses, and Chambers of Imaginary; and hath not he herein imposed upon the Objecters? and begged the question, taking it as granted that their explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as true as the oneness of the Deity, or as true as that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and Holy Ghost are God; as if he had told us it is all one, as true that they are <hi>distinct severed Persons,</hi> as it is that they are God; which it is not: we have not ground to believe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications herein to be equal; for the Unity of the Godhead or Divinity of Christ (or his Spirit) we never denied nor scrupled; Therefore for J. O. to require any that except against their terms and inventions positively, to deny the Unity of the Deity, is both sad Doctrine and unreasonableness, as also shews an imperious lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirit; though its probable among the Independants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors he can make a shew of more humility then he did formerly; for he now wants <hi>Cromwel</hi> to promote him.</p>
            <p>However, he and others of his Fraternity might by this time have in reallity learned more lowliness and humility, then yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in them towards such as cannot be screwed up to their way and method of expressing the Invisible things of God, which are Heavenly, Divine and Spiritual, as his being and properties are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely above the comprehension of J. O's reason, as is confest pag. 128. <hi>We cannot by searching find out God, we cannot find out the Almighty to perfection</hi>: And yet vain man would be wise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his natural reason and fallen wisdom, both to find, and set out God, to evince him and his things unto the natural reason of others which still falls short both of any true knowledg and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual understanding; for vain by nature is every man, and ignorant of God. It is the spiritually minded who are begotten to God, who are spiritually and immediately taught by his Spirit, that have a true and spiritual understanding of Divine Matters and Mysteries.</p>
            <p>Pag. 118. J. O. <hi>Every person hath distinctly its own Substance,</hi> [But then in contradiction he adds] <hi>for the one Substance of the Deity is the Substance of each Person; but each Person hath not its own distinct Substance</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> A strange Riddle and invention, that each person hath
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58882:82"/>
distinctly its own Substance, and yet not its own distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; what Scripture hath he for this Critick and nice distinction? how is a person then an individual Substance of a rational nature, that is not upheld by another, if it hath not its own distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whilst yet it hath distinctly its own Substance? but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Substance of the Deity of the Father, the Word and Spirit is but one, as often hath been granted; so then the Holy Ghost, though confessed to be <hi>a Substance,</hi> pag. 101. yet; I say, not a Personal Substance distinct from the Father and the Son, as there is ignorantly asserted.</p>
            <p>But then J. O. to tell us pag. 118. <hi>That all Divine properties, such as to be infinite is, belong not to the Persons, on the account of their Personallity, but of their nature, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> Then it appears they are not three Infinite Persons, but one Infinite God; and yet those Persons are the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost; were it not both Blasphemy and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to say they are finite; and what better have our Opposers said? but at other times they are Eternal; God Eternal, the Eternal Son and Eternal Spirit; and thus they wheel about, and say and unsay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It were better for them nakedly to apply themselves to the plain Language of Scripture, and keep to it, to lay aside and avoid confusion, and absurdities about distinct finite perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallities, which the Scripture does not put upon the Infinite God, in whom there is neither finiteness nor variableness. I am God, I change not, saith he; the Lord is one, and his name one; from Everlasting to Everlasting he is God unchangable. And the Father Son and Holy Ghost being one Divine Infinite Substance, are one Infinite God. Away with your vain babling, and invented erroneous distinctions of finite Persons in him who is infinite; you are not worthy therein to talk of God, nor to take his holy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and pure Name in your mouthes, who are in your sins and pollutions, corrupting your selves in your carnal conceptions and imaginations about those things that you know not; who are gone a whoring after humane inventions, invented words, names, terms and distinctions, such as neither the Holy Ghost, nor the Scriptures ever taught you.</p>
            <p>Pag. 117. And as for them that will keep to their <hi>Cavils</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58882:83"/>
               <hi>Sophisms</hi> about terms and expressions; I know not who <hi>J. O.</hi> may intend hereby; but if he intend us, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> because we do not own, but oppose his and their dark unscriptural terms and expressions, which darken both counsel and knowledge, we do reject his Accusation and Charge herein, for Cavils and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms are rather his and his Brethrens, who have been trained up in Sophistry and School-craft, in order to be furnished to a Trade of Preaching, to make a Trade of the Scriptures, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by their dark meanings, and School-terms, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick distinctions, by which poor people have been kept even learning, that they might be always paying them.</p>
            <p>Pag. 117. But then <hi>J. O.</hi> addeth against such as he supposeth will keep to their Cavils and Sophisms, <hi>That all further debate or conference with them, may justly, and ought both conscientiously and rationally to be refused and rejected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> If herein he may intend us, as its probably he may, as well as others among whom he has numbred us (though unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously) as his debating or conference is of little value or esteem with us, whilst it proceeds neither from a sence of God's Divine Power, nor from any Living experience of God, or his work within, but from humane inventions and traditions: So J. O. and his Brethrens work in these matters, whether they go on in it, or stop from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debate, it will be of very little weight to us, since we see to the far end of their subtilty, and beyond their spirits and confusion; however, J. O. laying it as their duty not to debate any further with such as he censures, (as before) he hath brought himself, and those that own him under a Law and Limitation, that if they further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with us, they must either not accuse us with Cavils and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms, or else not debate nor contend any further with us; for if they do so accuse and censure us, and yet further debate or contend with us, they transgress their own Law, so strictly here urged by J.O. and by the same reason, when he and they are found guilty of Cavils and Sophisms, may not others as much slight him and them therein? But however he or they judge or censure us, I hope we shall not be backward nor negligent to vindicate the Truth, and clear our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency from reproaches and scandals of men of perverse and envious spirits, when we have occasion given us thereby.</p>
            <p>J. O. <hi>These sacred Mysteries of God and the Gospel, are not lightly to be made the subject of mens contest and disputations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:58882:83"/>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> It is very true, that sacred Mysteries of God and Gospel are not lightly, nor yet slightly to be made subjects of contests, nor yet ought they to be medled with by light airy minds, nor by perverse and prejudiced spirits, which are apt to bring forth perverse disputes, as it is too common to men of corrupt minds, who are destitute of the Truth: But why then do <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Teachers give such occasion by their light and vain contests, confusions and contradictions to stir up the minds of people into such disputations about things which both they themselves are yet to seek in, and by which they do the more darken the Enquirers? J.O. should seriously review and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his Bro. <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>T. Danson</hi> their contests in their late Pamphlets, and see how lightly and sorrily they have contended, and how they have contradicted themselves; and whether such as they be fit Champions in the management of their Cause? it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to pause upon their work, and examine it, and compare their Books together, for they have very palpably contradicted one another in divers passages of principle concernment; and if several of them write Pamphlets again against the Quakers, they had need to compare them very diligently, for otherwise, in all probability, they will contradict one another; as they have done, as is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Babel</hi>'s Builders so to do.</p>
            <p>Pag. 150. J. O. <hi>For the term of Satisfaction, the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the word it self defends on some notions of Law, that as yet we need not take into consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It appears J. O. and his Brethren's understanding of their Doctrine herein depends on notions of Law not yet taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and not on any living experience of the Gospel of Gods Divine Power wherein the Righteousness of Faith is revealed, and the living and blessed effect of Christ's suffering and death; and here they bring us their notions instead of Gospel, so that what they tell us in this matter it is not from a saving knowledge or sence of the work of God in themselves, but notions received by tradition from one another, though they intermix many Scriptures among their notions, and therefore would have all go for Gospel that they divulge; but who knows the Power of God within, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Christ's Sufferings will own the Scriptures of Truth as we do, and not relie upon their uncertain notions, about which so much of their confusion and contradiction amongst themselves doth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58882:84"/>
appear, that little of their work can certainly be laid hold on, as with any confidence of their stability; howbeit, J. O. has in several things consented to the Truth in words which we do own, though we do not believe that he or his Brethren do experience the Life and Power of what they profess, as where J. O. Confesseth,</p>
            <p>That God out of his infinite Goodness, Grace and Love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind sent his only Son to save and deliver them; viz. from their sins,<note place="margin">Pag. 156, 157, and 160.</note> and that this Love was the same in the Father and Son; and that Christ gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. And gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. And to finish Transgression, and to make an end of Sin; to make Reconciliation, to bring in Everlasting Righteousness,<note place="margin">Pag. 163. and 176.</note> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. And that God had provided himself a Lamb for a Sacrifice; And God doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Sins freely, without requiring Faith, Repentance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them that are pardoned; and it is certain that the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of Faith and Repentance in and unto Sinners antecedently to their participation of it, &amp;c. We are to be discharged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods terms,<note place="margin">Pag. 178. and 180.</note> and under a new obligation unto his Love, &amp;c. Thus far J.O.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> In all which observe that J. O. has confessed unto the Truth, much more then some of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>For first, to the infinite Goodness of God, and his Love the same in Father and Son, which declares the freeness of both towards man kind, and their union therein for mans deliverance from Sin, Death and the Curse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God sending his Son, was to save and deliver from Sin, to redeem us from all Iniquity: Its well if J. O. truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves what he sayes herein; for his Brethren <hi>T. V.</hi> and <hi>T. D.</hi> have pleaded the contrary in their contending for Sin and Imperfection in all Believers term of Life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christ giving himself a ransom for all, to be testified of in due time; instead of <hi>For All, Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> were wont to say, it was but for a few that he died, only for a certain select number, wherein they have denied the universal Love and Grace of God in Christ to mankind.</p>

O. that God cannot lye, he cannot deny himself, &amp;c. to prove that he cannot freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don sin, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 178. <hi>as if the one were as much contrary to his nature as the other, and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Faith and Repentance (which are his gifts) he doth pardon his Creature man. Note also that J. O. to the Reader saith of his Authors, that many of them do expressly blame some of the School-men, as</hi> Aquinus Durandus Biel Tartare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, <hi>for granting a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of pardon without sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as opening a way to the</hi> Socinian <hi>error; See here J. O's Authors, &amp; great able learned defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, how they censure and contradict one another, yet he would have men be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how they censure them notwithstanding.</hi>
               </note> Fourthly, His coming to finish Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, to make an end of Sins, and to bring in Everlasting Righteousness, is both beyond and contradicts their sinfull Doctrine for sin and imperfection, and their notion of imputation of Christ's Righteousness to sinfull persons, whilst they are not at all really partakers of Christ's Righteousness, Holiness or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them, no more then Christ was guilty of sin, when he knew no sin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>T. D</hi>'s instance and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Argument, for a proportion in that case.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And seeing that without Faith, Repentance and Obedience on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's part, God doth not pardon sins freely, it appears it is not peoples bare application and belief of what Christ hath done and suffered for them that will free and acquit them, without the knowledge and sence of his Power which works li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith and Repentance, and makes willing to obey the pure Law of God in the heart, and the new Covenant in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts; for as <hi>J. O.</hi> confesseth, it would altogether unbecome the holy God to pardon Sinners that continue so to live and die in their sins, pag. 179. this is a truth which he and his Brethren had need to look to, that they be not found guilty both in Principle and in Practice, as namely both contending and preaching up a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in sin and imperfection all their dayes, as <hi>T. D.</hi> and <hi>T. V.</hi> hath done; and as its said by many, some of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Teachers do more of late revile the <hi>Quakers</hi> for holding Perfection and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Sin attainable in this life, and to perswade people against the belief of such a state more then they have done heretofore; wherein they work, as if they would hasten people to Hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58882:85"/>
and do but strengthen the hands of the Evil-Doers, that they may not forsake their sins, by promising them life, as the false Prophets did, and promising them pardon and peace on the account of all being fully paid and satisfied for them, they living and dying in sin, or telling them that perfection is not attainable till after death, as namely, till the Resurrection, as <hi>T. D.</hi> and others of them have affirmed; but they had little need to preach up such Doctrine, for their Hearers and Followers are prone and apt enough to run on in sin and transgression without their Leaders tutering them in it; they had not need to drive them on to Hell and Destruction; the Devil can lead them fast enough thither, who continue Sinners, to live and die in their sins, wherein it does not become the holy God to pardon them, as is confessed.</p>
            <p>And now touching your Explication, Declaration and Confession concerning the Terms and Conditions whereon Sinners may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the Satisfaction made by Christ; <hi>J. O.</hi> saith pag. 167. <hi>It may also be farther evinced that there is nothing asserted in them but what is excellently suited unto the common notions which mankind hath of God and his Righteousness, and that in their practice they answer the Light of Nature and common Reason exemplified in sundry instances among the Nations of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First it is to be observed that a great stress is laid upon these Explications, Declarations or Confessions of yours, as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the terms and interest you claim in Christ's Satisfaction unto the determination of God's Will and Confirmation of Divine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies according to J. O's words, wherein no less then Salvation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be concerned; for without an interest in Christ and his Righteousness men cannot be saved. Secondly, Your Assertions herein being suited unto the common notions of mankind, and as answering the Light of Nature and common Reason (as it is called, and as J. O's words are) whether herein hath he not rendred this Light and common Reason, together with the common notions mankind hath of God, to be of a saving property, since it so suits those things wherein Salvation is so deeply concerned, according to J. O. but then if he does not reckon mens common Notions, Light or Reason which is natural to be saving (as indeed we do not believe that any thing natural, as of man in the Fall can save) then may we not reasonablely look upon J.O. to have asserted and declared those
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58882:85"/>
things wherein Salvation is not concerned, or which we are not to look upon as answering that Light which is Spiritual and Saving, but only common Notions and natural Reason, whilst he and his Brethren keep not to plain Scripture Language, and but run into notions, terms distinctions, which they have by Tradition from men &amp; mens inventions, more suiting common and corrupt reason then Divine Light. But and if the Light in men be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine which manifests divine Revelations and Testimonies relating to Salvation, (such as J. O. would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his matter to be grounded on) then it follows, that such a light is common or universal in mankind, and not only given to a few, nor natural, as it hath been often rendred by such as J. O. <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Who with his Brethren were fully manifested and confuted by</hi> Sam. Fisher <hi>in his Book stiled</hi> Rusticus, <hi>&amp;c. never yet answered by them, nor like to be.</hi>
               </note> and what doth this spiritual or divine Light teach concerning God and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but that he is to be feared, obeyed and honoured, and that all sin and iniquity should be forsaken, and God's Righteousness, Power and Image (which is Christ Jesus) lived in, obeyed and followed by man; for herein is God well pleased and satisfied in beholding his own Image and birth renewed and brought forth, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not of sin nor imperfection, much less of either plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contending, disputing or preaching for its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in all term of life; and this Light of Christ within (however any miscall it) is that which gives the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's Love in Christ, and of the vertue and efficacy of his Suffering, and so of his Blood, and to eat of his flesh which is given for the Life of the World, wherein we partake of him, as the one Offering, at the Altar of God in his Sanctuary, which the carnal Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and pretended Christians, were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58882:86"/>
and are ignorant of, and in this Light are we come to know and receive Christ, and reconciliation through his Death, and also the glory of God through him in whom we have received the Attonement, Peace and Union with the Father in the Son, which all you that either slight, oppose or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Light within, and say its but natural, are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, being but in your dark notions, natural apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and conceivings, which you intermix with Scripture, so that the Dignity, Glory, Power and Vertue that is, and ever was in Christ, you do but talk of, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sence, discerning or enjoyment thereof; but every one that truely waits upon the Living God in his Light and Life within, whereby their minds and spirits being subjected unto his Will, and their hearts truly broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, such know the Ransom and Attonement which the Righteous and redeemed of the Lord knew and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed in all Ages, and have that to offer unto God, and such Sacrifices to present before him, wherein he behold of his own glory and beauty, and savours of his own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is truly acceptable and well pleasing unto him, who delighteth in his own Image, Seed and Royal Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, which none truly know but who come into the Light to receive Christ the promised Seed, which bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Serpents head; and to eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, without which you have no Life in you, for all your talk and notions.</p>
            <p>Pag. 185. <hi>J. O. The Sacrifice denotes his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whence God is said to purchase his Church with his own Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>For he offered himself through the Eternal Spirit, there was the matter of the Sacrifice, which was the Humane Nature of Christ, Soul and Body; his Soul was made an Offering for Sin,</hi> Isa. 53.10. <hi>his Death had the nature of a Sacrifice, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> These Passages are but darkly and confusedly expressed, as also we do not read in Scripture, that the Blood of God by which he purchased his Church, is ever called the Blood of the Humane Nature, nor that the Soul of Christ was the Humane Nature, or was put to death with the Body (for the wicked could not kill the Soul) though his Soul was made an Offering for sin, and he poured it out to death, (he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for Transgressors) but what death (and in what manner) was it is a mystery truly to know; for his Soul in his own being was Immortal, and the Nature of God is Divine, and therefore that the Blood of God should be of Humane (or earthly) nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears inconsistent; and where doth the Scripture call the Blood of God Humane, or Humane Nature? Neither do we read that the Blood which beareth record in the Earth, and agrees in one with the Spirit (and which purgeth the Conscience, washeth and cleanseth the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the Light from all sin) was ever called by the Apostles the blood of the Humane Nature; nor do we read that the Saints did eat and drink Flesh and Blood that was of a Humane Nature to receive Divine Life in them thereby; for the Water of Life, and Blood of Christ which are said to wash, sanctifie and justifie, which agree in one with the Spirit, in those works and effects, we never read that they are called in Scripture by the name of <hi>Humane Nature</hi>; for the Spirit that quickens is divine; and it is the Spirit that gives Life, the Flesh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, <hi>John</hi> 6. And the Soul of Christ is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and did not die with the Body, though its deemed as being of the Humane Nature with the Body, and so as of the Sacrifice in Suffering and Death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, though his Soul was made an Offering for sin, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58882:87"/>
offered himself through the Eternal Spirit, yet his Soul or Spirit did not die <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>For it was committed into the hands of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was that day in Paradice.</hi>

O. hath ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly made no distinction, but joyns both as being but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, (which was Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to death) but yet its evident, that though his Soul and Spirit did not die with the Body, yet his Soul was offered for sin, for the sins of men were laid upon him, or did meet on him, as is frequently confessed; and so he suffered, and his Soul travelled under the burthen of them, so that his Sufferings were twofold, both inward and outward; and which were the greater, suppose ye, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors? <note n="‖" place="margin">

in them: And Christ being touched with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Infirmities, was able to relieve them that were tempted; and as <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. You that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your minds through wicked works; yet now hath he reconciled in the Body of his Flesh through death, to present you holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and unreproveable in his sight, if you continue in the Faith grounded and setled, and be not moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard, which is preached to every Creature which is under Heaven, whereof I <hi>Paul</hi> am made a Minister, who now rejoyce in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his Body sake, which is the Church, verse 21, 22, 23, 24. where mark, that the reconciled state was not that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in their minds, and the end of this reconciliation through his Death, was to present them holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and unreproveable in his sight, which does not admit of sin and imperfection term of life, nor yet of Professors arguing or pleading for sin as they do; and was there any of Christ's afflictions or sufferings then to be filled up in the Apostle for the sake of his Church? how do Professors resent this Doctrine? and what meaning will they give to it? can they say that Christ's suffering was all at an end or fulfilled at once whilest yet some was behind, to be filled up in his Saints, and that for his Churches sake? although still he was the one Offering, Ransom, and Sacrifice for sin, and was offered once for all, as both being opposed to, and ending the many Offerings under the Law, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating a new and Living Way, and establishing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant of Life and Salvation; as also that in what he did and suffered, be set us an Example, bare

            <p>Neither would we have any unreverent and slighty Contests entertained on any hand about the Sufferings, Afflictions and Death of Christ, in the least, to lessen or undervalue them; nor yet ought you to meddle and tamper about either God, Christ, or Holy Spirit, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Suffering and Sacrifice of Christ with your pitifull sorry confused School-terms and distinctions, and beggerly scraps of mens Traditions and Rudiments of the World, &amp;c. wherein you have laboured more to fill your heads with airy notions, invented words, and brain knowledge, rather then your hearts and souls with a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge, and experimental sence and feeling of the Life and Power of Godliness, or of the Vertue and Efficacy of Christ Jesus, and his Reconciliation as the one Offering and Sacrifice which puts away sin, and whose Blood both remits and clenseth from all iniquity: But to evade these blessed Effects, which are only known to them that walk in the Light, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. many of you Professors have found out a very easie way and notion of all being fully satisfied and payed for you, both for sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> past, present, and to come, and of all being suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perfectly obeyed for you by Christ in your stead; (though you deny his dying and being a Propitiation for all men in the whole World) so that you can plead and wrangle for sin, imperfection and body of sin all your life, and say Christ hath fully payed all, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed for you; as also you can easily evade or

That it is to be meant, Christ must be perfect for us, he is to be only the subject of all those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands enjoyning perfect Obedience, Righteousness, and Holiness, and not we, which is as absurd, and all one as to say, That when God Commands us by his Grace not to sin, but to be perfect, (or perfectly to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live godly, soberly, &amp;c.) — That he all this while intends his Son Jesus Christ as the subject of these Commands; And whereas he never said, <hi>Son Jesus Christ, Do not thou sin, be not thou ungodly, do thou deny worldly lusts, live thou godly, soberly, be thou perfect for all, and it shall satisfie me fully, instead of Perfection or Righteousness in men, seeing none can be perfect or free from sin in this life, &amp;c.</hi> But this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Course, is the current, tenour, and intent of our Opposers Doctrine; And yet they must confess, That Christ never sinned, nor could sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth; so their presenting him only as the subject of perfect Obedience, and not Men, or Believers; is all one as to say, That all those Commands directed to us for that end, was only intended to Christ; for <hi>T.D.</hi> construes his Satisfaction and Payment [in men's stead] to consist in both Doing and Suffering, <hi>viz.</hi> Both in Christ's Obedience and Subjection to the Law, and God's Precepts; as also to its <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Curses,</hi> pag. 19, 20.

where was there a third Person substituted to pacifie the Anger of both?

               <q>We are to consider that these very Persons assert, That Christ paid all for us, and in our name and stead; so that the payment by Christ was by a substitution in our room; and if he paid the same which the Law required, the benefit must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly acrue to those in whose Name the Debt was paid; for what was done in the Name of another, is all one to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as if it had been done by the Debtor himself; But above all things, it is impossible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the freeness of Remission, with the full Payment, &amp;c. — Neither will it serve to say, <hi>That though it was not free to Christ, yet it was to us:</hi> for the Satisfaction and Remission must respect the same person, for Christ did not pay for himself, but for us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Remission be to him, &amp;c. — It is impossible the same Debt should be fully paid, and freely forgiven; much less will it avoid the difficulty in this case to say, <hi>That</hi>

Thus when our Adversaries Dispute against this Opinion, no wonder if they do it succesfully; but this whole Opinion is built upon a Mistake, That Satisfaction must be the payment of the very same; which while they contend for, they give our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries too great an advantage, and make them think they triumph over the Faith of the Church, when they do it only over the mistake of some perticular Persons, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>It is lawful for a man to forgive all the Debts which are owing him, — althoug they assert, <hi>That the Justice of God doth never require Punishment in case of Repentance</hi>; but withal they assert, <hi>That in case of Impenitency, it is not only agreeable, but due to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and decrees, and therefore to the rectitude and equity of God not to give Pardon:</hi> If this be true, then there is an apparent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the notion of Debts and Punishments, &amp;c. </p>

            <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>The sum of the <hi>Controversie</hi> between us and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Opposers, consists in these following Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st. FIrst, I Affirm, That their distinguishing the Deity, or God-head into Three separate (or finite) Personalities, and to reckon the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost not Infinite, is Anti-scriptural, Erroneous, and Blasphemous.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That their Affirming Christ not to be Innocent but Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our sins when he Suffered (is Blasphemous) and so their deeming, that the Suffering he underwent, was the same Revenge or Vengeance from God (which they term <hi>Vindictive Justice</hi>) that's
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58882:99"/>
due to Wicked men, Reprobate Angels, and Devils (this is false also) and that upon that ground, their stating the matter of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Justice, as otherwise, It being impossible <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God to Pardon, &amp;c. All this is to charge God with Injustice and Cruelty against his Innocent Son, and is, in the first place, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous against Christ; and in the next, its Impious, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of both Father and Son.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Their Affirming Christ but to have died but for <hi>a few,</hi> and not for <hi>all men</hi>; and that his being a Propitiation, or Sacrifice, is but for <hi>some</hi> of all sorts (of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>) and not for the sins of the whole World, is contrary to plain Scripture, and repugnant to the free Grace and gift of God to <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Their Affirming, That Christ doth not enlighten every man with a spiritual saving Light, but with a natural insufficient Light; is an Erroneous Doctrine of Darkness, and Antichrist, and repugnant both to Christ, and God's free Grace, and Love in him to Mankind.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Their Affirming Perfection, or freedom from sin, not to be attainable in this Life; and so their arguing for sin term of Life, is Antichristian, and of the Devil; being against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Promises of God, and against the Power and Coming of Christ, and frustrates the end of his Suffering, Sacrifice, and Manifestation.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Their Notion of Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, to impure, sinful, rebellious Persons, who are not partakers of it in themselves, nor yet in that Faith which purifies the heart; and thereupon their reckoning them Righteous in God's account, is a false Notion, and none of God's, nor Christ's Imputation; but as Gross, Erroneous, and Impious, as their imputing sin to Christ as not being Innocent when he Suffer'd, but Guilty, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. And their Affirming men to be Justified, or in a Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied state, by an Imputed Righteousness, whilst actually sinful and unjust; is as false, and as great abomination, as he that Justifieth the Wicked, and he that Condemneth the Just; or as they are that Condemn Christ as not being Innocent, and Justifie sinful men (or Hypocrites) as being Righteous, whose Faith is but emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, dead, and feigned.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58882:100"/>8thly. So their Affirming men to be Imputatively Righteous, when inherently and actually sinful; or Imputatively saved, when actually damned: And all their Doctrines that tend to dishonour God, or Christ, and to give People ease and liberty in sin, are to be denied as Erroneous, Antichristian, and Devillish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here in opposition to our Ridgid Opposers, both those of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> (concerned in these Doctrines) I further Affirm as followeth;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit (or the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) are <hi>One,</hi> and inseparable; no where in Scripture called Three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Persons, nor finite in Personalities; though three [in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation] and so testified of (as Three Witnesses) for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Testimony of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Christ was <hi>Innocent</hi> and not <hi>Guilty</hi> when he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (he was <hi>Just</hi> that Suffered for the <hi>Unjust</hi>) seeing he freely, in the Love of God to man, gave and offered himself, by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, a Lamb without spot to God; so that he was an <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well pleasing,</hi> a sweet smelling savour, and so a most acceptable and satisfactory <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God for <hi>all men.</hi>— It being also possible for God, and he doth Pardon men upon Repentance for Christ's sake, without either accounting Christ not Innocent or Guilty of men's sins, and without either exercising the same Rigour of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, Eternal Death, or Vengeance upon him, that's due to Reprobates and Devils: For it was in one and the same Love, mutual Condescention, and a Spirit of Compassion and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, both in the Father and in the Son, towards Mankind, that Christ was given a Ransom, or in which (as it's said) God sent his Son, and Christ gave himself, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58882:100"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Christ gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Ransom for <hi>all men,</hi> and by the Grace of God <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>His tasting Death, was not the Revenge that the Wicked have incurred; neither is Grace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
               </note> tasted Death for <hi>every man,</hi> being a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the sins of the whole World, to shew forth, and give Testimony of God's Love and Grace towards all Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Christ inlightens every man that cometh into the World, with a spiritual saving Light, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, and follow, do receive Life in him the true Light (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Darkness oppose or deny it) and they that reject, or hate his Light, are condemned, and left without excuse before the Lord by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Perfection and freedom from sin, is attainable in this Life to <hi>all</hi> that believe in the Power of Christ for that end, what ever the Devil and his Ministers say to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That while Persons are impure or sinful, not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing the Work of God in them, nor the Living Faith in it's Operation, nor Sanctification in them, God doth not impute Christ's Righteousness to them, nor reckon it theirs, they being out of it in the Unregenerate state, not come to know the Image of God renewed in them; for men are not imputedly Righteous when actually sinners (as impiously hath been Asserted) nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putedly saved, when actually damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more then imputatively Saints, while actually Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Neither doth God account men Justified, or reckon them Righteous, whilst they are really unjust, being reproved and judged as Unrighteous by his Light and Spirit in them; for God's accompts and reckonings are true and Righteous, and he Just and True in all his wayes, and his Judgments are Right, and he can no more therein Contradict his own Light, in Man, or it's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Testimony, than he can oppose or deny himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; and the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men; they that are (or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) actually sinful and polluted, are neither acquitted nor Righteous in God's account, but must bear their Iniquity, which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58882:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be their ruine, unless they Return and be reconciled in their minds to the Light of Christ within (which reproves them of sin and evil) and so except men Repent and forsake their sins, they shall surely perish; they that neglect the great Salvation, cannot escape Condemnation.— <hi>If I sin against thee, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine Iniquity,</hi> Job 10.14. Psal. 32. God imputes sin to none, but them in whom it is in being; so he imputes nor Righteousness to any, but them in whom it is; as the blessed man, to whom God imputeth not sin, &amp;c. in his Spirit there is no guile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> All that profess to be Ministers of the Gospel, and Teachers of others, ought to Preach or Teach nothing but what may make, or tend to the Glory of God, and Honour of Christ Jesus, in the Exaltation of Truth and Righteousness in the Earth, and all the Contrary (as all sin and sinful Doctrines, with all sin-pleasing and sinners-soothing Principles) to be abhorred, rejected, and opposed by all professing Christianity, that tender the Honour of Christ, and desire the Exaltation of his Kingdom, which stands in Righteousness.</p>
