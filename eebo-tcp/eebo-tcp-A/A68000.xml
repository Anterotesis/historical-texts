         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE preſent eſtate, that the realme of

            <p>And yet of the redreſſe of theſe calamities, ſo litle
hope is giuen, that nought els, but the terrors of farr
greater trobles, are daily ſounded in the eares of the af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flicted
people: which can be to no other end, then to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
it is to conſider, that the auoydance of ſuch great

ſoughte nor deſyred, by geuing that king ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

errors, when they are made manifeſt vnto them, by
which meanes many are confirmed in Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and ſome numbers brought from hereſy to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the truthe. which albeit the malice of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary

laboreth by all meanes poſsible, to make the cauſe

            <p>And becauſe all men can not without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration

            <p>In the which, albeit that euery fryuolous point

yet is the intention of the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tor thereof direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impugned, and the iuſt blame imputed where it
is iustly deſerued. It may therefore pleaſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
reader (laying a ſyde all partialitie) with an in
different eye, to behold the manifeſt truth, that ſhal (in
this treatiſe) be laid open vnto him, the which for his

            <p>Very probable it is, that the Queene, ſo ſhe
might haue enioyed the kingdome, could aſwell
haue bene contented to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued the faith
of her auncetours, as to be brought vnto her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
with ſolemne proceſsion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyke
clergie, and at a maſſe by a Catholike Biſhop
to be bothe crowned &amp; anointed: at what tyme,
ſhe vowed by othe to defend and maintayne
that Catholyke faith and religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1289:5"/>
point I do only here alleage, for proof of her mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
not to chaunge religion, wherein yf ſhe
had firmly remained, ſhe ſhould haue left vnto
the world a farr greater memorie of her giftes of
nature and educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But hauing once repoſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence
in this ſuggeſter, he ſhadowed his ſiniſter
practiſes vnder her aucthoritie, and lefte the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie
of his owne vniuſt actions, to redound
vnto her, and her eſtate. For this perſon, vnto
whoſe wylineſſe was ioyned a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who beeing by birth but of meane degree,
&amp; thereby denied to be ſet in equalitie, with the
nobilitie and peeres of the realme, for the better
ſatisfying of his inſatiable deſire of greatneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolued
that the beſt way for his aduancement,
muſt be by innouation, and that in no leſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then in points of faith, and religion, for that
by experience late before in the other Queenes
dayes, he could neither by the greatneſſe of his
beades, creeping to the croſſe, nor exterior ſhew
of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the highe altar, fynde his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
into highe dignitie, to be ſo ſpeedie as by
this meanes he deemed it. And therefore among
other his fraudulent reaſons, he ſiniſterly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
the Queene, that ſhe could not ſtand perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in her crowne and kingdome, vnleſſe ſhe
did condeſcend vnto the alteration of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and hereby he ſo farr abuſed the ſexe and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his Princeſſe, that the gate vnto all enſuiug
iniquitie was ſpedely opened. He then promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto authoritie one <hi>Nicolas Bacon,</hi> with
whome before he was lyncked in ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of affini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
vvho being alſo of meane birth, but of an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceding
craftie witt, was the more fit to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1289:6"/>
with himſelf in the menaging of the nevv
gouernement.</p>
            <p>I do not here deny, but that any man hovv
meane ſoeuer, may by iuſt prerogatiue obtaine
credit, &amp; honor, by his vertuous endeuours: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any honor be more due, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which
is atchiued by deſert. But how this perſon with
his compagnion haue vſurped their reputation,
their actions haue ſince manifeſted to all the
world, as hereafter ſhalbe ſhewed: eſpetially
in the ſuruiuer, being the beginer, proſecutor,
and continuer of the ruyne of England, and the
diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce almoſt of euery Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And he
that (as is ſaid before) was farr inferior to be mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched
in ranck, with the nobilite of the realme,
hath in a fewe yeares ſo ouermatched them al,
&amp; either by fained crimes cut them of, or by one
meanes or other, ſo maimed them of their due
honor and aucthoritie, that he hathe now made
himſelf <hi>Dictator perpetuꝰ.</hi> The Queene now being
broughte, to condeſcend vnto the chaunge of
the old religion, he broughte alſo the election of
the new, to lie in his owne choiſe: and neither fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowed
the doctrine of the Lutherans of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,
nor that of the Caluiniſts of <hi>Geneua,</hi> but
preſcribed a compoſition of his owne inuention.
Almoſt all the old Biſhops and clergie he thruſt
into priſon, and there conſumed them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the others in exile to end the reſt of their
dayes: and to ſupply their places, he ſhufled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the very rif raf, and refuſe of the world. A
wedded miniſtry he would haue (albeit the
Queene neuer lyked it) becauſe the fugitiue Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtataes
that were novv returned into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1289:6"/>
fitteſt for this nevv function, were for the moſt

the fleſh vnto the world, &amp; the deuill: &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to make vp tale, of this miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
multytude, were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp without partialitie,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tapſters, ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckers, &amp; ſuch depe diuynes, &amp; theſe
were ſent abrode to preache, &amp; ſtarve the cures
throughout the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie. Some veſtures of
the old clergie he left in the churches, whereby
the bearded miniſters, his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed apes, might
ſomuch the better imitate the outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Catholike prieſts: &amp; the more to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
this great conceit, of mutation in faith amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the people, and to make them wene, that the old
ſeruice was but turned out of Latin into Engliſh,
and ſome ceremonies only altered: the <hi>Goſpels,
Epiſtles,</hi> ꝑte of the <hi>Letany,</hi> &amp; the very <hi>Collects</hi> vſed
before at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> were ordayned by a booke of In
iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be daily red in the churches. The name
of this new profeſsion was borrowed from Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many,
for the profeſſors would be called Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
(a name vnknovvne vnto all our Catholike
auncetors, in all ages, ſince firſt they receyued
Chriſtianitie) but the chiefeſt ſubſtance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
was taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Geneua, whereunto the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſitor,
added of himſelf, an Eccleſiaſticall ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie
to the Queene, vvhich Iohn Caluine

Chriſtian, before king H. the eighte: nor neuer
atributed to any heathen potentate, except by
one only people of Perſia called the Aſaſynes: for
they in the yeare of our Lord 1253. admited
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1289:7"/>
their religion to depend wholy vpon the will
of their Prince.</p>
            <p>Thus was the proteſtanticall congregation of
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d created, &amp; erected, moſt repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the
old Catholike faith, participant of ſome newe he
reſies, and yet not conſonant to any one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
els: but different and diſagreeing from all
ſectes and religions, paſt &amp; preſent vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and what confuſion it hathe ſince declyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
in it ſelf, ſhal here after be declared. The apolo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie
of this Church was written in Latin, &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
into Engliſh by A.B. with the comendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. of
M.C. which twaine were ſiſters, &amp; wiues vnto
<hi>Cecill,</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> and gaue their aſsiſtance and
helping hands, in the plot and fortification of
this newe erected ſynagog.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſo ſtrange and extraordinarie a
doctrine, being in an <hi>antipathia</hi> to all, and in
vnitie with none, was vnlykely to haue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>durance:
eſpetially wanting ſuch deepe roote of
ſucceſsion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as hathe
theſe many hundred yeares preſerued in vigeur
one only entire faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and religion, againſt all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
ſchiſmes, &amp; diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions whatſoeuer, &amp; the
author fearing leaſt with the decay of this late
erected Churche, the creator with the creature
might fall: he then as impudently reiecting all
ſhewe of moral honeſty, as late before he had
don his hipocriticall cloke of deuotion, ſtudied
to put all countries in garbroiles round about
him. And for the effectuating of this his heroical
intention, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe the excercize of a newe
ſkill, &amp; that was alwaies to ꝑſwade the Queene,
that other princes ment to inuade her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1289:7"/>
when himſelf ment to drawe her to any
violent attempt againſt them. It is a world to ſee
how his experience hathe ſince encreaſed in this
practize, &amp; how well he hathe made this deuice
to extend, to the encreaſe of Englands enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with all the world: and how for his labor, he
hathe purchaſed among fooles the reputation of
wiſdome, albeit he hathe loſt among wiſemen
the eſteeme of honeſtie.</p>
            <p>The firſt proof of this deuice, to ſtirr vp tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
in other princes dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he put in practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ze
with Scotland the countrie next adioyning,
where-vpon ſone after folowed the warres of
<hi>Lythe,</hi> the ſucceſſe whereof, becauſe it fel not out
ſo well as to his purpoſe he wiſhed, himſelf
went thether to patche vp a peace, the which he
ſo well diſpoſed of, that they were neuer ſince out
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall warres. And for the better &amp; more
aſſured maintenance of diſcord, he hathe not
letted euer ſince, to hyre ſome principall perſons
for yearely wages, to nowriſh and continew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
quarrells, &amp; factions, by which meanes,
the treaſure of the realme hathe not only bene
infinitely waſted, but at ſundry tymes, diuers

               </gap>ether, conducted by the Earle of Suſſex and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whereof hathe enſued very great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of bloud of either nation, diuers horrible
murthers, the exyle of the Scottiſh Queene,
and the tranſpoſing of the realme, to the rule of
an infant, vnder the gouernment of a baſtard. But
what infortunate endes, this vſurper and ſundrie
others there ſett vp for regentes haue come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
is manifeſt to the world, and the great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1289:8"/>
that haue ſprong, throughe the ſeede of
diſſention firſt ſowen by this pacifier, haue not
ceaſed eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſlaughter of that queene, but
wil end the lyues of many before they be ended.</p>
            <p>Now, as one that of hatred vnto idleneſſe,
would rather chooſe to be occupied in iniquitie,
then to offend in ſlothe, in the meane whyle, that
theſe diſſentions were entretained in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that by the mariage of the French king
vnto the Scotiſh queene, their two realmes were
lynked together, and that the French king was
but an orphane, he neglected not his oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to bring France, to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in as good termes as
Scotland, &amp; therefore he ſent ouer Sir <hi>Nicolas
Throgmorto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to perſwade ſuch French vnto rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as he founde to be mutinous, &amp; diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented:
and for furtherance thereof, he promiſed them aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of mony, and munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The
vvhich promiſſe, was accordingly performed.
For M. <hi>Cecill</hi> ſeldome failed, to kepe his woord
in any ſuch couuenant, &amp; the ſeduced French, ſo
wel kept tutch on the other ſyde, that they proce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
vnto a very flatt rebellion, and ſo purchaſed
the nevv name of <hi>Huguenots.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hugeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> But this aſsiſtance
not being found ſufficient, the more to engage
the realme of England in that cauſe, the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
were wrought to deliuer vnto the Queenes
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, the tovvnes of <hi>Newhauen, Diepe,</hi> &amp; diuers
others: the accepta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whereof, ſome of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent
nobilitie of the realme (that yet remained of
the councel) vtterly miſliked, and aleaged, that it
was an ill preſident to aſsiſt the rebels of other
princes, leaſt the lyke might be offred vnto the
Queene: which conſiderate councell auailed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1289:8"/>
litle with him, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make this, no more but
an introduction to greater miſchieues. For <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan,
Pellam,</hi> and one <hi>Portinato,</hi> an Italian, were
ſent ouer to take the view of <hi>Newhauen,</hi> and theſe
returned with relation, that the Engliſh were
able with 2000. to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it againſt all the world:
and here upon the matter was reſolued, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding
all former alleagations: and forward it
went, but not without a vizard: for their was a
booke written in iuſtification of that action, to
ſignify to the world, that the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſh,
was but to kepe the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that towne
vntill the king came to age: as thoughe the
maſter of the wardes in England,<note place="margin">Cecill.</note> had had the
wardſhip of the French king alſo. And another
reaſon was, for that the other party (to wit the
princes and peeres of the realme, that were of
the kings councell) did meane to bring ſtrangers
into the countrie, from whome (of all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
they had great care to preſerue this towne:
whereupon a very difficill queſtion might be
moued, to wit, whether the Engliſh in thoſe dayes
were more naturall Frenchmen then other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers.
But leauing the reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this doubt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that there were ſent ouer vnto <hi>Newha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen</hi>
4000. men, which were but 2000. more then
were nedefull to withſtand all the world: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to remaine in prouiſion againſt <hi>Nouus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
which peraduenture might come againſt it al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo,
but how this tovvne was defended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
only, by the ſhame-full abandoning thereof it
did appeere. And this loſſe was not vnaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
with a greater euill, for the ſoldiers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
back againe into England, brought with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1289:9"/>
them ſuch a plague of peſtilence, as generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the moſt partes of the realme, and in
the citie of London, and the ſuburbes, there died
in 12. monethes, 20000. perſons. And the very <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guenotes</hi>
themſelues, abhorring the fraudule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linges
of the Engliſh, hauing obtayned a peace
and perdon of their king, became the very firſt,
that bent their forces to expulſe them, wherein
may be noted, with what firme amitie the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
&amp; French are vnited, in the diſcordant v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the new Goſpell. It is further to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued,
that the French king fynding the Engliſh
(whoſe name among the french people is ſo od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious)
to haue gotten footing in <hi>Normandie,</hi> to the
end that he might be deliuered of them in that
prouince, offred to deliuer the towne of <hi>Calis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſently
back againe, into the Queenes poſſeſsion:
The which he was not bound to do, vntill cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
yeares were expyred, &amp; this offer by the on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
perſwaſion of <hi>Cecill</hi> was refuſed, who told
the Queene, that ſhe might well kepe the one,
and recouer the other: but in fyne all was loſt.
For the Engliſh, as is alredy touched, diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blye
forſoke <hi>Normandie,</hi> &amp; the French hoſtages
that lay in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the rendring of Calis, were
priuily let go againe into Fraunce (and as it is
very probable) by the only deuice and woorking
of M. <hi>Cecill.</hi> The matter of Newhauen, being thus
begun with iniuſtice and ended with ſhame, the
authors practizes for the maintenance of the
French rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there withall ended not. But he
had gained the ſkill, better to contriue the execu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of his owne plots, vnder the aucthoritie of
the ſtate, and to be leaſt ſeene, in thoſe thinges,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1289:9"/>
that moſt he proſecuted. And there fore procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that with diuers great ſommes of mony fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
England, diuers troopes of Germaines were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme, and brought into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
for the aſsiſtance of the Huguenots: by which
meanes, the confederatie betwene the Engliſh
and them, was now growen ſo ſtrong, that they
would neuer in any treaty with their king, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any conditions without the counſell and
conſent of their Engliſh confederates (as it was
alwaies manifeſtly fonnde, and prooued) By
whoſe crafty direction they were ſo gouerned,
that they euer obtayned more by making their
peace, then by the ſucceſſe of their warr. And at
ſuch tyme as the oportunitie ſerued not to ſtirr
vp the Huguenotes againſt the king, they letted
not to ſtir vp his owne brother, and the houſe
of <hi>Montmorancie</hi> againſt him, for the proſecuting
whereof, the brother of the ſaid <hi>Montmorancie,</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> came into England, and
there receyued the ſomme of 50. thowſand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des:
which was paſt ouer by exchange, by way
of Antwerp, and Colen, for the firſt leuy of
men, and bringing in of Caſimire. By meanes of
which forces, the king was conſtrained to giue
vnto his brother, <hi>Aniow, Main, Towrain,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tours,</hi>
whereby his partage was made greater, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any
brother to any king of Frannce before him.</p>
            <p>Now when by this meanes the French king
was thus-much feebled, then was the ſaid Duke
of <hi>Aniow</hi> broughte into England, to be made the
make-fyre betweene the two moſt potent real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of Chriſtendome, Spaine, and Fraunce: but
vnder the colour and countenance of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1289:10"/>
which being in the end conuerted into a
mock-mariage: <hi>Monſieur</hi> receyued his errand to
go into the low countries of the king of Spaine,
&amp; there was he made, <hi>Antiduke</hi> of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the
which laudable deuice, yf any in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
except <hi>M. Cecill,</hi> or yf it had euer bene practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zed
in any other princes tyme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this, it could
haue bene no leſſe then highe treaſon. For that,
to put an heire apparent of Fraunce in poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Flaunders, is a matter of no leſſe moment, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to giue dooble ſtrengthe vnto an auncient ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to leaue England, for a future breakfaſt,
vnto a French king. But it pleaſed God ſoone to
quench the fire, that mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſieur was ſent to kindle.
For the new duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> being ſubdued by
his ſubiectes, was in the nonage of his raigne, for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced
with much diſhonor, to returne into France.
VVhere the remembrance of the deceatful
dealinges of England, and the ſhame that lately
he had ſuſtained in the low countries, did make
his owne indiſcretions apparent vnto himſelf:
and ſo aggrauated his ſickneſſe, that the reuenge
which he threatned vnto Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he was faine
to leaue vnto God, and his duchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
vnto the right owner: For ſoone after his arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
in Fraunce, with very much grief of mynde
he died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> being thus departed this world, it
was neceſſarie, that ſome nevv occaſion were
ſoughte out, for the continuance of M. <hi>Cecill</hi>
his eternall reſolution,<note place="margin">To ſovv ſedition.</note> which the ſiniſter practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
paſt, and the iniquities of the tyme preſent,
ſuffred not to be o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſought for. For he foorwith
diſcouered, that the French king had entretained
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1289:10"/>
an il opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the princes of the houſe of Guyſe,
vnto the which houſe, albeit that the King and
his bretheren, the late kinges before him, had
bene as much beholding,<note place="margin">D. Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> as a king could be vnto
his ſubiectes: yet by the ſuggeſtion of a leud mig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion,
all their manifold deſertes were vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forgotten.</p>
            <p>And then for the better now riſhing of theſe
diſlikes, an extraordinarie league of amitie was
concluded with the french King, who ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
became ſo attentiue vnto good inſtructions,
that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted moſt horrible murthers, vpon
tvvo of the princes of the ſaid houſe: and what
end himſelf ſhortly after came vnto, is manifeſt
enough.</p>
            <p>But to leaue Scotland and Fraunce in thoſe
termes, vvherunto they are novv led: vve vvill
come vnto Spaine, as to the matter of greateſt
mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; the ſubiect of this diſcours. The King
vvhereof, hauing left the Q. of England, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
vppon Q. Maries deceaſſe, in full poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of that kingdome, and by ſundry demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
giuen proof of his entire loue and amitie vnto
her: and alſo of his firme intention to continevv
the old concord, that had ſo long endured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the kinges of England, and the houſe of
Burgundie, being alſo at peace with the French
king, &amp; hauing placed for the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the
Netherlandes, the <hi>Ducheſſe</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> he departed
into Spaine.</p>
            <p>And albeit (as it is wel knowne) he hath euer
bene a prince, that by nature is diſpoſed vnto
peace, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the greatneſſe of the <hi>Turk,</hi>
and his inceſſant attemptes in the inuading of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1289:11"/>
Chriſtendome, whereof ſome vniuerſall danger
mighte be feared to enſue, he determined to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſuch meanes as God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, to with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand 
the intention of this comon enemy. The
which ſoone after, he began to put in practize,
as hereafter ſhalbe declared.</p>
            <p>But this cours of proceeding lyked not him,
that had deſigned his plots vnto other purpoſes,
and that rather ſought to woork ſome ſpeciall
domage to the king of Spaine, then to haue the
pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the Turck diminiſhed. And therefore
for an introduction thereunto, to make him
odious vnto the people, certaine players were per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted
to ſcof and ieſt at him, vpon their como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtages.
And the lyke was vſed in contempr of his
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: firſt, to make it no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Turkiſhe,
by annexing vnto the very pſalmes of Dauid (as
thoughe the prophet himſelf had bene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thereof) this enſuing meeter.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Preſerue vs lord by thy deere woord,</l>
               <l>From Turck and Pope defend vs lord,</l>
               <l>That bothe, would thruſt out of his throne,</l>
               <l>Our lord Ieſus Chriſt, thy deere ſonne.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And after, by making it farr more odious and
woors, then was the religion of Mahomet. As
diuers miniſters, did at diuers tymes inſinuate
vnto the people. And one of them in a ſermon
at Paules croſſe, affirmed that it was a more bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acte to aſsiſt Turks, then Papiſtes. For the
which woordes, the L. <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> the ſame day
reproued him, at the ſhirif of Londons table: but
M. miniſter ſtoode vnto his tacling, and had (as
it ſeemed) learned his leſſon, of the ſuperinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent
of VVincheſter,<note place="margin">Horne.</note> who publiſhed in a printed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1289:11"/>
booke, that it was better to ſweare vnto the
Turk and turkery, then vnto the Pope and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and that the Pope is a more perillous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Chriſt, then the Turk. But in the meane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>whyle
it is a good Goſpell, that maketh him
that tearheth vs to beleeve that Chriſt is the
ſonne of God, and ſauior of the world, and him
by whoſe meanes, our forefathers were baptiſed
in the name of the Father, Sonne, &amp; holy Ghoſt,
to be woors then he, that denyeth Chriſt to be
the ſonne of God, and conſtreyneth Chriſtians
to renounce their chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>Theſe preparatiues being thus made, the <hi>Moores</hi>
that inhabited the kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> were
excited to rebellion. Vnto whome, althoughe
the Engliſh would not openly ſend forces of
men, yet they ſent them ſuccors of powder,
ſhot, artillery, &amp; other munition of warr. There
were alſo,<note place="margin">Iane d Albret.</note> certaine French pirates, that vnder

               </gap> (that
then was) the prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> the Shatillion, and
others, were ſent foorth to robbe and endomage
the king of Spaine, and his ſubiects &amp; all theſe:
had free paſſage and entrance, to and from the
portes and hauens of England. And ſoone after,
one <hi>Kirkham,</hi> and diuers other Engliſh of the
weſtcountrey, were permitted to go foorthe to
robbe and ſpoile the Spaniardes, wherof the
Spaniſh Ambaſſador then reſident in England,
inſtantly demaunding redreſſe and reſtitution,
was denied of either. And the goodes thus taken
by piracie, were brought into diuers townes
weſt ward, and there openly ſold.</p>
            <p>But in the meane whyle, that theſe leſſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1289:12"/>
were continued, a matter of farr greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was practized, to witt, the rebellion of
the kinges naturall ſubiectes of his Netherlandes.
VVhere the people, by reaſon of their great
welth, were brought vnto pride, &amp; the nobillitie
throughe ouer-lauiſh expences, declyned vnto
pouerty, and the newneſſe &amp; libertie of hereſy,
redy to fynde acceptance with either party, they
were the ſooner and more eaſely ſeduced by the
Engliſh. The firſt atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, being begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by certaine

thus ſtirred vp, there was (to begin withall) 60,

in Antwerp.</p>
            <p>By theſe attemptes and practizes, the king
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreyned to withdrawe the forces that he
had intended &amp; bent againſt infidells, to employ
them in his owne countries againſt his owne
ſubiects. VVith whome, being nowe enbranled

the Q. had giuen her paſporte for the ſaf

were greatly let and hindred, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
followed, a generall arreſt of all marchants
ſhippes, and goodes, in the lowe countries. And
this action tending to ſome further great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1289:12"/>
the councell aſſembled at <hi>Hampton court,</hi>
and conſulted at ſundries tymes in the Queenes
preſence, whether it were beſt openly to breake
with the king of Spaine or not, and after long
deliberation, the whole bodie of the councell
concluded, not to breake with him in any vviſe.
But to make preſent reſtitution of the ſaid
mony, for diuers cauſes: and the rather, for that
they had but late before diſpleaſed the French
king, in aſsiſting his Huguenotes, and taking his
townes, and might not vvithout imminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
incurr the enmitie of two ſuch pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t princes.
But notvvithſtanding this their generall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being alſo conſented vnto by the Queene,
M. Cecill did aftervvardes ſecretly perſvvade
her vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, whereby the decree made
by the vvhole body of the councell, was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
contrarie to the prerogatiue of the councell of

auctoritie of any kinges councell els in <hi>Europe.</hi>
And hereupon was the arreſt of marchants
goodes continued, and a ſtay of trafyke, betwene
<hi>Spaine, England</hi> and the lovv countries, for three
yeares together, to the vndoing and detriment,
aſvvell of many of the ſubiects of <hi>England,</hi> as of
ſundrie the marchantes of the other countries.
But in the meane vvhile, al ſuch fugitiues and
traitors, as had in the lovve countries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
any enormious crimes, or could pilfer, or viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
robbe or take away, any thing from the king, or
his other ſubiects, were receyued and harbored
in England, which vvas novv become the open
receptacle of churchrobbers, and prieſt-kilers.</p>
            <p>Yea the very belles of the ſteeples of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1289:13"/>
vvere caried into England, and there caſt
into artillery. And one called <hi>Monſieur de Lumay,</hi>
being alſo fled thether, receyued there ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtructions,
that he came ouer into <hi>Holland</hi> &amp; ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priſed

and diuers other townes ſhortly after followed.
And to aſsiſt them in theſe proceedinges, there
were ſent ouer with troopes of Engliſh forces,
<hi>Morgan,</hi> Sir <hi>Humfrey Gilbert,</hi> and <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And
then followed <hi>North, Cotton, Candiſh,</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
all being Coronells, &amp; coming the therwith
whole regiments. And albeit theſe ſupplies
were ſtill continued, and men muſtred and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
perforce to go ouer vnto this ſeruice, yet was
it colourably ſhadowed to be don without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of ſuperior aucthoritie, and the ſending of

when any Engliſh for their encreaſſe of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege
in military affaires did come ouer, or did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to come ouet to ſerue the king of Spaine, they
were either before their departure, or vpon their
returne, impriſoned and puniſhed. I may not
heere omitt, that after the warres of Barbarie,
made by Sebaſtian king of Portugall (wherein
the Mahometaines were aſsiſted with munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
againſt the Chriſtians by the Engliſh, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
King was ſlaine) the nobillitie and people of
the realme of Portugall, hauing according to
their lawes and cuſtomes, receyued the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
(as the eldeſt of the blood royal) to be their
king, and he being very aged, and not lykely to

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1289:13"/>
about the ſucceſsion of the crowne,
which being vnderſtood in England, and alſo
that the Cardinall was enclyned vnto the king of

forth-vvith ſent ouer from <hi>England,</hi> to offer
the Portugales aſsiſtance, for the excluſion of the

            </p>
            <p>But this and the former practizes, being cloked
vvith much conning, vvere either deemed

to maintaine his rebelles againſt him in

vvhere in the ſtreight of <hi>Darien,</hi> vnderſtanding

6. or. 7. marchantes, and valiantly ſett the houſe

retyred home againe tovvardes England, vvhere
(not longe after for that he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch good
proof of his dexteritie) it vvas determyned that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1289:14"/>
he ſhould be employed againe, as being the fiteſt
man to atchiue an enterprize of ſtealing. And
therefore vvith ſhippes vvel furniſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided

back-ſyde of <hi>America,</hi> vvhere no pirates had
bene before him, and therefore the leſſe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made to vvithſtand them, there he and his

vvherin vvere but 8. Spaniardes, vvho ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Engliſh for freindes, receyued them on

tooke out of it 37. thouſand ducats in

boldly ventred on ſhore vnto a Spaniard that
lay a ſleepe, and had lying beſyde him the value
of 4. thouſand ducats in 13. vvedges of ſiluer:
all vvhich they ouercame &amp; caried vavay, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly

in poſſeſsion, after ſome ſmaller pilferies, and
ſacking of the tovvne of <hi>Gnatulca,</hi> M. Drake and

into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. VVhere he vvas ſo vvell vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and ſo liberall in the deuiſion of ſhares to
ſome Courtiers, that notvvithſtanding the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovves
claimed his intereſt, it neuer gat ſo great a

            <p>And albeit that now and then, ſome poore pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

Neither ſhould ſuch great miſ-hap haue betyded

with ſmall booties.</p>
            <p>But this good ſucceſſe of an il enterprize, gaue
great deſyre to the lyke attempt againe. And the
new knight of the order of theui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, by the inequal
deuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſhares, hauing, had perhaps the leaſt
parte alloted vnto himſelf, was redy enoughe to
vndertake it. And not longe after, he was ſent
forth with a greater number of men and ſhippes,
wherewith he arryued at the Ile of <hi>Spagnola,</hi> and
there ſacked the towne of <hi>S. Domingo,</hi> and other
places: where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted many barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,

            <p>Theſe continuall robberies, &amp; ſpoiles made
by the Engliſh, vpon the King of Spaine, &amp; his
ſubiects, in &amp; about his Indies, grewe in the end
to be ſo many and ſo ordinary, that euen the very
remembrance that it was iniuſtice, and the euery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1289:15"/>
forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for their greater ſhame &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they haue not letted to put downe many of their
actions them ſelues in print, to the view of the
world. And among others which for breuitie I
muſt omitt, M. <hi>Thomas Candiſh</hi> in his letter to
the lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> writeth, that he had naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
all alongſt the coaſt of <hi>Chili, Peru,</hi> and
<hi>Nouaſpagna.</hi> VVhere he made great ſpoiles, and
burnt and ſunck 19. ſaile of Shippes, ſmall and
great, and burnt and ſpoiled all the villages and

a ſhip of the Kinges at <hi>Califorma,</hi> wherein was
the ſomme of<note n="*" place="margin">the ſome is omitted in the printed copie.</note> in treaſure, and ſomuch other
coſtly wares as he was not able to carie away: &amp;
therefore tooke all the treaſure, and ſett the ſhip
with the other goodes on fyre. But I will here
end theſe matters, &amp; to auoyde prolixitie omitt
ſundry of theſame kynde, which by very many
haue bene put in practize. And albeit that euery
one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hathe not returned with lyke ſpoile,
yet certaine it is, that there vvere neuer any we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne
voyages made from England, theſe many
yeares paſt, but (howſoeuer they were in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhewe diuulged) the very meere meaning
&amp; intention of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, was to robbe the king of
Spaine or his ſubiects, of their Indian treaſure. In
the continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whereof for ſo-many yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
as the king neuer, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted any act of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
either againſt the Queene her dominions, or
ſubiects, which no prince in the world could
haue forborne to do, after ſo great prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo
the Engliſh on the otherſyde, did contrariwiſe
deeme, that the to-many iniuries vvhich they
had donne him, vvere al to fevv. And therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1289:15"/>
they reſolued to offend him much more, and in
a farr more apparent and inexcuſable manner, in
the ſight of all the world, then in any their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
actions, hovv manifeſt ſoeuer.</p>
            <p>For vvhen the Archtraitor to his King, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer
of his country (the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>) was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out of the world, and the head-leſſe rebels of the
Netherla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, firſt ſeeking patronage of the K. of
<hi>Denmarck,</hi> after of the French king, &amp; being by
both thoſe iuſtly denied and reiected, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
diſmaſking themſelues of all former viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
and ſhadowes, did ouertly receyue them
into their protection, to defend them in all open
hoſtillitie, againſt their naturall and lawful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
the king of Spaine. And thereupon
they reſolued, to put themſelues in poſſeſsion of
ſundry the principall porte townes, and other
places of thoſe partes. And by a printed declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
went about by diuers weake and indirect
reaſons, to iuſtifie that action: vvhereof amonge
others, one was, in reſpect of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t league
betvvene the kinges of <hi>England,</hi> and the houſe of
<hi>Burgundie,</hi> and the people of either of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces:
as thoughe the Q. of England mighte by
prerogatiue of that league, maintaine the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of the Netherlandes, againſt the King of
Spaine, their ſoueraigne, &amp; the chief Prince of
the houſe of Burgundie.</p>
            <p>An-other reaſon vvas, to the end the naturall
people of the countrie, ſhould not be oppreſſed
by ſtraungers, as thoughe the Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scotiſh,

ſufficient, M. Norris vvas firſt ſent ouer to take
poſſeſsion of certaine porte townes, fortes, and
other places in Holland, and Zealand, and ſoone
after the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> (whoſe experience in

alſo to come vnto the feild againſt the forces of
the king of Spaine. And in what ſorte, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

               </gap>ently in our view and memorie, I will omitt
the recytall.</p>
            <p>And thus at the laſt, by this ouert entrance of
the Engliſh into hoſtilitie, there was more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
occaſion giuen vnto the king, to vſe the
lyke againe, and to attempt that, whereunto no
former iniuries could prouoke him. And the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
now coming to an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warr on either ſyde,
either party was to vſe his aduantage as he beſt
could. <hi>Che piglia piglia, &amp; che non puo, ſuo danno.</hi>
And therefore omitting that which ſince hathe
bene donne in thoſe partes, I will briefly touch
the <hi>Portugall</hi> voyage, not in comparing it with
the double faced actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before rehearſed, but as
an ordinary expedition of warr.</p>
            <p>It ſhalbe nedeleſſe to examine the righte, that
<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> pretendeth to the crowne of that
country, ſince it is ſoone anſwered in his illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation.
VVhich being by M. Cecill diſpenſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1289:16"/>
withall, albeit he be but vicar generall, and not
the ſupreme head himſelf, requireth no further
queſtion. <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> then, accompaigned
with <hi>Sir Iohn Norrice,</hi> and <hi>Sir Frauncis Drake,</hi>
departed from Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with aboue 20. thouſand
ſoldiers, and mariners: <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> with full
reſolution to take poſſeſsion of <hi>Portugall,</hi> but
M. <hi>Drake,</hi> with a farr other ſecret deſignement,
which being vttred by him ſelf vnto the queene,
I would be lothe here to repeat, were it not for
feare, of leauing the reader in erronius ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
M. <hi>Drake</hi> forſoothe, did promiſſe the Q. very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
to bring the king of Spaine to kiſſe her
pantofle, or els to bring him, I know not to
what woful lamentation But ſuch was the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
effect of that iorney, that neither <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
obtained his expected kingdome, nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptaine
<hi>Drake</hi> would once enter on ſhore in Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tugall
to take the king of Spaine with him.</p>
            <p>VVhereof two mighty inconueniences haue
enſued, the one is, that the realme of Portugall is
ſtill poſſeſſed by the right owner: and the other,
that the Queenes pantofle is yet vnkiſt, by the
kinge of Spaine.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, excepting ſome 2. or 3. thowſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
all the reſt of the ſoldiers and mariners, ſhewed
more valour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their leaders, for that they neuer
returned back againe, but either remained ſtill in
Portugall, or aboute that coaſt. It is further to be
noted, that albeit in that voyage, they could not
effectuate their deſyre againſt their enemyes,
they did yet without partialitie ſo ſet vpon
their freindes, that they ſeazed vpon 50. ſhippes
of the Eaſterlinges which were bound to Spaine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1289:17"/>
with marchandize, and caried thoſe away with
them, and ſo returned home vnto <hi>Plimouthe.</hi>
VVhere enen at their very landing, there hapned
a more ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g encounter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before in the whole
iorney they had found. For the women of
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> whoſe huſbandes by ill vſage were
loſt in that voyage, being armed with diſtaues
&amp; other vnuſuall weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, without any reſpect
vnto kingſhip, or knighthoode, began ſo fierſly
to aſſault <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anthonio,</hi> &amp; <hi>Drake,</hi> that they were
faine to defend them ſelues by force of legges.
This voyage being thus ended, the progreſſe
thereof was printed and publiſhed, both in
Latin, and Engliſh. But the author thereof (in
myne opinion) mighte well haue ſpared his
paines, becauſe all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifeſtly knew without
booke, what ſucceſſe the ſaid voyage had had.
VVhat ſithence hathe bene do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, in the ſending
of Shippes and forces towardes the <hi>Terceraes</hi>
and els where, and the ſucceſſes thereof being
ryf in our memorie, I will here omitt: and
proceed to giue the reader ſuch ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the
ſcope of the premiſſes haue directed me vnto.</p>
            <p>Not withſtanding the manifold iniuries,

            <p>Firſt it is very manifeſt,<note place="margin">Anno. 1559.</note> that after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the lowe countries, at which tyme he
peaceably poſſeſſed thoſe, &amp; the reſt of his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes,
and dominions: his firme reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was,
for the generall defence of Chriſtendome, to
make warr againſt the Turk, and other Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertaines.
And to that end, he firſt vpon his peace
made with Fraunce, called all his forces of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes
and others, oute of Flaunders, and ſent
them into Italy: and thence employed them,
againſt the enemies of Chriſtianitie. Firſt at
<hi>Pinion de velis,</hi> then to <hi>Zerbi,</hi> then to <hi>La Racha,</hi>
and other places of Africa. And the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi>
being ſtrongly beſieged, &amp; in very great perill to
be loſt, he ſent thether a great army to ſuccor it,
and defeated the forces of the <hi>Turk.</hi> He alſo
prouided ſuch troopes, for the yeare enſuing
(which he ſent thether vnder the conduct of the
<hi>Marquis of Piſcara</hi>) that the <hi>Turk</hi> was forced to
giue ouer, &amp; leave his ſecond enterprize: albeit
he came very ſtrongly prouided, for the taking
thereof, &amp; therein to recouer his honor, loſt the
yeare before. And after all this, the king of <hi>Spaine</hi>
for the more repoſe and tranquilitie of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
ioyned in league againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> with
the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereof followed the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1289:18"/>
great victory, obtained by <hi>Don Iohn de Auſtria</hi>
his generall, at <hi>Lepanto.</hi> Theſe pointes albeit
but briefly touched may ſerue for a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his princely reſolution, to maintaine the
concord of Chriſtians, and to offend their como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
enemy. Yea the king of <hi>Tunis,</hi> being by the <hi>Turk</hi>
expulſed, he reſtored him again vnto his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>But moſte redy he was to giue aid and aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to Chriſtian princes. VVhen being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the inſolencie of their rebells, they de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſired
his help: and amonge others, to the French
king. Vnto whoſe ayd, he ſent in the firſt troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
3. thowſand Spaniardes, who were preſent
at the battaile of Dreux.</p>
            <p>And afterward from the lowe countries, he
ſent the Counte of Mansfeild at two ſeuerall
tymes, both with horſe, and foote. He ſent alſo,
the Counte of Arenberg, the Baron of Erge, and
diuets others, to aſsiſt theſaid king, at ſundry
tymes. All which forces, ſent by the King of
Spaine, from tyme to tyme into Fraunce, himſelf
of his princely and liberall mynde, euer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
&amp; payed at his owne charges. And there
is nothing that more declareth his moderation,
iuſtice, and equitie, towardes his Chriſtian neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours,
then his ſweete and Chriſtianlyke demea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour,
towardes the realme of Fraunce. VVhere
neither, by the minorites of the late kinges, nor
ciuill diſcentions of the ſubiects, he would take
aduantage, to chalenge or encroache, any parte
of that countrie. VVhereas yf he had bene ſo
greedy and ambitious, as his aduerſaries do bely
him to bee, he would not haue omitted in ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1289:19"/>
many oportunities, to have chalenged all Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to hymſelf. VVho hathe at this preſent, theſame
right by his daughter, and farr more cleere, then
had ſomtyme the noble prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the
third of England, thereunto. And yet as the
world ſeeth, he neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor now, hath chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
any ſuch thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at all: &amp; this is a ſingular praiſe
and an eternall glory, to this moſt puiſſant prince
of all ages, and in this tyme eſpecially to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
at, that he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth nothing, nor wageth
any warres, that are not iuſt, honorable, and
allowed bothe by the lawes of God and man.
And as touching the Queene of England, I will
omitt ſome great and eſpeciall acts of amitie,
ſhewed by himſelf vnto her, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was maried
vnto her ſiſter, whereof her ſelf is not ignorant,
but dothe beſt know them: And I will briefly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late
ſome points before touched.</p>
            <p>Firſt vpon the deceaſſe of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> his
wyf, he gaue vnto this Queene al her Iewelles,
which rightly appertayned vnto himſelf. And
being aboute the concluſion of a peace with the
Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king, after the taking of S. Quintynes, he
delt very inſtantly for the rendring of Calis vnto
the Engliſh, inſomuch as vvithout the reſtoring
thereof, he refuſed the accord, &amp; ſtode ſo reſolute
vpon this point, that in the end the French vvere
faine to tell him, that albeit the Engliſh did ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him to include the deliuery of Calis in his
peace, yet had they ſecretly alredy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded their
peace with them, without that condition. And
this was donne by a cloſe practize of M. Cecill,
who ſent ouer one <hi>Guido Caualcante</hi> an Italian,
to conclude it vvithoute the knowlege of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1289:19"/>
Queenes Ambaſſadors, vvho vvere there appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
to ſolicite it. VVhich extreme duble dealing,
could not yet brede any auerſion in his mynde
againſt the Engliſh, inſomuch, that after they
began to fall from the doing vnto him, one iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the neck of another, which ſtill encreaſed
from a fewe to many, and from leſſer to greater:
yet would he neuer begin any attempt againſt
them, nor neuer make ſomuch as any ſhewe of
any one acte of hoſtilitie whatſoeuer, vntill ſuch
tyme as they came ſo farr, as to the very taking
of his townes into their owne poſſeſsions, as is
aforeſaid. VVhich is a moſt great and ſufficient
argument, of his grounded affection vnto that
Queene and countrie. For moſte rarely is it fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that any King or Prince could ſo continually
diſgeſt and ouerſee, ſuch great vvronges and
iniuries, as he hathe receyued from England: and
much leſſe himſelf, that hathe greater meanes to
reuenge them, then any other potentate lyuing
in the world. And had doubtleſſe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
it, had it not proceeded of a moſt ſingular affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto that Prince and people, &amp; hope of redreſſe
and amendment.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſerue to ſhewe, whether the
King of Spaine hathe ſoughte ſo many yeares to
trooble the ſtate of England. But contrariwiſe,
vvhether the ſtate of England hathe ſo long
ſoughte the diſturbance of him, and almoſt of all
other their neighbours, I leaue the reader to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
by the premiſſes, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of thoſe,
I referr to the teſtimony of all the nations of
Europe, to the end there may be a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of witneſſes, to check the extreme impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1289:20"/>
the malitious aduerſary,<note place="margin">In the late pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> who is not aſhamed
to ſay, that the repoſe of Chriſtendom, by the

is nowdiſturbed: which otherwiſe mighte come
to an vniuerſall peace. But as touching the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall

would preſcribe it vnto him, I muſt needes
confeſſe, that I do greatly doubte vvhether the
king of Spaine would thereunto be perſwaded:
becauſe in al-lykelyhode, it muſt be in this
manner.<note place="margin">Conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of an vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſall peace.</note> Firſt, that he ſhould recall ſuch forces,
as of great compaſsion vnto the naturall people

againſt a relapſed <hi>Huguenote,</hi> that vvould make
them renegates from the faith, as himſelf is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he ſhould ſuffer his rebells of
Holland and Zealand, quietly to poſſeſſe the
places they do hold, and to take vnto them all
the reſt of the low countries alſo: conditionally,
that the Engliſh mighte ſtill kepe the poſſeſsion
of ſuch porte townes as they haue, &amp; haue ſome
half a doſen more annexed vnto them, Thirdly
that the Engliſh rouers, might peaceably go to
his <hi>Indies,</hi> and there take away his treaſure, and
his Indies alſo. And theſe fewe aricles being
thus accorded, then might <hi>England Fraunce,</hi>
the <hi>Netherlandes,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> be in farr better
poſsibilitie, to extirpate the Catholyke religion
in <hi>Italy,</hi> to bring the Moores into <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; then
to conclude that vniuerſall peace, which paſſeth
all vnderſtanding: And include in the-ſame, the
great Turk the king of Feſſe, and Marrocco, and
other infidells, with whome England is alredy
leagued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1289:20"/>

VVhoſe falſe faith is not only detected in their

ſome of their ſpies to go to confeſsion, of

that will not lett to vrge men to the

it is not ſinceritie and zeale of religion that they

themſelues do litle feare ſuch treaſons, as they
pretend to be wrought by prieſtes, when they

as they vntruly reporte.</p>
            <p>And yet for confirmation of the ill opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
do labor to make the people to haue of them, the
<hi>Archpolitike</hi> hathe fraudulently prouyded, that
when any Catholike or Prieſt is araigned, the en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is euer farced with many odious matters,
as of conſpiratie, killing the Queene, ſtiring the
ſubiects to rebellion, drawing them from their
obedience, &amp; the lyke: &amp; yet when they come to
proofes, they can proue nothing in the world,
but only that he is Prieſt, or hathe relieued prieſts

in <hi>Latin.</hi> Is it poſsible quoth the other? I aſſure
you quoth this partie, it is out of all doute, for
he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay it before a multitude of witneſſes
and would haue ſaid it vnto the end, but that as
hap was, the hangman was redy to diſpatche
him, before he had half donne. This diepe concei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1289:23"/>
without any great ſcruple belieue the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
in ſaying that none are put to death for

ſomuch labouring to detaine from Catholikes,
the deſerued honor and glory of the cauſe for
which they ſuffer, dothe thereby proclame his
owne iniquitie and iniuſtice, to all the world,
making that to be new <hi>Treaſon,</hi> which is nothing

vnto common ſence, as yf the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould make

ſuch is his great and abſurd impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that there
is no treaſon that ſeemeth greater, nor no crime
more vnpardonable in England, then there to be
a Catholike, nor yet any offence ſo ſeuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
There was neuer <hi>Scythian,</hi> nor ſauage
<hi>Tartar,</hi> that could vſe more inhumaine cruelty
then to rip vp the bodies of innocent men, being
perfectly aliue, to teare out their entrailes, to be

of the <hi>Romaine Emperors,</hi> that more vexed, ſpoiled
impriſoned, and tortured Catholikes, then dothe
now the ſtate of England. And thus haue I abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiated
vnto the reader, a huge volume of the
preſent lamentable ſtate of religion.</p>
            <p>TOuching rhe ſecond point, concerning the
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of exterior enemyes, how mighte the
caſe be other with England, then now it is, ſeeing
that during the continuance of thirtie and three
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1289:24"/>
yeares, they neuer ſent foorth any one ſoldier,
nor neuer drew ſwoord in any iuſt quarrel, or
honorable action. They neuer ſought to endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
the Turk, the comon enemy of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor neuer defended any lawful prince or
King in all the world: But haue inuented, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecuted,
the moſt diſhonorable, inglorious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt,
and tyranicall actions, that euer were practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zed
by any Chriſtian ſtate.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> was in her
owne realme, and they acknowleged her for the
lawful prince of that countrie, did they giue aid
vnto her, or vnto her rebells? In the tymes of
<hi>Frauncis, Charles,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> the late Kinges of
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> was their aſsiſtance giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome
they knew to be lawful Kinges, or to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells?
and as for the ſuccour they do now giue
vnto <hi>Nauarr</hi> &amp; his <hi>Huguenotes,</hi> it is no otherwiſe
then it was before, when they acknowledged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be rebells. In this long rebellion in the low
countries, whether haue they taken parte with
the King their old co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federate, or with <hi>Orange</hi> &amp;
the other rebells? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Sebastian</hi> king of Portugal
warred with the Mahometaines of Africa, gaue
they ayd vnto the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or vnto the infidells?</p>
            <p>And ſince in the realme of <hi>Portugall,</hi> gaue they
help vnto the lawfull prince, or to the baſtard his
rebell? In the warres of <hi>Colen,</hi> did the Engliſh
ſuccur the lawfull Biſhop, or the vnlawfull depo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
apoſtata? And yf we ſhal looke into ſea mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſee who it is, that hathe ſet vp a publike pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie,
to ſpare neither freind, nor foe. Aſke the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh,</hi>
the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch,</hi> the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> the <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> the <hi>Hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
townes,</hi> yea the <hi>Indies,</hi> and further partes of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1289:24"/>
               <hi>earth,</hi> who they are, that do ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually robbe
and ſpoile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yf the Engliſh had but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the king of Spaine to be their enemy, they
needed not to haue ſoughte any others: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
England, nor any other Chriſtian country
els, hathe euer had any ſo great. And as they haue
made eſpetiall choiſe of the enmitie of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
ſo haue they employed the tyme of 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
to deſerue it.</p>
            <p>And as for the King of Scotland, albeit he do
diſſemble amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many leſſe iniuries, one ſo great,
as the cutting of of his owne mothers head, yet
ſome of his owne nation, being of good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
haue ſaid vnto ſtraungers in defence of
their Kinges honor: that albeit they of England
haue cut of the head of his mother, he muſt not
therefore by vn-tymely reuenge, cut him-ſelf
from the poſsibilitie of that crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But hauing
once obtained theſame, he will then fall to the
cutting of of the heades of thoſe, that aſſented to
that action: and to the confiſcatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their landes
and goodes, therewith to reward his freindes &amp;
followers: and ſo demonſtrate vnto the world,
that he could politikely chuſe a tyme conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to diſcharge ſuch duty, as is incident vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor
and reputation of a King.</p>
            <p>And touching Fraunce, albeit that by the
death of the three late Kinges, the iniuries do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
vnto them cannot be by them remembred, yet
the people of the realme, that were participa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, are ſtill lyuing: in whome the deſyre
of reuenge, is of late newly reuyued, throughe
the aſsiſting of the <hi>Huguenote</hi> of <hi>Nauarr,</hi> their
capitall enemy, but not their lawfull King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1289:25"/>
And laſt of all, which of al other is the greateſt,
there extreme enmitie with the chief Biſhop, &amp;
paſtor of Gods Churche. VVhereof enſueth their
general diſcord with all the Catholike Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of the world.</p>
            <p>Thus the realme of England, being brought
into breach of amitie, not only with the Churche
of God, but with all their old alies and freindes,
yf we now conſider with whome they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in true freindſhip, we ſhal fynde them to be
ſo fewe as none at all, ſince they haue neither
ſpared, to offend freind nor foe. But yf we looke
what new confederates they haue choſen, in ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of the old, we ſhall ſee them to be the great
<hi>Turk,</hi> the kinges of <hi>Feſſe, Marocco,</hi> and <hi>Algiers,</hi> or
other <hi>Mahometains</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> all
profeſſed enemies to <hi>Christ.</hi> Againſt whome,
ſome of the moſt noble and famous kinges of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland,
went in perſon with great armies, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſuch victories, as will for euer recomend
their glorie to all poſterities. They are alſo in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
with a fewe <hi>Bere-bruers,</hi> and <hi>Baſketmakers</hi> of
<hi>Holland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> with a company of <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes,</hi>
and <hi>Huguenotes</hi> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> &amp; with their feed
pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſioner, the <hi>Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celor</hi> of <hi>Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> who by abuſing
of the King, hathe gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credit to woork his ruy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne.
And the Engliſh thus leagued with <hi>infidells,
heretikes,</hi> and <hi>rebells,</hi> cannot yet preſume of any
true frindſhip of them in their hartes. For the
French albeit they be <hi>Huguenotes,</hi> yet are they ſtill
French vnto the Engliſh, and as heretofore, ſo
euen of late they have ſhewed themſelues vnto
ſuch, as were ſent from England to aſsiſt them.
The ſtates of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> yf they could
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1289:25"/>
poſsibly thurſt out the Engliſhe, they would
not let to do it. And it is well knowne, that
ſome of them of chiefeſt auctoritie haue ſecretly
concluded and reſolued, either preſently vpon
the Queenes deceaſſe, or ſo ſoone as any oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
ſerueth, to bring all their forces together
to attempt it.</p>
            <p>The freindſhip of <hi>Scotland,</hi> although it haue
coſt many Engliſhe angels, yet will it prove
Scotiſh in the end. And the great <hi>Turk</hi> and his
conſorts, may be by the Engliſh excited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
ſome partes of Chriſtendome, neere vnto
them adioyning (as alredy vpon ſuch perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they haue attempted) but good vnto England
they can do none, albeit the Engliſh would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
their <hi>Geneua Bible,</hi> for the <hi>Turkiſh Alcora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
becauſe their ſituations are to farr diſtant. But
how ſo euer their new freindes may congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with them, their old alies may rather reioyce
in hauing their enmitie, then their amitie. For
that by the vnhappy and miſchieuous endes, of
ſomany of their late confederates, it is obſerued
that to be in league with Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, is <hi>malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Et

becauſe it is yet of them vnfelt. And that is, the
great confuſion, of ſomany competitors to the
crowne, bothe within, &amp; without the realme.
VVhich muſt nedes prognoſticate ſuch ſlaughter
&amp; cruell murthers, as neuer were in that, nor in
any other country, for ſuch quarrell. VVhen the
crowne of England was in contention only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the two howſes of <hi>Yorck,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g it laſted, how many of the bloud Royal
&amp; Nobilitie loſt their lyues, and what great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of thowſandes were ſlaine, the hiſtories of
thoſe dayes can declare. But farr greater extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
are we now to expect, among ſomany do
meſticall, and ſome externe competitors. Euery
one of which, thinking himſelf to be iuſtly the
firſt, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aleage many cauſes for the excluſion
of the others. And therefore in all lykely hoode,
each one of thoſe, that liue within the realme &amp;
Ile, will not forbeare hereafter to attempt by
what meanes he may, to preferr himſelf, and to
depreſſe the others. For the crowne remayning
among ſo many in equall ballance, and each al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in lyke poſsibilitie, who of them is it, that
will not dare to aduenture the vttermoſt of his
meanes, for the gayning of no leſſe a thing, then
is the kingdome of England? And what auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of any diſſolued councel ſhal prohibite any
of the competitors to attempt the ſame vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the
dereaſſe of the Queene? VVhat great appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1289:27"/>
there then, of the effuſion of the blood of many
thowſands, &amp; to what deſolation is the realme
lyke to be brought? how fayned will then this
preſent ſeeming peace be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in ſuch intricate mortall warres?</p>
            <p>And how infinite wilbe the curſinges, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions
of all ſortes of people, vpon him that
hathe cauſed it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhall appere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
as he neuer ſought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in peace during
the Queenes lyf, ſo he neuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but to leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in warres after her death? At what tyme he may
reioyce as once did the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Nero,</hi> to ſee the citie
burne, which himſelf had, ſet on fyre. And how
ſoone this great quarrel ſhalbe begun, is as vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine,
as the thing that each howre is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Seeing it dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the only lyf of the
Queene, wherof there is as litle aſſurance, as of
the lyf of any other mortall creature: and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſe
ſo-much the nearer, in that ſhe is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning
in age.</p>
            <p>TO come vnto the fourth &amp; laſt parte, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ouer-throwe of the Nobilitie, and
the great and generall oppreſsion of the people:
it is firſt to be conſidered, that albeit the vniuſt
moleſtations of other comon-wealths, and the
oppreſsions and cruelties vſed within the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
were bothe by M. <hi>Cecill</hi> begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; proſecuted,
yet hathe he ſo cuningly diſpoſed very many of
his affaires, into the handes of other principall
actors (eſpetially ſince the death of his brother
<hi>Bacon</hi>) that very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes, his owne plottes &amp;
inuentions have ſeemed the practizes of others.
Of theſe his actors, the late Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> &amp;
the ſecretary <hi>VValſingham,</hi> were the chiefeſt. The
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1289:27"/>
former of the twaine, for that he had in his
youth, by ouermuch attending his pleaſures, neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected
the obſeruation of many ſecretes, which
M. <hi>Cecill</hi> practized out of <hi>Machiauill:</hi> yet in the
end, he did in fewe yeares profit ſomuch, and ſo
recouer his negligences paſt, as that he ſoone
grewe old in iniquitie: and lefte no miſchief vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted
how abhominable ſo euer. And at the
laſt (as it ſeemeth) euen by the iuſt iudgement
of God, the ſame day ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> night, that he had cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
diuers <hi>Prieſtes</hi> and other <hi>Catholikes,</hi> to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
murthered in diuers places, within and with
out the citie of <hi>London,</hi> he ſickned: and as it is
thoughte was poiſoned, and preuented by one,
whome himſelf had thought by ſuch meanes to
have diſpatched, he died without any ſignes of a
Chriſtian, more lyke a dogg then a man, &amp; being
dead, was as vgly a corſe, as he was filthy in man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners
in his lyf: and in his ſtomack, were great
holes eaten throughe with the poyſon. His la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des
were preſently ceaſed vpon, for his debtes vnto
the <hi>Queene,</hi> whereby he was as much diſgraced,
as yf he had rather bene hated, then fauoured of
her.</p>
            <p>And he that but late before, ſeemed to cary in
himſelf the very glory of the realme, and that in
his lyf tyme was feared of many, thoughe loued
of none: was no ſooner dead, but iuſtly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned
of all. Yea exclamed on, curſed and banned to all
miſchief, by all the people of the land: who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
reioyſed, that ſo wicked a monſter was
dead.</p>
            <p>And albeit that toward his later dayes, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the only patrone of the pureſt profeſſors of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1289:28"/>
the Goſpell: yet immediatly after his death, a
freind of his beſtowed vpon him this <hi>Epitaphe.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Heere lies the woorthy warrier,</l>
               <l>That neuer bloodied ſwoord:</l>
               <l>Heere lies the loyall courtier,</l>
               <l>That neuer kept his woord.</l>
               <l>Heere lies his noble excellence,</l>
               <l>That ruled all the ſtates.</l>
               <l>Heere lies the Earle of Leiceſter,</l>
               <l>VVhome earth, and heauen hates.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> a moſt violent
perſecutor of Catholikes, died almoſt in lyke
manner, neuer ſomuch as naming God in his laſt
extremities, and yet he had bothe ſpeech and me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morie,
as he ſhewed by telling the preacher that
he heard him, and therefore hee needed not to
crie ſo loude, and theſe were his laſt woordes:
and in the end, his vryne came foorth at his
mouth, and noſe, with ſo odious a ſtench, that
none could endure to come neere him. And not
withſtanding his great credit and aucthoritie,
he died a begger, and more indebted, then his
landes could ſatisfy, and hathe lefte no fame of
vertue behynde him.</p>
            <p>Theſe twaine, and ſundry other inferior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes,
being gon to render an accompt of
their infynite euills, &amp; the ſame impious courſe
of proceeding ſtil continued, &amp; daily encreaſing
from ill to woors, dothe plainly manifeſt vnto
the world, who it is, that hathe bene the author
and ſupporter of all miſchief, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the
direct occaſioner, of whatſoeuer inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
the realme of England dothe preſently ſuſtaine,
and what diſtreſſes, miſeries, perills, or, dangers,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1289:28"/>
it is threatned hereafter to ſuffer. VVhereunto
it ſeemerh, he is bent with a very full reſolution,
to hazard and bring it.</p>
            <p>And touching the preſent eſtate of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
wherewith the ſtately courtes of former
princes were adorned, their armies in the feild
conducted, the comons of the countrie by their
great hoſpitalitie relieued, look whether they
are not brought vnto that ſeruilitie, that yf they
apply not themſelues to <hi>Cecils</hi> humour, they
muſt not liue in their countries, but be tyed vnto
the courte, or alotted their dwelling, as yf they
were his perpetuall wardes? yea rather as pupils,
that are kept vnder with roddes, not daring to
ſpeake what they think and know: but are ſet
to be ayme-giuers, while others do hitt their
marckes. Some of them, he hathe vnde ſeruedly
brought into the disfauor of the prince. Sundry
he hathe drawne vpon fained fauours of the
courte, to conſume themſelues to beggery.
Others he hathe ſent foorth, to become pirates
and ſea-rouers. And the lyues of ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall,
by guylefull pretended crymes he hathe
taken away, &amp; by one meanes or other, he hathe
brought ſuch as be yet lyuing into thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
that none may be permitted to cary any
credit in the comon-welth, except it be ſome
very fewe, whoſe wiſdomes he can eaſely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule.
By which meanes, there is no ſubiect in En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland
of more opulence, none of more aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
nor none of more power, then himſelf: and
therefore none to withſtand his entended mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
betweene the Lady <hi>Arbella,</hi> and his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.
VVhereby England may happen to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1289:29"/>
haue a King <hi>Cecill</hi> the firſt, that is ſuddainly meta
morphoſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a grome of the wardrobe, to the
wearing of the beſt robe within the wardrobe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the generall oppreſsion of the
people, it is no leſſe, but rather more lamentable
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ouerthrowe of the nobilitie: in aſmuch,
as it tendeth to an vniuerſall diſtruction of the
whole body of the realme.<note place="margin">As the E. of Darby &amp; others</note> The Lyftenantes and
Iuſtices of ſhires, who are reputed to liue in beſt
credit in their countries, are no more but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iects
of purſuiuants, catchpoles, &amp; promoters,
and muſt night and day be redy, to waite and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
at euery call, of this vile and abiect ſorte of
people. But the meaner gentlemen and comons,
are brought vnto the greateſt ſlauiſhneſſe, and
miſery, that euer any free borne people haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in. VVhich whoſo ſhall rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, ſhall
eaſely perceaue, whether England hathe theſe
33. yeares enioyed peace and tranquillitie, as it is
impudently reported to haue do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> For yf we firſt
look what often &amp; generall muſters haue bene
made, what preſsinges, and ſending foorthe
of men, what prouiſion, chopping, changing, &amp;
conſuming, of armour, munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, artillery, &amp; pou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
ſince the firſt yeare of the Queenes raigne:
we ſhall fynde it to giue ſmall proof of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
peace.</p>
            <p>Let vs call to remembrance what troopes of
men haue at ſundry tymes beene ſent into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
what forces almoſt yearely into Ireland,
what infynite numbers into the low countries,
and continued with dayly ſupplies, how many
thouſandes into Fraunce and Britany, what an
huge army into Portugall, beſydes all the braue
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1289:29"/>
men and mariners conſumed in ſundry voyages
or piracies by ſea, ſent foorth to ſeeke new habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and by one ſuch meanes or
other made away: and we ſhall fynde the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to be farr greater, then any King of England
hathe employed within or without the realme
in any his honorable watres. And yf any man
ſhould think, that al theſe troopes haue bene but
ſet forthe in May-games he may call to memorie
that their coming home againe declared it not.</p>
            <p>Let vs alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what great numbers of pore
women are often tymes lefte in miſery, &amp; with
their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pyne at home in famyne, whyle
their huſbandes are ſent foorth in forreyne
warres: &amp; how-many by this meanes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
widowes, and their childeren fatherleſſe.
And further, what great trooble and vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all artificers, farmers, and huſbandmen
are put vnto by attending and following ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generall muſters: wherein are alſo, diuers
great and foule abuſes comitted. VVhat infinite
numbers of freholders, yeomen, and others (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being charged with wyf and familie)
are preſſed &amp; ſent foorth of the realme vnto
the warres of forein parts, contrary to the lawes
of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, by the which it is prouyded that
none ought to be preſſed, but only to defend the
realme, or to recouer ſome loſt patrimony of the
crowne: whereof it is not knowne that either
<hi>Spaine, Portugall,</hi> the lowe <hi>countries,</hi> or the <hi>Indies</hi>
euer were. And yet ſo exceeding great haue bene
the multytudes of men, that by compulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue
theſe late yeares bene ſent vnto thoſe partes, that
(being well employed) they might haue conque<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1289:30"/>
whole kingdome: and not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this
great iniuſtice and iniury donne vnto them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in theſe ſeruices and euill actions they haue loſt
their lyues, they are rewarded with infamy after
their deaths, euen by thoſe, that conſtrained
them thereunto, and moſt contemptibly called
the ſcum &amp; raſcallitie of the countrie, whereof it
is happely deliuered. And ſuch as after the great
miſeries (which comonly they do ſuſtaine) do re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turne
home againe into England, they haue by
the very report of being <hi>Soldiers,</hi> purchaſed the
hatefull names of <hi>rogues</hi> &amp; <hi>vagabondes:</hi> &amp; being

and puniſhement, of euery beadle &amp; catchpole:
and laſtly euen for very trifles, to the fynall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
of the hangman. VVhat a moſt vile and ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tefull
vſage is this, to men of any valor? and how
intolerable to be borne by any that beareth in
his breſt the harte and courage of a ſoldier, or
hathe euer bene conducted by a captaine in the
feild? what wrong and iniury can be greater to
any one that retayneth the ſhape of a man? or
how is it poſsible for any Engliſh ſoldier to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, or for any other to extend it vnto him ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept
this only naturall enemy to all men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes?
that could neuer abyde that euer any man
of ſeruice, capitaine, ſoldier, or perſon of braue
ſpirite, ſhould be rewarded but with reproche &amp;
miſery: whoſe condition and ſtate of lyf is in all
countries in the world moſt honorable, and was
neuer made ſlauiſh in England before England
came vnto a <hi>Cecilian</hi> gouernment.</p>
            <p>Thus rewardeth he thoſe whome himſelf em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployeth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1289:30"/>
to his owne purpoſe, in the loſſe and ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zarding
of their lyues. And yf we ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
what infynite numbers of the inhabitants
of the land he hathe by one meanes or other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
&amp; dayly entendeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume, we might
iuſtly feare, that this his courſe continuing, he
would in tyme bring the realme to be a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of <hi>Amaſones,</hi> yf he had not alredy drawne
into it treble as many ſtrangers, as King <hi>VVilliam</hi>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror planted therein after his ſubduing
theſame, wherewith himſelf (as it ſeemeth) doth
meane to erect and fortify his new imagyned
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Let vs alſo conſider the great decay of Trafike,
that of late yeares the countrie is brought vnto,
whereby not only many principall marchantes,
which were wont to tranſport great riches and
comodities to the realme, are become banckrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and ſundry of them enforced to turne their
trade of marchandize into meere piracie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
diuers whole townes are decayed, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
compelled to beg, that before were honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſtained by the trade of clothing.</p>
            <p>VVhat ſhould I ſpeake of the generall abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the realme, ſince they are ſo great, and ſo
infynite.</p>
            <p>There were neuer ſomany ſutes in lawe, nor
there was neuer leſſe redreſſe of wronges.</p>
            <p>The lawe is exempt from Iuſtice, and all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

            <p>Conſcyence is leaſt accompted of, and cooſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

            </p>
            <p>The priſons were neuer in any princes daies

now (as it ſeemeth) becauſe he will not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
aſſurance to remit all iniuries paſt, and to put vp
as many as hereafter they may do vnto him, and
quietly lett them continew their wrongfull poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſsion
of his righte, M. <hi>Cecill</hi> is become ſo mad
and angry with him, that he raileth vpon him
in open proclamation (wherein I ſuppoſe I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
not the perſon) for albeit the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be publiſhed in the name of the Queene, yet
muſt it needes be written by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him
which is <hi>Domine fac totum,</hi> who as it ſeemeth,
being in ſome great choler, was ouer haſty in the
choiſe of his Scribe, or ſomuch ouer-weened in
his owne wiſdome, that he thought no one of
his fond impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and friuolous reaſons could
be controled. And therefore with much impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie
he ſaith, that the king of Spaine hathe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
diſturbed the ſtate of England 33. yeares
together, and he greatly laboreth to make the
world belieue, that either the king did neuer
know, or els had vtterly forgotten, whether the
Engliſh had euer don vnto him any iniuries at
all, and therefore could neuer think vpon any
meanes of remedy or reuenge, yf he were not vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
forward and put in memorie of them, by a
fewe prieſtes and Ieſuites.</p>
            <p>He accuſeth the Pope, of exhauſting the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Churche, without conſent of the
college of Cardinalles. VVherein he ſeemeth as
thoughe he pitied the waſting of the Churches
treaſure, who could wiſh in his harte that the.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1289:32"/>
Pope and all his Cardinalles, were as poore as
euer was <hi>Iobe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would make it ſeeme an iniury, that this
treaſure is employed in the warres of Fraunce,
becauſe that realme hathe bene a defender of the
Romaine Churche in all their oppreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: where
as it rather might ſeeme an iniury, yf the Pope
ſhould not now relieue them, that had aſsiſted
the Church in former oppreſsions, who I think
he cannot meane to haue bene <hi>Nauarr</hi> and his
<hi>Huguenotes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verely it ſeemeth, that this mannes great
proſperitie do the make him to forget himſelf, &amp;
dothe bereaue him of his iudgement. For who
may els imagyne that his vanitie ſhould be ſo
great, or his lack of wiſer matter ſo litle, as to ſet
foorth in proclamation that the King of Spaine
did practize with men of baſe birth of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
nation, who giueth credit vnto none, but
vnto ſuch as to whome all Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome yeildeth
honor, for their knowne vertue and wiſdome,
being alſo of honorable, or very honeſt pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage

that one <hi>Cecill</hi> was now come to beare ſo great
ſway in the courte, whoſe name in his tyme was
ſo obſcure in the countri. Neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidereth he,
that albeit by his owne pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage he is but meane,
that he hath litle betred himſelf by his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
his firſt wyf being but the ſiſter of a <hi>Peda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1289:33"/>
and his later ſo lately come out of the kitchin,
that her poſteritie for ſome diſcents, muſt nedes
ſmell of the fat of the frying pan: which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleſſe
here to be aleaged, were it not to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

as fethers in the ayre: who in reſpect of meane pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rentage
do neuer accompt the leſſe of wiſe or
woorthy mennes qualities.</p>
            <p>It is alſo a lyke matter of moment, that he
ſpeaketh of the Kinges charges for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of ſtudents, vnleſſe it be to inſinuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
aſwell of his as of the Popes expences: but
his ſaying that they are a number of diſſolute
yong men, is an exceeding ſhamefull &amp; mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
flaunder.</p>
            <p>He would proue that none are put to deathe
for religion, becauſe as he ſaith numbers of men,
of welth of contrary religion, are not touched in
their lyves, landes, goodes, or liberties, but with
the payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a pecuniary ſomme (which being
but a trifle of 20. pounde the moneth he nameth
not) and yet many haue ſcarſly the libertie of
their priſons, while theire landes, and goodes
are ſeazed on, for this pecuniary trifle. And yf
any fewe for ſome colour of clemencie be ſet at
liberty, their licence comonly excedeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
20. dayes, and it is bothe vnder bondes &amp;

               </gap>es, with limitation of their reſidence. And
becauſe theſe numbers are not put to death for
religion, he ſeeketh to proue that none are put to
death for religion: which he thinketh he may
the rather auouch, for that neither Ieſuites, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
prieſtes, nor other Catholikes, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1289:33"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to death for ſaying or hearing
<hi>Maſſe</hi> or the lyke, but the one is condemned and
put to death becauſe he is a prieſt, and the other
for receyuing him. VVhereby the world may
vnderſtand, that no Catholike ſhould be put
death for any exerciſe of his religion, ſo
he would not come in the company of prieſtes:
nor prieſtes, yf they would remaine and vſe
their functins in <hi>Italy</hi> or other countries,
ſhould not be put to death for treaſon in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no leſſe ridiculous, to call the Lord Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall
a ſcholer, who being now threeſcore yeares
of age, hathe bene choſen to be a head and
gouernour of colleges and ſchollers, bothe in
England &amp; in other countries, aboue 36. yeares
paſt. And hathe profeſſed in diuers famous vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities,

and in the opinion of the beſt and wiſeſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtendome,

            <p>If M. <hi>Cecill</hi> himſelf, had obtayned his eſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for vertue and honeſt endeuours, &amp; ſo had

&amp; the hazard of the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the realme
ſo arrogantly to aduaunce himſelf, and to extole
his owne glory in painted pedegrees, borrowed
and farr fetched: and his poſteritie might then
more longer haue retained their honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
then perhappes they are now lyke to do,
becauſe great treaſure heaped together by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyne

be true, it is not impoſsible but his houſe as it
hathe begun, ſo it may end with himſelf. And
this perhaps he ſomwhat ſuſpecteth and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
as all tyrantes are woont, dothe ſeeke to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
himſelf by the effuſion of innocent blood: as
thoughe that were the only way to auoyde all

And that his vniuſt accuſing of innocent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>For it is he, that neither of conſcyence, nor

hathe wrought the mutation and change of
religion, where of ſuch wonderfull inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

haue followed.</p>
            <p>It is he, that hathe procured the enmytie,
which Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hathe at this preſent with ſo-ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
Chriſtian Princes and ſtates, &amp; chiefly with
the moſt potent King of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1289:34"/>
It is he, that for the proſecuting of his impious

of the naturall people of the realme to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in forreyne countries.</p>
            <p>It is he, that hathe cauſed ſo-many great and

treaſure of the Queene &amp; realme for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of rebells, and purchaſing of enemyes to his

            <p>It is he, that hathe bene the occaſion, that the
Queene (contrary to her owne honor,<note place="margin">Leiceſter Hatton.</note> and the
well lyking of her other counſelors which ſhe

to forreyne princes: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hathe euer vtterly perſwaded her from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,

            <p>It is he, that was one of the moſt principall
contriuers of the deuyſed plott, for the treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſlaughter of the Scottiſh Queene, which
will redownde vnto the eternall infamy of Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land,
and dothe threaten a continuall reuenge.</p>
            <p>It his he, that becauſe he could not ſomtyme
eſtabliſh ſuch heyr apparent as he liſted, hathe
lefte the ſucceſsion of the crowne ſo confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among ſomany competitors, bothe within,

the effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the blood of infynite thowſandes,
more then alredy he hathe brought to diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>It is he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hathe bene the cauſer of al the

brought into ſuch a labyrinth of calamities, as
neuer the ſame, nor any other can be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred
to haue bene brought vnto. And as this hathe
bene wrought by himſelf and not by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lykes,
ſo himſelf and not Catholykes, is iuſtly
therefore to be accuſed and blamed. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
he do now in ſupreame aucthoritie falſly
impute vnto others the crymes of treaſons, and
trecheries: yf the matter might come to any
equall hearing before indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges, it ſhould
cleerely be prooued, that he which wiſheth the
reformation of his country, cannot be a traitor
to his country: but that <hi>Cecill</hi> being the cauſer of
the moſt enormious euills thereof, is a traitor
himſelf, and the greateſt, that euer England
nowriſhed, and farr more noyſome and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to the realme, then euer were the <hi>Spencers,
Peeter</hi> of <hi>Gauerſtone,</hi> or any other that euer abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
either Prince or people. And becauſe no man
dare frame an endytement againſt him, I will
heere omit many other articles of highe treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but yf any will vndertake to iuſtifie his actions
in his courſe of gouernment, let him know, that
there is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter of reply reſerued for him,
which is not extracted out of <hi>Mother Hubberds</hi>
tale,<note place="margin">Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poia or mother Hubberds tale.</note> of the falſe fox and his crooked cubbes,
but is to be vttred in plaine proſe, and ſhal lay
open to the world, his birth, his lyf, and perhaps
his death, ſeing his deteſtable actions are ſuch, as
do aſke vengeance of heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>It is a lamentable grief to conſider, that the
manifold harmes which comonly the afflicted
ſubiects do ſuffer, the Princes themſelues do
neuer feele, and that the perills &amp; dangers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1289:35"/>
wherein they do ſtand, are kept from their ſight
and knowlege by ſuch, as in whome they repoſe
ouermuch truſt and confidence, vntill with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
they do fall vpon their owne heades, and
comonly when all remedy is paſt to auoyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And thus the great euills which are cauſed by
one man, do redownde vnto the vniuerſall
harme, both of the Prince and people. How
greatly dangerous is it then for any Prince, to
be wholy led and conducted by the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of one man, and to deliuer the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his or
her eares, vnto the deceitfull tonge of a flatterer.
By ſuch meanes was the puiſant Emperor <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaigne,</hi>
miſguyded, whoſe ouer-great affyance
in the wicked counſell of one only <hi>Gano,</hi> was
the occaſion of wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull harmes, that fell bothe

            </lg>
            <p>And happy were it for the Queene &amp; realme
of England, yf all the ſuſtayned or expected har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of that Prince or people, being directly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by one man, might iuſtly redownd vpon the

But moſt infortunate is it, that he which hathe

            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1289:38"/>
THus good reader haue I briefly ended this
precedent diſcours,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and declared vnto thee
bothe by whoſe meanes, and in what manner,
the realme of <hi>England</hi> is diſtreſſed with ſomany
preſent calamities, and deliuered to ſuch feares,
of greater future troobles.</p>
            <p>The mature conſideration of the premiſes, I
refer vnto thy indifferent iudgement. The iuſt
blame of theſe euills, where it is iuſtly deſerued.
And the reformation of ſo great iniquity, to
the infynite mercy of almighty God: who vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf
to woork theſame, by the ſweeteſt, &amp; eaſieſt
meanes, that his iuſtice may admitt.</p>
            <p>And now in concluſion I haue not deemed it
amiſſe, to giue the ſome caueat of a vile and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
kynde of dealing, which the aduerſary of late
hathe vſed, in diuulging nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of falſe and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matorie
libells: which it ſeemeth cuſtome hathe
made ſo familiar to the libellers themſelues, that
by an ordinary habite which therein they haue
gotten, they ſeme to haue forgotten, that there
is any difference betwene lying, and telling
ttuthe: for otherwiſe it might be preſumed, they
would neuer ſo greatly buſy themſelues, ſo
egregiouſly to abuſe the world. And albeit as the
Pſalme ſaith <hi>Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tita est iniquitas ſibi,</hi> &amp; that theſe
libells do comonly cary their owne diſcredit in
themſelues, by being ouercharged with moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pable
lies: yet becauſe they tend vnto the furthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance
of the pretended Goſpell, and that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
of that cauſe ſo much requireth it, they
muſt paſſe without contradiction of them that
can detect them of falſhoode, and be taken for
verities, of thoſe that are not able to diſcerne
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1289:38"/>
them for vntruthes. And therefore in reſpect of
pitie of the abuſed multytude, I wil make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall
of ſome fewe of this kynde, to the end that
the reader may giue ſuch creditt vnto the lyke
hereafter, as he ſhall well perceaue the former to
haue deſerued.</p>
            <p>Of theſe ſortes of libells, many do declare
great numbers of French &amp; Flemiſh victories,
which are ſo famous, that ſundry of them were
neuer knowne nor heard of in all the world, but
only in England.</p>
            <p>Others are of obſcure and tryfling matters,<note place="margin">Printed by vv Blac vvall.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch as is that of the happy conqueſt of the
ſuburbes of <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Others tell of viſions in the ayre,<note place="margin">Printed by Nelſon. 1590.</note> which are
enterpreted to preſage detriment to thoſe of the
league.</p>
            <p>Somtymes they are of propheſied victories
before they happen,<note place="margin">Printed by VVoolf 1590.</note> and appointed tymes of the
death of Princes, as that the duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
ſhould die at martinmas 1590.</p>
            <p>Some are of triumphes of victories,<note place="margin">Printed by Allde. 1591.</note> before
they be obtayned, as when the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
was to go with his forces into Normandie.</p>
            <p>Some haue bene ſet foorthe to make loſſes
ſeeme victories,<note place="margin">Printed 1589.</note> as the diſcours of the Portugall
voyage,<note place="margin">And by ponſonby 1591.</note> and the loſſe of the Reuenge.</p>
            <p>And whereas there was one <hi>Caçalla</hi> &amp; others
of his company,<note place="margin">Printed by Nelſon 1591.</note> executed for Hereſy and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſie
at <hi>Validolid</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> 30. yeares paſt: the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of this execution is in an Engliſh libell newly
ſet foorth, and ſaid to be for profeſsion of the
Goſpell, and to be donne but of late.</p>
            <p>In lyke ſorte is very perticularly ſet downe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1289:39"/>
the glorious &amp; conſtant martirdome of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſhma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince) in the towne of Dunkerck,<note place="margin">Printed at Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1590.</note>
whoſe torments endured fowre dayes: &amp; yet
there was neuer any ſuch man, nor any ſuch
matter hard of in the ſaid towne, as all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
will witneſſe.</p>
            <p>So was it publiſhed,<note place="margin">Printed by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot 1591.</note> that the King of Spaine
(whome the libeller calleth the <hi>Archtyrant</hi> of the
world) was dead.</p>
            <p>And another libell that came foorthe of late
entituled <hi>A fig for the Spaniard</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicteth that
lie,<note place="margin">Printed by VVoolf 1592.</note> with another as manifeſt an vntruthe, and
ſaith that <hi>Phillip</hi> of Spaine is not dead, but lyeth
bedred.</p>
            <p>In all theſe and ſundry other lyke lybells,<note place="margin">As in the forged co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion Printed by VVoolf 1590.</note> it
ſeemeth they haue chalenged vnto themſelues
a kynde of priuilege, to raile and raue at Princes,
and to be-ly and ſlaunder whome they liſt: and
this good dealing is vſed, for the aduauncement
of the cauſe of the Goſpell, but argueth in dede,
that all the plotts and practizes of the aduetſary
as they firſt were begun, ſo haue they bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynued,
and ſo are they ſtill vpholden and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped,
with cogging, foiſting, lying and cooſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
which equity &amp; truthe hathe euer deteſted,
and all honorable ſtates and honeſt myndes, do
vtterly abhorr. Neither is theſame able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe
the vſurped credit of the newnamed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell,
but muſt needes in tyme bring it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme
hatred and contempt.</p>
            <p>And it ſeemeth that the exceding malice of
ſome of theſe libellers,<note place="margin">The fig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giuer.</note> hath tranſported them
into ſuch a feruour of folly, that they imagyne all
Chriſtendome (without any queſtion to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1289:39"/>
bothe to knowe &amp; acknowledge, <hi>Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyns</hi>
expoſition of the Goſpell (as it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in England) to be the very Goſpell of
Chriſt in dede: els would they neuer ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rily
raile at other princes and people, for not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
theſame.</p>
            <p>The Sacred Scripture and true Goſpell of
Chriſt, as it hathe euer bene inuiolably preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Catholike Churche, ſo is it only of
that Churche moſt highly eſteemed, and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.
And no Caluiniſts or other Sectaries, haue
any ſcripture at all, that they haue not had from
that Churche. And by this true Goſpell and
woord of God, the woord of Caluyne, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Goſpell of Proteſtants, is clerely proued
to be falſe and flat hereſy. And yf the Engliſh
Goſpellers, will not ſtand to the iudgement of
Catholikes in this point, all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many</hi>
will reſolutely offer to prooue the ſame alſo
out of a ſuppoſed Goſpell of theirs, which they
as confidently chalenge to themſelues, as any
Engliſhe Goſpellers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſsibli claime any other.
And therefore my maſters in England, muſt not
ſo run in crie with their peculier <hi>Goſpell,</hi> as to
chyde others for nor following the ſame, when
they belieue it not to be true, but do truly belieue
it to be falſe. And ſo leauing this later clauſe for
<hi>A fig to the figmonger.</hi> I wiſh the reader to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the diſcordant Engliſh Goſpell of hereſy,
and the Goſpellers libells, of malitious lies.</p>
