         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in vs: and affliction that followes vs in the following of
Christ. Against both these the Apostle furnishes the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

remanents of sinne, wee haue from the 1. verse to the 18.
Comforts against our afflictions, wee haue from the midst

triumph is first set downe generally, verse 31.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 31.</note>

We come then to the first part of the Chapter,<note place="margin">Subdiuision of the first part.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Apostle keepes this order. First, hee sets downe a

that which goeth before. Seeing wee are iustified by Faith

vnder Grace; seeing we are buryed with Christ by Baptisme
into his death, that like as he was raised from the dead by
the glory of his Father, so we also should walke in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of life, hauing receiued that spirit of Christ, whereby
wee fight against the Law of sinne in our members, which
rebelleth against the Law of our minde: seeing it is so, we

neuer be able to condemne vs.</p>

that he did the euill which he would not, and that he saw a

but now hee reioyceth in Christ, that sinne in him is not
able to condemne him. It is then a false exposition of these

for the Apostle condemnes these motions of sinne, which

this of himselfe, what blinde presumption is this in them,
to exempt themselues, or others from such motions, as are
worthy to be damned, wee shall still confesse our guiltines,

spirit of God in holy Scripture expresses our vnion with

Christ is the husband, and we the spouse. Secondly, by a
body, whereof Christ is the head, and wee the members.
Thirdly, by a building or house, wherein Christ is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

which is nourished.</p>
                     <p>As for the similitude of Marriage,<note place="margin">As Eue was to Adam, his wife his sister, and his Daughter, so are we vnto Christ.</note> the strongest bands of

made immediately by the hand of that same Father who
made <hi>Adam,</hi> and that without <hi>Adams</hi> helpe: shee was
also his Daughter, for of him shee was made, bone of his
bone, and flesh of his flesh. All these wayes are we alyed

                        <hi>this concupiscence which sometime the

vnto them, for he protests of himselfe that he resisted these
motions of sin, but was oftentimes sore against his will cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued

no consent vnto them; for the Law (as I haue said) doth
not onely condemne sinne in the branch, but also in the root,
<hi>there shall not bee in thee an euill thought against the Lord thy

nature is a thing indifferent,<note place="margin">By Reason.</note> if that whereunto I consent be

euill: if the first motion of sinne be not an euill thing in it

it: for that which is not euill in it selfe, by my consenting
cannot become euill. It is not then the consent following,

These are the three helpes to keepe our hart in the way of
God, so necessary that if without them we doe any worke,
it is not possible but wee shall bee snared. And therefore
as in a ship which is ready to sayle, so soone as the sayles are

and make our selues ready to go forward in our pilgrimage,

we begin to keepe a good course. By supplication vve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

Againe, <hi>the law of the spirit of life in Christ,</hi> is no other thing
but that forcible working liuely power vvhich is in Christ:
for it is customable to the holy Apostle to vse the vvord
<hi>law</hi> to expresse any thing, wherein there is a commanding
or working power; so hee hath ascribed a law to sinne, a
law to his members, a law to death, and now very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
hee oppones vnto them <hi>a law of the spirit of life in
Christ,</hi> vvhich is more liuely and powerfull to saue, to free,
and to quicken, then any law that hath contrary power, can
be able to destroy, captiue, or slay them who are in Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thus the words being expounded,<note place="margin">Our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Sathan, sinne &amp; death, are strong, but our Sauiour is stronger.</note> the first lesson will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise

contrary power of man and Angell in subiecton to him,
that tyrant sinne hath indeede oppressed and ouer-ruled
many a one, but our Lord Iesus the valiant conquerour
hath a mightie power able to disanull the lavv of sinne: and
Sathan is that strong one vvho by nature possesses the hart
of man, as his owne house, but Iesus is that stronger one,

the contrary sinne that was dead without the lavv, is reuiued
by the law, and takes occasion to worke in vs all manner of

neighbours fruit, not so much for loue of the fruit, for hee
had better at home, as for a sinfull delight he had to goe with
his companions to commit euill: so that where the lavv
should haue restrayned his sinfull nature, it was so much the
more prouoked to sinne by the lavv. Let therefore the

Surely neither man nor Angell could haue euer
thought of such a way of Saluation, the Lord hath found

to saue man, that the glory both of his mercie and iustice

<hi>Pater non indiciorum, sed misericordiarum,</hi> Father not of
iudgements but of mercies,<note place="margin">Why God is called father of mercie not of iudgements.</note> for both the purpose, and the
meanes of our saluation are from himselfe: hee hath found
causes without him, mouing to execute his iustice, hee hath

Angels, and man; but a cause mouing him to shew mercie

of the primitiue Church to expresse the presumption of

                     <p>But to returne,<note place="margin">The diuers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Christian and carnall man flowes from the diuersitie of their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> this diuersitie of dispositions in the man
naturall and spirituall, the Apostle designes to flow from
the diuersitie of their generations, <hi>they who are after the flesh,</hi>
that is as our Sauiour expounds it, <hi>that which is borne of the
flesh, is flesh:</hi> so then the cause why they are carnall and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
onely the things of the flesh, is because they are onely
pertakers of a carnall generation. Euery creature, as ye may
see,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 6.</note> hath an inclination to follow the owne kind, some liues
in the earth, some in the water, euery one of them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
of that nature, which they receiued in their generation,
following so earnestly their owne kinde, that a contrarie
education cannot make them to forsake it. The Fowle
whose kinde is to liue in the waters, though she be brought
vp vnder the wings of another damme, whose kinde is to
liue in the earth, so soone, as shee is strengthened with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
forsaking her education, followes her kinde: so also
in euery man the disposition of his affections and actions is
answerable to the nature of his life. If he haue no more but
a naturall life, his cogitations, counsels, resolutions, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are onely carnall, but if he haue also a spirituall life, then
shall he be able to mount aboue nature, hauing an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

seekes those things which are aboue.</p>
                     <p>Now this difference of ther dispositions,<note place="margin">The contrary disposition of the christian &amp; carnall man appeares.</note> flowing from

first is, that where this holy spirit comes to dwel, he repaires

to the reparation of our bodies, it consists partly in making
all the members thereof weapons of righteousnesse in this

the holy Ghosts operation is speciall, and proper to the
godly, by the vvhich hee doth not onely illuminate their
mindes, but proceeds also to their harts, and workes this
threefold effect in it, Sanctification, Intercession, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
                     <p>First he is vnto them a spirit of Sanctification,<note place="margin">Three effects wrought by the speciall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the spirit in the godly.</note> renuing
their harts by his effectuall grace, hee first rebukes them of
sinne, he wakens their conscience with some sight of their

in their whole behauiour, that their former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
become painefull vnto them, and others who knevv
them before wonders to see such a change in them. From
this he proceeds and leads them to a sight of Gods mercie
in Christ, hee inflames their harts with a hunger &amp; thirst
for that mercie, and workes in their hearts such a loue of
righteousnesse, and hatred of sinne, that now they become
more afraid of the occasions of sinne, then they were before
of sinne it selfe: this resistance made to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

care to eschew the occasions of sinne, is an vndoubted token
of the spirit of Christ dwelling in thee.</p>
                     <p>This is the first operation of the spirit, but it is not all,
he proceeds yet further by degrees: for the kingdom of God
is as if a man should cast seede into the earth, which growes
vp and vve cannot tell how, first it sends out the blade, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the eares, and then the cornes; so proceeds the

the holy spirit becomes to the godly a spirit of Intercession,

                     <p>And thirdly hee becomes vnto them the spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
if he be vnto thee a sanctifier, and an intercessor,
hee shall not faile at the last to be thy comforter: If at the
first after that thou hast sent vp supplications, thou find not
his consolation descending vpon thee, be not discouraged,
but be the more humbled; for alas our sinnes shortens his

wherein the soule being reconsiled with God by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

is the estate of glory, wherein both of them being ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

we haue lost it; as for the second, the reprobate stands in it,

so much offend him, as the licentiousnesse of bastard Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who will sinne the more freely because Christ hath
suffered for sinne: they heare that a man is not iustified by
good workes, and therefore being deceiued by Sathans so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie,
they cease to doe well, not considering that good
workes must proue wee are sanctified, and sanctification
must proue that wee are iustified. In the second verse, the
Apostle said that <hi>Christ hath freed vs from the Law of sinne;</hi>
and here he sayth, that <hi>hee hath made vs debters to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi>
these are not contrary, they agree very well together,
hee hath loosed vs from the seruice of all other Masters,
that he might binde vs the more straightly to serue himselfe.</p>

O how many Lords hath that man who hath not Christ
to be his Lord? assuredly there is no thing which will not
vsurpe superioritie ouer thee, who liues not as a bound ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
to Iesus Christ: either thy belly shall become thy God,
and for a mease of pottage with <hi>Esau,</hi> thou shalt sell thy
birth-right and blessing, or a wedge of gold shall become
thy confidence, and thou shalt not care for gaine to loose a
good conscience: or then some other vncouth Lord who
hath no title to thee shall tyrannize ouer thee. Thus wee
see that the Christian libertie we haue by Christ, makes vs
free from the seruitude of sinne, as the Apostle teacheth vs,
and not free to commit sinne, as the carnall Atheist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues

should refuse to doe that dutie vnto the Lord our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
which wee craue to our selues from our Inferiours.
The Lord hath made vs, wee made not our selues; his hand
hath formed and shaped vs; the life we haue wee hold it of
him; we can not abide a moment longer in this house of our
earthly tabernacle, than the Lords thinkes expedient, his

his hand: seeing wee our selues craue seruice of those to
whem we giue the smallest things, shall wee not much more
giue seruice vnto GOD, from whom wee receiue the
greatest?</p>
                     <p>The other is the bond of Redemption.<note place="margin">Redemption: here consider first, that we are bought seruants.</note> Wherein we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

wages before hand; all for this end, that vve should serue
him. <hi>Ye are bought</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>with a price, therefore

And againe, <hi>wee are redeemed, not with corruptible things, as

and the poynt of a Diamond, and they shall at length be

with a good conscience desire the Lord to discharge it, nor
exempt vs from it, but wee must in all humilitie craue
Grace of God, that wee being enriched by him, who of our

how then can wee but drowne in this debt, seeing no day

which we owe vnto him? To this there is giuen a three-fold
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> comfort,<note place="margin">The Lord to whom we owe it, giues vs wherewith to pay it.</note> first the Lord dealeth with vs as a louing liberall
man dealeth with his debter, who knowing that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his owne, wherewith to pay him, and not willing
to put him to shame, stops priuately into his hand, that
which publikely againe he may giue vnto him, so the Lord
conuaies secret grace into the hearts of his children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are in some measure able to serue him: but as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
protested,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14.</note> so may wee all, whatsoeuer wee giue vnto the
Lord, wee haue it of his owne hand. Secondly, the Lord
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our God is so gracious that hee is content to accept part of
payment at our hand,<note place="margin">He accepts for a time part of payment.</note> till wee bee able to doe better, if our
faith bee but like the graine of Mustard seede, yet if it bee
true, the Lord will not despise it; though our repentance be
not perfect and absolute; though our prayers bee weake;
though wee cannot doe the good that wee would, yet the
good that wee doe is accepted at his hands through Iesus
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Christ. And thirdly, wee haue this comfort, that the more
wee pay of this debt of obedience,<note place="margin">The more wee pay of this debt the more we are able to pay.</note> the more wee are able
to pay. In other debts it is not so: for if the more be payed
out by him that is indebted, the lesse remaines behinde vnto
himselfe, but here the more wee pay, the richer wee are; the
doing of one good worke of seruice vnto the Lord makes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9473:65"/>
vs both more willing, and able to doe an other, the talents
of spirituall Graces being of that nature, that the more
they are vsed the more they are encreased, and these should

that as euery thing in them sinned, so euery thing in them

astonish man to consider this; for if now any one of Gods

be? he vvho novv is payned vvith the tooth ach, takes some

of water that drowned the originall world, lasted but a yeere,
the famine that plagued Aegipt lasted but seauen yeeres,
the captiuitie of Israell was ended in seauenty yeeres, but this
wrath of God vpon the damned shall endure for euer and
euer. Thus wee see what a horrible death the Apostle
threatneth here, vvhile hee sayth, <hi>if yee liue after the flesh yee
shall dye.</hi> The Lord giue vs wise and vnderstanding hearts,
that we may ponder it according to the waight therof, and
it may be to vs a liuely voyce of God, to prouoke vs to flee

                        <note place="margin">In the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate there is some thing that needes to be mortified.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here followes the other member
of the argument, taken from the great vantage wee receiue
by mortifying the lusts of the body, if wee doe so wee shall
liue. Here also we haue first to consider that albeit the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
affirmed before verse 9. that these godly Romanes were
not in the flesh, yet now he exhorts them to a further mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the lusts of the flesh, which were superfluous if
there vvere nothing in them that needed to be mortified:
then we see clearely, vvhich we may also feele in our selues,
that so long as we liue in the bodie, there is euer some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
life of sinne, vvhich vvee haue neede to mortifie and
put out. In this battell we must fight without intermission,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:9473:70"/>
till we haue gotten the victory: for vvho can say that he hath
in such sort cut away his superfluities, that there remaynes
nothing in him, which hath need of reforming: beleeue me
when they are cut off they spring,<note place="margin">For out of the stony rocke springeth noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some weedes.</note> when they are chased
away they returne, when they are once quenched they kindle
againe, except thou dissemble, thou shalt alway finde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thy selfe something that hath need to be subdued. There
is nothing harder (sayth <hi>Cyrill</hi>) than the Rocke,<note place="margin">Cyrill.</note> yet in the
seames and clifts thereof the noysome weede fasteneth her
roote, and springes out: and albeit there be no man in the
vvorld stronger than a Christian, yet is hee oftentimes buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted
by Sathan and sinne, which hath fastened their roote
in him, sends out her inordinate motions and affections, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vvhich hee hath neede to fight continually.</p>
                     <p>But here it is inquired,<note place="margin">That which God works in vs he calles it our worke.</note> how doth the Apostle require
this of them, that they should mortifie their lusts? lyeth it
in the power of man to doe it? To this I answere, first that
as man gaue life to sinne, so is hee bound to put out the life
thereof vpon no lesse paine than condemnation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
iustly is it required of him. Secondly, these same good
workes vvhich the Lord vvorkes in vs, hee is content to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them to vs, and calles them ours. Of our selues vve
must say with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>we are not sufficient of our selues
to thinke so much as a good thought,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Therefore vve should be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and giue God the glory</note> our sufficiencie is of God,
and it is hee who worketh in vs both the vvill and the deed:
so hee workes in vs that he makes vs through his grace vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vvorkers vvith him, through him that strengthens vs
vve are able to doe all things, and therefore the praise of
all the good wee can doe should be ascribed vnto God.
When <hi>Dauid</hi> had offered to God aboundance of siluer and
gold, and other mettels vvhich hee had prepared for the
house of God, hee concludes in the humilitie of his heart,
<hi>What am I O Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Chro. 29. 14</note> 
                        <hi>and what is my people, that wee should be
able to offer willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee,
and of thine owne hand haue wee giuen thee.</hi> But much more
vvhen vve doe any worke of sanctification, for the building
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:9473:71"/>
of our selues vp into a spirituall Temple to the Lord our
God, we may say, O Lord all the good wee can doe is of
thee, and of thine owne hand wee haue giuen backe vnto
thee, for except thou Lord hadst giuen vnto vs grace, vve
should neuer haue giuen to thee obedience.</p>
                     <p>Let therefore the presumptuous conceit of Merit yet
againe be farre from vs,<note place="margin">Presumptuous opinion of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit damned.</note> seeing the good which vve doe is

as it were by correction, <hi>yet not I but the grace of God in me:</hi>

any thing from vs, but by promosing freely to vs that which
pleased him: and therefore when we are exhorted to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the body by the spirit, let vs first turne this
and the like of the precepts into prayers, that the Lord
would enable vs by grace to doe that which he commaunds
vs, and then when in some measure we haue done it, that we
returne the praise and glory to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">A tryall of our Mortification.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seeing the first part of our sanctification
is called mortification, vve are to consider hovv in this word
there lurkes a rule, vvhereby euery man may try hovv farre
forth he hath profited in sanctification, vve see by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that the neerer a man drawes to death, the lesse motion
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:9473:71"/>
is in him, but after hee is once dead hee moues not at all;
present him pleasant obiects, they delight him not, praise
him, yet he is not puffed vp, speake euill of him, yet he is
not offended: euen so is it with the spirituall man, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
progresse he makes in sanctification, the motions of sin
are euer the weaker in him, the pleasures of the world moues
him not, as they were wont, if thou praise him, the breath
of thy mouth cannot lift him vp, if thou offend him, the
more he is mortified, the lesse he is grieued. As a man (saith
<hi>Basile</hi>) being dead is seperate from those with whom he was
conuersant before, so hee who is mortified is instantly sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in his affections from those who before were his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
companions in sinne: yea those actions wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
before, are a griefe vnto him now, it is a vexation
of his soule to heare and see the vnrighteous deedes of the
wicked, which were wont to be vnto him the matter of his
sport and laughter.</p>
                     <p>Therefore doth he wish,<note place="margin">Death to sinne takes not life away but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores it.</note> and so should we, that we might
alwayes die this kind of death, <hi>foelix mors quae alienum facit
hominem ab hoc saeculo,</hi> certainly it is a happy death which
alienates, and turnes away the hart of man from the loue
of this world. <hi>Bona mors quippe vitam non aufert, sed trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert
in melius,</hi> for it is a good kinde of death, which doth
not take life away, but changes it into a better. But alas how
farre are we from this spirituall disposition? doth not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
countenance of one in wordly authoritie terrifie vs?
the disdainfull words of men doe they not put vs out of the
state of patience? if the world flatter vs are we not puft vp?
if she frowne vpon vs, are wee not cast downe? and this
our great weakenesse proceeds onely from the strength of
sinne in vs: this lets vs see what cause we haue to bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
considering that hauing liued long in this time of grace,
yet haue we profited little in the mortification of our sinfull
lusts and affections.</p>
                     <p>Againe, out of this same word of Mortification, wee
learne that the worke of our Sanctification is a worke of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:9473:72"/>
difficultie,<note place="margin">Sanctification is a work of difficultie, for it is a birth, a death, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, &amp;c.</note> not accomplished without labour, paine, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
for it receiues these three names, as to bee called, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
Regeneration, and Circumcision. As no birth,
no death, no cutting off the flesh can bee without dolour
and sorrow; so the conuersion of a sinner is not wrought
without inward paine and sorrow. The Infant that hath laid
but nine Moneths in the wombe of the mother, is not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
without great paine, suppose shee conceiued it with
pleasure: and shalt thou thinke to part with sinne, which
in thee was conceiued with thee, and which since so often
thou hast nourished with pleasure, and not to proue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the New-birth? No assuredly. In the worke of
mans conuersion, there is the contrite spirit, the humbled
heart, the mourning weede, the melting eye, the pale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
the voyce of lamentation; let not such as feele them,
if they find therwith a rending of their affections from their
old sins, be troubled; for these are but the dolors of their new
birth; and for others who know not these inward humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

sets downe a short discription in this and the
subsequent verse, of a threefold operation which
the spirit maketh in them whom he leadeth: for
first, he is vnto them a spirit of bondage, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feare: Secondly, he is a Spirit of Adoption, working loue
through the sense of Gods mercy, for hee not onely makes
them whom hee leades the Sonnes of God, but intimates
vnto their spirits Gods loue towards them, which otherwise
was vnknowne vnto them: and thirdly, hee is a Spirit of
intercession, making vs to goe with boldnesse to the throne
of grace, and call vpon God as vpon our Father. Of the
which the first part of his argument is made cleare, that they
who are led by the spirit of God are the Sonnes of God,
yea, by the testimonie of the Spirit they themselues know
that it is so, and therefore in most homely and humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
acknowledge him for their Father. This the Apostle
propones in such a manner that hee applyes it particularly
to the Godly Romaines, vnto whom hee writeth, <hi>Yee haue
not</hi> (saith he) <hi>receiued againe the Spirit of bondage vnto feare,</hi>
as yee did in the time of your first conuersion; yee haue
proceeded further, and haue experience of his other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
then yee felt him casting you downe with the sight
of your sinnes, but now ye feele him comforting you and
raising you vp with the sense of Gods loue and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
you in Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>The spirit of God is called <hi>a Spirit of bondage vnto feare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why in his first operation he is called a spirit of bondage to fear</note>
not as if hee made them in whom hee worketh slaues or
bond-men, but because in his first operation hee rebukes
them of sinne, in whom hee worketh, and lets them see that
bondage and seruitude vnder which they lye, which works
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9473:74"/>
in them an horrible feare, but in his second operation he is
a spirit of Adoption, making them free who were bound
before; comforting them with the sight of Gods mercy,
whom before he terrified with the sight of their owne sins,
to the one hee vseth the preaching of the Law, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers
our disease; to the other the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">By the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law he discouers sin and wrath due to it, which causeth feare.</note>
which points out the Physition. As the proclayming
of the Law wrought a terrour in their hearts who heard it,
so doth the preaching thereof: for who can heare himselfe
accursed and condemned by the mouth of God and not
tremble? <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist began at the preaching of the
Law,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Now is the axe laid to the root of the tree, euery tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewen downe and cast into
the fire:</hi> then hee proceeded and poynted out the Lambe
of God that takes away the sinnes of the world; by the first
hee prepared a way to the second: for his auditours being
cast downe in themselues with the threatning, enquired
earnestly <hi>what shall wee doe then that we may bee saued?</hi> and
were glad to heare of a remedy. It is out of doubt, that they
who are not touched with a remorse for their sinnes, nor a
feare of the wrath to come, and into whose hearts neuer
entred that care, <hi>what shall I doe that I may be saued?</hi> haue
not knowne as yet so much as the very beginnings of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>Wee are not then to thinke here,<note place="margin">Hee is not here comparing the godly vnder the Law vvith the godly vnder the Gospell.</note> that the Apostle is
comparing the Godly vnder the Gospell, with the Godly
vnder the Law, but hee is comparing the Godly vnder the
Gospell with themselues; their second experience of the
operation of the Spirit with the first, it is true that once
(sayth hee) <hi>yee receiued the Spirit of bondage working feare,</hi>
this was his first operation in you, but now yee haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

in them.<note place="margin">A seruile feare.</note> The third sort is seruile feare, the obiect
whereof is the iudgements of God onely: and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that they loue their sinnes, and hates and abhorres euery
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> one that doth snibbe or restraine them in the course of their
sinnes.<note place="margin">A filiall feare.</note> The fourth is filiall, so called because it is proper
to the sonnes of God; they doe not onely feare him for his
iudgements,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 4.</note> but loue him and feare him for his mercy: <hi>mercy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is with thee O Lord, that thou mayst be feared.</hi> As for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall
feare,<note place="margin">A Diabolicall feare.</note> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith the Diuels know there is a

shall neuer be recalled, they seeke no mercy, nor shall they
obtaine it: and the seruile feare of the wicked shall at the last
end in this desperate feare of the damned, finding themselues
condemned, without all further hope of mercy, they shall
tremble and feare continually.</p>
                     <p>Of this it is euident that the feare wherof here he speaks
is the first part of filiall feare,<note place="margin">From what sort of feare are we exempted?</note> namely, a feare of that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is due to sinne, and to the godly is an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
to worke in them feare of God for his mercies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
with loue: so then his meaning is cleere, albeit in the
time of your first conuersion you were striken with a feare
of that wrath which is the recompense of sinne, yet now the
spirit of adoption hath not onely released you of that feare
of damnation, which you conceiued at the first, through the
knowledge of your sinnes, but hath also made you certaine
of saluation, and assured that God is become your father in
Christ Iesus.</p>
                     <p>In the wicked the feare of Gods wrath once begunne
encreases daily, till it proceede as I spake, to that desperate

feare of the damned,<note place="margin">In the godly feare prepares a place for the perfect loue of God, and then departs it selfe.</note> but in the godly the feare of Gods
iudgements is but a preparation to the loue of God, feare
shall not alwayes abide in their harts, for when God shall
crowne them with his mercies, and his loue in them shall
be perfect, then perfect loue casts out feare: therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
compares the feare of Gods iudgements in the godly
to a Needle, that goes through the seame, and prepares in
it a place for the thread, which is to remaine: so doth the
feare of Gods iudgements goe through the secret seames
of the hart, and prepares a place for the loue of God, which
shall abide and continue for euer in the godly, when feare
shall bee away. The Lord at the first deales hardly with
his children,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> as our Sauiour delt with the woman of Canaan,
whom hee comforted at the last; and as <hi>Ioseph</hi> entreated his
brethren roughly, whom at the last for tender compassion
hee imbraced with many teares: but all these terrours and
feares wherewith God humbles his owne, are but prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
to his consolations; at the length hee shall make it
knowne to them, that hee is their louing father: as for the
wicked, though they haue not suffered from their youth the
terrours of God, it is because they are reserued for them.</p>

that Spirit men may speake of God, but without him they
cannot speake vnto God: Prayer is a proper action of the
sons of God. The Apostle describing them who are Saints
by calling, saith, they are sanctified by Christ; and call vpon
the name of the Lord Iesus: hee ioynes these two together,

                     <p>Father wee learne here,<note place="margin">The Parents of Prayer.</note> that the Parent which begets
Prayer is the Spirit of adoption, the mother that conceiues
it is the humble and contrite heart, for no proud, vncleane

ascends are feruencie and an heauenly disposition; feruency
is noted in the word of Crying, for as in crying there is an
earnestnesse of the powers of the body to send out the voice,
so in prayer should there bee an earnestnesse of the powers
of our soule to send vp our desires. As incense without fire
makes no smell, and therefore the Lord commaunded it to
bee sacrificed with fire in the Law: so prayer without fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie
sends vp no sweet smell vnto the Lord. Our heauenly
disposition required in prayer is collected out of this, that
hee to whom wee speake is our Father in Heauen, if our

that is in heauen; vvee must therefore ascend in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

feele it, they so abound in ioy that all the terrors and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

                     <p>Where for our further comfort,<note place="margin">Three things required to make our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings sufferings with Christ.</note> if any man be desirous to
know, whether if his sufferings be sufferings with Christ, or
not, let him consider these three things: first, how Iesus
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9473:85"/>
receiued the Crosse as a cuppe giuen to him out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hand, neither looking to <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed him, nor
to the Iewes that pursued him. Secondly, hee receiued it
not grudgingly nor impatiently, but with an humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of his will, to the will of his Father. Thirdly, hee
suffered for this end, that he might abolish sinne, and destroy
him who had the power of death. If these three concurre in
thy sufferings, thou mayest be sure they are suffrings with
Christ: first, if passing by the instrument of thy trouble,
thou looke to the hand of God, tempering and giuing it
vnto thee: secondly, if thou receiue it with a humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of thy spirit to him who is the Father of Spirits:
and thirdly, if it worke in thee a mortification of thy sinfull
lusts and affections.</p>
                     <p>And of this we haue to make our vse in all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

if at any time it please the Lord to exercise vs with
fearefull agonies of Conscience, let vs looke vnto GOD,
who killes and makes aliue, who casts downe and raises vp;
let vs for a while beare his indignation, he abides but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his anger: if we finde that by them wee are more
humbled, wakened out of securitie, and stirred vp more
feruently to pray, and that the life of sinne is weakened in
vs, let vs be out of all doubt, that these inward troubles are
sufferings with Christ; whose soule for our sinnes was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

the vehement anguish of his spirit.<note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst outward Afflictions which wee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer either in name,</note> And as for outward suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,

that we may set our harts vpon those things which are more

and if we can yeeld our bodies to phisitions to be cut or burnt

one that hee sets not downe this as an vncertaine opinion,
but as a most sure conclusion gathered out of good reason.
And againe that it is the conclusion of such a one, as by
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9473:87"/>
experience knew both: what experience the Apostle had of
our present suffering, hee telleth vs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
he had <hi>of the glory to be reuealed,</hi> he tels vs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
so that his words wee are to consider this way, let other
men count and reckon as they will, this is my reckoning,
who haue proued them both, there is no comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them. What knowledge hee had of the weight of
our present sufferings, he tels you by a three-fold vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:
first, that hee had suffered all kinde of crosses, hunger,
thirst, cold, nakednesse, rods, stonings, imprisonnings: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that he suffered in all places, in the sea, in the land,
in the citie, in the wildernesse, where euer he came to preach
the Gospell, there was he persecuted, by some one sort of
trouble or other: thirdly, that hee suffered of all sorts of
persons, both of the Gentiles, and of his owne nation, both
of open enimies, and of false brethren. Againe, as for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the glory to be reuealed, hee tels you how hee
was taken vp into Paradise, and there heard such words as
cannot be reuealed.<note place="margin">The one he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem to Illiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, the other in his iourney from earth to heauen.</note> This conclusion therefore is the more
to be esteemed of vs, because he who giues out this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the excellency of the one aboue the other, is such a
one, as had experience of them both, hee made a iourney
on earth from Ierusalem to Illiricum, all which way prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospell, he suffered many afflictions; he made
another iourney from earth to heauen, whether in the body
or out of the body hee could not tell, and there he saw that
inutterable glory: and comparing with himselfe these two
together, hee giues out this for a finall sentence, that all our
present afflictions are but light, in respect of that infinite
weight of glory to bee reuealed. As for worldlings wee are
not to stand vpon their testimonie, for as hee cannot giue
ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> right sentence between two parties that heares not both
their causes, so cannot the worldling who knows somthing
both of the pleasures and sorrows of this life, but nothing
of the ioyes which are to come, consider how farre the life
to come is to be preferred before this: and therfore albeit in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9473:87"/>
the conclusions of his heart hee giue out sentence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
of the life present, we are not to regard it, because he
hath not heard nor considered, that which tends to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the other.</p>
                     <p>Wee see then here,<note place="margin">How the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the glory to come mittigates our present trouble.</note> how that our strength in trouble is
greatly encreased by the sight, at least by the certaintie, of
that glory which will be the ende of our trouble: this sight
made the Apostle count light of his present sufferings: let
<hi>Stephen</hi> haue his eyes in prayer to see the Heauens opened,
and Iesus standing at the right hand of God, and hee shall
not bee moued with the stones which the Iewes violently
throw at him: let <hi>Moses</hi> see him who is inuisible, and hee
shall not feare <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> let him see that recompense of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and he shall be better contented to suffer rebuke with
the people of God, than to enioy the treasures of Egypt:
this is that which made the Martyres stand exulting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing,
euen then when Infidels tormented their bodyes.

it had disquieted them,<note place="margin">Ber. in. Cant. ser. 61.</note>

Gods spirit is so short and vaine a thing, that he vouchsafes
not the name of life vpon it, without some restriction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it bewitcheth vs so, that in our false imagination wee

the time which is past is gone away like a thought, and that
which is to come we thinke it longer, then indeede by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
wee shall finde it. But the spirit of God, who best
knowes it, giues vnto it the name of life as I said with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
hee calles it a momentanie life, it is but a moment
wherein we liue, if we iudge aright we haue no more: for as
for the moments which are past, they are dead to thee, and
thou to them, and as for the moments which are to come,
they are vncertain, and thou canst not be said to liue in them;
so that no more is left to thee wherin thou canst truely say I
liue, but a moment, and this also must shortly goe away and
giue place to another, that so by succession of moments one
vnto another, thy silly life may be prorogued for a while.</p>
                     <p>But this shall yet better appeare,<note place="margin">Sacred simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, by which the holy Ghost shadowes the vanitie of our present life.</note> if wee consider those
similitudes by which the spirit of God describes the vanitie
of this our mortall life. Patient <hi>Iob</hi> compares the life of
man vnto the weauers shuttle, which scarce is in at the one
end of the webbe, when it is out at the other, and hee that
lookes vnto it,<note place="margin">Iob. 7. 6.</note> can hardly perceiue it. He compares it also
to the winde,<note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> that quickly flyeth by vs; and to the cloud,
which speedely vanishes; to a Post that runnes diligently
and rests not till he come to his end; to an hungry Eagle in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:9473:88"/>
the aire, who seeing her pray a farre off flyeth speedely vpon
it;<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note> to a flower that flourishes at once, but withers inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
and last of all to a ship sayling in the sea before the
winde, which for the present is seene, but within short space
appeares no more, yea doth not leaue behinde her any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step
or token that any such thing was there; and as it is with
them who saile in her, that how euer they change their
action, yet goe they on in their course toward their wished
hauen: so is it with vs, doe what wee will, whether wee
eate, or wee sleepe, wee are hasting alway toward our ends.
The Psalmist againe compares our life to a spanne or hand
breadth:<note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> to the grasse which groweth vp in the morning,
and is cut downe in the euening: to a sleepe which slippes
away before wee can know what were doing in it: to a
dreame, which of all things is most fickle and vaine: to a
thought, which is not well begunne, when it is ended: and
last of all to a declyning shadow, as is the shadow of the
Sunne in the setting, which a man shall see on the toppe
of a mountaine lesse and lesse, vanishing till it be no more.
The Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> compares our life to a race, and S.
<hi>Iames</hi> compares it to a smoke or vapour.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see how little the spirit of God esteemes of that,<note place="margin">The pleasures of this life are worme-eaten.</note>
whereof all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> accounts so much. Our

him; the Earth in like manner is wearied of the heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

God, and desires to be releeued of this bondage, yea, if the

and in very deed when once the creature shall be set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and no superiour power shall hold them vnder this

spoken of the creature,<note place="margin">How a will is ascribed to the creature.</note> that it is said to haue a will.
For the will of the creature is no other thing, but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclination of the creature; and the meaning is, that the
creature of the owne nature is not subiect to this vanitie, but
that it is subdued vnder it, by the superiour power of God,
for the sinne of man. Where if it be asked how stands this
with iustice,<note place="margin">How stands it with iustice that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is punished for mans sinne?</note> that the creature which sinned not, should be
subiected to vanitie for the sinne of man? The question is
easily answered, if we consider that the creatures were not
made for themselues, but for the vse and seruice of man, and
that whatsoeuer change to the worse is come vpon them, is
not their punishment, but a part of ours. If earthly Kings
without violation of iustice may punish their rebels, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their persons, but by demolition of their houses, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in their goods and substance, how shall we be bold
to reproue the Lords doing, who hauing conuinced man of
a notorious treason, hath not onely punished himselfe, but
defaced the house wherein he set him to dwell? seeing hee
hath violated the band of his seruice vnto God, what reason
is it that Gods creatures should continue in the first course
of their seruice to him? surely it stands with the righteous
iudgement of God, that his creatures should become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse
seruants to man, seeing man of his owne free will
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9473:95"/>
is become an vnprofitable servent to his God, yea a wicked
rebell against him.</p>
                     <p>And againe,<note place="margin">The fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of man, &amp; of the creature compared.</note> that the Apostle sayth the change which
is made in the creature, is against the will of the creature, it
serues greatly for our humiliation. The fall of Apostate
Angels was a fall by sinne, but with their will, and without
a Tempter to allure them, or without any hope that euer
they shall bee restored. The fall of man was also a fall
by sinne of his owne free-will, but not without the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
neither without hope of recouery and restitution.
But the fall of the creature, was neither a fall of sinne, nor
of their owne will, but a casting of them downe against
their will from their originall state, yet not without hope to
be deliuered. Miserable in the highest degree are Apostate
Angels, who of their owne free-will without an exteriour
tempter, haue deserted their first habitation, and cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into remedilesse condemnation. Miserable in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree are reprobate men, who haue fallen of their
owne free-will, suppose prouoked by an exteriour tempter,
and shall neuer be pertaker of the restitution of the sonnes
of God. But herein hath the Lord magnified his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs, that where wee fell with Angels, and reprobate
men, yet we are restored without them. The consideration
of our fall should humble vs, for in it wee are worse than
the creatures; they haue fallen from their glory, but not with
their owne will; we are fallen from ours, and we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our selues, but it was with our will: Againe, the hope
of our restitution should greatly comfort vs, considering
that the Lord hath vouchsafed that mercy vnto vs, which he

Now as for the manner of their deliuerance.<note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, the creatures shall be deliuered, seeing the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith they shall perish.</note> Seeing the
Apostle saith that the heauens shall passe away with a noise,
and the elements shall melt with heate, and the earth with
the workes therein shall be burnt vp with fire; and seeing
the Psalmist saith, that they shall perish, how is it that here
the Apostle saith, they shall be deliuered? This doubt shall
easily be loosed if Scripture be made interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The Psalmist in that same place expones the word
of perishing, by the word of changing, what this changing
shall be, the Apostle here makes it manifest, while he cals
it the deliuering of them from one estate into another: so
that wee are not to thinke that they shall perish as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

subiected by the fall of man. As siluer and gold is changed

wherby he proues the greatnesse and certaintie
of that glory to be reueiled, &amp; it is taken from
that feruent expectation vvhich the sonnes of
God haue of it. It can neither be a vaine nor a small thing,
but by the contrary both great and certaine, vvhereupon
God hath set the desire of his best creatures, by instinct of
the Spirit of Grace. So that vve haue here first a description
of Gods children; they are such as haue receiued the first
fruits of the spirit: secondly, a twofold effect vvhich this
holy Spirit workes in Gods children; first a wearinesse of
their present bondage, and seruitude of sinne; secondly, a
vvaiting by a constant expectation for a better. And this
doth very much confirme the Apostles purpose, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none on earth vvho can better iudge the excellencie of
that glory to come, than they vvho haue receiued the first

the testimonie of the creature, to the testimonie of the
sonnes of God; when he spake of the creature he said, they
sigh and grone with vs, they trauaile together in paine with
vs, and when hee speakes of the godly, hee saith, we sigh in
our selues, As man was not made for himselfe but for the
Lord, and therefore should wait vpon him, so the creatures
were not made for themselues but for vs: and therefore
where they are at couenant with vs, they in their kind wait

In this description of the godly, let vs consider these three
things. First, that whatsoeuer grace we haue we receiued it.
Secondly, that grace we haue receiued is not full, but in part;
for we haue onely receiued the first fruits of the Spirit. And
thirdly, that the first fruits which we haue are sufficient
pledges to vs of the plenitude and fulnesse, which afterward
we shall receiue.</p>
                     <p>The first of these learnes vs humilitie:<note place="margin">Learning vs hum litie, thankfulnesse, &amp; diligence in Prayer.</note> 
                        <hi>what hast thou O
man which thou hast not receiued?</hi> The Lord dispenses grace
to euery one according to his pleasure, and we are but ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
filled and emptied as hee will. Secondly it learnes vs
thankfulnesse: whatsoeuer Grace wee haue receiued wee
should returne both the praise and the vse of it to him who
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:9473:100"/>
gaue it; as the waters by secret conduits come from the Sea,
returne againe openly into it, through the troughes, so that
all men may see the returning, albeit they saw not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
so that Grace which the Lord by his Spirit secretly
conuayes to the godly, doth againe publikely returne vnto
him by prayse and well doing. And thirdly, it doth teach
vs diligence in prayer; if we desire encrease of Grace, vve
should seeke it from him of vvhom vve haue the beginning,
and vse all the meanes, such as hearing, reading, praying,
keeping of a good conscience, by which Grace may grovv,
and be intertayned in vs.</p>
                     <p>The next thing we obserue is,<note place="margin">No plenitude but first fruits of the Spirit haue we now.</note> that in this life we receiue
not the plenitude and fulnesse of Grace, but onely the first
fruits thereof. The vse of this is, first to comfort the children
of God, who are oftentimes discouraged with the sense and
feeling of their owne wants. It is one of Sathans stratagems
to try those by the rule of perfection, who are yet but in
the state of proficients,<note place="margin">Therefore are we not to think that we haue no grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue but beginnings</note> and we had neede to beware of it.
Shall I giue that vantage to the aduersary, as to thinke I
haue no faith, because it is weake? or I haue no loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is little: or no sanctification, because it is but in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning?
No, but I will so hunger and thirst for more grace,
that I will still giue thankes for the grace I haue receiued;
for here vve haue no fulnesse, our greatest measure is as
the first fruits, in respect of that which is to come.</p>
                     <p>On the other side,<note place="margin">This comfort vainly abused by prophane men.</note> because euery comfort vvhich is giuen
to the godly, is turned by prophane contemners and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
into an occasion and nourishment of sinne: they are to
know this comfort belongs not vnto them: It is a common
thing to them to excuse the want of all Grace. O it is but
a small grace vvhich in this life is communicated to the best,
and they thinke their sinnes are well inough couered, by this
that all men are sinners, as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
sinne tyrannizing in the wicked, and captiued in the
the godly, or as if beginnings of Grace in the regenerate
did not seperate them in regard of conuersation from the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:9473:100"/>
vnregenerate who are void of all Grace. Let them therefore
know that the Spirit of God vvhom the godly receiue, is
not onely called the first fruits, the earnest, and the witnesse
of God, but also the seale and signet of the liuing God. As
a seale leaues in the waxe that similitude and impression of
the forme which is in it selfe; so the Spirit of God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
his owne image to all those whom he seales against
the day of redemption, hee makes them nevv and holy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And this conuinces carnall professors of a lye, vvho
say they haue receiued the first fruites of the Spirit, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that their vvorks be wicked and vncleane: they may
rather if they would tell the truth, say as those who being
demaunded vvhether they had receiued the holy Ghost or
no, answered we know not vvhether there be an holy Ghost
or no: so may they instead of bragging of the first fruits
of the Spirit, say in truth we knovv not vvhat yee call the
first fruits of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly,<note place="margin">Why the Lord giues vs not in this life the principall, as well as the earnest.</note> out of this description vve may gather, that
albeit we haue no more but the first fruits of the Spirit, yet
are they sufficient to assure vs, that hereafter vve shall enioy
the whole Masse. In two respects it is customable to men to
giue an earnest penny in buying and selling, either when
the summe is greater than they are able to pay for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or when the thing bought is of that nature, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
presently be deliuered: but betweene the Lord and vs
there is no buying nor selling, he giues freely vnto vs, both
the earnest and the principall, but first the one, and then the
other; not that the Lord is vnable to pay presently all that
he hath promised, but because the principall is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it cannot be receiued, till we be prepared for it.
As the husbandman must sow and tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the haruest come, wherein he may sheare: as the warriour
must fight before he obtaine the victory; and the wrestler
receiues not his crowne till hee haue ouercome, neither

                     <p>And though payment of the principall for a time be

presently deliuered vnto vs, the Lord so dealing with vs as
he delt with Israell in the Wildernesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he caused the

branch of the Vine tree, so full of the clusters of grapes,
that it was borne betweene two vpon a tree, together with
the figges, and pomegranats, and other fruits of that land:
for no other end, but that Israell tasting of the first fruits of
Canaan might be prouoked to a more earnest desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as also to assure them that the Lord who had giuen them
the beginnings, would also put them in possession of the
whole, according to his promise: euen so the Lord Iesus
who hath gone before vs to our heauenly Canaan, not to
view it onely, but to take possession thereof in our name,
hath sent downe vnto vs some of the first fruites thereof,
that we may taste them, such as peace of Conscience, and
ioy of the Spirit, that by proofe of the small beginnings,
we may knovv vvhat excellent comfort is laid vp in store
for vs.<note place="margin">Two effects which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit workes in the godly, first a sense of their miserie for which they sigh.</note>

                        <hi>We sigh in our selues.</hi> Here followes now the two effects
of the Spirit, which he vvorkes in them vvho haue receiued
it. The first, is a sense of their present misery, which causes
them to sigh vnto God for deliuerance, and hee sayth, they
sigh within themselues, to teach vs that it is not an hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and counterfait, but an inward and godly sorrow,
vvhich the Spirit workes in the children of God. Which I
doe not so speake as if I did condemne those sighes which
breake forth without; for sometime the griefe of hart is so
aboundant in the godly, that not onely it breakes out in
sighing and mourning, but in strong crying to God also,
but to restraine the hipocrisie of others, who make a faire
shew of that in the flesh, which is not in the Spirit. True
religion striues rather to be approued of God, than seene of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:9473:101"/>
men: one sigh proceeding from the heart, is a louder crying
in the eares of the Lord of hosts, and more forcible to moue
him, than the noise of all the shooting Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> when
they are gathered together into one.</p>
                     <p>We are therefore more deepely to consider this,<note place="margin">Sighing and mourning goe before comfort</note> that the
Spirit of God first teacheth vs to figh and mourne for our
present misery, before he comfort vs with a constant hope
of deliuerance. If now we mourne not, wee shall not reioyce
hereafter: it is onely mourners whom God hath marked in
the fore-head, to saue from the wrath to come: such a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuall

to professe that of themselues, which the mockers of

but the question betweene vs and them is, concerning the
right placing of them.<note place="margin">Faith and hope compaired in their relation to Christ.</note> First, then it is certaine, that both
faith and hope looke vnto Christ; Iesus Christ and that
which he hath conquered vnto vs, is the obiect of them
both, but diuersly: for faith enters vs into a present posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ and his benefits,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>he that beleeueth in me</hi> (saith
our Sauiour) <hi>hath eternall life,</hi> hee saith not onely hee shall
haue it, but also that presently hee hath it: Hope againe
lookes for a future possession of Christ, which shall bee
much more excellent, than that which presently we inioy;
for the possession of Christ which now I haue by Faith is
imperfect and mediate;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9. 10.</note> by Faith I know Christ but in part,
by Faith I apprehend him but in part also: and this posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I haue it mediately, to wit, by the meanes of the Word
and Sacraments; but my hope directs mee to looke for a
mroe excellent possession of Christ, within a short while,
in whom I shall enioy much more than now by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of my Faith I can see in him, or yet by apprehension
of my Faith I can comprehend of him. And this is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and immediate possession of Christ which by Hope
we looke for.</p>
                     <p>Now as for their mutuall relation among themselues,<note place="margin">Faith and hope compared in their mutuall relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note>
Faith is of things past, present, and to come; Hope is onely
of things to come: Faith is more largely extended than
Hope: wee hope for nothing which wee beleeue not, but
something wee beleeue for which wee hope not: wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that the paines of hell abide the wicked, but we hope
them not; for hope is an expectation of good to come, they
may fall vnder feare, but come not vnder hope. Againe,
Faith is the mother of Hope; for of that imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and apprehension of Christ which I haue by Faith,
there ariseth in mee an hope and expectation of a better:
Hope againe, is not onely the daughter of Faith, but the
conseruer and nourisher of Faith, the piller that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>props
it, when it faints; for in this life we are beset with so
manifold tentations, the worke of God seeming oftentimes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:9473:106"/>
contrary to his word, and things appearing to fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than the Lord hath promised, that our Faith thereby
is wonderfully daunted, and therefore hath neede to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by Hope, which teacheth alwayes with patience to
depend vpon Gods truth, and to looke for a better. As for
example,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note> the Lord saith, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I will heare thee, and deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me,</hi>
according to this promise the Christian calling vpon God
and yet not finding deliuerance, his Faith begins to faint,
but then Hope comes in, and succoureth Faith, and her
counsell is,<note place="margin">Habak. 2. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>the vision is for an appointed time, at last it shall
speake and not lye: though it tarry, waite, for it shall surely
come and not stay:</hi> and this Faith being strengthened by
Hope, continues her prayers to God, vntill she obtaine her
promised and desired deliuerance.</p>
                     <p>And of this it is euident,<note place="margin">The right place assigned to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these three, Faith, Hope, &amp; Loue, in the worke of saluation.</note> in what sense it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, wee are saued by Hope, to wit, because by it wee
are vpholden in trouble: for he is not here disputing of the
manner of our Iustification (which he hath done before) but
discoursing of those comforts which wee haue to sustaine vs
in affliction. If ye aske by which of these three, Faith, Hope,
and Loue, we are iustified, that is, by which of them we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Christs righteousnes offered to vs in the Gospell,
the Apostle hath answered already, wee are iustified by
Faith? If yee demand which of these three chiefely sustaines
vs in affliction: the Apostle here telleth you, that when
Faith is weake, Hope saues vs that wee dispaire not: and if
yee demaund which of these three declares vs to bee men
iustified by Faith in Christ, the Apostle telleth you, wee
must declare our Faith by good workes; for Faith worketh
by Loue: these are the right places, which these three excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
graces of the Spirit hath in the worke of our saluation,
and they goe so ioyntly together, that they cannot bee
sundred.</p>
                     <p>When we say that a man is iustified by Faith onely, we
doe not therefore make the iustified man to be without
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:9473:106"/>
Hope and Loue.<note place="margin">The doctrine of Iustification by Faith onely, takes not away Hope &amp; Loue.</note> For albeit in the action of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and applying of Christs righteousnesse, Faith onely
workes, for which wee say truely wee are iustified by Faith
onely, yet Hope and Loue haue other actions pertayning
to saluation, necessarily requisite in the iustified man. And
this doth cleare vs of that false calumnie wherewith the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
doe charge vs,<note place="margin">Calumnie of the aduersary concerning this confuted.</note> as if we did teach, that Faith might
be without Hope or Loue, because wee affirme that wee are
iustified by Faith onely. I say most truely, when I say that
among all the members of the body, the eye onely sees, but
if any man collect of my speach, that the eye is onely in the
body, without eare or hand, he concludes wrong. For albeit
in the facultie of seeing I say the eye onely sees, yet doe I
not for that seperate it from the communion of the rest of
the members of the body. In the Sunne heat and light goe
inseperably together; of these two it is the heat onely that
warmes vs, doe I therefore say that the heat is without the
light? Among all the graces of the Spirit, when I say
that Faith onely iustifies, I doe but point out the proper
action of Faith, but doe not therefore seperate it from
Hope and Loue. So farre iniurious are the aduersaryes of
the truth vnto vs, when they accuse vs for maintayning a
Faith which is without Hope, and doth not worke by Loue,
which we neuer affirmed.</p>
                     <p>Of this now it is euident,<note place="margin">Hope of a Christian is a strong thing, depending on sure warrants.</note> that the Hope of a Christian

the very nature of hope leades vs to looke for
some better thing which is to come, but also he
concludes his first principall argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
making this to bee the end of all, that it becomes vs
with patience to abide our promised deliuerance. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for memories sake wee haue reduced all that hee hath
spoken, into one principall argument, yet may wee see how
vnder this one, many particular reasons are heaped vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tending all to this one conclusion; that we should abide
it with petience.<note place="margin">Sixe seuerall reasons of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, lurking vnder this one.</note> First, wee haue heard that the nature of
our sufferings are so changed, that they are now made suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
with Christ. Secondly, that the end of them is to be
glorified with Christ. Thirdly, that the glory to come doth
farre exceede in waight and eternitie our present sufferings.
Fourthly, that the creatures haue a feruent desire of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
of that glory. Fiftly, that they also who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the first fruites of the Spirit, are wearie of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
misery, and waite for ther edemption to come. And last,
that in all our troubles wee are saued, and sustained with the
hope of that which is to come, and not with a present
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9473:107"/>
possession of that which wee would haue. In all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
it becomes vs not onely to be of good comfort for
the present, but also patiently to looke for a better. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
brings in his conclusion vpon his last argument, but we
are to consider that it hath an eye vnto all that goes before,
and that euery one of those reasons aforesaide, serueth to
strengthen this conclusion, that if wee hope for that which
is to come, then will we with patience abide for it.</p>
                     <p>We haue first to marke a difference betweene the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and the Worldling:<note place="margin">The worldlings comfort is in things that are seene, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians not so.</note> the Worldling hath his affection
on things which are seene, hee cannot mount aboue them;
hee hath receiued his consolation on earth; his portion is
here, and he possesseth his best things in this present life. It
is farre otherwise with the Christian, for in his affection he
transcends euery thing which is subiect to sense, hee is not
now a possessor, but an expectant by hope of his best
things, hee hath them not <hi>in re,</hi> but <hi>in spe:</hi> therefore may he
say to the Worldling, as our Sauiour saide to his Kinsmen,
<hi>your times is alway, but my time is not yet come.</hi> The Christian
is that good husbandman, who hath more comfort in that
seed, which he hath sowen, and couered with earth that he
seeth it not, than he hath in that, which he sees lying before
his eyes in the barne, for hee knowes that the one, at the
last, shall render him manifold greater encrease, than the
other.</p>
                     <p>It is not an vnpleasant Allegorie which <hi>Augustine</hi> makes

vnawares seases vpon you: yee comfort your selues vvith
the hope of a good successe of your affaires, and an euill

thus the good for which yee looke to come, in your owne
experience you finde it deceiues you. Call not therefore
any more vpon vs to follow you, and to drinke with you of
your perishing pleasures, wee haue had a proofe of yours,
and found them to bee vanitie; but if yee will, come and
take a proofe of ours, will you taste of those delicates

shall breed you peace, and peace shall breed you ioy in the

regard of them, your soule shall loath all your former vaine

                     <p>Of this we may see further, that as Faith procreates hope,<note place="margin">Impatience in trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the want of Hope.</note>
so hope procreates Patience: so that the want of Patience
in trouble bewrayes the want of Hope, What made <hi>Saul</hi>
who in his first beginning draue Witches out of the land,
in his latter end to make his refuge to them? surely because
all hope had failed him that the Lord would answere him
any more. When Samaria was besieged and straited vvith
Famine, as long as <hi>Iehoram</hi> had any hope hee waited vvith
patience vpon the word of <hi>Elisha,</hi> that there should be
great plenty shortly in Samaria, but when by the womans
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:9473:108"/>
complaint he vnderstood that the Famine was encreast to
that height, that his subiects were forced to eate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
his hope failed him, and hee concludes to attend no
longer vpon the Lord, but vowes in his impatience to cut
off the head of <hi>Elisha.</hi> Thus the cause of all impatience in
trouble, that driues men to seeke deliuerance by wicked
and vnlawfull meanes, is onely the want of hope.</p>

clearely, in the Parable of that seruant who because hee
thought within himselfe that his Maister would not come,
began to beat his fellowes instead of feeding them. So that
the ground of all the Atheisme of our time, is pointed out
to be the want of hope: there is no sinne committed but
through impatience, all proceedes of this, that mans vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
and proud nature cannot contayne the selfe within
the limites prescribed vnto it by the Lord: he that is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with patience is easily kept both in peace and warre

to please God, nor was the end thereof directed to
his glory; albeit as sayth the Apostle, <hi>after a sort they knew

<hi>omni virtutum genere praeclari,</hi> to excell in euery kinde of
vertue; yet herein are they conuinced to be vniust, <hi>quod dona
Dei non retulerunt ad suum authorem,</hi> that they returned not
the gifts of God to the author thereof, but rather abused
them to their owne vaine-glory; and so fayling both in the

to vs that patience whereby we possesse our soules; hee
counts not of those sufferings, which men endure that they
may possesse things which are without them: for what is
that possession worth whereby men possesse those things

themselues are captiued slaues vnder the seruitude of Sathan:
but that Patience is praise worthy, whereby we possesse our

In a Godly man his desires are better than his deedes,
hee cannot doe the good that hee desires, as the Apostle
plainely confesseth of himselfe: but the wicked haue their
desires worse than their deed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; for when they haue done
most wickedly, yet haue they still a desire to doe more, till
their tormenting conscience waken them: and so whereas
the one sinneth of weaknesse,<note place="margin">The Christian is freed from wickednes not from weaknes.</note> the other sinneth of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Certainely they who are truely Godly are so far from
wickednesse, that if they were such men as they desire to
be, and could possibly perform that good which they prease
to doe, there would not be such a thing as a spark of the life
of sinne left remaning in them. Alwayes wee liue vnder this
hope, that the Lord who hath already by his grace deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs from wickednes, will also in his owne good time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
vs from our weaknesse: hee shall make our deeds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable

that having experience of our owne weaknesse, wee might
runne to the Lord who is the strength of our soule, and
seeke his helpe by prayer, whereunto otherwise we are very
slow by nature, notwithstanding it be the best and most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
seruice that we can giue vnto God vpon earth. We
haue marked this in experience, that as they who finde not
themselues bodily diseased seeke not the Phisition, so hee
that feeles not the spirituall infirmities of his soule, cannot
pray vnto God to remedie them: the Lord hath vsed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of many as holy meanes to make them truely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
who were prophane before, and for these causes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
left in vs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Our infirmities are manifold.</note> So the Apostle speakes in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
because not one, but manifold are the infirmities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are subiect: whereof there arises to vs a two-fold
warning. First, that we take heede vnto our selues, and see
where wee are weakest, to the end that there wee may
strengthen our selues. The Philistims were very carefull to
know wherein <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength lay, to the end that spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him of his strength they might spoyle him of his life:
but Sathan by long experience knows our infirmities, and
sets vpon vs there where hee knowes that wee are weakest.
As therefore they who are besieged looke not so much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the stronger part of the wall,<note place="margin">Wee should strengthen our selues most where we are weakest.</note> as vnto the weaker, that they
may strengthen it: so wisdome craues that we should looke
most narrowly to our greatest infirmities. Hee that hath
children albeit he loue them all, yet hath he most respect to
the most infirme among the; and he that hath many tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of land, hastes soonest to repayre that which is most
ruinous; and among all the members of the body, we care
most for those that are weake or wounded. Seeing Nature
hath taught vs to take heed to those things which are ours,
shall we not much more take heed vnto our selues? It is
euen a point of holy wisedome to consider where wee are
weakest, and what those sinnes are vnto which we are most
subiect, and by which Sathan hath gotten greatest vantage
against vs, that so we may take the more paynes to make
our selues strong against it.</p>
                     <p>And after that by prayer and spirituall exercises,<note place="margin">Yet so that we remember that the enimie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed at one place will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault another.</note> thou
hast made thy selfe strong there where thou wast wont to

many infirmities whereunto we are subiect, and the craftie
enimie can very well change his tentations vpon thee, if he
be repulsed at any one part, whereat he was wont to enter,
hee will goe about and seeke vantage at an other: and
therefore seeing our enimie is restlesse, and the matter hee
workes vpon is our manifold infirmities, let vs walke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly,

grace, the grace of Prayer is, we should not so vainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
in our words, that wee can pray, as earnestly beseech
him with the Disciples that he would teach vs to pray. As
that Eunuch professed that hee could not vnderstand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a guide,<note place="margin">Acts. 8. 31.</note> so may we that we cannot pray without a guide,
it is easie to speake of God, but not so easie to speake vnto
God; hee that will speake to God (saith <hi>Ambrose</hi>) must
speake to him in his owne language, that is, in the language
of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is not a communing of the tongue with God,<note place="margin">Praier is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning of the soule with God</note> but
of the soule with God, and of such a soule onely as is taught
by the holy Spirit how to pray: it is true the Lord vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the thoughts of euery mans heart, but the language
acceptable to God, are those motions of the heart which are
raised by his owne Spirit, and hee that wants this Spirit, can
not speake vnto God in Gods language. Let this serue to
reforme the corrupt iudgement of many, who thinking
themselues able enough to pray, passe ouer their dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>This naturall inabilitie to pray consists in these:<note place="margin">Our natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie to pray is, eyther in our corrupt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by which we seek things vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

doe we read that men beloued of God haue beene refused in
mercy, but others haue had their petitions granted in anger:
which wee may see not onely in the Israelites, vvho obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

children of God renued by grace, willingly presents their
hearts to God, that he should looke vpon them. And this
the Apostle points out here, when hee saith, that not onely
God knowes the heart, but that hee searches the heart.
Searching, is the inquisition of a thing which is hid and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
and imports the contrary corruption of our Nature,
vvhich seekes to hide and obscure it selfe from the Lord.
As <hi>Adam</hi> presently after his fall sought to couer his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse

heritable euill to all his posteritie, that when they haue done
wickedly,<note place="margin">But in vaine.</note> they doe what they can to couer it: but in vaine,
for the Lord is such a searcher, from whose eyes no man
can hide that for which he makes inquisition. <hi>Laban</hi> searched
the Tent of <hi>Iacob</hi> for his idols, and could not finde them
though they were there: but what the Lord searches hee
shall finde out. If <hi>Saul</hi> hide himselfe the Lord can tell the
people that he lurkes among the stuffe. As a light where
it comes makes things to be seene which were hid in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so the Lord when he searches, saith he will search with
lights; to tell thee that were thy deedes neuer so secret, hee
will make them manifest. Let vs not therefore like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

Neyther is it without great cause that the Lord passing
by other things,<note place="margin">The heart only makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the true christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an &amp; counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite.</note> looketh onely to the heart, the heart being
the essentiall difference that distinguisheth a true Christian
from a counterfaite: for outward exercises of godlinesse the
hypocrite in appearance may match the holy one. Ye shall
see <hi>Cain</hi> sacrificing no lesse then <hi>Abel:</hi> yee shall see <hi>Esas</hi>
seeking the blessing with greater crying, and moe teares,
than <hi>Iacob:</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> shall confesse his sinne no lesse than
<hi>Dauid:</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> shall humble himselfe in dust and ashes,
more penitent like than <hi>Ezechiah:</hi> the Pharisee shall be
more abundant in fasting and giuing of almes, than the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.
As he that doth paint a fire, may paint the colour and
the forme of the bowing flame thereof, but can no way
paint the heate thereof: so an Hypocrite can looke like a
Christian, speake like a Christian, and in outward actions
counterfait the Christian, but can neuer attaine to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
heart: therefore is it that the Lord most of all delights
in the heart, and we also most of all should take heede vnto
it, to keepe it holy.</p>
                     <p>Beside this,<note place="margin">It is in great wisedome that God hath loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp the hart of one man from another.</note> that the Lord hath locked vp the heart of
one man from another, and hath reserued the knowledge of
the heart to himselfe onely, the Lord hath done it in great
wisedome: for seeing that man diuided himselfe by sinne
from God, their hearts by nature are so discordant among
themselues, that if their hearts were as manifest to others,
as their faces, there could not be a fellowship nor societie
entertained among men. Looke how many men are in the
world, there are as many sundry iudgements and wils, euery
man hauing a kingdome in his breast, and so carryed away
with a desire of his owne super-excellencie, that hee seeketh
the aduancement of his owne will with the ouerthrow of all
others, whose will is not agreeable to his, if hee might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto it. Againe, the heart of man is such a bottomlesse
fountaine of wickednesse, that if it were manifested, the
world should be infected with viler abhominations, than
any that yet are knowne in it: for if the tongue which is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:9473:114"/>
but a little member of the body, when it fomes out but a
small part of that filth which abounds in the heart, be so
forcible as to corrupt the honest minds and manners of the
hearers, what should be done if the heart it selfe were laid
open, which is by nature but a stincking puddle, and filthy
store-house of all iniquitie?</p>
                     <p>And further for the comfort of the whole Church of God,<note place="margin">The soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God ouer man appears in this, that hee is vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their hearts.</note>
and euery member thereof, let vs marke the soueraigntie of
our God ouer all his creatures in these two, that not onely
hee is vpon their secrets whether they will or not, for hee
sits in their hearts, but also hath soueraign commandement
ouer them, so that he can when he wil, &amp; will when his glory
requires, eyther take their hearts vtterly from them, or turne
their owne hearts against themselues, as domestick enimies
to torment them. And as for the first, it is manifest out of
this place, that the Lord sitteth vpon the secret counsell of
the wicked; for hee searcheth the heart. It was a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of Aram, that the secret
conclusion, which hee laid with his captaines in his cabinet
counsel, concerning the ordering of his battels against Israel,
were discouered as they were concluded, by <hi>Elisha</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

is his glory, and good of his Church. Let our enimies
then take counsell, and conspire together as they will, hee
that doth sit in the heauens shall haue them in derision. The

power to doe with it what hee will: how oft haue we seene
that the Lord being angry at man, passing by all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his body, and leauing them whole and sound, hath
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:9473:115"/>
stricken the heart with such terrours, that most valiant men
hauing eyes could not see, hauing a tongue could not speak,
hauing hands could not strike to defend themselues, and
hauing feete could not doe so much as runne away, their
heart being taken from them by God, they are left in a strait
and comfortlesse estate. But farre more miserable are they,
when the Lord turnes their owne hearts against themselues,
and makes them a terrour to themselues. A fearefull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whereof wee haue in <hi>Belshazzar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 6.</note> who seeing nothing
without him, but the figure of a hand which stirred him
not, was so stricken and pursued with his owne heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, that his flesh trembled, his countenance waxed pale,
his knees smote one against another. If man considered this,
he would be loath to prouoke the Lord vnto anger, seeing
hee can neyther sustaine the wrath of God nor eschew it.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer wee are taught here,<note place="margin">We haue neede of great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in praier, seeing we speak to him who searcheth the heart.</note> seeing our Prayer is a
conference with him who searcheth the heart, that we should
alway pray with our heart, for otherwise if wee draw neere
him with our lips our heart being farre from him, hee will
curse vs as deceiuers, that hauing a male in our flock, doe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
a lame thing vnto the Lord: that is, in stead of the
seruice of our hearts, doe offer vnto him the seruice of our
lips. The Lord hath no delight in the sacrifice of fooles, who
are rash with their mouth to vtter a thing before him, not
considering that hee is in heauen, and they are vpon earth,
the mouth may reach to men who are beside vs, the heart
onely may reach to God who is aboue. It was a very godly
protestation that <hi>Dauid</hi> made,<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 23</note> 
                        <hi>Try me O Lord, and prooue
my thoughts in the night,</hi> and see if at any time I haue spoken
that to thee with my mouth, which I haue not thought with
my heart: and albeit wee haue not as yet atteyned vnto it,
yet is it that holy sinceritie whereat wee should ayme in all
our prayers, so to speake vnto God that our conscience
may beare vs record that we lye not, and that we haue spoken
nothing with our mouth, which we haue not thought vvith
our heart.</p>

                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:9473:115"/>
We are therefore for the right ordering of our prayers,<note place="margin">Three things to be obserued in Prayer.</note>
to take heede to these three things. First, preparation before
prayer. Secondly, attention in prayer. Thirdly, reuerent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
thanksgiuing after prayer.<note place="margin">That prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion go before it.</note> As for the first, as <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Iosua</hi> put off their shooes before they came neere the Lord,
so are we to remoue out of our hearts vncleane cogitations,
and affections, whereby we haue trode in the filth of sinne,
before we pray; for those are neuer lawfull, but most vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the time of prayer. As for worldly cogitations they
are sometimes lawfull, but neuer in the time of prayer. As
<hi>Abraham</hi> vsed his Asses to serue him for the iourney, but
when he came to mount Moriah, the place of the worship,
he left them at the foot of the hill: so the thoughts of the
world are sometime tollerable, if wee vse them as seruants,
to carry vs through in our iourney, from the earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but we must not take them with vs into the holy place
wherein the Lord is to be worshipped.</p>
                     <p>To help vs to the preparation before prayer,<note place="margin">Motiues to preparation.</note> let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider;
first that he to whom we speake is the Father of light,
and we are by nature but the children of darknes: call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vpon him in the sinceritie and vprightnesse of thine
heart; for he loues truth in the inward affections. Secondly,
he is the Father of glory, come therefore before him with
feare and reuerence, for thou art but dust and ashes. Thirdly,
he is the Father of mercy, repent thee therefore of thy
sinnes, and then draw neere with a true heart, in assurance
of Faith.</p>
                     <p>The second thing requisit, is attention in Prayer: the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to whom we speake is the searcher of the heart,<note place="margin">That there be attention in prayer.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should beware that we speake nothing to him with
our mouth, which our heart hath not conceiued. For it is a
great mockerie to the Lord to desire him to consider those
petitions which we haue not considred our selues; we scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heare what we say our selues, and how then shall we craue
the Lord may heare vs? We finde by experience that it is
not an easie thing to gather together in one, and keepe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:9473:116"/>
vnited the powers of our soule in prayer vnto God. Sathan
knowes that the gathering of our forces is the weakening of
his kingdome, and that then we are strongest, when we are
most feruent in prayer, and therefore doth hee labour all
that hee can to slacke the earnestnesse of our affection, and
so to make vs more remisse in prayer, by stealing into our
hearts if not a prophane, at least an impertinent cogitation,
so that vnlesse we fight without ceasing against the incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our enimie, like <hi>Abraham</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

birds from his Sacrifice, vnlesse we expell them speedely,

with reuerent thanksgiuing. It is the fault of many carelesse
worshippers, they goe vnto God as men goe to a Well to
refresh them when they are thirstie; they goe to it, and their

backe vpon it: euen so doe they sit downe to their prayers
without preparation, powre them out without attention and

                     </p>
                     <p>The resolution of this doubt will arise by considering
that in the Christian man are two men,<note place="margin">In the christian man are two men, the new and the old.</note> the new man, and
the old; the one the workmanship of God, the other the
workmanship of Sathan; the one but young, little &amp; weake

stronger, the life of the old man weaker and weaker, the
one tending to perfection, the other wearing to a finall

                     <p>Now the Lord in iudging of the Christian lookes not
to the remanents of sinne in him,<note place="margin">God iudges of the Christian by the new man, and not by the old.</note> which are daily decaying,

which is daily growing; according to it he esteemes, iudges,

vs what wee haue beene, neither yet weighing vs by the

                        <hi>He sees no iniquitie in Israell,</hi> and it is his

Christian by the contrary in iudging of himselfe, he lookes
most commonly to that whereunto the Lord lookes least,
his sinnes are euer before him, the old man is continually
in his sight, as a strong, and mightie Gyant, whose force
hee feares, whose tyrannie makes him to tremble, and by
whom hee finds himselfe detayned vnder miserable thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
farre against his will, and therefore all his care is how
to subdue this tyrannie, how to quench his life, and shake
off his dominion in this warfare: hee sighes, complaines,
and cryes vnto God with the holy Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>O miserable
man who shall deliuer me from this body of sinne.</hi> But because
so long as this old man hath a life, hee neuer rests to send
out sinnefull motions and actions, which doe greatly greiue
the child of God, therefore is it that hee esteemes himselfe a
miserable creature, yea, and the chiefe of all sinners. Thus
yee see how it is, that God accounts his children <hi>Saints,</hi> and
they account themselues <hi>Sinners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where againe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">How it is to be vnderstood that he who is borne of God sinneth not.</note> that <hi>hee who is borne of
God sinnes not,</hi> and yet that <hi>hee who saith he hath no sinne is a

new man, <hi>sinneth not:</hi> for sure it is that all the sins which are
committed by man, are either done without the knowledge
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:9473:117"/>
of the new man, his vnderstanding being as yet so weake
that he doth not know euery sinne to be sinne, or then if he
knowes them to be sinnes, they are done without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or approbation, yea they are done sore against his will,
so that the <hi>new man</hi> in the sinnes which are done in the body
is a patient not an agent.</p>
                     <p>So that as an honest man captiued by violence,<note place="margin">The new man liues in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like Lot in Sodome:</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

and compelled to looke vnto that which he loues not,
that is, to the sinnefull motions, vnruly lusts and affections
of his corrupt nature, whereunto he consents not, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
against them, and for their sake becomes weary of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning
in the body, so that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was not more weary of
his prison, nor <hi>Ieremie</hi> of his dungeon, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> of the

in the tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> than is the new man weary of his abiding
in the bodie. Hee is like <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodome, whose righteous

conuersation of the Sodomites: hee is like <hi>Israel</hi> in Aegipt,
kept in most vile slauerie by the tyrannie of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his will, it is a great mockery, if it be done with knowledge,
or otherwise a grose impietie to seeke them from him. It is
written of <hi>Vitellius</hi> that one of his friends asking from him
a certaine thing which hee refused, and being impatient of
the refusall, did say to him, What auaileth thy friendship to
me, if I cannot obtaine that which I craue? returned back
to his friend this answere, And what auaileth to me thy
friendship, if for thy sake I must doe that which becomes
me not? If such equitie be in a mortall man that hee vvill
not graunt an vnlawfull thing, euen to his tender friend, how
much more are we to thinke that it is in the Lord our God:
Away therefore with these cursed and abhominable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
as to present vnto the Lord petitions which are not
agreeable vnto his holy will.</p>

to prayer, let vs consider vvhat excellent priuiledge this is,
that the Christian as oft as hee pleaseth, hath libertie to
speake vnto the Lord his God. The Persians thought it a

yee see how afraid <hi>Hester</hi> the Queene was to goe in

in the first creation, causing light to shine out of darknesse;
so also in the worke of redemption, for by cursed death he
brought happy life, by the crosse he conquered the crowne,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:9473:123"/>
and through shame hee went to glory. And this same order
the Lord still keepeth in the worke of our second creation,

in the ende with louing affection shall hee embrace them;
hee may seeme angry at thy prayers, as hee put backe the
petitions of that woman of Canaan, but at length hee will
graunt a fauourable answere vnto them. Let vs not therfore
murmure against the Lord, by whatsoeuer meanes it please
him to worke: It is enough wee know that all the wayes of

Sathan by his restlesse tentations doth destroy himselfe:
which is most euident both in his tentations for sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
tending to desperation, as also in his tentations vnto
sinne, tending to presumption. Euery accusation of the
conscience for sinne past, is vnto the Godly man a preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue
to keepe him from sinne in time to come, hee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
with himselfe after this manner: If mine enimie doe
so disquiet my minde with inward terrour, for those sinnes
which foolishly I did by his entisement, why shall I hearken
to him any more, and so increase the matter of my trouble?
for what fruit haue I of all those sinnes which I did by his
instigation, but terrour and shame? and shall I looke that
this forbidden tree can render vnto me any better fruit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?
O what a faithlesse traitor is Sathan, he entiseth man
vnto sinne, and when hee hath done it, hee is the first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
and troubler of man for sinne. When hee comes first
vnto vs hee is a tempter; when wee haue finished his worke

Stoppe thine eare therefore O my soule, from the voyce of

                     <p>His tentations againe vnto sinne,<note place="margin">And his tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to sinne chases them to the throne of grace.</note> are vnto the Godly

a great power of God this is certainly, which commandeth

for then doth hee destroy himselfe, when the man whom

those who delight in the exercise of the word and prayer,
so doth it serue for the conuiction of those, to whom any

are but like an adulterous woman, who if so be shee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse

                     </p>
                     <p>And generally all of you in your callings remember that
the value of your Christian loue must be tryed by the same
touchstone,<note place="margin">But this age in word calleth Christ their King, but casts off his yoke.</note> not by your words but by your workes. <hi>If any

here also the hypocrisie of this age is discouered: as the
Iewes called Iesus their King,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. 10.</note> and bowed their knees before
him, but spat in his face and buffetted him: so the bastard
Christians of this age call Christ their Lord, and bowe their
knees before him, yet by their sinfull life they crucifie him,
and tread his bloud of the couenant vnder their feete: they
kisse and betray him with <hi>Iudas,</hi> it is but a Scepter of reed
they allow him, for they giue him no commaundement
ouer their affections, wherefore great is the controuersie
which the Lord hath this day with the men of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>The third tryall of loue is Bountifulnesse,<note place="margin">The propertie of loue is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse.</note> the Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
sayth <hi>Loue is bountifull:</hi> experience proues that euery louer
bostoweth bountifully on that which hee loueth: yee loue
your bodyes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4.</note> and therefore largely bestow vpon them to
feede them, and cloth them, yea, with excessiue apparrell;
yee loue your Children, and lets them want no needfull
thing for them; yea, yee loue your beasts, and spares not to
bestow largely vpon them: onely you say you loue the
Lord, but wherein are yee bountifull toward him? It is true
that in nothing can a man be profitable to the Almightie,
but are there not workes commaunded vs, which should so
shine before men, that by them our heauenly Father may
be glorified? though workes can be no merits, yet are they
your witnesses, and what haue yee done to remaine when
yee are dead as witnesses of your loue toward the Lord?
Though your goodnesse extend not to the Lord, yet where
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:9473:136"/>
is your delight that should be on his Saints and excellent
ones vpon earth? where is your compassion and loue toward
the brethren? are not the men of this age like vnto that fig-tree
which had faire leaues, but not so much as one figge to
giue vnto Iesus in his hunger, <hi>hauing the shew of godlinesse
but haue denyed the power therof,</hi> yeelding words inough but
no fruits to adorne the glorious Gospell of our Lord Iesus.
Of these and many moe if wee might insist in them, it is
manifest that all haue not the loue of God in their hearts,
who this day pretend it.</p>
                     <p>The last tryall of Loue which novv we bring,<note place="margin">The last is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to suffer for his cause.</note> is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to suffer affliction for the cause of God. The Apostles
being beaten for preaching in the name of Iesus, instead of
mourning, departed reioycing that they were counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to suffer for Christs sake, and all because they loued him.
For the loue of <hi>Rahel</hi> seauen yeeres of hard seruitude see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> but a short space. For the loue of <hi>Dinah
Sichem</hi> willingly sustayned the circumcision and cutting of
his flesh: much more to him in whose heart abounds the
loue of the Lord, vvill bitter things become sweet, and hard
things easie. This Loue hath made the holy Martyres step
out of their owne element into the fire, with greater ioy and
willingnesse, then worldlings haue when they fit downe to
their banquetting tables to refresh them, or lyes downe in
their beds to rest them. The Apostle who suffered all sorts
of affliction for the Gospell, giues this for a reason, that the
loue of Iesus constrayned him. Thus much concerning the
effects of holy loue, by which we are to make sure our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and consequently our election, for our euerlasting
comfort.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his third and last argument of comfort.</note> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
the Apostle hath summarily set downe his third prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
argument of comfort: and now in the end of this
verse he shortly breakes vp the confirmation thereof, which
is this: they who loue God are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
therefore all things must work for the best vnto them.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:9473:136"/>
The necessitie of this reason shall appeare if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Lord cannot be frustrated of his end. Those
whom the Lord in his immutable purpose hath ordayned to
glory, and whom according to that purpose he hath called
in time, how can it be but all things must worke vnto their
good? for the working prouidence of God which is the
executer of his purpose, doth so ouer-rule all incidents which
fall out in the world, and doth so gouerne all secondary and
inferiour causes, that of necessitie they are directed to that
end, whereunto the supreame cause of all, to wit, the purpose
and will of God hath ordayned them. This is shortly set
downe in these words, and more largely explaned in the two
verses following. It is the last reason of comfort, and the
highest: for now the Apostle leades vs out of our selues,
and sets vs vpon that rocke which is higher than wee, hee
carries vs by the hand as it were out of the earth vp into
heauen, and lets vs see how our saluation is so grounded in
Gods eternall purpose, that no accident in the world can
change it.</p>
                     <p>We haue here then three things,<note place="margin">Comfort, that the ground of our saluation is in God, the tokens thereof in our selues.</note> euery one of them depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon another: the loue of God, flowing from the calling
of God, and the calling of God, comming from the purpose
of God: vnto which the Apostle here drawes vs, that vve
casting our anchor within the vaile, and resting in the Lords
immutable purpose, may haue comfort in all our present
tentations. It is most expedient for the godly to marke this,
that our manifold changes doe not interrupt our peace:
let vs consider that the Lord hath in such sort dispensed
our saluation, that the ground thereof is laid in his owne
immutable purpose, but the markes and tokens thereof
are placed in vs after our calling: the markes and tokens are
changeable, like a wee our selues in whom they are, are
changeable; but the ground holds fast, being laid in that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
God in whom falles no shadow of alteration,<note place="margin">Esay. 46.</note>
                        <hi>I am God and am not changed:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>My sheepe none can take out

                        <hi>The counsell of the Lord shall stand, and his
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:9473:137"/>
foundation remaines sure.</hi> It is true that the tokens of election
cannot be fully taken away from any that is effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
nay not in the greatest desertion, yet haue they in vs their
owne intention and remission. And this should comfort vs
against our daily vicissitudes and changes, when wee feele
that our Faith doth faint, our life languishes, our hope ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and we are like to sincke in the tentation with <hi>Peter,</hi>
and our feeble hands fall downe with <hi>Moses,</hi> yet let vs not
dispaire; no change in vs can alter Gods vnchangeable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he who hath begunne the worke in vs will also perfect
it.<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Because I am not changed</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>therefore is it
that yee O sonnes of Iacob are not consumed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This purpose of God is called otherwise the will of God.<note place="margin">Our calling &amp; conuersion flowes from Gods purpose &amp; therefore all the praise of it belongs to the Lord.</note>
and the good pleasure of his Will. In that the Apostle
saith our calling is according to his purpose, it teacheth vs
to ascribe the whole praise of our saluation to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his will, and not to our owne foreseene merits. That
poyson of pride which Sathan poured into our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and by which they aspyred to be equall with God,
doth yet breake forth in their posteritie, the corrupt heart of
man euer ayming at this, to seeke vnto himselfe either in
part or in whole, the power and praise of his own saluation.
This is to start vp into the roome of God, and to vsurpe
that glory which belongs to the Lord, and he will not giue
to any other: than the which no greater sacriledge can be
committed against the Lord. O man content thee with that
which the Lord offers thee, and let that alone which hee
reserues vnto himselfe: <hi>My peace</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I giue
to you, my glory I will not giue to any other.</hi> The first Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Gospell were Angels, they proclaymed glory
and peace, but glory they gaue to God which is on high,
and peace they cryed to the children of his good will which
are vpon earth. It is inough that peace and saluation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to be thine, but as for the glory of saluation let it remain
to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:9473:137"/>
Hee is for this called the father of mercy,<note place="margin">For this cause he is called the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not of Iudgement.</note> because mercy
bred in his owne bosome. Hee hath found many causes
without himselfe mouing him to execute iustice, but a cause
mouing him to shew mercie hee neuer found, but the good
pleasure of his will:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>the Lord
hath called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes,
but according to his purpose &amp; grace.</hi> Surely except the Lord
had reserued mercy for vs, we had beene like to Sodome
and Gomorrha: but it pleased him of his owne good will
of the same lumpe of clay to make vs vessels of honour,
whereof hee made others vessels of dishonour. And who
is able sufficiently to ponder so great a benefit? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
howsoeuer the blinded Pharisee sacrifice to his owne
net, and make his mouth to kisse his hand, as if his own hand
had done it, yet let the redeemed of the Lord praise the Lord;
let them cry out with a louder voyce than <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>O Lord
what are wee that thou art so mindefull of vs? Not vnto vs O
Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy name giue the glory, for thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

God that sits vpon the throne, and from the Lambe.</hi> To thee O

                     <p>Now as for the calling;<note place="margin">Our calling is twofold, and the inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our election.</note> we are to know that the calling of

which is the first intimation and declaration of our election.
For the decree of our election is alwaies hid and secret vnto

all those on whom the Lard hath not vouchsafed so much
as an outward calling by his Gospell; and here standeth the
greatest part of the world. In the middle circle, which is
much narrower, stand they who are pertakers of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
calling by the Word and Sacraments. In the third
circle, which yet is of smaller compasse than the other two,
stand they who are inwardly and effectually called; these
are Christs little flocke; the communion of Saints; the few
chosen;<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 9.</note> the Lords third part, so to speake with <hi>Zachary:</hi>
the other two parts shall be cut off and dye, but the third
will the Lord fine as siluer and gold: the Lord will say of
them, this is my people, and they shall say <hi>the Lord is my
God.</hi> It is a great steppe indeed that wee are brought from
the first circle into the second, but it is not sufficient to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
yea, rather they who stand in the second circle, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the voyce of God calling them to repentance, and yet
harden their hearts and will not follow him, may looke
for a more fearefull condemnation then they who are in the
outmost rancke of all. Double stripes are for him who
knoweth his Maisters will, and doth it not. Sodome and
Gomorrha shall be in an easier estate than they. Content
not therefore your selues, that yee are brought within the
compasse of the visible Church, that yee haue beene bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the name of Iesus, and haue communicated at his holy
Table,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Not euery one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into

calling, that the arme of his grace hath drawne you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of the third circle, and hath set you downe
among those, whom he hath chosen to be his owne peculiar
people.</p>
                     <p>And againe, that the calling of God is according to his
purpose yeelds vnto vs this comfort, that seeing his calling
is extended toward vs, we may be sure that from euerlasting
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:9473:138"/>
hee hath had toward vs a purpose of loue.<note place="margin">Where euer the Gospell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to cal men there God hath toward some a purpose of loue.</note> Certainely
hee had not sent his Gospell among vs, were it not that he
hath here a number belonging to the election of his Grace;
hee hath lighted a candle among vs, and set it in an eminent
candlesticke, to assure vs that hee is seeking here some
peeces of money which were lost, and hee will not rest till
hee finde them. When the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> should haue gone
to Bythinia, the Lord commaunded him to goe to Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
what the purpose of God was, the euent declared,
namely,<note place="margin">Acts. 16.</note> that it was to conuert <hi>Lidia</hi> and the Iaylour. Who
may not see here Gods meruailous mercy towards his
owne, that for the conuersion of a few, will haue his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to be preached to a whole kingdome? which doth yet
more clearely appeare, in that when hee commaunded his
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to tarry at Corinthus, hee gaue this reason,
<hi>because</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I haue much people here:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 18. 10.</note> shewing vnto
vs, that the greater haruest hee hath, the longer doth hee
continue his Labourers among a people. This is the very
work of God which hee is working in the middest of you,
and for which hee continueth among you the preaching of
his glorious Gospell, it is because toward many of you, hee
hath a purpose of loue: some hath he called already, whom
hee will haue confirmed; others not yet inwardly called, hee
will conuert by the Gospell, before hee remoue it. Let euery
man looke to himselfe, whether hee haue part in that grace
which comes by the Gospell, or no; for woe will be to him
that shall be found in darknesse, after that the light hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it wold work a greater reuerence of the Gospell.</note> if wee could more deepely
consider this, that the Gospell of the Lord Iesus is come
among vs, not by accident, nor by the meanes of men, but
by the purpose of God: that in these dayes wee heare that
voyce, which many of our Fathers heard not, that in some
places of the world this Gospell is preached, and not in
others, that it is continued with vs, notwithstanding of the
manifold machinations of the Children of darknesse to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:9473:139"/>
subuert it, yea, that by such and such persons the Gospell
hath beene preached vnto vs, if vvee did consider that all
these fall out according to Gods determinate purpose, it
would waken in vs a more reuerent hearing of the word of
Grace, and a greater care to take heede to the smallest oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of grace, when it is offered: but all the contempt
thereof which now is among men floweth from this, that
they doe not looke vnto the hand of God sending out such
a message to them, by such persons, at such a time, in such
a place, as hee in his eternall purpose hath concluded with
himselfe. But as <hi>Samuell</hi> before hee knew the Lord, thought
the voyce of God to be but the voyce of <hi>Eli,</hi> and therefore
went againe to his rest: so the great multitude of them who
heare it, not as the word of God, but as the word of men,
esteeming that it commeth by the meanes of men, and not
according to the determinate purpose of God, it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
if still they returne to their old sinnes, and remaine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to the heauenly vocation.</p>

of God is according to his purpose, we are taught, that
the least intermission of Gods calling should be vnto vs a
great matter of our humiliation; seeing the Lord calleth
men to be Preachers, and hath them in his hand as starres,
holding them out sometime to one part of the world, and
sometime to another, that hee may communicate light to
them who are sitting in darknesse; the remouing of them
from a people is a fearefull token of the Lords departure,<note place="margin">For no hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman will want labourers in his field, as long as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest is not ended.</note>
and translating of his kingdome. The Husbandman calles
not his Labourers out of the field in the middest of the
day, vnlesse the haruest be done: and if the Lord remoue
his Seruants from a people, it is because his purpose is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
for the ground is sure, that his calling is according to
his purpose: but the Lord forbid that the tearme of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this calling should euer come in our dayes.</p>
                     <p>And to the ende that wee haste it not vpon our selues,
wee are to know that as the Gospell comes not to a Land

by mans procurement,<note place="margin">As the Gospell comes not by mans procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so no power of man can remoue it.</note> so no power of man is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
it. The Lord who set the Sunne in the Firmament,
and gouernes it in such sort, that it giues light to one part
of the world when another is in darknesse, and no malice of
the euill doer is able to obscure it, howeuer hee hates it,
hath also set his Gospell in the firmament of his Church,
to giue light to Goshen, while as Egypt is in darknesse;
and all the courses of politikes, though they were filled

exhibited now by Gods effectuall calling, to be performed

                     <p>This comfort the Apostle brake vp shortly as we heard
in the end of the last verse, and now more largely explanes
it in these two verses: in the which hee sets downe in order
the causes of our saluation, and lets vs see how our present
effectuall calling is so inseperably knit with our election &amp;
glorification by the hand of God, that no power in earth
nor in hell is able to sunder them: whereof the certaintie of
his former comfort appeares cleerely, that of necessitie all
things must worke together for the best vnto them that
loue God, euen to them that are called according to his
purpose. Which shall yet be more manifested if wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how that this golden Chaine of our saluation reaches
(so to speake it) from eternitie to eternitie; the beginning
of it, albeit without beginning, is our Election; the end of
it, albeit without end, is our Glorification. And these two
ends of the chaine the Lord keepes them sure and secret in
his owne hand, but the two middle linckes thereof, to wit,
our Calling and Iustification, the Lord lets them downe
from heauen to the earth, that wee for our comfort might
gripe and apprehend them, and being sure of the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
linekes, we might also be sure of the two ends, because
the Lord hath knit them inseperably together.</p>
                     <p>Thou then who wouldst be comforted with the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

linckes of this Chaine, that by them thou mayst be pulled
out of this dungeon and raised vp to heauen to see that
thou art one of them who was elected before time, &amp; after
time shall be glorified. To make this yet more plaine we are
to know that this mortall life of ours is a short interiected
point of time,<note place="margin">Our present life is a point of time betweene two eternities.</note> betweene two eternities (so to call it,) in the
which some in feare and trembling working out their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

others againe in wantonnes and carelesse securitie,
drincke in iniquitie with greedinesse, and so steps from the

of his euerlasting weale or woe by his present disposition
in this life.</p>
                     <p>Oh that we had sanctified memories,<note place="margin">If in this life we fall we may rise againe, but if in death we step downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we shall neuer mend it.</note> alwayes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this: so long as we are here, if of weakenesse wee fall wee
may rise againe, and if in one day we haue not learned well

                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 3.</note> the wicked who die in their
sinnes, step downeward to the deepe pit and gulfe, out of
the which there is no redemption. Let vs therefore be well
aduised before we leape; let vs fasten the one foote vpon the
border of that Canaan, before we go out of the body; let vs
make sure that wee shall be receiued into those euerlasting
habitations. This shall be done if we make our whole life a
proceeding from election to glorification, and that through
calling and iustification, which two haue inseperably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them the sanctification and renouation of the whole
man. The Lord make vs wise in time that we may consider
the course of our life, and thinke of the end whereunto it
leads vs: for as <hi>Moses</hi> protested to Israell, so doe I vnto
you, <hi>I haue laid this day life and death before you:</hi>

In these causes of our saluation linked together in this
Chaine,<note place="margin">Prescience and Predestination how they are here distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> we haue first to looke vnto Gods decree, consisting
in his foreknowledge and predestination: secondly, to the
execution thereof, which is made by his Calling, Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Glorification. The decree hath in it these two acts
or preordinances (so to call them) Prescience and Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which this manner of way are to be distinguished: by
foreknowledge the Lord sets before him the whole number
of mankinde, whom of the good pleasure of his owne will
he purposed to saue: so that the first preordinance is this,
these are they whom I will saue: by predestination againe
he concluded to saue them by such and such meanes; so that
the second preordinance of the decree is this; those whom
I haue decreed to saue I will saue this manner of way; so that
prescience lookes to the person to be saued, predestination
to the meanes whereby they are to be saued. Where wee
must consider that this decree of God is thus distinguished
by the Apostle in these two words for our capacitie, who
being but mortall creatures endued with reason, conceiues,
vnderstands, and discernes one thing after another, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe otherwise: but it is not so with the Lord our God,
who being himselfe a most perfect vnderstanding, by one act
without prioritie or posterioritie, knowes, conceiues, and
discernes all things.</p>
                     <p>We come first now to speake of Gods foreknowledge:<note place="margin">Prescience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto God.</note>
the properties of God are either absolute, as namely, that
he is a Spirit, simple, and infinite, or else such as haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the creature. And of this sort is foreknowledge,
which improperly is ascribed vnto God: for properly there
is no fore not after in God, nothing past, nothing to come:
but foreknowledge is ascribed to God in respect of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because he knew vs before that wee were. This fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
is two wayes considered:<note place="margin">Prescience two manner of wayes conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, generally, and specially.</note> first, generally, as it is
extended to all his creatures, and so it is compared to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

things which were afterward to be: and of this speakes the

                        <hi>My bones</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are not hid from thee, though
I was made in a secret place and fashioned beneath in the earth,
thine eyes did see mee, when I was without forme: for in thy

fashioned, though they were not before.</hi> Of it also speakes the
Apostle,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>All things are manifest in his sight with whom wee
haue to doe.</hi> This manner of way foreknowledge is Gods

their actions, their beginnings, their ends, but foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

loue and liking of God, as it is all one with Election, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

it is affirmed of the Godly,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13. 18.</note>

considered, is called the booke of life, vvherein the Lord
hath written the names of those vvhom hee hath ordayned
to life.</p>
                     <p>Predestination is also two manner of wayes considered,<note place="margin">Predestination is also two wayes conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>
first, as it is generally extended to all his creatures, for as he

buildeth an house, knowes not how long it vvill stand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fire shall consume it, or the winde ouer-turne it, or the
earth-quake vndermine it; but the Lord as hee hath made
his creatures, so hath he appoynted them to an end, which
hee knoweth himselfe: but here Predestination is specially
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:9473:142"/>
considered, and is no larger than Election, respecting the

cause of predestination but an effect.</p>
                     <p>But beside these,<note place="margin">Sanctification is an effect of predestination and therefore not a cause of it.</note> this errour is conuinced by manifold
proofes of holy Scripture: the Apostle saith, <hi>hee hath chosen
vs in Christ,</hi> therefore not in our selues: he saith againe, <hi>that
wee should be holy and without blame,</hi> hee saith not, hee chose
vs because hee foresaw that wee would be holy; so hee sets
downe sanctification as an effect of Predestination.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> Now it
is certaine that one effect of Predestination may well be the
cause of an other posterior effect, as the preaching of the
word is a cause of faith, and faith is a certaine cause of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but no effect of Predestination can be cause of it.
Againe he saith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord hath saued vs, and called vs with
an holy calling, not according to our workes,</hi> here yee see, that
in our calling our workes and Gods purpose are manifestly
opponed, so that the putting of the one is the remouing of
the other: thus neyther in our Election before time, not
in our calling in time, hath the Lord regarded our works,
or foreseene rectitude of our will, but the good pleasure of
his owne will.</p>
                     <p>And I pray you what other thing could the Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
in vs,<note place="margin">The calling of God sinds eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in an euill estate.</note> than that which hee foresaw in the Israelites? <hi>I

so many places of holy Scripture doth the Lord plead the
cause of his owne glory, that it cannot be but a most feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

them: for those whom God hath appointed to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
hee hath also appointed to those meanes which may
bring them vnto it. It is therefore a blasphemie which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the mouthes of carnall professers, if I be elected
howsoeuer I liue I shall be saued, and if otherwise I be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,

nature of fire to be cold, so is it impossible that the elect
man effectually called can reason after this manner, yea the
more hee heares of election, the more hee endeauours to
make it sure by well doing, knowing that no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the end of our Faith, which is the saluation of our
soule, but by the lawfull and ordinary meanes.</p>
                     <p>Both temporall and spirituall blessings the Lord will haue

Cornes cannot serue Israell except the earth beare them; the

Therefore when the Lord promises a blessing, <hi>In that day</hi>
(saith the Lord) <hi>I will heare the heauens, and they shall heare
the earth,</hi>

the same order in bestowing spiritual blessings we are taught
by the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13</note> when he saith, that before wee be saued we

                     <p>And againe for our further comfort wee haue here to

to day nor yesterday that the Lord concluded to be
mercifull vnto vs; our election beganne not with our selues:
before the mountaines were made, before the earth and the
world were formed, euen from euerlasting to euerlasting the
Lord is our God. What creature then is able to disanull
that which God hath willed, before that euer a creature
was? onely let vs labour that as our election is sure in it
selfe, so we may make it sure vnto vs, by walking in a good
conscience before the Lord, and then we shall not care what
man or Angell say to the contrary against it; they are but
posterior creatures, and what intrest can they haue to gaine
say that which God hath done before that they were?
Happy are they who are rooted, grounded, and builded
vpon this rocke; no stormy waue of the sea shall ouerturne
them, no rage of tentation, nor power of the gates of hell
shall preuaile against them.</p>
                     <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Sauing grace is communicated to few, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore should be the more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> we are taught here by the holy Apostle that all
men are not foreknowne, all are not predestinated to life,
otherwise there were not an election: there is onely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and definit number which belong to the election of
Grace; a fulnesse both of Iewes and Gentiles; a number not
knowne to vs, but knowne to the Lord; not one more nor
one lesse shall be pertakers of saluation. <hi>Many</hi> (saith out

                        <hi>Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of

so long as the calling of God continues among vs, to take

creature; but parcels of the earth possessed by men
in propertie, are much more remembred and regarded by
those to whom they belong; riches and honour are in greater
account among men because few attaine vnto them: and if
we were as wise in spirituall things, that grace of Christ
which brings saluation would be more pretious and deere
vnto vs, because it is communicated to few. The Lord giue
vs grace to consider rightly of it in time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To be made like to the image of his Sonne.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Predestination is vnto glory by a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Christ in our present life.</note> The Apostle
insists not in the rest of the linckes of the Chaine; hauing
touched them he leaues them, onely he insists in this lincke
of Predestination: teaching vs that he vseth not here the
word of Predestination generally, but restraines it to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination
vnto life; as also that we cannot step from electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to glory but by a conformitie with Christ, which is most
necessary for vs to marke: for albeit there be great comfort
in the consideration of Gods immutable purpose ordayning
man to life, as also in the consideration of that glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are ordayned, yet neither of them can comfort vs
vnlesse we be sure that our life is a proceeding from electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to glorification by the right meanes.</p>
                     <p>The first and neerest end of election in regard of man,
is his sanctification:<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> for the Lord hath chosen vs that wee
should be holy:<note place="margin">As Christ is the life, so is he the way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can wee come to life but by the way</note> the second and furthest end is mans glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
The same Lord Iesus who said <hi>I am the life,</hi> said in
like manner <hi>I am the way and the veritie:</hi> if thou wouldst be
at life, lye not still in thy sinnes, but rise and walke in the way,
and if thou knowest not the way, learne it from him who is
veritie.<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> Let not presumption which slayes the wicked ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
thee; they passe ouer the matter of their saluation with
a wanton word; their hearts are prophane, yet they boast
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:9473:145"/>
with their tongues that they are sure to be saued; but this
is a vaine reioycing: for he that walkes not in the way, how
is it possible that he can come to the end? assuredly he shall
neuer come where Christ is to liue with him, that walkes
not after Christ in newnesse of life.</p>
                     <p>This conformitie with the Lord Iesus whereunto wee
are predestinated,<note place="margin">Conformitie with Christ wherein it stands.</note> is partly in this life, partly in the life to
come. Our conformitie in the life to come shall stand in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and raigning with Christ, which is our glorification,
whereof he speakes hereafter. Our conformitie in this life
stands in liuing and suffering with Christ, and of this hee
speakes here; to liue godly after the rule of Christ, to suffer
patiently after the similitude of Christ, are the two parts of
our present conformitie with him. The Lord Iesus is giuen
vs of the Father both to be a Sauiour, and an example, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we make him an example to follow him in our doing
and suffering, he shall not be vnto vs a Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>Here we are to marke that the workes done by Christ in
our nature,<note place="margin">Workes done by Christ are threefold: 1. personall workes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: 2. Miracles: 3. workes of a godly life.</note> are threefold: first, his personall workes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
as that he was borne of the Virgin; that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the cursed death of the Crosse, for the expiation of
our sinnes; that hee rose the third day for our iustification;
that hee ascended triumphantly into Heauen, leading capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
captiue. Secondly, his workes of miracles; as that hee
fasted forty dayes; gaue sight to the blinde; life to the dead,
and such like. Thirdly, his workes of godlinesse and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification;
as that he was subiect to his parents; louing to
his brethren; painefull in his calling; perseuering in prayer.
To practise to follow him in his personall workes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is blasphemie, or in his workes of Miracles is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie,
but to follow him in the workes of a godly life,
is true pietie. In the first Papists are blasphemous, that on
good Fryday makes a play to the people,<note place="margin">In the first and second Papists are apish imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</note> by counterfaiting
the sufferings of Christ. In the second Papists are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that practise to counterfaite him in his fortie dayes
fasting, as if that might ordinarily be done of men, which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:9473:145"/>
once Iesus did for a Miracle. In the third let all those who
are truely religious striue to follow him: as Children loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to their coppy learne to mend their letters; so let vs
by looking daily to our example, learne to amend our
liues.</p>
                     <p>Imitation in the first two Iesus did neuer require,<note place="margin">In the third onely should we follow the Lord Iesus.</note> onely
hee craues that wee should follow him in the third: there
is his voyce, <hi>Learne of me that I am lowly and meeke,</hi> he did
not bid thee (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) learne at him how to make
the world,<note place="margin">Iohn, 13. 15.</note> or how to raise the dead, but how to be lowly
and meeke, for this cause did our blessed Sauiour wash his

one of vs should serue another,<note place="margin">Iohn, 15. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>as I haue loued you</hi> (saide

hee prayed for his enimies, hee hath also taught vs how to
practise that precept,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>Pray for them who persecute you.</hi> In pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
likewise hee is proposed vnto vs for an example,
for so are wee exhorted,<note place="margin">Heb, 12. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Let vs runne with patience the race
that is set before vs, looking vnto Iesus the author and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher

                     <note place="margin">We must also follow the Lord Iesus in suffering.</note>
                     <p>The other poynt wherein stands our conformitie with
him, is in patient suffering with him for righteousnes, which
wee shall not be able to doe, except wee liue first after the
similitude of his life: what liker suffering to the suffering of
Christ, than the suffering of that reprobate theefe, who
dyed with Iesus at the same time, the same kinde of death?
yet because his life was neuer like the life of Christ, his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
shall neuer be accounted the sufferings of Christ.

the Lord Iesus conuerted vpon the Crosse, to declare to all
the world that euen in death, hee retayned the power of a
Sauiour, able to giue life to them who are dead, hee brought
out in the last houre of his life, the first fruites of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life; hee liued long a wicked malefactor, but short
while a conuerted Christian; yet in that same space hee
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:9473:146"/>
abounded in the fruits of Godlinesse, confessing his sinnes,
giuing glory to the iustice of God, rebuking the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the other, and pleading the cause of his innocent
Sauiour; thus being turned from his sinne, hee began, euen
on the Crosse to liue with Iesus, and therefore heard that

vvhich by creation belonged to our fore father. But alas,
what a beastly stupiditie is this, that man will not doe so

                     <p>The name of the first borne is ascribed vnto Iesus Christ
three manner of wayes:<note place="margin">The name of the first borne three wayes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Christ: 1. as God: 2. as man: 3. as a mediator</note> first, as hee is God: secondly, as he

and the head of his misticall body, vvhich is his Church. As
hee is God, hee is called by the Apostle, <hi>Primogenitus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

by such a generation as none (saith <hi>Esay</hi>) are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 15.</note>
Now before the creature was, what could there be?
surely nothing but the Creator. Secondly, as hee is man S.

of the Virgin.<note place="margin">Luke. 2. 7.</note> Thirdly, as Mediator and head of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall

of strength, for hee had a double portion: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
excellency of dignitie, for he vvas the Prince and priest
of the rest of his brethren: now both these most properly
appertaines to our eldest brother Christ Iesus. Excellencie
of strength is his, hee hath receiued the double portion: for
hee receiued not the Spirit in measure as wee doe, but the
plentitude and fulnesse thereof was communicated vnto him,
and the comfort thereof redounds vnto vs: for he receiued
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:9473:147"/>
it not for himselfe but for vs, that of his fulnesse we might
all receiue grace for grace. Excellencie also of dignitie is his;
for beside that glory which hee had with his Father from
the beginning,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18.</note> hee is also as our head crowned with glory
and dignitie; all power in heauen and earth is giuen him,
and he is set ouer his brethren, as the onely high Priest of
the liuing God, who makes attonement for the sinnes of
his brethren; as the onely Prophet and teacher of the whole
familie of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> for so hath the Father authorized him: <hi>This

                     <p>Let vs therefore submit our selues vnto him,<note place="margin">Miserable are they in this age who doe not acknowledge Christs prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue.</note> seeing God
the Father hath set him ouer vs, let vs not be disobedient to
that heauenly proclamation (<hi>heare him.</hi>) Woe be to them
that subscribes not vnto the excellencie of his dignitie. But
alas, if the world proclaime such pleasures as shee hath to
giue by any sport or play, or such profits as she can yeeld
at her fairest fayres and markets, O what a frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of people is made vnto her? but if the Priests of the
Lord stand as they did of old in the west part of Ierusalems
temple, on their seuerall turrets, to blow their two siluer
Trumpets, and warne the people to resort vnto the house of
the Lord, or if now any other manner of way signification
be made vnto them to enter into the courts of the Lord with
praise, how few shall hee finde flocking vnto the house of
God in respect of them who abides without, and followes
the world; and which is yet more to be lamented, there are
many of those who heare the word of Christ, and yet doth
not change the manner of their conuersation for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
he can giue them; speake what he will, they

when we were carried away captiue by spirituall <hi>Chedarlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
he did not onely hazard, but laid downe his life of our
Redemption. <hi>Moses</hi> is greatly praysed for that when hee
was honourable in Aegipt, hee left the court of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to
visit his brethren, esteeming the rebuke of Christ in his

Husband and Wife, of Maisters and Seruants, of Parents

that he makes it drop vpon one hart, &amp; not vpon another.
The Gospell is preached to many, but the blessing that
comes by the Gospell abides onely vpon the children of
peace. Let euery one among you see to himselfe, this prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

who hitherto haue receiued the word of grace in vaine: but

to consider that the grace of God hath conuerted so many

of the skie, and can marke the tokens of his anger in the

to know that the word of Iustifying hath three principall
significations. First, to iustifie is all one with this, to sanctifie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or to infound by grace new qualities into the soule of man,
and so Iustification is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

euer;</hi> and in this sense the Papists take it in this question,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but wrongfully.<note place="margin">Luke. 7. 29</note> Secondly, to iustifie, is to acknowledge or
declare one to be iust: so it is said that the Publicans iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
God; of force wee must expound it, they acknowledged
or confessed him to be iust: so S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith that <hi>a man is
iustified by workes,</hi> that is, declared to be iust by his workes,
or as S. <hi>Iames</hi> expounds it himselfe, his Iustification is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by his works. Thirdly, the word to Iustifie, is a iudiciall
terme, and it signifieth to absolue in iudgement, and is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
to condemning: so <hi>Salomon</hi> vseth it, <hi>He that iustifies
the wicked, and condemnes the iust, are both alike abhominat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>on
to the Lord:</hi> and in this sense the Apostle vseth it here, for
he oppones it to condemnation.</p>
                     <p>This right vnderstanding of the word,<note place="margin">Iustification is opponed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> will lead vs to
know what the benefit of Iustification is: for what euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
be, Iustification must be the contrary: they are
both iudiciall termes, vsed in iudgement holden on matters
of life and death. Condemnation (no man will deny) is the
sentence of a righteous Iudge, adiudging a malefactor to
death for some capitall crime whereof hee is found guiltie
in iudgement: Iustification then is the sentence of God, a
righteous Iudge, absoluing the man that is in Christ from
sinne and death, and accepting him to life for the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ, which is his.</p>
                     <p>So that it is euident,<note place="margin">How the state of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation stands betweene vs and the Papists</note> the state of the question in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
of Iustification will be this: how is a man iustified
before God? that is, what is it that a man must bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods tribunall, for the which hee shall be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
innocent, absolued from death, and adiudged to life?
whether is it our workes of sanctification inherent in vs, or
is it the righteousnesse of Christ giuen vnto vs, and made
ours? The question being this way taken vp, shall giue great
light to the controuersie that is betweene vs and the falsely
named Catholikes of our time: for we denie not that there
is in Gods children an inherent sanctification, and that they
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:9473:154"/>
are changed from vnrighteousnesse to righteousnesse, but
this inherent righteousnesse (say we) is not able to purchase
to vs an absoluitorie sentence from death.</p>
                     <p>To make this yet more cleare,<note place="margin">Foure names giuen to that righteousnesse, by which wee are iustified.</note> let vs know that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
by which wee are Iustified, receiues foure names:
first, it is called the righteousnesse of Christ: secondly, the
righteousnesse of God: thirdly, the righteousnesse of Faith:
fourthly, our righteousnesse. The righteousnesse of Christ,
because it is conquered by him, and inherent in him, as in
the proper subiect: The righteousnesse of God, because he
onely in his meruailous wisedome found it out: it is called
the righteousnesse of Faith, because Faith is the instrument
by which wee apprehend it: and it is called our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
because it is giuen vnto vs of God to be ours, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
on Gods part, by acceptation of it by Faith vpon
our part, for these two wayes that acquisite righteousnesse
of Christ is made ours.</p>
                     <p>This wee haue to marke for our comfort,<note place="margin">The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes is ours, stoppeth the mouth of all that impugnes our Faith.</note> against those
obiections, which eyther inwardly by Sathan, or outwardly
by men of a contrary opinion are obiected vnto vs. If they
to trouble our peace, and weaken our Faith, aske, how can
yee be iustified by a righteousnesse which is not yours? we
answere, the righteousnesse of Christ is ours, and ours by
as great a right as any other thing that we possesse is ours,
to wit, by the free gift of God: seeing it hath pleased God
to giue vs a garment who were naked, and to giue vs, who
had none of our owne, a righteousnesse answerable to his
Iustice, vvhat intrest can eyther man or Angell haue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

impugnes this doctrine, are chiefely these: First, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
(say they) excludeth the works of nature, not the works
of Grace; the workes of a man vnregenerate they confesse
cannot iustifie him, but the works of a man regenerate, say
they, doe iustifie him: but this is false, as is proued first
by examples: for <hi>Abraham</hi> whose example the Apostle
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:9473:155"/>
bringeth in to confirme the doctrine of Iustification, was
a regenerate man and effectually called; yet as witnesseth
both <hi>Moses</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Proued by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> his faith was counted to him for
righteousnesse. <hi>Dauid</hi> after hee had beene a regenerate man
yet saith, <hi>Lord enter not into iudgement with thy Seruant, for
in thy sight shall no flesh be iustified.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
of himselfe, I haue in all good conscience serued God
vnto this day; neyther know I any thing of my selfe, yet
am I not thereby iustified: hee was more abundant in good
workes than all the rest of the Apostles: hee did also beare
in his body the markes of Iesus; and was renouned through
his manifold sufferings: If euer any regenerate man could
haue beene iustified by his good workes, it was this holy
Apostle, yet hee tels you himselfe, for all that I haue done,
for all that I haue suffered, yet am I not thereby iustified.</p>

                     <p>But they insist,<note place="margin">How it is that workes of men regenerate doe not merit, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are workes done in vs by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ.</note> the workes of regenerate men are the
workes of Christ, for it is hee who by his spirit workes
them in them, therefore they are meritorious and iustifies. I answere, the workes of Christ iustifies, it is true, if yee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
his personall workes, done by himselfe in his own
person; as the Apostle teacheth vs, <hi>He hath purged our sinnes
by himselfe.</hi> But as for those workes which hee workes in vs
by his spirit of grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3</note> hee workes them not for our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that as I haue said he hath done already by himselfe
and in his owne person, but for our sanctification. Secondly,
the good workes of men regenerate are so wrought by
Christ in vs that they are also wrought by vs, and we haue
our working in them, and therefore by reason of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
cannot be perfect: for as the fountaines of the
actions are, so must the actions be themselues, the fountaines
are mixed being partly good, and partly euill: for our mind
is not so illuminated that there is no darknesse in it; neither
is our hart so sanctified that there is no vncleannesse in it, and
therefore the actions flowing from thence cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
workes of light and sanctification.</p>
                     <p>They insist yet further and obiects,<note place="margin">Faith &amp; works are not simply opponed to other, for they are inseperable but opponed onely in the act of Iustification</note> if the Apostle say
they in his conclusion, we are iustified by Faith without the
workes of the Law, did vnderstand the workes of Grace,
then it would follow that he oppones things which are not
to be opponed: for workes and Grace, workes and Faith,
workes and Christ, are not opposite but agrees very well
together, as the cause and effect, as the tree and the branch.
To this we answere that Faith and workes agrees well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but there is no thing in the world which agree so
well the one with the other, but in some things they may be
opponed: as for example; the tree and the branch agrees
very well together, but if the question be moued whether
the tree beares the branch or the branch the tree, in this
they are opponed; that which is affirmed of the one must
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:9473:156"/>
be denyed of the other. Againe, there is a very sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
betweene a naturall Father and the sonne, the one of
them cannot be without the other: for hee is not a Father,
who neuer had a sonne; neither is he a sonne, who neuer had
a father: but if this be the question which of them gaue
beginning to another, here we must oppone them, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that of the one, which wee deny of the other. In like
manner there is a very sweet harmonie and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Faith and good workes; but if this be the question,
for which of them it is that God doth iustifie vs, there wee
must oppone them, affirming with the Apostle that we are
iustified by Faith, and not by workes: alway the opposition
is not simple, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Their second euasion is a distinction of the workes of the

workes of the law ceremoniall iustifies not, but the workes
of the Law Morall iustifies. But the Apostle in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
excludes from iustification the workes of the Law
Morall, for these reasons: he excludes those workes of which
he hath proued both Iewes and Gentiles to be guiltie, but
so it is he hath proued them to be guiltie of the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law Morall, as is euident out of the sins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he charges them, therefore, &amp;c. Secondly, he excludes
from iustification the workes of that law by which comes
the knowledge of sinne; but so it is the knowledge of sinne
comes by the law Morall, therefore, &amp;c. <hi>I had not kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Their third euasion is by a distinction of the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
iustification,<note place="margin">The distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first and second Iustification improued.</note> the first whereof say they is by Faith,
but the second is by workes. But this twofold iustification
is also forged: for <hi>iustificatio est actus indiuidius &amp; simul totus,</hi>
there is no first and last in the act of iustification: hee that

doth teach vs, Christ is made to vs righteousnesse and

if these new qualities infused by Grace into the soule of
man, and good workes flowing there from be the matter as
they say of mans second Iustification, then let them tell vs
what is the matter of his sanctification.</p>

whomsoeuer the Lord imputes the righteousnes of Christ,

holy spirit, an inherent righteousnesse, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

our transformation into the glorious image of God. The

This Ioy which is the highest degree of eternall life,<note place="margin">A three-fold ioy we haue in this life.</note> wee

                        <hi>and reioyce in him with Ioy vnspeakeable and glorious.</hi>
Secondly, there is a Ioy which ariseth of feeling and tasting,
<hi>taste and consider how gratious the Lord is,</hi> and this feeling
is much more than beleeuing. Thirdly, there is a ioy which
ariseth of sight and of spirituall embracing; such vvas the
ioy of <hi>Simeon</hi> when hee saw that promised saluation, and
embraced the Lord Iesus in his armes.</p>

against the Christian to hurt him, the reason is, because
God is with him. In the second he glories that the Christian
can want nothing that is needfull for him, the reason is, seeing
the Lord hath giuen vnto vs his owne sonne, which is the
greatest gift, that can be giuen, he will not let vs want any
of his inferiour gifts.</p>

electing, calling, and iustifying vs, that he may glorifie vs, as
hath beene said, then we may be sure that nothing can be
against vs. This I marke because worldlings iudge of Gods

which they iudged was true, for GOD was present with
<hi>Abraham</hi> indeed, but the rule by which they so iudged was

<hi>Sosthenes</hi> before he was a Christian was a ruler of a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,

is also true in inward tentations: when our Sauiour beganne

                     <p>They who are one the side of Iesus are knowne chiefely
these two manner of wayes:<note place="margin">Why all the followers of Christ are pursued of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than with rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse malice.</note> First, Sathan fights against
them: Secondly, they are also warriours against him: the
first without the second is nothing; for man euen as hee is
a naturall man is an obiect of Sathans malice, but where the
grace of God hath made the man a new creature, there Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
doubles his hatred; for hee enuies most the glory of
Gods mercy, whereof hee knowes he shall neuer be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
As <hi>Nabuchadnezers</hi> countenance changed, and his
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:9473:163"/>
rage encreased when the three Children refused in his face
to worship his image, and thereupon commaunded to make
his Ouen seauen times hotter than it was before: so is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
malice most intended against those who plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to fall downe and worship him.</p>
                     <p>But that the godly be not discouraged with his malice,<note place="margin">What com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ort christians haue of this that they finde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than an enimie to them.</note>
let vs remember that first hee was an enimie vnto God, or
euer he was an enimie vnto vs, and that wee haue cause to
reioyce in that we finde that Apostate spirit an enimie vnto
vs, whom God from the beginning hath proclaymed to be
an enimie vnto himselfe. Secondly, we are to collect of his
inuasion and our resistance that there is in vs some measure
of the grace of Iesus Christ: for against those doth he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
his malitious assaults, on whom hee sees that the Lord
hath multiplyed his graces: like to a crafitie Pirate, who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by the emptie vessell, sets vpon that which is loadned.
Thirdly, howeuer he being compared with vs hath many
vantages; as that he is more subtile in nature, being of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
experience and more auncient, being now almost sixe
thousand yeeres old: and hath also vantage of place; for he
is the Prince of the Aire, assisted with armies of spirituall
wickednesse, who for their number are legions, for their
strength principalities &amp; powers, for their subtiltie serpents,
for their fiercenesse dragons: yet stronger is he who is on
our side, than they who are against vs; the serpents head is
bruised, some life remaines in him, but hee hath no power
to inflict death on them which are in Christ.</p>
                     <p>But what euer inimitie Sathan exercise against vs,<note place="margin">If so be that they also liue at inimity with Sathan.</note> it is not
sufficient to comfort vs, vnlesse wee also liue as enimies vnto
him. It was a notable speach of <hi>Azariah</hi> to Prophet to
<hi>Asa, the Lord is with you, while yee be with him:</hi> if thou
stand with the compleat armour of God,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 2</note> pleading the cause
of God, fighting against the enimie of God, than mayst thou
say in a good conscience, God is with thee, and thou art with
him. But alas we see in this generation many wearing Christs
liuerie, and bearing Sathans armour, professing friendship
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:9473:164"/>
to Christ yet fighting against him: these two factions are
entred already into the battaile <hi>pelmell,</hi> so that in the smallest
fellowships some ye shall finde aduancing the kingdome of
the one,<note place="margin">This comfort taken from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men who professe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to Christ, and are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to Sathan</note> though very few to fight for the glory of the other.
What a shame is this for vs, who say we are on the Lords
side, that a wicked man seruing Sathan shall in our audience
open his mouth to blaspheme God, and we will not open
our mouthes to rebuke him? we see carnall men so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
that they stand vpon no circumstances to dishonour
God, and we who professe we loue him, for feare wee faile
against curtesie, and I cannot tell what circumstances, dare
not open our mouthes to praise him. Our coldnesse in this
point hath neede to be admonished, that we may be stirred
vp not by profession onely, but by conuersation also, to
make it knowen to the world, that wee belong wholy to
the Lord Iesus.</p>
                     <p>

An example whereof we haue in that notable warriour
of God,<note place="margin">This is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Iob.</note> Patient <hi>Iob,</hi> whom the Lord set vp as an obiect of

hee could: hee crossed him not onely in his goods, in
his children, and in his owne body, but also in his minde;
by his wife hee tempted him to blasphemie; by his friends
to diffidence; yet by none of these could hee ouercome him:
In his outward troubles his resolution was,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 21.</note>

                        <hi>yet would I trust in him:</hi> so impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is it for Sathan by any tentation whatsoeuer, to seperate

of wayes present with his children in trouble: first, hee is
with them by preuenting the danger, so that hee will not
suffer the intended euill of the enimie to come neere them:
so he brought <hi>Senacherib</hi> to see Ierusalem without, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him not to shoot so much as a dart against it within.
Somtime again the Lord enters his children into the trouble,
as <hi>Daniel</hi> into the den, <hi>Ioseph</hi> into the prison, the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into the fire; but deliuers them in such sort that both his
glory, and their comfort is greater than if they had not
beene in trouble at all: Sometime hee suffers his children
to end their mortall liues in trouble, and yet is with them
strengthening them by his glorious might to all patience
and long suffering, filling them with such a sense of his
loue, that in death they rest vnder the assurance of life.</p>
                     <p>The practise of this see in the examples of <hi>Eliah</hi> and

out the vttermost dregs thereof. So straite is the Iustice of
God, that sinne being imputed to the Sonne of God, who
had no sinne of his owne, is pursued to the vttermost. The
greatest example of Iustice that euer the Lord declared in
the world, the drowning of the originall world, the burning
of Sodome; the plaguing of Egypt; were terrible proofes of
the straitnesse of diuine Iustice, but nothing comparable to
this.</p>
                     <p>Which I marke partly for a comfort to the Godly,<note place="margin">Comfort for the Godly that the iustice of God shall not, nay cannot strike vpon them.</note> and
partly for a warning to the wicked: it is our great comfort,
that the saluation which Iesus hath purchased vnto vs, hee
hath obtained it with a full satisfaction of his Fathers Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
so that now wee that are in him, are not any more
to feare it. The great Iudge of all the world will not doe
vnrighteously, to require that againe from vs, which our
Christ, whom hee himselfe hath giuen vnto vs, hath payed
for vs.</p>
                     <p>And as for the wicked who are not in Christ,<note place="margin">Miserable are the wicked who in their owne persons beare the punishment of their sinnes.</note> how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
will their state and condition be, for they must beare
the punishment of their owne sinnes in their owne persons?
If the burden of that wrath due to our sinnes, caused Iesus
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:9473:166"/>
to sweat bloud,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 38.</note> and to say, that his soule was heauy vnto
the very death. O how shall the burden of this wrath presse
downe the wicked! it is euen a horrour to think of it: their
faces shall be confused without, and their spirits oppressed
within, with tribulation and anguish; hee that spared not
in his owne Sonne sinne imputed vnto him, will hee spare

our possession. The children of God haue the right and

heires:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord giues it or with-holds it, according as hee sees may
be for the good of his children. We know our father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had the right of Canaan when he had not the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Lord giues not alwayes possession of that to his Children
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:9473:167"/>
whereof they haue the right. But as for the wicked they haue
possession without a right, and therefore shall be punished
as theeues and robbers, and violent vsurpers of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whereunto Iesus Christ who is the heyre of all hath

                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Seeing all things are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by God, let vs moderate our care, and take nothing but out of his fatherly hand.</note> wee marke here that the giuing and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

this it would moderate our care, and make vs in our callings
first to seeke the Lords blessing, loath any manner of way
to take the things of this world, vnlesse we see they be giuen
vs out of the hand of God. For we are to know that Sathan
who is a counterfaiter of God, doth also arrogate to himself,
though falsely, to be the giuer of things: hee that durst say
to the sonne of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>all the kingdomes of the earth are mine,
I will giue them to thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me:</hi>
will hee stand in awe to speake it vnto sinnefull man? No
indeed, it is his daily tentation, by which he circumuents ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
intangling their hearts with the loue of worldly gaine,
that to obtaine it they care not to lye, to steale, to sweare,
to oppresse, to deceiue one another: which in effect is to
fall downe before Sathan and worship him.</p>
                     <p>Thus Sathan rules in the kingdome of Babell,<note place="margin">Sathan another Nabuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer, and a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak, offers also gifts to men.</note> like a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> presenting to his subiects his great

that is, worldly pleasures, vvealth, and prosperitie,
which bewitch the simple and makes them fall downe and

with the Apostle in whatsoeuer state we are to be content,
remembring that euery mans portion of vvorldly things is
measured vnto him from the Lord. We see that a steward

aged and the young, the seruant and the Lord receiues not
a like portion, yet no man gainsayes it; and shall vve not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
the Lords dispensation, who is the great steward of
his familie in heauen and earth, shall vve murmure against
him if he giue <hi>Beniamin</hi> a double portion, and bestow vpon
some of his children these worldly things in greater aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
than he doth vpon others? farre be it from vs: for he
dispenses these perishing things in great vvisedome and loue

how wee must fight before wee triumph, and mourne

                     <p>Now to enter into the words.<note place="margin">The tongue of the wicked is a fornace of fire wherein the godly are tryed</note> The Apostle conioynes
these two interrogations together very conueniently, <hi>Who

wee shall want accusations: for the world, Sathan, and our

<hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet, albeit he so loued his country

the Christians of the primitiue Church oppressed with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

                     <p>Now as for Sathan he is stiled the accuser of the Saints
of God night and day;<note place="margin">Sathan stiled a calumniator or accuser &amp; why.</note> sometime hee accuses God to man;
sometime man to God; and sometime man to himselfe.<note place="margin">Reue. 12. 10</note> In

he lyes against the mercy of God, as vvhen hee saith to the

he lyes against Gods prouidence, as when hee saith to them

put out their hand to wickednesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Hee accuseth man vnto God</note> he is a restlesse accuser of man vnto God, as

sonne, a mercenarie worshipper, who serued God for his
gifts and not for himselfe, albeit after tryall he was found
a lyer. And herein we are to consider how faithlesse a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
Sathan is, for those same sinnes which man doth by
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:9473:171"/>
Sathans instigation, he is the first accuser of man for them
vnto God.<note place="margin">A discouery of Sathans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

euer doing one of these three against him: first hee is a

hee is an accuser of man vnto God for those same
sinnes <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>which he tempted him to doe: and thirdly, hee is a
tormenter of man for them, vnlesse they be remoued by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
But Iesus Christ our Lord is of a plaine contrary
disposition: first hee disswades vs from sinne, warning vs of
the danger, and then if of weakenesse wee sinne, hee offers
himselfe an aduocate for vs if wee repent:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>These things my

haue an aduocate with the Father, euen Iesus the iust.</hi> These
two compared lets vs see what a great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, that knowing the deceitfull malice of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
we may learne to abhorre him; and the heartie vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
affection of Iesus Christ toward vs, wee may loue and
follow him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Hee accuseth man vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> Sathan accuses man vnto himselfe: he deceiues
the vvicked &amp; beares them in hand that they are the sonnes
of God, and labours to perswade the godly that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
denying that they haue Faith or Repentance, or
any spiritual grace. There is nothing so true but Sathan dare
deny it: hee that durst call it in doubt to Christ himselfe
whether he were the sonne of God or no, will that shameles

saluation in feare and trembling,</hi> and make sure our calling
by well doing, that we may haue within vs the infallible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of our election, and as for the rest let vs keepe this
ground; seeing the worke of our saluation is done by God,
in despite of Sathan; Sathans testimonie in it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
though hee would call vs as he did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi>
the seruants of the liuing of God, yet are we not the better,
neither the worse, albeit hee pronounce vs to be such as are

And last, the children of God are accused of their owne
consciences: these are eyther such as proceede from suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
light, or from wrong information.<note place="margin">Conscience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth eyther vpon right or wrong infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> If conscience accuse
vpon light which shee hath receiued out of the word of

shee accuse vpon wrong information, it is the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of conscience, and wee are to remedie it by sending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to seeke the warrant of her sentence out of the word
of God. It is very expedient that wee put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
conscience and the errour of conscience:<note place="margin">Conscience, &amp; error of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</note> where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

which are lawfull: for if this be not obserued, wee
shall be disquieted while we hearken to the errours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as if they were the iust and lawfull accusations of

                     <p>Sometime againe conscience presents to men sins which
they haue done many yeeres agoe,<note place="margin">Why the Lord leaues remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a sin in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science after that it is pardoned.</note> and whereof they haue

the memorie thereof to remaine in that conseruing facultie
of conscience, called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that it may both serue to
humble vs for the euill wee haue done, as also to preserue
vs from sinne for the time to come. And sinne this manner
of way retained in the memory, I compare it to thornes &amp;
bryers, which in the middest of a garden are hurtfull, and
hinder the grouth of good fruit, but being put in the hedge
are profitable to preserue them:<note place="margin">Sin euill in the affection but good in the memory.</note> so sinne as long as it is in
the affection is very pernitious; for then it chokes the seede
of the word of God in them, but being taken out of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and set in the memory, is as a hedge to the soule, to
preserue it from wilde and raging beasts that would come
in and deuoure it: thus for our humiliation the Lord keepes
in vs a remembrance euen of those sinnes which hee hath
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:9473:172"/>
pardoned, but so that with the remembrance of the euill
which we haue done, our conscience doth also excuse and
comfort vs with the remembrance of our vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

                     <p>And if otherwise the conscience accuse vs for those euill

for there is nothing in heauen and earth which shall not

                        <hi>It is God that Iustifies.</hi> Of this ye may see cleerely, that
Iustification as the Apostle vseth it here, is a iudicial terme,
for he oppones it to accusation and condemnation: but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that because wee marked it before, in the poynt of
Iustification, we will adde this more: that the Apostle brings
not the reason of his comfort from his owne innocencie,
but from Gods mercy;<note place="margin">The argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of our comfort are not brought from our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency but gods mercy.</note> he saith not, there is nothing in me

is, that whateuer it be, God hath pardoned it. This is it that

more clearely manifested: for hee was declared mightily
to be the sonne of God by his resurrection,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> and hath made

is horrible to speake) they paint him in the shape of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
body hauing three heads; but albeit it were true, which
they say, yet doth it not excuse them: for the Lords extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
facts are not to bee vsed as warrants to breake his

any more excuse them, than that deed of the Lord, whereby
he caused the Israelits to take from the Egiptians their siluer,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:9473:174"/>
gold, and Iewels which they neuer rendred, can excuse them
that doe borrow, steale, and robbe from others but neuer

                     <p>But howeuer they excuse themselues, as long as the word
of the Apostle stands true, they shall not rubbe off them
the blot of idolatry:<note place="margin">They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by the Apostle of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</note> they turne the glory of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible

Maiestie of God is eternall, the heauens waxe olde, but he

ashamed of the light that shines in this place of Scripture,
and passe by it without an answer, they excuse the making
of the Image of Christ, and of his Saints, but speak not one
word to defend that grosse Idolatry, whereby they turne
the glory of the inuisible God into the image of a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     <p>This speach therefore to sit at the right hand of God

whereunto Christ Iesus as man is exalted,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 2. 19.</note> being crowned

                     <p>This right hand of God wherat Christ sits is expounded

The right hand of God, that is, the power and glory of
God stretches throughout the whole world, but wee are
plainly taught that the place of the residence of Christ Iesus
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:9473:174"/>
the man is in the heauenly places, and not in earthly places,
in the high places to which hee is ascended, and not in the

in stones vpon his breast the names of the twelue tribes of

of all his elect, that by the merit of his death hee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

                     <p>Here againe wee are taught that Iesus Christ is descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to vs in holy Scripture as our mediatour of intercession,<note place="margin">No Mediator of intercession but Iesus Christ.</note>
and that there is no other beside him recommended vnto vs.
In all the old testament no prayer is made to <hi>Henoch, Moses,</hi>
nor <hi>Eliah,</hi> who ended their dayes not after the common
course of men: no prayer to <hi>Abraham,</hi> albeit he was the
Father of the faithfull: yea no prayer to Cherubin nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphin;
though now the Apostate Church of Rome haue
made as many aduocates for vs in heauen, as there are Saints
departed, and hath framed perticular prayers vnto them,
and which is more ridiculous, hath parted among them the
patrocinie of sundry sorts of sicknesse and diseases.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed that the Saints which are departed haue
not as yet all their desires fulfilled,<note place="margin">Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted haue their owne desires which they craue to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, but knowes not our necessities.</note> and shall not be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
without vs: wherefore also it is that they long for the
full gathering together of the Saints, and for the restitution
of their bodyes, and for the last day of iudgement: but that
they know the perticular troubles of Gods children, our
greatest troubles being inward tentations and wrestlings of
conscience, neither knowne to man nor Angell but onely to
God, who is the searcher of the heart: or that we can in faith
vse them as mediators vnto God for vs, wee iustly deny it.
Where if they take them vnto their common refuge, that
ther is but one mediator of redemption, but many mediators
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:9473:175"/>
of intercession: to this wee answere that in the same place
wherin the Apostle saith <hi>there is one mediator betweene God
and man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> the subiect whereof hee entreats is Prayer; so that
euen in prayer he will haue vs to acknowledge no mediator
of intercession but Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>And beside this <hi>Augustine</hi> doth so define a mediator of
intercession, that it can be competent to none but to Iesus
Christ.<note place="margin">A Mediator of intercession as he is defined by Augustine is competent to none but christ. <hi>Aug. con. epis Par. l. 2. c.</hi> 8.</note> It is commanded sayth he that euery Christian pray

                           </expan> mediator est,</hi> but he who requests
for all, and for whom none requests is the onely one true
Mediator.</p>
                     <p>And where againe they alledge that the Saints of God in
heauen are not ignorant of things done vpon earth,<note place="margin">Three manner of wayes are things knowne 1 by sense: 2 by report of creatures: 3 by reuelation from God.</note> we are to
know that things are knowne three manner of wayes: first
by hearing and seeing: Secondly, by reflex, as by looking
in a glasse those things are made knowne to vs which are
behind our backes: and thirdly by report. This second and
third way say they, there is no doubt but Saints that are in
heauen know those things which are done vpon earth, but
both of these are false, for if they say they know our estate
by report of Angels, or such as are departed this life, how
can that be? seeing wee know that when <hi>Hanna</hi> prayed in

                        <note place="margin">None of these waies do saints departed know our miseries.</note> yet hee knew not her trouble, yea those

make them to know it when they are dead?</p>
                     <p>If againe they say that they haue it by reuelation from
God, then I pray you consider how that one errour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie
dashes against an other, for sometime in the same

communicate our petitions to those who must be our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators

I say fully and finally because of those inward tentations
wherewith Gods children are so exercised, that the sense of
that loue in them is greatly diminished: but in all those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

of the Children of God, that hovveuer their outvvard estate

they are Godly in prosperitie, but more Godly in aduersitie,
the more they are troubled the neerer they draw vnto the

so the loue of God waxeth stronger in the hearts of Gods

sometime againe he giues in dew season the first and

                     <p>But we are to know that famine,<note place="margin">The lord who changed the Serpent into a flourishing rod hath changed cursed famine into a blessed crosse to his children.</note> which in the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the nature of all those euils which sinne hath brought vpon
vs, now they worke for our good, and are become like
Waspes wanting stings, profitable to waken vs and exercise
our faith, but not able to seperate vs from the loue of God.
Among those famine is a great tentation, Nature being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of the want of necessaries; and therefore Sathan who
picks out the time and place of tentations as may be most
for his vantage, tempted our blessed Sauiour when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to waxe hungry.<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> It is a rare grace in want to praise the

riches,<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 8.</note> least the one make him full, and cause him deny God,
and the other should cause him to steale, and take the name
of God in vaine: yet no extremitie of this tentation can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
them from the loue of God, for either in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
necessities the Lord meruailously prouides for them, or
then strengthens them with patience and inward comfort to

                     <p>For sometime the earth hath beene as iron,<note place="margin">How the Lord prouides in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for his children.</note> but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens

fruit, but the heauens rayned downe Manna and Quailes:
and sometime the heauens haue beene as brasse, yet in the
earth hath the Lord prouided nourishment, as he did by the
Rauens and the Widdow of Sarepta for <hi>Eliah:</hi> and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it please the Lord by famine to inflict death vpon his
children, then he strengthens their spirits with the bread of
life, and comforts their hearts with hid <hi>Manna,</hi> so that they

can seperate vs from Christ; a comfort excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great indeed: for seeing we know that the Lords loue
towards vs in vnchangeable, hauing his fauour which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

mone for? Now because hee hath made an enumeration of
sundry sorts of crosses, hee proues here by a testimonie of
scripture, that it is the lot of Gods children to be subiect vnto
them; for seeing they are not exempted from the greatest
which is to be slaine by the sword, why shall wee promise
to our selues any immunitie from the smallest.</p>
                     <p>The testimonie is taken out of the 44. Psalme,<note place="margin">Worshippers of God howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer disioyned in time or place yet are of one communion.</note> wherein

yet they were counted as sheepe for the slaughter:<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 22.</note> and this
testimonie the Apostle applyes to the estate of the Church
in his time, wherein the Apostle wil teach vs that howsoeuer
the true worshippers of God liue in sundry times and ages,

therefore the Apostle vseth that which is spoken of the
afflicted Church of the Iewes, as competent to afflicted

to confirme their doctrine by testimonies of the Prophets.
This harmonie among the writers of holy Scripture is no
small confirmation of our Faith, that they who neuer saw
one another in the face, yet all together agrees to breath out
one truth.<note place="margin">Ezech. 1. 11</note> As the Cherubines stretch their wings one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

them.<note place="margin">Euery Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astique teacher is bound to confirme his doctrine by Scripture.</note> And their fact stands for a rule to teach vs that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

after the example of their Maister confirmed their doctrine

                        <note place="margin">Three things obseruedin this testimonie.</note> In the testimonie wee haue three things:
first, the greatnesse of the affliction of a Christian, when
hee saith, <hi>we are slaine,</hi> subiect not onely to smaller crosses

<hi>All the day long,</hi> that is, not in one age, but in all
ages of the world hath it beene our lot: thirdly, the cause of
their suffering, <hi>for thy sake.</hi>

                     <p>It is necessary for our comfort that wee marke the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,<note place="margin">The causes for which God sends affliction should bee marked.</note>
and from whence affliction proceedes to the Godly,
for the ignorance thereof makes many to erre with the
friends of <hi>Iob,</hi> and iudge wrong of the godly, as if they were
stricken alway for their sinnes, when indeed they are not:
wee are therefore to know that sometime affliction comes
to the Godly for sinne past; sometime for sinne to come;
sometime neyther for sinne past, nor sinne to come, but that
the workes of God may be made manifest.</p>
                     <p>The first way afflictions to them whom the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

will he hedge in with thrones the wayes of those whom he
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:9473:182"/>
purposeth to saue, and will waken them by some sharp rod
or other, when he feeth them sleeping in securitie; so taught

hee <hi>Ionas</hi> out of his sleepe by casting him into the sea;
he cured <hi>Zachary</hi> of infidelitie by striking him with dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
hee diuerted <hi>Paul</hi> from his euill course by blindnes:
blessed is the man whom the Lord this way correcteth.</p>
                     <p>Sometime againe the Lord sends affliction,<note place="margin">Afflictions laid on to preuent sin to come are wholesome preseruatiues.</note> as preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
to his children to keepe them from sinne, whereunto
hee seeth of their weaknesse they are ready to fall, if they

                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> not for any sinne he had done, but for a sinne
that he might doe, least he should haue beene exalted out
of measure.</p>
                     <p>And sometime the Lord layeth on affliction,<note place="margin">But euery affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not laid on the godly for sinne</note> neyther to
correct sinnes past, nor to preuent sinnes to come, but that
the workes of God may be made manifest, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

him that was borne blind, whether it was for his owne
sinnes, or the sinnes of his Parents: aunswered it was for
neyther of them,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9. 3.</note> but <hi>that the workes of God might be made
manifest in him.</hi> And these workes of God manifested by
affliction are of two sorts; for not onely his meruailous
power and constant truth in preseruing and deliuering his
owne Church in all troubles against the power, falshoode,
and malice of the world, are manifested that all men may
see, it is not by the arme of man, but by the power of God
that his Church is continued vpon earth: but likewise these
manifold graces of God, wrought secretly by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the hearts of his children, are made manifest to the
world, such as their constant faith; their inuincible loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God; their patience in the hardest sort of crosses. And
vnto these kindes of afflictions doe wee referre that which
here is spoken.</p>
                     <p>These afflictions which are for Gods sake, require these
two things, comprised by the Apostle in these words, <hi>Faith
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:9473:183"/>
and a good Conscience,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19</note> that is a good Religion and a good

                        <note place="margin">It is common to al Christians to suffer with Christ, not so to suffer for him.</note> It is common to all the Godly to suffer with
Christ as yee heard before: but to suffer for Christ is not a
honour communicated to them all; the rarer that it is, the

The Apostle reioyced in the bonds wherewith hee was

which are worne for Christs cause. The Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
honoured all the Fathers of the Counsell of Nice,
but made most of those who had suffered for the cause of
Christ; as in perticular, hee kissed the hole of <hi>Paphnutius</hi>
eye, which had beene put out in time of trouble for Christs
sake, yet did hee reuerence it as the most honourable and
precious part of his body: no face so beautifull as that which
is deformed; no man so rich as hee who hath sustained spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
of his goods,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note> if it be for Christs sake, neyther is any
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:9473:183"/>
death so glorious, as that which is sustained for his cause:

                     <p>But now because no Christian is persecuted without some

in euery trouble his owne conscience saith that hee hath

put a difference betweene the pretended and the true cause
for which the wicked doe persecute vs. If <hi>Haman</hi> beare

man in this life may be perswaded of his saluation, neyther
is it to be accounted presumption, for as much as in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hee leanes not vpon himselfe, but vpon the word and
promise of God, which the Lord hath confirmed by an
oath, that hee may make sure to the heyres of promise the
stabilitie of his counsell. Where if the aduersary obiect, that
the word of the Lord out of all doubt is true, and that they
who beleeues and repents shall be saued, but euery one who
saith hee beleeues doth not beleeue, and so cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of his saluation? To this I answere, that hee who
repents vnfainedly and beleeues, knowes as certainely that
hee hath repentance and faith, as hee who hath in his hand
a iewell knowes that he hath i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with himselfe that the promises of saluation made to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent

be many in the Church like vnto those fiue foolish Virgins,
who suppose they haue that which they shall not be found

                     <p>Out of all doubt where the Lord Iesus dwelleth by his

                     <p>Againe we mark here how that our estate in Christ is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the estate of <hi>Adam</hi> by his first creation; for then an

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:9473:189"/>
but now no Angell is able to seperate vs from the loue of
God; the reason is, the couenant which God made with
<hi>Adam</hi> was without a mediatour; hee had the keeping of his
owne saluation in his owne hand: but the couenant of grace
with vs is bound vp in the mediator Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. 12.</note> to whom
the Father hath committed vs, that hee might redeeme and
saue vs; hee hath taken vs into his hand and none are able to
take vs from him; our saluation depends not on our selues,
it is not in our keeping but in his, and therefore is it most
certaine.</p>

chaines which are vpon him, are an euill conscience, and
the wrath of God: for as he growes in euill doing so grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his conscience worse and worse, and the wrath of God
