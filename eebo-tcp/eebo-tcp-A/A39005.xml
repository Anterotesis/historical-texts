            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>DIana</hi> and her Darlings dear, went walking on a day,</l>
            <l>Throughout the Woods and Waters clear, for their disports and play;</l>
            <l>The leaves aloft were very green and pleasant to behold;</l>
            <l>These Nymps they wa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the trees between, under the shadows cold,</l>
            <l>So long, at last they found a place of Springs and Waters clear,</l>
            <l>A fairer Bath there never was found out this thousand year:</l>
            <l>Wherein <hi>Diana,</hi> daintily, herself began to bathe,</l>
            <l>And all her Uirgins fair and pure, themselves did wash and lave:</l>
            <l>And as the Nymps in water stood, <hi>Acteon</hi> passed by,</l>
            <l>As he came running through the Wood, on them he cast his Eye,</l>
            <l>And eke beheld their Bodies bare, then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>resently that tide.</l>
            <l>And as the Nymps of him were ware, with voice aloud they cry'd,</l>
            <l>And clos'd <hi>Diana</hi> round about, to hide her Body small;</l>
            <l>But she was highest in the Rout, and seen above them all.</l>
            <l>And when <hi>Diana</hi> did perceive where <hi>Acteon</hi> did stand,</l>
            <l>A furious look to him she gave, and took her Bow in hand:</l>
            <l>And as she was about to shoot, <hi>Acteon</hi> began to run,</l>
            <l>To hide he thought it was no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot, his former sight was done.</l>
            <l>And as he thought from her to 'scape, she brought it so to pass,</l>
            <l>Incontinently chang'd his shape, even running as he was;</l>
            <l>Each Goddess took <hi>Diana'</hi>s part, <hi>Acteon</hi> to Transform,</l>
            <l>To make of him a huge wild Hart, there they did all determ:</l>
            <l>His skin that was so fine and fair, was made a tawny red,</l>
            <l>His body over grown with hair, from feet unto the head;</l>
            <l>And on his head great horns were set, most wonderous to behold,</l>
            <l>A huger Hart was never <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et nor seen upon the Mold;</l>
            <l>His ears and eyes that were so fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, transformed were full strange,</l>
            <l>His hands and feet comprised were throughout the Woods to range.</l>
            <l>Thus was he made a perfect Hart, and waxed fierce and grim;</l>
            <l>His former Shape did quite depart from every joynt and limb;</l>
            <l>But still his Memory did remain, although he might not speak,</l>
            <l>Nor yet among his Friends complain, his woful mind to break;</l>
            <l>At length he thought for to repair home to his Dwelling-place,</l>
            <l>Anon of him his Hounds were ware, and gan to cry apace:</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Acteon</hi> was sore agast, his Hounds would him devour,</l>
            <l>And from them then he fled full fast, with all his might and power.</l>
            <l>He spared neither bush nor b<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake, but ran through thick and thin,</l>
            <l>With all the swiftness he could make, in hope to save his skin;</l>
            <l>Yet were his Hounds so near his tail, and follow'd him so fast,</l>
            <l>That running might not him avail, for all his speed and haste:</l>
            <l>For why, his Hounds would never li<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> till they him overtook,</l>
            <l>And then they rent and tore his skin: and all his body shook:</l>
            <l>I am your Master <hi>Acteon,</hi> then cry'd he to his Hounds,</l>
            <l>And made unto them rueful moans, with sad lamenting sounds;</l>
            <l>I have been he which gave you food, wherein I took delight;</l>
            <l>Therefore suck not your Master's blood, his Friendship to requite.</l>
            <l>But those Curs of a cursed Kind, on him had no remorse,</l>
            <l>Although he was their dearest Friend, they pull'd him down by force,</l>
            <l>There was no Man to take his part, the Story telleth plain;</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Acteon</hi> a huge wild Hart, among the Does were slain.</l>
            <l>You Hunters all, that range the Woods, although you rise up rath,</l>
            <l>Beware you come not nigh the Flood, were Uirgins use to bathe:</l>
            <l>For if <hi>Diana</hi> you espy, among her Darlings dear,</l>
            <l>Your former Shape she will disguise, and make you horns to wear.</l>
            <l>And so I do conclude my Song, having nothing to alledge;</l>
            <l>If <hi>Acteon</hi> had Right or Wrong, let all true Uirgins judge.</l>
