            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in reverencing his Power and Majeſty as I ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I have ſometimes doubted of him, misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Promiſes, and not truſting to his Help. I have made Fleſh my arm, and put my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the pleaſing Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and uncertain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities of the World. I have otherwhile been full of roving and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imaginations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and full of wandring thoughts in his Service.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I have often fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſet up to my
<pb facs="tcp:32982:34"/>
ſelf divers Imaginations and Forms of God's Worſhip and Religion, which he hath not ſet and eſtabliſhed in his Church.</p>
                  <p>I have been negligent in giving him his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip and Honour, not falling down before him with that inward reverence of Spirit and Truth, nor with that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Order and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Body which is requiſite always to be ſhewed forth and done before Him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I have often drawn
<pb facs="tcp:32982:34"/>
near unto him with my lips, when my heart hath been far from him. I have too frequently, vainly, &amp; inconſiderately uſed his great and fearful Name and in the eagerneſs of my Spirit I have not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from abuſing it with raſh Oaths and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations. My Vows and Promiſes that I have made in his Name, I have not performed: Thoſe holy things whereon his ſacred Name is ſet &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed; I have not duly regarded; and through my preſumptuous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:32982:35"/>
I have been an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make his Name be evil ſpoken of, and prophaned by others.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. I have often ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my ſelf from the publick Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies &amp; Sanctuary; vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſpending the days that are hallowed to the honor of his great Name.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. I have not carried that reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, nor given that due obedience which I ought to them whom God hath placed over me, ſeeking rather my own will and
<pb facs="tcp:32982:35"/>
pleaſure, than ſubmitting my ſelf to their lawful precepts, and advice. I have too much unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Perſons of my Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and been unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd well of me.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. I have not done to all others, as I would that they ſhould do to me; I have envied their welfare, the better and more proſperous Life of others above my own. I have often let the reins of my Paſſion looſe to anger, malice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; uncharitably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
<pb facs="tcp:32982:36"/>
in the miſchief and deſtruction of my own private or peculiar Enemies. When out of my abundance I might have relieved others that were in want, I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times neglected it.</p>

I have not careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſchewed the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and enticements to corrupt and vain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: I have not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <p n="9">IX. I have liſtened to Flattery, and uſed it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others: of many I have had evil ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and given raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. Upon my ſelf I have ſet a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value than I deſerved, and ſeemed better than I was, that I might gain a
<pb facs="tcp:32982:37"/>
falſe reputation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And I have often ſuffered truth to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. I am guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inordinate deſires and irregular affections.</p>
                  <p>And wo is me that in all theſe things I have offended: For if in all theſe things my Heart ſhould not condemn me, God is greater than my Heart, and knoweth all things.

Grace thereunto aſſiſting me; and not only to leave them, but to judge my ſelf for them: with all religious lowlineſs and alacrity, ſubmitting my ſelf freely to the pious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and advice that ſhall be given me by my Spiritual Governors and Miniſters of God, for ſhewing forth the fruits of my ſorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, meet for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life.

of that his Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we all receive by it. I believe that I ſhall here partake of the ſpiritual Food and moſt precious Body and Bloud of Chriſt, the Bread of Life that came down from Heaven, the Bloud that hath been carried up into the holy places, and the Cup of Eternity. For they that eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup, ſhall live for ever.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:32982:60"/>
Lord, look down from Heaven, the habitation of thy Holineſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Ruines of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to ſee her in the duſt. Behold her, O Lord, not only broken, but crumbled, divided into ſo many Sects and Fractions, that ſhe no longer repreſents the Ark of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the Covenant and the Manna were conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> filled with all various ſorts of unclean Beaſts: and to compleat our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb facs="tcp:32982:60"/>
and guilt, the Spirit of Diviſion hath inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelf as well into our Affections as our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that Badge of Diſcipleſhip which thou recommendedſt to us, is caſt off, and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wrath and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, anger and clamour, called in to maintain and widen our breaches. O Lord, how long ſhall we thus violate and defame that Goſpel of Peace that we profeſs? how long ſhall me thus madly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat our ſelves, loſe that Chriſtianity which we

And now that in Civil Affairs there ſeems ſome aptneſs to a compoſure, O let not our Spiritual Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be more unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable. Lord, let not the rougheſt winds blow out of the Sanctuary, let not thoſe which ſhould be Embaſſadors for Peace, ſtill ſound a Trumpet for

War: but do thou reveal thy ſelf to all our <hi>Eliah</hi>'s in that ſtill ſmall Voice, which may teach them to echo thee in the like meek treating with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

To this end, do thou, O Lord, mollifie all

exaſperate minds, take off all animoſities and prejudices, contempt and heart-burnings, and by uniting their hearts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the reconciling their Opinions: And that nothing may intercept the clear ſight of thy truth, Lord, let all private and ſecular Deſigns be totally depoſited, that gain may no longer be the meaſure of our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but that the one great and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of truth and peace may be unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and vigorouſly

purſued. Lord, the hearts of all men are in thy hands, O be thou pleaſed to let thy Spirit of Peace overſhadow the minds of all contending Parties; and if it be thy will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore this Church to her priſtine ſtate, renew her daies as of old; let her eſcape out of <hi>Egypt</hi> be ſo entire, that not an hoof may be left behind: but if thy Wiſdom ſee it not yet a ſeaſon for ſo full a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, Lord, defer not we beſeech thee, ſuch a degree of it, as may at leaſt ſecure her a being;

not till the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our ſins enforce thee, and then correcteſt in meaſure, we thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Creatures hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyacknowledge that we have abundantly taſted of this patience and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thine. To what an enormous height were our ſins arrived, ere thou beganſt to viſit them! &amp; when thou couldeſt no longer forbear, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering thy Power, thou haſt not proportion'd thy vengeance to our crimes, but to thy own gracious deſign of reducing and
<pb facs="tcp:32982:66"/>
reclaiming us. Lord had the firſt ſtroke of thy hand been extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, our guilts had juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the method; but thou haſt proceeded by ſuch eaſie and gentle degrees, as witneſs how much thou deſired'ſt to be interrupted, and ſhew us, that all that ſad weight we have long groaned under, hath been accumulated only by our ownincorrigibleneſs. Tis now, O Lord, theſe many years that this Nation hath been in the furnace, and yet our
<pb facs="tcp:32982:66"/>
droſs waſtes not, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes; and it is owing only to thy unſpeakable mercy, that we, who would not be purified, are not conſumed; that we remain a Nation, who ceaſe not to be a moſt ſinful and provoking Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Lord, let not this long-ſuffering of thine ſerve only to upbraid our obſtinacy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance our guilt; but let it at laſt have the proper effect on us, melt our hearts, and lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And O that this may be the day for
<pb facs="tcp:32982:67"/>
us thus to diſcern the things that belong to our Peace! that all who are (yea, and all who are not) caſt down this day in an external humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may by the operation of thymighty Spirit have their ſouls laid proſtrate before thee in a ſincere contrition! O thou who canſt out of the very ſtones raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> work our ſtony flinty hearts into ſuch a temper as may be malleable to the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thy grace, that all the ſinners in <hi>Sion</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:32982:67"/>
tremble; that we may not by a perſevering obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſeal to our ſelves both temporal and eternal ruine, but in ſtead of our mutinous complainingat the puniſhments of our ſins, ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. O be thou pleaſed to grant us this one grand fundamental mercy, that we who ſo impatiently thirſt after a change without us, may render that poſſible and ſafe by this better and more neceſſary change within us; that our ſins
<pb facs="tcp:32982:68"/>
may not, as they have ſo often done, interpoſe and eclipſe that light which now begins to break out upon us. Lord, thy Dove ſeems to approach us with an Olive Branch in her mouth; Oh let not our filth and noiſomneſs chaſe her away; but grant us that true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which may attone thee, and that Chriſtian Charity which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Lord, let not our breach either with thee, or among our ſelves, be incurable, but by making
<pb facs="tcp:32982:68"/>
up the firſt, prepare us for the healing of the latter. And becauſe, O Lord the way to make us one Fold is to have one Shepherd, be pleaſed to put us all under the conduct of him to whom that charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; bow the hearts of this People as of one Man, that the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention may be, who ſhall be moſt forward in bringing back our <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> O let none reflect on their paſt Guilts, as an Argument to perſevere, but repent, and to make their return ſo ſincere as
<pb facs="tcp:32982:69"/>
may qualifie them, not only for his but thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And, Lord, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo to guide the hearts of all who ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with that great Concernment of ſetling this Nation, that they may weigh all their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations in the Balance of the Sanctuary, that Conſcience, not Intereſt, may be the ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and that they may render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, and to God the things that are God's; that they may become healers of
<pb facs="tcp:32982:69"/>
our breaches, and happy Repairers of the ſad Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines both in Church and State: And grant, O Lord, that as thoſe ſins which made them are become National, ſo the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be National alſo, and that evidenc'd by the proper fruits of it, by zeal of reſtoring the rights both of thee and thine Anointed. And do thou, O Lord, ſo diſpoſe all hearts, and remove all obſtacles, that none may have the will much leſs the power, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his peaceable reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<pb facs="tcp:32982:70"/>
And, Lord, let him bring with him an heart ſo intirely devoted to thee, that he may wiſh his own Honour only as a means to advance thine. O let the Precepts and Example of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father never depart from his mind; and as thou wert pleas'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the one by ſuffering, ſo perfect the other by acting thy will; that He may be a bleſſed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of replanting the power in ſtead of the form of Godlineſs among us, of reſtoring Chriſtian

vertue in a profane and almoſt barbarous Nation. And if any wiſh him for any diſtant ends, if any deſire his ſhadow as a ſhelter for their riots and licentiouſneſs, O let him come a great, but happy defeat to all ſuch, not bring fewel, but cure to their inordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; and by his example as a Chriſtian, &amp; his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as a King, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to good, and reſtrain from evil, that he may not only releaſe our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but our ſpiritual bondage, ſuppreſs thoſe
