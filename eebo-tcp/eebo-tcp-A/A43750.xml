            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Chriſtian Counſel and Advice unto the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>LEt a Chriſtian ſpirit of moderation appear among you all, Oh ye Rulers and People of <hi>England</hi>; for not in our own name, but in the Name and Spirit of the Lord God Everlaſting is my appearance unto you all at this time, that you may come certainly to be informed, and come to know and underſtand what the Lord our God hath done, and what he is a doing in this the day of his bleſſed appearance and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, even with the tender of Eternal Salvation unto all the ſons of men in <hi>General.</hi> Be ye therefore <hi>moderate,</hi> Oh ye wiſe men and flouriſhing in knowledge, that the <hi>nobility</hi> of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings may come to be opened, and ye come in the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſee, and to behold this moſt <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent myſtery</hi> of Eternal ſalvation unto all your immortal ſouls, and alſo the <hi>bleſſedneſs, peace,</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> of you all (as men) throughout all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this world.</p>
            <p>And now in this the Lord hath opened my heart, and <hi>I</hi> ſhal make mention of his Name in righteouſneſs, ſhewing unto all people of the large and <hi>Univerſal</hi> love of God unto all the ſons of men in general; That as all have followed the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin and Tranſgreſſion againſt God their <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſo are become degenerated into a ſtrange ſpirit, and a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt God; even ſo in like manner, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Son of God, the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the Lord from heaven, who is a <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening ſpirit,</hi> he is appeared, and is appearing to lead all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers back again out of the ſin, out of the tranſgreſſion, and out of the ſtate of degeneration, and to give unto every one a right ſpirit, and make them partakers of his heavenly <hi>divine</hi> nature; And this is he whom the Father hath freely tendered unto all the ſons of men, and hath ſent him a light into the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96921:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world, that whoſever believs in his Name, and follows him (who is the Light, and the Truth, and the Way to the Father) ſhall not abide in darkneſs, and captive under ſin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and in the ſtate of degeneration; but all that through faith and obedience comes to follow him who is the true Light and Power that proceeds from the Father, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all the <hi>Author of eternal ſalvation,</hi> and that through faith and obedience unto his ſpiritual <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> which is to be known in every one; and thus he is become the <hi>Captain</hi> of our ſalvation, our Leader and Commander, and by his ſpiritual rule and government in all them that believe, he eads them out of ſin and tranſgreſſion, and out of the ſtate of degeneration, and ſo from under the wrath and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and brings into favor with God again.</p>
            <p>Now then, unto his name and power and ſpirituall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt every ſoul be ſubject, and this is that which the Lord God Everlaſting requires of every one, to be made Conformable in faithful obedience unto the Rule and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's ſpirit, and light and life manifeſted in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in every man; for behold this is the day wherein he is, and is to be <hi>proclaimed Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi> and under his Rule and goverment ſpiritually muſt all the <hi>Kings and Princes,</hi> and great <hi>Potentates</hi> of the earth be made ſubject, and his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſhall be over all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this world, and he is come and coming to <hi>Rule</hi> and to <hi>Reign</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in truth and in Righteouſneſs, and he Rules according to the good will and pleaſure of the father in all things, even in all who are faithful and obedient to the Rule and goverment of his righteous <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; ſo that by him <hi>Kings</hi> muſt Reign, and <hi>Princes</hi> decree Juſtice, and he is to be head &amp; to have the preheminence in all things, and this is his priveledge, &amp; perogative given unto him of the father, and he wil not give it unto another; wherefore it was ſaid in a certain place—<hi>Bring thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould Reign over them, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (certainly) this is the day of God's Controverſie with his Enemies, and the ſeed of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>who is called the Divel,</hi> is to be caſt out; for in the night of darkneſs and day of Apoſtaſie he has been exalted, and has
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96921:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ruled in the hearts of all the children of diſobedience, in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and ſin againſt God; and this is he who hath been the author of all <hi>Miſchiefs,</hi> wickedneſs, and abominations both in publique and in private, that hath been, and that is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Sons of men; for his Rule and goverment in the hearts of the children in diſobedience, has been continually in the <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt God, and againſt all the real appearances of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and this is he who hath led all the Sons of men into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from God, and hath exalted himſelf in the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and ſhewing himſelf as if he were God, by his rule and <hi>Authority</hi> in the hearts of all the children of diſobedience, who have been and are diſobedient to Chriſt the true light and power of God, who is the captain of eternal ſalvation unto all that obey &amp; follow him in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And this is he who hath appeared to ſet up his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in theſe latter daies in the hearts of the children of men, that from his <hi>Throne</hi> Righteouſneſs, and truth, and equity may flouriſh and be advanced throughout all <hi>Nations,</hi> and in all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of men upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Now it is moſt certain, clear, and evident, how that the power &amp; <hi>Kingdom</hi> of darkneſs and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath been <hi>Advanced</hi> among all the Sons of men, and that the hearts of all the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience have been ſubjected to the power of darkneſs, the <hi>Prince</hi> of the power of the <hi>Air</hi>; this needs no further proof then the ſad and grievous abominations which have been, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this part of the world called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which are the evident ſignes and tokens, that the power of darkneſs (who is the <hi>Devil) Rules</hi> in the hearts of all the children in diſobedience, whoſe ſouls are not ſubject to the Light and power of God; and ſo it is he that hath been the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> cauſe of all Tranſgreſſion and abominations, and blindneſs of heart that is among the Sons of men, through ſubjecting the mind unto his power, who hath wholy corrupted man's ways before the Lord; and in this ſtate man is holy diſ-inabled to do any thing for his maker, untill his mind and his heart comes again to be turned from the darkneſs, and from the power of it unto the true light and power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is onely and alone (through faith and obedience to his name and power) ſufficient
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96921:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for to <hi>Ranſom</hi> men from the <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Servitude</hi> of the <hi>Devill, the power of darkneſs</hi>; and to give and to inable men with <hi>ability, power,</hi> and <hi>ſufficiency</hi> to ſerve to worſhip the Lord God Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably.</p>
            <p>So now for this end is <hi>Repentance</hi> preached unto all the Sons of men, that their hearts may be turned and <hi>converted</hi> from the darkneſs, and from the power of it, unto the light and power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt manifeſted in them, thereby to be led and ordered in their duty, and obedience, and worſhip towards the Lord, and in love and unity and fellowſhip one towards another. And behold this is he that comes to work a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and among the Sons of men, through converting their hearts from the darkneſs and power of it, unto the power of God in the light, whereby men's hearts which have been clouded with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance, comes to be opened, and to be brought to an underſtanding in the light of the knowledge of God, and to be gathered into favor and communion with God, through the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and operation of the ſanctifying ſpirit and life in Chriſt Jeſus, who is the power of God unto ſalvation, unto all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>And thus, and after this manner will the Lord <hi>Repleniſh Nations</hi>; even by the word of his power manifeſted in them, thereby to be <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> in <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> unto God again, into his <hi>Image</hi> in truth and righteouſneſs and true holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none ſhal ſee the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now then, this is <hi>Chriſtian counſel</hi> and <hi>advice,</hi> and <hi>ſound doctrine</hi> unto the <hi>Rulers</hi> and people of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> and that which ſhal be anſwered by Gods Witneſs in all conſciences, whether men wil hear or forbear; all are called to <hi>Repent</hi> of their <hi>diſobedience</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God in the meaſure of his ſpirit &amp; power manifeſted in them which is the great and <hi>Univerſal ſin</hi> and <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> which men are <hi>Guilty of,</hi> from the <hi>higheſt,</hi> to the <hi>loweſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rich,</hi> and <hi>poor, bond,</hi> and <hi>free, profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> are found Guilty of this ſin of diſobedience againſt the light and power of God made manifeſt in them Oh! how have men (in the <hi>darkneſs of Ignorance) ſleighted, contemned,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemed</hi> the worthy name of the Lord by which we are called; and ſo far have men been erred from the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Goverment of the true Light, and power of God, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96921:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it hath been even a deriſion in their hearts, and their tongues have uttered <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt God, and them that Dwell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Wel, But ſurely it ſhall not always be thus, for the Lord our God is daily making himſelf manifeſt in his <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> among all them that believe; and ſo at the brightneſs of his appearance ſhall the wicked be <hi>aſhamed</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi> and break their <hi>Idols</hi> to peeces, and many ſhall come trembling with broken hearts before the Lord, becauſe of their diſobedience to the true Light and Power of God manifeſted in them. And this is the humility that goes before the honour, even the humility of mans heart and ſoul unto the power of God in the Light; and this is that which ſhall be the glory of all <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> &amp; the beauty of all <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> &amp; the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Univerſal peace,</hi> and men ſhall be abundantly bleſſed of God, and they ſhall be a bleſſing one unto another in the new and Everlaſting Covenant of God, from <hi>generation</hi> to <hi>generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh ye <hi>Rulers</hi> and people of <hi>England,</hi> that ye had an ear to hear, and heart to underſtand the <hi>Bleſſed viſitation</hi> of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal love, and bowels of infinite mercy towards you all; For behold, God hath ſent <hi>ſalvation</hi> unto you, and among you; &amp; now every one that turns from his iniquity unto the Lord, ſuch, even ſuch are received into favour with God, and <hi>their former ſins and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions comes to be blottted out, and to be remembred no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the free love and infinite mercy of the Lord our God, unto all the ſons of men without <hi>exception,</hi> that all through faith and obedience unto God in Chriſt, the Light and the Truth, might receive Remiſſion of ſins, and a portion and inheritance among the ſaints in Light; and herein the Lord God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth, who formed man for a purpoſe of his own Glory, thus he comes to be glorified in the work of his own Eternal power, and man comes here to be bleſſed with the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Eternal life, both in this World, and in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>And this was even the <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> of God in the firſt <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> who hath given unto man (above all other Creatures which the Lord hath made) a meaſure of his <hi>Divine</hi> Light and Spirit, for to order man aright in all holy obedience unto his Maker;

But this, even this Spirit of Light and Life from God, the ſons of men has even loſt, and ſo has forgotten the Lord, <hi>days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number</hi>; and this Spirit of God is grieved and daily oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>as a cart is preſſed with ſheavs</hi>; and now this is man's dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, erring from the Light and Spirit of his Maker, and ſo is become dead unto God in all his ways and courſes: and here man having loſt his guide, runs on in the darkneſs of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance into ſin and trangreſſion againſt his Maker, and ſo poſts on unto eternal <hi>perdition,</hi> and periſhes worſe then the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> without an underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And now, though ſin hath thus <hi>abounded,</hi> yet behold the love of God in Chriſt doth much more <hi>abound,</hi> who has given him for a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and a <hi>Light</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and him hath the Lord appointed for a <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Commander</hi> unto all the children of men, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lead them by his Eternal Light and Spirit out of the Fall, and out of the ſtate of degeneration, and to be Regenerated in truth and righteouſneſs unto God again, wherein God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and man bleſſed with the Light of God's countenance in the everlaſting Covenant of endleſs life, and bleſſings for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>And unto this ſtate of heavenly <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> is the Lord God freely inviting all the ſons of men, that they may turn from the darkneſs unto the Light, and from Satan's power unto the power of God the <hi>Creator</hi> of all, that man through <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> may come to be <hi>bleſſed,</hi> with the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Lord God of heaven and earth, for his glory and honours ſake, doth now command and require all men, as well the <hi>King</hi> on the <hi>Throne,</hi> as the loweſt of men, to bow their hearts, and ſubmit their ſouls in all holy <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> unto the <hi>guidance, rule</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of the Light and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he may rule as King in the hearts of all the children of men, in all <hi>nations</hi> and <hi>countries</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the whole <hi>Earth,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom</hi> is to reach over all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this world.</p>
            <p>And now my <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>Countrymen,</hi> both <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> &amp;c. this <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> unto the Light and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96921:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit of Chriſt, doth the God of Heaven Command &amp; Require of us all, even from the higheſt to the loweſt, upon pain and peril of Eternal Condemnation, and an utter ſeparation from God, and all the <hi>Saints</hi> in Light.</p>
            <p>And theſe things (Oh ye <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>people</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) have deeply entered into the hearts of many <hi>thouſands</hi> in this our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrie, even in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and in the <hi>Ilands</hi> &amp; <hi>dominions</hi> thereunto belonging; and God hath given us an <hi>abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and a perfeſt ſence and feeling in our hearts of that which he requires of us all; and ſo in obedience to his heavenly calling, many are they who love not their lives unto the death, that God may be glorified, and our ſouls reſt in his heavenly bleſſings from hence forth, and for evermore.</p>
            <p>And now ſince the Lord God hath thus called us to <hi>ſerve</hi> and to <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> his holy name, in faithful obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt the Light and the truth, Oh! how hath the ſeed of the <hi>Serpent</hi> raged, and raiſed war againſt the Lord, and againſt his <hi>Annointed</hi>; But the Lord our God is with us, and his Bleſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence dwells in us, and among us; ſo that in the godly Reſolution of our ſoules we are purpoſed in the name, and power, and ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to go on and follow the Lamb in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs whereſoever he goes; and thus we are the Lords, and at the diſpoſings of his bleſſed ſpirit to <hi>ſerve,</hi> and to <hi>worſhip</hi> him, in all godly <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> even all the dayes of our appointed time.</p>
            <p>And behold, this is but our <hi>Reaſonable duty</hi> ſo to do, and as the Lord our God hath engaged us through his infinite love &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, thus to walk in all holy duty and obedience unto him, even the ſame <hi>Obligation</hi> comes upon all, as they wait for an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But now this is that which grieves the ſpirit of the Lord, and is the <hi>greateſt</hi> of <hi>abominations,</hi> that when a man, or a people, doth not onely <hi>neglect</hi> their own <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> unto God, but are alſo <hi>ſmiting</hi> &amp; ready to <hi>devour</hi> the obedient children of the Lord, who fears and <hi>Reverences</hi> his holy name and power, and <hi>dare</hi> not ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p>Oh this grieves the Spirit of the Lord, and is that <hi>crying ſin</hi> and <hi>grievous Abomination</hi> which draws down wrath and vengeance
