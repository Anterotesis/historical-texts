            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of my busiest houres, I haue spared
my selfe so much time as to touch some
particulars concerning vs, to approue
our Antiquity, ancient Dignity, and
the true vse of our quality. That it
hath beene ancient, we haue deriued
it from more then two thousand yeeres agoe, successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this age. That it hath beene esteemed by the best
and greatest: to omit all the noble Patrons of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
world, I need alledge no more then the Royall
and Princely seruices, in which we now liue. That
the vse thereof is authentique, I haue done my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to instance by History, and approue by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To excuse my ignorance in affecting no florish of
Eloquence, to set a glosse vpon my Treatise, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say for my selfe but this: <hi>A good face needs
no painting, &amp; a good cause no abetting.</hi> Some ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
haue too liberally taxed vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hee (in my
thoughts) is held worthy reproofe, whose ignorance
cannot answere for it selfe: I hold it more honest for
the guiltlesse to excuse, then the enuious to exclaime.
And we may as freely (out of our plainnesse) answere,
as they (out of their peruersnesse obiect) instancing

altogether omitted; because I am loath to bee taxed in
borrowing from others: and besides, their workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extant to the world, offer themselues freely to euery
mans perusall. I am profest aduersary to none, I rather
couet reconcilement, then opposition, nor proceedes this
my labour from any enuy in me, but rather to shew them
wherein they erre. So wishing you iudiciall Audiences,

            <head>To my approued good friend
M. THOMAS HEYVVOOD.</head>
            <l>OF thee, and thy <hi>Apology</hi> for playes,</l>
            <l>I will not much speake in contempt or praise:</l>
            <l>Yet in these following lines Il'e shew my minde,</l>
            <l>Of Playes, and such as haue 'gainst Playes repin'd.</l>
            <l>A Play's a briefe <hi>Epitome</hi> of time,</l>
            <l>Where man my see his vertue or his crime</l>
            <l>Layd open, either to their vices shame,</l>
            <l>Or to their vertues memorable fame.</l>
            <l>A Play's a true transparant Christall mirror,</l>
            <l>To shew good minds their mirth, the bad their terror:</l>
            <l>Where stabbing, drabbing, dicing, drinking, swearing</l>
            <l>Are all proclaim'd vnto the sight and hearing,</l>
            <l>In vgly shapes of Heauen-abhorrid sinne,</l>
            <l>Where men may see the mire they wallow in.</l>
            <l>And well I know it makes the Diuell rage,</l>
            <l>To see his seruants flouted on a stage.</l>
            <l>A Whore, a Thiefe, a Pander, or a Bawd,</l>
            <l>A Broker, or a slaue that liues by fraud:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:6452:8"/>
An Vsurer, whose soule is in his chest,</l>
            <l>Vntill in hell it comes to restlesse rest.</l>
            <l>A Fly-blowne gull, that faine would be a Gallant,</l>
            <l>A Raggamuffin that hath spent his Tallant:</l>
            <l>A selfe-wise foole, that sees his wits out-stript,</l>
            <l>Or any vice that feeles it selfe but nipt,</l>
            <l>Either in Tragedy, or Comedy,</l>
            <l>In Morall, Pastorall, or History:</l>
            <l>But straight the poyson of their enuious tongues,</l>
            <l>Breakes out in vollyes of Calumnious wronges.</l>
            <l>And then a Tinker, or a Dray-man sweares,</l>
            <l>I would the house were fir'd about their eares.</l>
            <l>Thus when a play nips Sathan by the nose,</l>
            <l>Streight all his vassails are the Actors foes.</l>
            <l>But feare not man, let enuy swell and burst,</l>
            <l>Proceed, and bid the Diuell do his worst.</l>
            <l>For Playes are good or bad, as they are vs'd,</l>
            <l>And best inuentions often are abus'd.</l>

to the eyes of all fauorable and iudiciall readers, as well to
satisfie the requests of some of our well qualified fauorers,
as to stop the enuious acclamations of those who chalenge

were meerly shaped after that patterne, and it may be
imagined had <hi>Achilles</hi> neuer liued, <hi>Alexander</hi> had neuer
conquered the whole world. The like assertion may be
made of that euer-renowned Roman <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> Who
<pb facs="tcp:6452:12"/>
after the like representation of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Temple of

and attonement made with the neighbour Nations, hee
built a Theater, plaine, according to the time; yet large, fit
for the entertainement of so great an Assembly, and these
were they whose famous issue peopled the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which in after ages grew to such height, that not <hi>Troy,</hi>

hence (me thinkes) a very probable and important ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
may be grounded, that since they, in their diuine
wisdomes, knew all the sinnes abounding in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time, taxt and reproued all the abuses reigning in
that time, and foresaw all the actions and inconueniences
(to the Church preiudiciall) in the time to come; Since
they (I say) in all their holy doctrines, bookes, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Diuinity, were content to passe them ouer, as
things tollerated, and indifferent, why should any nice and
ouer-scrupulous heads, since they cannot ground their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse
either vpon the old or new Testament, take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to correct, controule, and carpe at that, against
which they cannot finde any text in the sacred Scriptures?</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

Epistle to the Romans, and at the same time did the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
most florish amongst the Romans; yet where can we
quote any place in his Epistles, which forbids the Church
of God, then resident in <hi>Rome,</hi> to absent themselues from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>To speake my opinion with all indifferency, God hath

Hare made to be hunted? the Stagge to be chaced; and so
of all other beasts of game in their seuerall kindes? since
God hath prouided vs of these pastimes, why may wee not
vse them to his glory? Now if you aske me why were not
the Theaters as gorgeously built in all other Cities of <hi>Italy</hi>
as <hi>Rome?</hi> And why are not Play-houses maintained as well
in other Cities of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>London?</hi> my answere is: It is
not meet euery meane Esquire should carry the part belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

the estate of a Prince. <hi>Rome</hi> was a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> a place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(personated in some licentious liuer) they should despise &amp;
shunne: which borne out as well by the wisedome of the
Poet, as supported by the worth of the Actors, wrought
such impression in the hearts of the plebe, that in short space
they excelled in ciuility and gouernement, insomuch that
from them all the neighbour Nations drew their patternes
of Humanity, as well in the establishing of their lawes, as
the reformation of their manners. These <hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosophistae,</hi>

Yea (but say some) you ought not to confound the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of either sex, as to let your boyes weare the attires of
virgins, &amp;c. To which I answere: The Scriptures are not

(for in such esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but they ought exactly to bee conferred with the
purpose they handle. To do as the Sodomites did, vse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
lusts in preposterous habits, is in that text flatly
and seuerely forbidden: nor can I imagine any man, that
hath in him any taste of relish of Christianity, to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of so abhorred a sinne. Besides, it is not probable, that
Playes were meant in that text, because we read not of any
Playes knowne in that time that <hi>Deutero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

among the Children of Israel, nor do I hold it lawfull to
beguile the eyes of the world in confounding the shapes
of either sex, as to keepe any youth in the habit of a virgin,
or any virgin in the shape of a lad, to shroud them from the
eyes of their fathers, tutors, or protectors, or to any other
sinister intent whatsoeuer. But to see our youths attired in
the habit of women, who knowes not what their intents
be? who cannot distinguish them by their names, assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing, they are but to represent such a Lady, at such a
time appoynted?</p>

of all good Arts, Learning and Documents, admit the like
in their Colledges? and they (I assure my selfe) are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of their true vse. In the time of my residence in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
I haue seene Tragedyes, Comedyes, Historyes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storals
and Shewes, publickly acted, in which Graduates of
good place and reputation, haue bene specially parted: this
is held necessary for the emboldening of their <hi>Iunior</hi> schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
to arme them with audacity, against they come to bee
imployed in any publicke exercise, as in the reading of the
Dialecticke, Rhetoricke, Ethicke, Mathematicke, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
or Metaphysicke Lectures, It teacheth audacity to
the bashfull Grammarian, beeing newly admitted into the
priuate Colledge, and after matriculated and entred as a
member of the Vniuersity, and makes him a bold Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to argue <hi>pro et contra,</hi> to compose his Sillogismes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegoricke,

be able to moderate in any Argumentation whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>To come to Rhetoricke, it not onely emboldens a schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

countenance sutable to all the rest, I hold all the rest as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
A deliuery &amp; sweet actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the glosse &amp; beauty of any
discourse that belongs to a scholler. And this is the action
behoouefull in any that professe this quality, not to vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
impudent or forced motion in any part of the body, no
rough, or other violent gesture, nor on the contrary, to
stand like a stiffe starcht man, but to qualifie euery thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of the person personated: for in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
trickes, and toyling too much in the anticke habit of
humors, men of the ripest desert, greatest opinions, and
best reputations, may breake into the most violent absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
I take not vpon me to teach, but to aduise: for it
becomes my <hi>Iuniority</hi> rather to be pupild my selfe, then to
instruct others.</p>
            <p>To proceed, and to looke into those men that professe
themselues aduersaries to this quality, they are none of the
grauest, and most ancient Doctors of the Academy, but
<pb facs="tcp:6452:17"/>
onely a sort of finde-faults, such as interest their prodigall
tongues in all mens affaires without respect. These I haue
heard as liberally in their superficiall censures, taxe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
performed in their Colledges, as these acted on
our publicke stages, not looking into the true &amp; direct
vse of either, but ambitiously preferring their owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
humors, before the profound and authenticall
iudgements of all the learned Doctors of the Vniuersitie.
Thus you see, that touching the antiquity of Actors and
Acting, they haue not beene new lately begot by any vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start

There were others in the Citty of <hi>Elis,</hi> where <hi>Menander</hi>
was foyled by <hi>Philomene.</hi> In the same kinde <hi>Hesiod</hi> is sayd
to haue triumpht ouer <hi>Homer.</hi> So <hi>Corinna</hi> for her excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

the <hi>Theban</hi> Poet, for which she was fiue times crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>The first publicke Theater was by <hi>Dionysius</hi> built in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theaters.</note>
it was fashioned in the manner of a semi-circle, or
halfe-moone, whose galleries &amp; degrees were reared from
the ground, their staires high, in the midst of which did
arise the stage, beside, such a conuenient distance from
the earth, that the audience assembled might easily behold
<pb facs="tcp:6452:19"/>
the whole proiect without impediment. From this the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
had their first patterne, which at the first not being
roof't, but lying open to all weathers, <hi>Quintus Catulus</hi>
was the first that caused the out-side to bee couered with
linnen cloth, and the in-side to bee hung round with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
of silke. But when <hi>Marcus Scaurus</hi> was <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dilis,</hi> hee
repaired it, and supported it round with pillers of Marble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caius Curio,</hi> at the solemne obsequies of his father, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a famous Theater of Timber, in so strange a forme,
that on two seuerall stages, two sundry playes might bee
acted at once, and yet the one bee no hinderance or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to the other; and when hee so pleased the whole
frame was artificially composed to meet in the middest,
which made an Amphi-theater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, after his victories against <hi>Methridates,</hi>
King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> saw in the Citty <hi>Mitelene</hi> a Theater of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
forme, and after his triumphes and returne to <hi>Rome,</hi>
he raised one after the same patterne, of free stone, of that
vastnesse and receit, that within his spaciousnesse it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at once to receiue fourescore thousand people, euery
one to sit, see and heare.</p>
            <p>In emulation of this sumptuous and gorgious building
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> successor to <hi>Pompeyes</hi> greatnesse, exceeded him
in his famous Architecture, hee raised an Amphitheater,
<hi>Campo Martio,</hi> in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> which as farre excelled
<hi>Pompeyes,</hi> as <hi>Pompeyes</hi> did exceed <hi>Caius Curioes, Curioes</hi> that
of <hi>Marcus Scaurus, Scaurus</hi> that of <hi>Quintus Catulus,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi>
that which was first made in <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Dionysius:</hi> for
the Basses, Columnes, Pillars, and Pyramides were all of
hewed Marble, the couerings of the stage, which wee call
the heauens (where vpon any occasion their Gods descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
were Geometrically supported by a Giant-like <hi>Atlas,</hi>
whom the Poëts for his Astrology, feigne to beare heauen
on his shoulders, in which an artificiall Sunne and Moone
of extraordinary aspect and brightnesse had their diurnall,
and nocturnall motions; so had the starres their true and
<pb facs="tcp:6452:19"/>
coelestiall course; so had the spheares, which in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
motion made a most sweet and rauishing harmony:
Here were the Elements and planets in their degrees, the
sky of the <hi>Moone,</hi> the sky of <hi>Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars,
Iupiter and Saturne;</hi> the starres, both fixed and wandering:
and aboue all these, the first mouer, or <hi>primum mobile,</hi> there
were the 12 signes; the lines Equinoctiall and Zodiacal, the
Meridian circle, or Zenith, the Orizon circle, or Emisphere,
the Zones torrid &amp; frozen, the poles articke &amp; antarticke,
with all other tropickes, orbs, lines, circles, the <hi>Solstitium</hi> &amp;
all other motions of the stars, signes, &amp; planets. In briefe, in
that little compasse were comprehended the perfect modell
of the firmament, the whole frame of the heauens, with all
grounds of Astronomicall coniecture. From the roofe grew
a loouer, or turret, of an exceedding altitude, from which an
ensigne of silke waued continually, <hi>Pendebant vela Theatro.</hi>
But lest I waste too much of that compendiousnesse I haue
promised in my discourse, in idle descriptions, I leaue you
to iudge the proportion of the body by the making of
this one limbe, euery piller, seat, foot-post, staire, gallery, &amp;
whatsoeuer else belongs to the furnishing of such a place,
being in cost, substance, forme, and artificiall workmanship,
most sutable. The floore, stage, roofe, out-side, &amp; in-side, as
costly as the <hi>Pantheon</hi> or <hi>

<hi>patres conscripti,</hi> Dictators, Consuls, Pretors, Tribunes,
Triumviri, Decemviri, Ediles, Curules, and other Noble
Officers among the Senators: all other roomes were free
for the plebe, or multitude. To this purpose I introduce
these famous Edifices, as wondring at their cost &amp; state,
thus intimating, that if the quality of Acting, were (as
some propose) altogether vnworthy, why for the speciall
practise, and memorable imployment of the same, were
founded so many rare and admirable monuments: and by
whom were they erected? but by the greatest princes of
their times, and the most famous and worthiest of them all,
<pb facs="tcp:6452:20"/>
builded by him that was the greatest Prince of the world,
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> at what time in his hand he grip't the vniuersal
Empire of the earth. So of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi>

To proceed to the matter: First, playing is an ornament
to the Citty, which strangers of all Nations, repairing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
report of in their Countries, beholding them here
with some admiration: for what variety of entertainment
can there be in any Citty of Christendome, more then in

of playing, continually refined, euery writer striuing in
himselfe to adde a new florish vnto it; so that in processe,
from the most rude and vnpolisht tongue, it is growne to a
most perfect and composed language, and many excellent

Nations grow inamored of our tongue (before despised.)

in these daies we are ashamed of that <hi>Euphony</hi> &amp; eloquence
which within these 60 yeares, the best tongues in the land

thus, by the example of <hi>Caesar</hi> to stir souldiers to valour, &amp;

may reforme that simplicity in themselues, which others
make their sport, lest they happen to become the like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of generall scorne to an auditory, else it intreates of
loue, deriding foolish inamorates, who spend their ages,
their spirits, nay themselues, in the seruile and ridiculous
imployments of their Mistresses: and these are mingled
with sportfull accidents, to recreate such as of themselues
are wholly deuoted to Melancholly, which corrupts the
bloud: or to refresh such weary spirits as are tired with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or study, to moderate the cares and heauinesse of the
minde, that they may returne to their trades and faculties
with more zeale and earnestnesse, after some small soft and
pleasant retirement. Sometimes they discourse of Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loones,
Vsurers that haue vnthrifty sonnes, which both the
fathers and sonnes may behold to their instructions: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of Curtesans, to diuulge their subtelties and snares,
in which yong men may be intangled, shewing them the

discouerers of many notorious murders, long concealed
from the eyes of the world. To omit all farre-fetcht instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we wil proue it by a domestike, and home-borne truth,
which within these few yeares happened.<note place="margin">A strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a play.</note> At <hi>Lin</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi>
the then Earle of <hi>Sussex</hi> players acting the old Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Fryer <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp; presenting a woman, who insatiately
doting on a yong gentleman, had (the more securely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
his affection) mischieuously and seceretly murdered
her husband, whose ghost haunted her, and at diuers times
in her most solitary and priuate contemplations, in most
horrid and fearefull shapes, appeared, and stood before her.
As this was acted, a townes-woman (till then of good esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and report) finding her conscience (at this presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
extremely troubled, suddenly skritched and cryd out
Oh my husband, my husband! I see the ghost of my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
fiercely threatning and menacing me. At which shrill
and vexpected out-cry, the people about her, moou'd to a
strange amazement, inquired the reason of her clamour,
when presently vn-urged, she told them, that seuen yeares
ago, she, to be possest of such a Gentleman (meaning him)
had poysoned her husband, whose fearefull image persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:6452:30"/>
it selfe in the shape of that ghost: whereupon the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
was apprehended, before the Iustices further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; by her voluntary confession after condemned. That
this is true, as well by the report of the Actors as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Towne, there are many eye-witnesses of this
accident yet liuing, vocally to confirme it.</p>
            <p>As strange an accident happened to a company of the

a battle on the stage with their drum and trumpets
strooke vp a lowd alarme: which the enemy hearing, and
fearing they were discouered, amazedly retired, made some
few idle shot in a brauado, and so in a hurly-burly fled dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
to their boats. At the report of this tumult, the
townes-men were immediatly armed, and pursued them to
the sea, praysing God for their happy deliuerance from so
great a danger, who by his prouidence made these stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the instrument and secondary meanes of their escape
from such imminent mischife, and the tyranny of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morcelesse

in disguise, vowing as his last pennance, to labour &amp; carry
burdens to the structure of a goodly Church there to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected:
whose diligence the labourers enuying, since by-reason
of his stature and strength, hee did vsually perfect
more worke in a day, then a dozen of the best, (hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for his conscience, they for their lucres.) Whereupon
<pb facs="tcp:6452:31"/>
by reason his industry had so much disparaged their liuing,
conspired amongst themselues to kill him, waiting some
opportunity to finde him asleepe, which they might easily
doe, since the forest labourers are the soundest sleepers, and
industry is the best preparatiue to rest. Hauing spy'd their
opportunity, they draue a naile into his temples, of which

               </gap>d immediatly he dyed. As the Actors handled this,
the audience might on a sodaine vnderstand an out-cry,
and loud shrike in a remote gallery, and pressing about the
place, they might perceiue a woman of great grauity,
strangely amazed, who with a distracted &amp; troubled braine
oft sighed out these words: Oh my husband, my husband!
The play, without further interruption, proceeded; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was to her owne house conducted, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
suspition, euery one coniecturing as their fancies led
them. In this agony she some few dayes languished, and
on a time, as certaine of her well disposed neighbours came
to comfort her, one amongst the rest being Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to him the Sexton posts, to tell him of a strange thing
happening him in the ripping vp of a graue: see here (quoth
he) what I haue found, and shewes them a faire skull, with
a great nayle pierst quite through the braine-pan, but we
cannot coniecture to whom it should belong, nor how long
it hath laine in the earth, the graue being confused, and the
flesh consumed. At the report of this accident, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
out of the trouble of her afflicted conscience,
discouered a former murder. For 12 yeares ago, by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that nayle into that skull, being the head of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
she had trecherously slaine him. This being publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confest, she was arraigned, condemned, adiudged, and
burned. But I draw my subiect to greater length then I

of priuate mens humors (yet aliue) Noble-men, &amp;

it, nor dare I by any meanes excuse it. The liberty
which some arrogate to themselues, committing their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse,
and liberall inuectiues against all estates, to the
mouthes of Children, supposing their iuniority to be a
priuiledge for any rayling, be it neuer so violent, I could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
all such, to curbe and limit this presumed liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
