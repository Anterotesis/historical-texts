            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Students of the Univerſity here, deſigned, ſome time ago, to burn the Pope's <hi>Effigies;</hi> but that was not more zealouſly deſired to be prevented by ſome, than to be done by others; notwithſtanding all the imaginable care taken to prevent it, yet it was done about Ten Days ago, after day-light gone, at the Croſs, and blown up with art, that ſeems to have been beyond their invention, above Four Stories high. Two days thereafter they went to the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> at mid-day, paſſing by the Guards, crying, <hi>No Pope, No Papiſt;</hi> and being got into the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> (after they had required the Guards to be preſent at the Sentence) and having got upon the Bench, they Arraigned his <hi>Holineſs</hi> before his Judges, and gave the Jury their Commiſſion, who brought him in Guilty; whereupon, he was ſentenced to be burnt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly at the Croſs the Twenty Fifth of this inſtant; and withal declared and proteſted for a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, advertiſement was giving by a Papiſt, to a Gentlewoman to remove her ſelf out of this City, and to carry out her Husbands papers forthwith, becauſe that Night there ſhould be here a hot wakening, ſuch as had not been heretofore, and adviſed her to give the ſame advice to any of her friends ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Your friend Mr. <hi>M.</hi> being acquainted with this, he revealed the ſame to ſeveral of our Magiſtrates, (which, as is alledged, was not regarded,) he went thereafter and acquainted the Guard of our <hi>Trained-bands</hi> therewith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Captain <hi>Patrick Johnſtone, (Hilton</hi>'s Brother) cauſed to beat the Drums, and the noiſe having gone abroad, and ſeveral perſons having ordered their Arms, and people flocking together to conſider what was fit to be done, the Magiſtrates, with the Council, convened for the ſame purpoſe. A great many Boys met alſo, and went through the whole Town, crying aloud, <hi>No Pope. No</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95327:2"/>
                     <hi>Papiſt, No Popiſh Chancellor, No</hi> Melfort, <hi>No Father</hi> Petres. But the Gates were ſhut, the Magiſtrates went along the ſtreets for the keeping of the peace; and nothing more was done that night, except the breaking of three or four Glaſs-windows of <hi>Papiſts</hi> Houſes, and that ſome of the Boys got up to the Croſs, and Proclaimed a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> and offered Two Thouſand Pounds for <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>'s Head; ſo that Night paſt over, when all people here were in fear of ſome ill deſigns, and the rather, becauſe of their certain knowledge that there were lying in the Suburbs a great many Hundreds of <hi>Highland men,</hi> (or rather Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands) and that all that day the Abbey Gates were exactly kept by Souldiers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Wallace,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and none admitted to enter except <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Highland-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Monday,</hi> about mid-day, the Chancellor parted thence, and went towards the Highlands, by advice of ſeveral of the Privy Council and his friends, and took a good Guard with him. At Night the Students went (without Arms) to the Abbey, to condemn the Pope, and to Proclaim a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> and perhaps to burn what was contained in the Chapel, but without asking queſtions, were repulſed by a ſhower of Ball whereby ſeveral were wounded, and ſome ſince dead of their wounds, which coming to the Privy Councils knowledge (which was then fitting) they called the Town Council, (then alſo met) and Captain <hi>Grahame;</hi> deſired them to ſee to the preſervance of the peace, and ſent Six He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds with an order to Captain <hi>Wallace,</hi> and his men, to lay down their Arms, render themſelves Priſoners, and deliver their Guards to the Magiſtrates, but they were anſwer'd by Ball, which being reported to the Privy Council, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ordered Captain <hi>Grahame,</hi> and his Company, Trained-bands and Militia, to fall upon them, which they did; <hi>Wallace</hi> and his men fled, ſeveral of them were taken, and ſome wounded, as were ſome of Captain <hi>Grahame</hi>'s men. The Rabble were ſo incenſed upon the firing, and ſuppoſition that it was Boys were killed, that they burnt all that was contained in the Chapels, the Jeſuits Colledge, the Popiſh Printing-houſe, the Abbey Church, the Chancellors Lodgings, and generally, all that was contained in the Houſes of Papiſts, in the Town and Cannon-gate, excepting what was taken away by ſome people who deſigned plunder.</p>
                  <p>They had fires in the Abbey-Court, and at the Croſs, all the Night, and ſpared nothing they got in Papiſts Houſes. Some few Houſes were ſpared at the interceſſion of ſome Proteſtants their friends, and after true enquiry, I heard the loſs is called greater than it is. None of the Papiſts themſelves were killed or wounded. They met with few of them; thoſe they got they carried into the Guard.</p>
                  <p>In ſome of the Popiſh Houſes they found Arms and Barrels of Powder, which provoked to a more narrow ſearch. All this time the Caſtle never fired one Gun, which is more attributed to the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> than to any other inferior Officer. I am told the Council ſent and diſcharged an Execution from the Caſtle. Some of the Boys are dead of their wounds. <hi>Traquair</hi> (a Popiſh Lord) and ſeveral others went to, and continue in the Caſtle for their ſecurity. The Council ordered the ſearching for Ammunition and Arms in ſome Popiſh Houſes in the Country, and this day committed a Warrant for the reſtoring of what was plundred out of the Papiſts Houſes.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot to tell you, that on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt the Privy Council disbanded Six Hundred Men, taken on the <hi>Friday</hi> before, and commanded all the Highlanders forthwith to depart upon pain of death, and yeſterday ordered all Gentlemen to depart out of the Town, excepting ſuch as ſhould give account of their buſineſs to ſome of the Privy Council. I am credibly informed, that this day in the Privy Council, was voted an Addreſs to be made to his Majeſty for a <hi>Free Parliament;</hi> there are ſeveral Noblemen and Gentlemen gone from hence into <hi>England,</hi> and more to follow, but its ſuſpected they are going to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the Chancellor went away privately from the Abbey for <hi>Caſtle Drummond,</hi> he gave ſtrict command to Captain <hi>Wallace</hi> to preſerve the Chapel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Rabble having gathered, and procured Links, without any Fire-Arms, about Six at Night went to the Abbey, and were denied acceſs; whereupon, ſome preſſing forward, <hi>Wallace</hi> commanded his Souldiers to Fire; which they did, and killed and wounded about Twenty, whereof one half died ſhortly after. The Rabble retired to the City with a great noiſe, towards the Entry to the Court of the Parliament-Houſe, where ſome of the Lords of the Privy-Council were ſitting. There ſome Weſt-Country Gentlemen encouraged them to proſecute a Revenge, and got the Provoſt of the City to go to the Houſe of Lords; and told them, if they would not give a Warrant to Aſſault <hi>Wallace,</hi> and force him from the Abbey, they would do it without it. The Lords being alarm'd with the ſlaughter, and a report that ſeveral Gentlemens Sons were killed, and ſome of their own; they ordered a Herald at Arms, with ſound of Trumpet, to command <hi>Wallace</hi> in the Kings Name to give up his Guard at the Abbey to the City: And the Company under the Cities Pay marched firſt, commanded by Captain <hi>Grahame;</hi> and after them all the Train'd-bands and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, to force him in caſe of refuſal; ſeveral Gentlemen accompanying <hi>Grahame,</hi> and the Magiſtrates attending, <hi>Wallace</hi> refuſed the Herald, and fired upon <hi>Grahame,</hi> and the reſt behind; wounded ſome Gentlemen and a few Souldiers: But <hi>Grahame</hi> Marched quickly down a Lane on the South-ſide of the Porch of the Abbey-Court, where <hi>Wallace</hi> was Poſted, and by a back way entered the Court, came upon <hi>Wallace</hi>'s Reer, and the Town Companies Fronting him; after the firſt Fire he and all his Men fled; only a few of them were taken, the moſt part eſcaping under the darkneſs of the Night. The City being thus Maſter of the Abbey the Rabble immediately, without oppoſition, went firſt to the Chapel, forced the Doors, broke all to pieces, and carried ſeveral parcels in Triumph up to the Croſs, and burnt them there.</p>
                  <p>The next day ſtrong Guards were ſet through the whole City and Suburbs, in convenient places, to repreſs any farther Tumult; and ſo all was quiet, and continues ſo.</p>
                  <p>This Morning there was coming into <hi>Leith</hi> a Boat from <hi>Burnt-Iſland,</hi> with Eighty Men a-board, being a part of Two or Three Hundred which had been ſent for by the Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi> from the North, to inforce the Caſtle; the reſt were to follow. But the Bailiff of <hi>Leith</hi> having notice beforehand of their coming, ſent on Board and diſcharged their coming into the Harbor, and deſired to ſpeak with their Commander; who came aſhore, and owned the deſign; being believed to be all Papiſts: He was ſeized, and the Men commanded back to the other ſhoar, under the higheſt pains.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of the Treaſury have called in all Commiſſions given to Papiſts, for Collecting His Majeſty's Revenue.</p>

                  <p>THE Chancellor, thinking as Affairs ſtood, he was not ſecure at home, reſolved for <hi>France;</hi> and with all the privacy imaginable, he in Womans and his Lady in Mans Clothes, got a-board a Veſſel bound from this Firth the <hi>20th.</hi> inſtant, being <hi>Thurſday;</hi> which ſet Sail, the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair: But a certain perſon on Horſeback, Riding by <hi>Kircaldie,</hi> where the Seamen uſe to walk, called to them, and told them, there was a good Prize in that Ship under Sail, namely, the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereupon, about Thirty Six common Seamen, Commanded by one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> that had been a Buca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95327:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in <hi>America,</hi> which had Guns or Muskets, mann'd a light Boat; and with out any Proviſions, ſave a little Brandy, or any Order from a Magiſtrate, ſet Sail immediately, and came up with the Ship that Night, Boarded her, inquired for the Chancellor, whom they denied to be a-board; but after ſearch, found him and his Lady cloathed as aforeſaid; brought the Ship back, and carried the Priſoners, with Mr. <hi>Nicolſon,</hi> (a Prieſt, late Regent in the College of <hi>Glaſgow)</hi> aſhore to <hi>Kircaldie</hi> Talbooth (or Priſon.) The Chancellor wrote Letters yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to ſeveral of the Privy Council, complaning of the injury done him. The Council have ordered him to be carried by the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> and a Company of the Militia, to <hi>Stirling</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi> has been deſired by the Council to lay down his Charge of Governour of the Caſtle; but he ſtill declines it; alledging, that ſeeing he has his Commiſſion immediately from the King, and to be accountable to none elſe, he cannot in honour lay it down till he has His Majeſty's command for it; and ſays, he had ſent a Gentleman expreſly to know His Majeſty's pleaſure upon that point fourteen days ago, and expects his return every day: And in the mean time, has aſſured the Council by Letters, and this day the Provoſt and Magiſtrates of the City, whom he ſent for to ſpeak with, that he will upon his Word of Honour be a good Neighbour, and not do them or the City any prejudice.</p>
