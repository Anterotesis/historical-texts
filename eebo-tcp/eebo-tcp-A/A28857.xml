            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MAſter <hi>William Boteler</hi> was born in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> about the Year 1650.

(the great Randevous of Buſineſs) as a Candidate of Fortune, in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Imploy: He ſuddenly and moſt unexpectedly met with that Sad and Diſaſterous Fate; which put a Period to his Life.</p>
               <p>The wicked Inſtrument that drew this Miſchief upon him, was one <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> a fellow of a Debauched Life and Ill Fame; who having heretofore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated into the Affections of one Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> living in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and not above Four Miles from the Town of <hi>Biſhops-Starfford,</hi> A Gentleman of conſiderable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Captain of the Train-bands: He was pleaſed commonly to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him at His Houſe, aſſiſt him upon any Occaſions, and in a word had conferred many ſingular Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations from time to time upon him: But in <hi>July</hi> laſt a Difference ſuddenly ariſing between them upon

               <p>
                  <hi>Boteler</hi> declared further, that he parted with Captain <hi>Wade</hi> before the Murther was committed, and ſaw him not afterwards; but endeavour'd all he could to avoid his Company; We ſhall referr the more particular Relation of circumſtances to Maſter <hi>Boteler's</hi> Solemn confeſſion, taken after his condemnation by the High Sheriffs Chaplain, according to the Honourable Judges order, which he twice took the Sacrament upon, and Dyed in; the true coppy whereof ſhall herein in it's due place be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:109766:10"/>They came to Miſtris <hi>Ainſworths</hi> that night, and there lay, and alſo Sunday night; on Munday morning <hi>Parſons</hi> called up one of the Servants early, and ordered him to make ready the Horſe he uſually rode upon, and alſo one for Mr. <hi>Boteler,</hi> telling him he would ſhow him a neighbouring Park, which was very pleaſant and worth ſeeing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they rode out together; in the way <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> told Mr. <hi>Boteler,</hi> it would then be a very fit time to know Captain <hi>Wades</hi> mind; Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> anſwered, it was moſt proper for him to go himſelf, and he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go along with him, for he knew not the way alone; <hi>Parſons</hi> replyed, he was afraid to go to the Captains Houſe, leaſt the Servants ſhould take an advantage of him, who knew very well he had lately quarreled with their Maſter, but if he would go to the Captains houſe, he would direct him the way, and wait his return in a field not far diſtant; Mr. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teler</hi> accordingly went, telling him at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture that if he did not return in a ſhort time, he ſhould ride back again towards <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops-Starfford,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109766:10"/>
and he would follow him, Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> came to the Captains Houſe, asked for him, and underſtanding he was at home, alighted from his horſe, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a Servant into the houſe, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately acquainting his Maſter, he not long after came down, and treated Mr. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teler</hi> with great kindneſs and civilty, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a breakfaſt, which he refuſed, but Drank with him, and in their Diſcourſe told him, he was concerned to hear there had been a quarrel betwixt him and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and that he ſhould think himſelf happy could he be an inſtrument to reconcile them: Capt. <hi>Wade</hi> anſwered in a paſsion, that <hi>Parſons</hi> was a very ungrateful Rogue, that he had affronted him and given him the lye twice, and he would never put it up; Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> replied, that if they both continued in ſuch a heat, <hi>Parſons</hi> demanding ſatisfaction for the opprobrious language given him, and he reſolving on the other ſide not to paſs by the affront offered by <hi>Parſons,</hi> there was little hopes of a Reconciliation; Captain <hi>Wade</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109766:11"/>
then asked him where <hi>Parſons</hi> was: Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> anſwered, in a field not far off: then the Captain demanded why he came not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his houſe; he anſwered, becauſe he feared his ſervants, or that himſelf would take advantage of the challenge; Capt. <hi>Wade</hi> proteſted he ſcorned any thing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then enquired of Mr. <hi>Boteler,</hi> whether <hi>parſons</hi> had not importun'd him to be his ſecond; he anſwered he had very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired it, but he altogether refuſed him, and therefore deſired the Captain he would forgive <hi>parſons</hi> and be Reconciled: the Captain ſolemnly proteſted he would not, but he would go and ſpeak with <hi>parſons</hi> himſelf: which Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> hearing, was very earneſt with him, that in regard he was thus wheadled down by <hi>parſons,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the Difference, and yet might ſeem concerned in it, that he would put off the meeting of <hi>parſons</hi> for that Day at leaſt, and then if <hi>parſons</hi> reſolved to fight, he would be a ſecond to the Capt. rather than to <hi>parſons;</hi> but the Capt. not hearkening
<pb facs="tcp:109766:11"/>
thereunto, in a rage took up his ſword, and told Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> he would walk a little way with him, and ſo ſpeak with <hi>parſons:</hi> Mr. <hi>boteler</hi> deſired him to deſist, becauſe being both in a heat danger might enſue: however the Capt. went to the Door with Mr. <hi>bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> who called for his horſe, and would have immediately got up, but the Capt. told him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he would willingly walk a little way with him, and then Mr. <hi>boteler</hi> ſeeing he could not prevail, led his horſe in his hand, and ſo they walked on together; the Capt. ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>boteler</hi> in the way, which field he had left <hi>parſons</hi> in, he pointed to the Field, but deſired the Captain to retorn, which he abſolutely refuſing, Mr. <hi>Boteler</hi> told him, if he was reſolv'd to go to <hi>parſons</hi> he would leave him, for he fear'd ſome miſchief would, follow; the Capt. replyed, Farewel then honeſt <hi>Will,</hi> God bleſs thee, and ſo ſhook hands and parted: Mr. <hi>boteler</hi> got on horſe-back, and rode on gently towards <hi>biſhops-ſtarfford,</hi> and after he had rode half way, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, <hi>parſons</hi> upon a ſwift Gallop over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb facs="tcp:109766:12"/>
him, and crying out to him onely, <hi>He is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> paſſed by him, and never ſtop'd till he came to <hi>Biſhops-Starfford;</hi> M. <hi>Boteler</hi> rode after him, and when he came into <hi>Mrs. Ainſworths</hi> houſe, found her crying upon the bed, and <hi>Parſons</hi> in the Room with his Boots on: No ſooner did <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> come in, but ſhe cryed out, <hi>Oh! Mr.</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teler, <hi>what have you done? Parſons</hi> hearing that, ſwore that <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> was not near when they fought, and if the Capt. were dead, he onely had kill'd him, and moreover that what he had done, be had done fairly: and having thus ſaid, quitted the Room, call'd for his horſe, and rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> after he was gone, thought it convenient for him to ſtay there, and whilſt he was conſidering what to do in this caſe, <hi>Mrs. Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and her Servant plainly told him he ſhould not ſtay there; and bringing the Horſe to the door, would not let him be quiet till they had prevailed with him to be gone, not ſuffering him to ſtay to take his Coat and his other Perriwig which he left behind. After he had rode four miles, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, he ſaw <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtanding at a Smiths ſhop, whilſt his Horſe was ſhoo'd, having drop'd a ſhooe by the way: and after that riding a little way with <hi>Parſons,</hi> ask't him the manner of their Duel, who told him, that after they had choſe a ſmooth green place at the end of a Land, they made ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at one another, and it was his fortune to break the Captains ſword, and then catching hold of his
<pb facs="tcp:109766:12"/>
hand and wringing it behind him, he ask't whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would beg his life; the Capt. ſaying he ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, he ſtab'd him into the breaſt, and ſo he fell: after he was fallen he thruſt his own ſword into the ground, and it breaking, he took the peice broke off, and whirl'd it from him, and ſo took Horſe and rid away. <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> hearing this, told <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> he thought it not ſafe to keep him company, and deſired him to ride on by himſelf: then ſaid <hi>Parſons,</hi> prethee <hi>Will</hi> don't leave me, but let us ride together to <hi>London,</hi> and aſſure thy ſelf if thou bee'ſt queſtioned, I will quickly clear thee and own the fact; but <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> ſtill deſired <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to ride before, and then he did; and <hi>Mr. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teler</hi> kept at ſome diſtance from him in hopes to be left behind, but when he came to the <hi>Green-Man, Parſons</hi> having dropt another ſhooe, ſtaid there at the Smiths, when <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> came by, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there, took the way over <hi>Hackney-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes</hi> in hopes to looſe him, and ſo they rode into <hi>London</hi> together; when they came into <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> where they ſet up their horſes, <hi>Mr. Parſons</hi> ſent for ſome women of his acquaintance; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them that he had fought a duel, and that <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> was not near the Capt. and himſelf when they fought, and if <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> was call'd in queſtion about it, he wiſht that he might be ſtruck blind and dumb, and many other horrid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments befall him, if he did not ſurrender himſelf and own the fact. <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> upon this left him, and went to his own lodging where he commonly
<pb facs="tcp:109766:13"/>
lay before; and the next day din'd with his friends at the uſual Ordinary, and being admoniſht by a Gentleman that had heard that he was ſearch'd for by the Hue and Cry, ſent immediately to ſecure <hi>Parſons:</hi> but miſſing of him, was adviſed to take another lodging till <hi>Parſons</hi> was taken: whereupon he went to a friends houſe, being an Inn in Blooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and being ſeiz'd by the Conſtable and Watch, at the firſt ſurprize betwixt ſleeping and waking, deny'd his name, but afterwards confeſſed it, and proteſted his innocence, ſubmitting to the Officers, and ſo was brought to Priſon.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This Confeſſion he Solemnly made, declaring it to be the whole Truth, as far as he was concerned in, or privy to the Death of Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> either before or after the ſame was committed; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he received the Sacrament. And of the Verity thereof there is this further probability, That he declared the <hi>very ſame</hi> to ſeveral <hi>friends upon</hi> his firſt Apprehenſion, and all along to his Death continued conſtant therein, without variation or contradicting himſelf in any circumſtances, even to his Death; Nor was any part thereof diſproved by any of the Witneſſes, but ſeveral particulars confirm'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:109766:13"/>Being now under a Sentence of Death he began to conſider his latter End; and as by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity of Authority he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a larger ſpace of time than ordinary to fit himſelf for that great and dreadful Change, ſo he impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thoſe precious minutes moſt frugally to his ſpiritual advantage, by frequent converſe with Miniſters, reading the Holy Scriptures, and other pious Books; and leſt he ſhould be tempted to miſpend any part of his time vainly, or worſe, inſtead of redeeming that which was paſt, which was now become his great buſineſs, as well as intereſt, he was very cautious of being ſpoken withal by any without firſt knowing their names; ſo that if any of his old profane idle Acquaintance came, he put off their impertinent Viſits by
<pb facs="tcp:109766:14"/>
ſending word of his being retired, and buſie; but with the Miniſters and others, whoſe diſcourſe ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Heavenly things, and tended to the edification of his Soul; he declared himſelf much delighted and refreſhed in their ſociety, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf to follow to his power all their wholſome directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He was now much given to meditation and private Prayer, mightily bewailing the wickedneſs of his paſt life, and magnifying God that had made him ſenſible of the danger he was formerly in: In a word, There appeared a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al change; and that the Reader may judge how happy a frame of ſpirit he was under, let him peruſe the following Engagement or Covenant drawn up by <hi>Mr. Boteler</hi> himſelf, ſoon after his condemnation, and
<pb facs="tcp:109766:14"/>
found in his own Hand-writing in his Book: The Original remaining in the hands of a worthy Miniſter, Chaplain to a Noble Lord, whence this is faithfully copied.</p>

                  <p>OH! moſt dreadful God for the Pasſion of thy Son, I beſeech thee, accept of thy poor Prodigal, now proſtrating himſelf at thy door; I have fallen from thee by mine Iniquities, and am by Nature the Son of Death, and a thouſand-fold more the Child of Hell by my wicked practiſes; but of thine infinite Grace, thou haſt promiſed Mercy to me in Chriſt, if I will turn to thee with all my Heart: Therefore upon the Call of thy Goſpel I am now come in, and throwing
<pb facs="tcp:109766:15"/>
down my Weapons, ſubmit my ſelf to thy Mercy: And becauſe thou requireſt, as the conditions of my peace with Thee, that I ſhould put away my Idols, and be at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with all thine Enemies, whom I acknowledge I have wickedly ſided with againſt thee; I do here from the bottom of my heart renounce them all, firmly covenanting with thee, not to allow my ſelf in any known ſin, but conſcientiouſly to uſe all means that I know thou haſt preſcribed for the death and utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all my Corruptions: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I have formerly inordinately and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly let out all my Affections upon the World, I do here reſign my heart to thee that madeſt it, humbly proteſting before thy glorious Majeſty, that this is the firm reſolution of my heart, and that I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly deſire Grace from thee, That when thou ſhalt call me thereunto, I may practiſe this my Reſolution, through thy Aſſiſtance, to forſake all that is dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in this World, rather than to turn from thee to the ways of ſin; and that I may watch againſt all its Temptations, whether of Proſperity or Adverſity, leſt they ſhould withdraw my heart from

                  <p>And for as much as Thou haſt of thy bottomleſs Mercy offered moſt graciouſly to me, wretched ſinner, to be again through Chriſt my God, if I would accept of Thee, I call Heaven and Earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord this day, That I do here ſolemnly avouch Thee for the Lord my God, and with all poſſible veneration, bowing the neck of my Soul under the feet of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, I do here take thee the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt for my Portion and chief Good, and do give up my ſelf, Body and Soul for thy Servant, promiſing and vowing to ſerve thee in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of my life; and ſince thou haſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the only means of coming unto thee, I do here upon the bended knees of my Soul accept of him as the only new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <p>And ſince thou haſt told me I muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer if I will reign; I do here covenant to take my Lot as it falls with thee, and by thy Grace aſſiſting to run all hazards with thee, verily confiding, That neither life nor death ſhall part between thee and me.</p>

                  <p>I cannot but acknowledge myſelf plac'd here as the faint Eccho of this Dying perſon, and therefore tis but fit I repeat that, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired might be part of his laſt words, and the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe, had I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time alotted for a matter of ſo great weight and importance. Hear then (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) hear this Dying Penitent, breaking forth into the Pathetical words of the Church, ſpoken by the <hi>Prophet, Mic. 7.8.9.10. Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine Enemy, when I fall, I ſhall ariſe, when I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a Light unto me; my ſhameful fall will be my glorious

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have very great reaſon to believe, that I ſhall die here with as little pity, and as much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice as ever any did; but I beg of you to hear the words of a dying man, who within a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes muſt go out of this World.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, as to the thing I ſuffer for, I am very well ſatisfied, and am content to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that I die juſtly and righitouſly by the Law of the Land; but as touching the murder of Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> I am not guilty; <hi>Parſons</hi> came to me, and deſired me to go to Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> to tell him that he was in ſuch a place, and would ſpeak with him, which I was loath for to do; but upon his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I went to him. (This Captain <hi>Wade</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any malice or envy in my heart againſt in my life, nor any provocation from him) But, as I ſaid, I went to him, and told him that <hi>Parſons</hi> was reſolved not to put up the affront he had given him: I told him alſo that <hi>Parſons</hi> was in a Field in ſuch a place: I ſaid, Sir, I am ſorry that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> hath any thing againſt you, that he is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd; He deſired me to go with him to the Field, and ſhew him where <hi>Parſons</hi> was, for he would go to him: But I was unwilling to go with him, and
<pb facs="tcp:109766:22"/>
more than once deſired him to let me be gone, that I might not be concern'd one way or other, deſiring him likewiſe to forbear, or at leaſt defer meeting, to ſee if a reconciliation might not be had, and if afterwards <hi>Parſons</hi> would fight with Seconds, I would ſerve him rather than Parſons: But he would needs have me go forth of his Houſe with him; ſo I walk'd with him a little way, and then I ſaid, <hi>Fare ye well, Sir, God bleſs you.</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>God bleſs thee, honeſt</hi> Will, and ſo we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>I do declare that I never ſaw them near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor any Sword drawn.</p>
                  <p>If any thing lies upon my Conſcience, it is this, (and I have laid it before the Lord with humility, and am ſatisfied that God hath pardon'd it through the Merits of Chriſt (That I ſhould be an occaſion to bring him out of his houſe, whereby he came to his end.</p>
                  <p>I do declare, That <hi>Parſons</hi> told me both before and when he was come to <hi>London,</hi> that he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Captain was not dead.</p>
                  <p>But I have very juſtly deſerved a greater death than this, by my many ſins that I have committed againſt God, and I do deſire that my fall may be to the ſaving of many a man here.</p>
                  <p>My wickedneſs was great, I was come to meer Atheiſme, I did not beleive there was a God, but liv'd in continuual practice of ſin; going to bed prophaning of his holy Name, and riſing again with curſes in my mouth, let all that hear me this day repent, and not forget the Lord that made them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109766:22"/>I was educated like a Gentleman (as many do know) and very well brought up as to Religion, but I had left all that, and kept bad company, and was drawn in only as you have heard, but you ſee, he that did the fact is eſcaped, and I muſt dye.</p>
                  <p>Now I deſire that every one that lives, and ſees me here, may take example by me, who am going out of this world within a few minutes; there is never a one here, but does provoke the Almighty every minute to cut him off, were not his mercies infinite; and I can freely loſe this life, confeſſing I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an eternal death, yet I believe through the merits of my dear Saviour that he will receive me immediately into glory.</p>
                  <p>Now there is another aſperſion that is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, that I was a High-way Robber, and I do declare, that I never had any ſuch deſign, never was of any gang to that purpoſe, nor ever ſaw any man robb'd that I remember in all my life.</p>
                  <p>As touching the bloody coat that people judge I did the Act in, I do declare that it was done by my being let blood, and that ſix or ſeven weeks before the murder was committed, as many Gentlemen can witneſs, nor had I that coat on then.</p>
                  <p>Another thing I would clear that was caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, which is, that I was a Roman Catholick, But I do declare that I am not, but am a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though one of the leaſt and worſt thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now I have done, and leave it to you, whether you will beleive the words of a dying man or no; for how could I expect to be ſaved, if I ſhould go
<pb facs="tcp:109766:23"/>
out of the world with a lye in my mouth.</p>
                  <p>I pray God of Heaven freely to forgive <hi>Parſons,</hi> that hath brought me to this, and to give him to conſider what he hath done, and grant him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, and to have mercy on his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>But though I dye I am confident that he will clear my innocency, but I find that I was ſo little believed, that people thought I would ſay any thing to ſave my life.</p>
                  <p>And now I deſire you all to joyn with me in Prayer to Almighty God to forgive me my ſins, to have mercy upon me, and to ſave my ſoul.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="narrative">
                  <p>So he kneeled down to Prayer, and prayed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affectionately, humbly, and enlargedly, with much brokenneſs of heart, and ſuch pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that, being not exactly taken, it would be injurious to repreſent them with the leaſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from his own words, then a Miniſter went to Prayer with him, and after he had prayed to God again in few words, he then riſe up and ſaid, <hi>The God of Heaven bleſs you all,</hi> and when he was on the Ladder, he ſaid. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt have mercy on me,</hi> then the Hangman asking him to forgive him, he anſwered, <hi>Oh with all my Soul I forgive thee</hi>; and then laſt of all gave the ſignal of his innocency that he promiſed to the Miniſter, by clapping his hands, and ſaid, <hi>Jeſus Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Soul,</hi> and ſo was turned off.</p>
                  <p>There were preſent a great many perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and a vaſt number of common people, but ſo
<pb facs="tcp:109766:23"/>
affecting was his language and behaviour, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tears from his very Enemies, ſo that ſcarce any there but wept, and bewaild his untimely end, as if he had been one of their own Relations: His body in a fair Cofin was convey'd back to <hi>Chelmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and that evening decently buried, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttended to the Church with a very numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the original occaſion of all this ſad Tragedy, wherein theſe two Gentlemen ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately loſt their lives one in the field by the ſword of an ungrateful villain, and the other by the hand of Juſtice; I know not how I can more uſefully cloſe this Narrative, than with a few words againſt the miſchievous humour of Duels, tis moſt ſtrange how ſuch an unreaſonable, brutiſh and bloody cuſtome ſhould ſo far prevail againſt the Laws, as ſtill to be accounted brave and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, as if a Gentleman were obliged to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life, or forfeit his Honour at the pleaſure of every deſperate Ruffin; that Honor is too thin and brittle, that a fooliſh raſh word can pierce; tis certainly a dear purchas'd Conqueſt, that ſtains a man with the deſerved title of a Murderer, a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry triumph where the Conqueror muſt either run away and hide his head, or ignominiouſly fall a ſacrifice to expiate the guilt of his victory; does not he who denies that he can be wrong'd more nobly, then he who confeſſes that he is both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to wrongs, and hath received ſo great an one that he cannot but purſue its revenge, he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals his wrong, is only wrong'd in private,
<pb facs="tcp:109766:24"/>
whilſt he who revenges his wrong, is wrong'd in publique, and certainly the publike wrong is more ignoble; and ſeeing we conceive our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in honour to puniſh ſuch as would divulge an affront that was ſmother'd as ſoon as given, we cannot but be ſaid to wrong our own Honour, when we in ſeeking revenge, proclaim ſuch wrongs as had elſe either vaniſht, or been leſſen'd by the concealment. Thus have I heard of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent old man, at whoſe bald head a rotten Orange being thrown, in the ſtreet, clapt his hat upon't, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhall ſpoil that knaves ſport, who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſee me come ſhewing my head all beſmear'd over, and complaining of the injury:</hi> Tis one of the moſt picquant revenges to undervalue our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo far as not to think them worthy of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and we ſhew our ſelves to be greater then they, when we let the world ſee, that they cannot trouble us, when children and natural foolls, or mad men do the ſame things that we fret at in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of more advanced years, and underſtanding, we paſs them without a frown; which ſhews, that it is not the acts done us by our enemies, but our own reſentment, which in effect injures us; he who pardons, proclaims he fears not his Enemies for the future, but revenge implies apprehenſions of what we deſire on that account to leſſen; thus cowards are generally cruel, never counting themſelves ſecure till their Enemies have loſt all capacity to reſiſt: in revenge we act the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, but we perſonate a Prince when we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in the one we beſtow a favour, and ſo are
<pb facs="tcp:109766:24"/>
noble, in the other we diſcover our infirmity. May ſuch conſiderations or (if reaſon cannot be heard) at leaſt ſuch direful examples, as this we have here impartially preſented the world with prevail, for the future to abate this wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, grounded on fantaſtick punctilio's of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, generally promoted on trifling, ſhameful occaſions, alwayes attended with black and fatal conſequences, and chiefly practiſed by thoſe that may juſtly claim the leaſt ſhare in the noble ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of real Magnanimity and Fortitude.</p>
