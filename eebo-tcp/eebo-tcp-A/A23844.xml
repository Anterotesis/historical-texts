            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ABSTRACT Of ſome Letters ſent from <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> to ſome friends in <hi>London:</hi> dated the third of <hi>September,</hi> 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt weeke I wrote you of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe that Marqueſſe <hi>Hartford</hi> and the Cavaliers had made, in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of their deſigne in theſe parts, and how they have intrencht them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Sherbone</hi> Caſtle; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the daily increaſe of their Company, both Horſe and Foote; they continue ſtill in the uſe of all meanes whereby to make themſelves ſecure, and the place ſtrong where they are; and the truth is, that its much to be feared, that this County is intended for the Seat of Warre, it being a Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on place, fit for the purpoſe, and the rottenneſſe of the Gentry in theſe parts (we doubt) will be a ſtrong inducement to draw all the Cavaliers with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hither: Many places have been attempted for this purpoſe, but it ſeemes the deſigne would not take in other Counties, doubtleſſe every Buſh muſt be beaten before they will give up the Game.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe having received a Commiſſion this laſt weeke to put in execution the <hi>Array,</hi> he ſent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Towne and County of <hi>Poole,</hi> to ſhew them that he had authority to preſerve that Town in peace
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52532:3"/>
and ſafety, and thereupon required them to ſtand upon their Guard, and to oppoſe all others that ſhould come by any authority whatſoever, to Array and Muſter them; and in caſe they were unable of themſelves, he would ſend them a hundred men: Theſe Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received, two of the chiefe men in the Towne brought them to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and preſented them to Sir <hi>Walter Earle,</hi> and the reſt of the Lieutenants, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly furniſh'd theſe men with fifty pounds, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to get ſuch men into the Towne as they might repoſe truſt in, and by their helpe to make the place ſtrong; and withall to apprehend one Mr. <hi>Antill</hi> (ſometimes Miniſter of that Town) who brought theſe Letters to them, and to ſend him up to the Parliament: Alſo the Marqueſſe ſent Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> the High-Sheriffes Sonne of this county unto Wareham (which is a conſiderable Port Towne, and will eaſily be made ſtrong) with a commiſſion to preſſe a hundred men, &amp; to billet them in the ſame place, and this Mr. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be the captaine over them: whereupon the Towneſmen laid hold of him, and put him into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody whilſt they ſent hither to the Deputy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: but before the Meſſengers returned hee had made an eſcape; however monies were ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht hence, that Souldiers might be entertained into pay for the ſafety of the Towne; ſo that now both Poole and Wareham are well fortified, and provided, the Souldiers come in chearfully, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Captaines. Captaine <hi>Gould</hi> hath twenty men of his Bond that cam riding to his houſe laſt week, and told him, that they had each of them a hundred pound a peece that they would ſpend in the cauſe. All our beſt juſtices of the Peace, are put out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

Our Grand-jury are likewiſe put out, and others put in, which are men deſperatly inraged againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Marqueſſe ſent lately for all our Juſtices, (ſuch as they are) to come to <hi>Sherbone,</hi> where hee ſhew'd them his Commiſſion, and feaſted them (as we are informed) they are men of malignant ſpirits, and cannot indure this word <hi>Reformation</hi>: Well, from thence they came to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> to treate with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Lieutenants, concerning the Marqueſſe his quiet departure from <hi>Sherbone,</hi> which he is contented to do if they would undertake to ſecure his paſſage; Anſwer was made by Sir <hi>Walter Earle</hi> and the reſt, that it was more then they could grant, but in caſe he would put himſelfe into their cuſtody, hee ſhould be ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Parliament, and there be brought to an Honourable Tryall.</p>
            <p>The next monday the Lord <hi>Bedfords</hi> forces and ours meete at <hi>Sherbone,</hi> the Lord <hi>Bedford</hi> brings 20000. with him, and eight or ten pieces of Ordnance: there is 1000. men will be with us this night out of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and we have here two thouſand to joyne with them, and foure good pieces of ordnance. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe hath not with him above 500 horſe, moſt of them baſe ones, as baſe as their maſters, and betwixt three or foure hundred foote, many of them being lowſie fellowes, that inſtead of fighting, will finde enough to ſcratch, ſome among them (which are got in by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion) are of good ranke: The towne of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> continues conſtant in their reſolutions for King and

Parliament, and to defend themſelves and Magazine, if aſſaulted, and to that end continue their watching and fortifying dayly, you know willing minds &amp; ſtout hearts paſſe through all difficulties and expence, for they all contribute in paines and purſe, according to their abilities, excepting one Mr. <hi>I. G.</hi> a man that you well know.</p>
            <p>The Cavaliers that are with the Marqueſſe commit many outrages dayly in theſe parts, the laſt wedenſday as we are credibly informed, two of them met a maid and raviſht her, &amp; then tyed her to a tree ſtark naked, and ſtopt her mouth, but an honeſt man comming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently by, and ſeeing her, untyed her, and tooke the cloth out of her mouth, &amp; then ſhe told him that they were two Horſemen that uſed her ſo cruelly, who told her they would go to ſuch a place hard by to drinke, who indeed did ſo and were there taken and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſent to <hi>Illcheſter</hi> Goale.</p>
            <p>Three or 4 of them were coming through a little village nere <hi>Sherbone,</hi> called <hi>Marſton,</hi> and having bin at an Alehouſe by, and there heard of an honeſt man living in that pariſh, inquired for his houſe, and when they found it, askt for him, but the dore they found faſt ſhut, whereupon theſe rogues called out often to him by the ſimple name of Round-head, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not ſorth to them, they ſhot three or foure times through his doore and ſo departed; they alſo rob many men and women, that Countrey people dare ſcarce ſtir forth neare <hi>Sherbone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt thurſday one of the Cavaliers kild a poor harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe man in the Market at <hi>Sherbone</hi> (being about his buſineſſe) and without any the leaſt occaſion ran to him and ſtruck him firſt with his ſtick, and then with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52532:4"/>
his owne ſword into the skull. I hope we ſhall not be long troubled with them, had our Country bin as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, and our Gentlemen not ſo bad, wee had bin rid of them ere this, our feares lye chiefly now at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> (a conſiderable port Towne) which hath it it nigh upon twenty demy Culverins &amp; above 40. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Minyon, the Towneſmen are ſo malignant, that they will not admit of any ſtrength to be ſent in out of the Countrey: we offered them 150. men of a traine bond, neare them, being men they well know, and would have paid them 7. s. a weeke each man, but this offer was refuſed: you muſt pray for a good ſucceſſe to this Weekes worke, for it will be of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

               <p>SInce my laſt, you may pleaſe to underſtand that the Marqueſſe with his company remaines here ſtill at <hi>Sherbone,</hi> and to outward appearance, intend to try their ſtrength in this place, the truth is, they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated thereunto by reaſon of the ſtrictnes of theſe forces in theſe parts, that have ſurrounded him. They have not above one thouſand of horſe and foot at this day. This day the Marqueſſe ſummoned all <hi>Blackmore</hi> to appeare before him upon paine of death, but there was but ten that manifeſted their obedience to thoſe ſummons. The new high Sheriffe of <hi>Somerſet</hi> could not get above twelve men to aſſiſt the Marqueſſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his zealous endeavours for this weeke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Marqueſſe his men begin to come from him already, ſome of his company have bin lately taken by our partie. Yeſterday about eleven of the clock, the Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi> marched from <hi>Yeavell</hi> to <hi>Sherbon</hi> with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52532:5"/>
twenty eight enſignes, moſt companies having above two hundred men in them, he hath left a double num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber behinde him, which will be ready upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but I hope the deſigne will not require it, hee brought now 8. pieces of Ordnance along with him. About two of the clock yeſterday the <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> men, with thoſe that came out of <hi>Devon,</hi> being 19. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, marched towards <hi>Sherbone</hi> with two Troops of horſe, and 4 great pieces of Ordnance, containing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 32. c. a peace. I am now riding to the Campe, and wil write you further by the next. The Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi> hath 700 good horſe there already, ſo that I hope theſe Achans will not eſcape Him.</p>
