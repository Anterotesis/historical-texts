         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After this, continue with the firſt lie, and lot it be hote and a little at ones, and prouing it often times as we haue ſaide afore, you ſhall by &amp; by know that it will be well trimmed and ordered. And whan it ſhalbe to muche ſodden, or burnt, the ſigne or token ſhalbe whan it is ſo ſtrong and white out of meaſure, that it is burned. Than muſt you giue it ſome water onely, or ſome of the fourth lie hote, not boiling it any more, or at the leaſt very little, &amp; by this meanes you maie parfitely atchiue and come to an ende of your worke.

And note, that it muſt boile ten or twelue houres, and wil not make any lie at the bottome, and in boiling lift vp your ladle a high, and it will make long ſtrekes like threede the ſpace of ſixe houres, and then will beginne to faſten and cloſe vp it ſelf, and will make ſtrekes whiche beyng broken will returne vpward againe, &amp; that is a ſigne that it is not yet ſodden inough: but whan they breake not neither returne backward but remaine faſt and whole than it is ſodden, and therfore you ſhall take it from the fire, for this is the true ſigne &amp; token of it. The other ſigne is, whan it is cold cut it in little rolles, and if they ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpright and not fall, it is a ſigne that it is made. Laie of it oftentimes vpon your tonge before it be ſodden, and if you feele it to ſtrong giue it a little of the third or of the laſt magiſtrale, according as you ſhal perceiue it to be ſtrong, or els little or inough after as you ſhal ſee it hath nede.

The fourth lie, is not ſet a worke but whan it maketh as it were a gelley, and is ſtrong and to rawe. There bee ſome good Maiſters &amp; worke men, that put in the ſecond magiſtrale with the oile, to the intent that the oile mighte not bee ſo muche hurt by his ſtrength, and then they putte in a little of the third, and then a little of the fourth, and after that a little of the firſte: but there is no hurte in that, for there bee meaſures in it, and theſe mixtions are made in the preſence of other menne, whan the maiſter will not ſuffer it to bee knowen, for feare leaſte that other ſhould eaſely learns it.
