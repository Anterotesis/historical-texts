            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And in order thereunto your Honours were pleased to refer it to the Committee of forraign plantations, to prepare and bring in an Ordinance <hi>for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and advancement of Learning and</hi>

               <hi>Piety in New England,</hi> as appeareth by your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der March 17. 1647. This Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee with great readiness and chearfulness took it into their serious consideration, and presented the result of their mature debates to this honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House: But so many and weighty have been the occasions and businesses of the House, that however the nature of the work and my duty (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed Agent though unworthy) on the behalf of New-England to this Parliament: yet durst not presse too hard to interrupt the great affaires your Honours have been in hand withall. Nevertheles, I do now crave leave, humbly to acquaint you, that what was then judged defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the power granted to the Feoffees in that Ordinance, is since corrected and amended, and attendeth your Honours leisure for compleating and finishing the same.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly the common enemy of mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath rejoyced that this work so happily begun, hath not as yet received that countenance and encouragement from hence, which your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours intended and resolved many months since. Nevertheles, I trust the most wise God hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this appearing losse into gaine, by affording your Honours and the Nation a more clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reall and glorious Progres of the
<pb facs="tcp:65159:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gospel among those poor Indians in AMERICA, by such Intelligence I very lately received from thence, under the hands of those Reverend &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministers, which are principally employed in preaching the Gospel to them in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And as I am daily and earnestly called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to publish the same, that the whole Nation may be acquainted therewith: So I took it to be my duty to present it in the first place to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House, and the Councel of State; that your Honours might perceive how these poor Creatures cry out for help; Oh come unto us, teach us the knowledge of God, tarry longer with us, come and dwell amongst us, at least depart not so soon from us. And others of them whose dwellings are near the Habitations of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, (whose hearts God hath touched) calling for and demanding a free and full participation of all the Ordinances of Jesus Christ All which, and much more is evidently held forth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative, which I have with all faithfulnes collected and transcribed, according as I received the same from persons that were Actors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and are of known Integrity.</p>
            <p>There are two great questions Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which have much troubled ancient and
<pb facs="tcp:65159:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
modern writers, and men of greatest depth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to resolve: the first, what became of the ten Tribes of Israel, that were carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity by the King of Siria, when their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Cities were planted and filled with strangers? The second is, what Family, Tribe, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or people it was that first planted, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards filled that vast and long unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of America? Now however I confesse questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are sooner asked then resolved; yet let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

His answer was to this effect, if not in these words, That they were certainly transported into America, and that they had infallible tokens of their being there. Unto which if I may take the boldnesse to adde what my self, with many others in New England have observed in the practice of the Indians there, in relation to some things enjoyned in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law of Moses, about the purification of weomen, which no men at this day do observe, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the year of our Lord, 1646. it seemed good to the most high God, to stirre up some reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Ministers of the Gospel in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to consider how they might be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Lord Jesus, as well towards the Natives of that Countrey, (as to their owne Congregations and Churches, over which the Lord had set them) in bringing them to a right understanding of God and hemselves; and so by degrees to hold forth unto them that Salvation by Jesus Christ to all that should beleeve and obey his Commands; perswading themselves, that God might have a select people amongst these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and that for that end amongst many others he had planted so many Christian Congregations so neer them. And however the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> were not wholly negligent this way, but had in sundry parts of the Countrey long before brought divers to a pretty competency of right understanding in the mystery of salvation, who lived orderly, and dyed hopefully; yet till such time as they were more generally acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our conversation amongst our selves, and with our demeanor towards them, as well in peace, as in such warres they had unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably drawn upon themselves; whereby they had such experience of the justice, prudence, valour, temperance, and righteousnesse of the <hi>English,</hi> as did not onely remove their former jealousies and feares concerning us, and convict them of their owne uneven walking; but begat a good opinion of our persons, and caused them to affect our Laws and Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65159:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Till now (together with the want of language) we had but some few that were wrought upon; But in this acceptable year of the Lord, (being it seems the appointed season for their visitation) God having stirred up these Ministers to seek a Blessing upon their endeavours, and direct them in a right way; they found the answer of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the good acceptation they had amongst the poore <hi>Indians</hi> where they first went, &amp;c. who soon became in love also with our Religion, and mightily hungred and thirsted after the Knowledge of God in Christ, as was published and made apparant to this Nation by a short Treatise, called, <hi>The day-breaking, if not the Sun-rising of the Gospel with the Indians in New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1647. being here upon some speciall service for the Countrey, Letters came to my hands with some Papers from Mr. <hi>Tho. Shepard,</hi> Pastor of the Church at <hi>Cambridge</hi> there, which held forth a greater warmth of heavenly heat upon their (former frozen) spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which I communicated to some eminent Ministers of and neere the City of <hi>London; viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Downham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Case,</hi> Mr. <hi>Galamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sydrack Simpson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenhill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bolton:</hi> And such was the esteem these reverend men had of it, as by two severall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles under their hands they recommended it to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as a thing worthy their notice, care, and furtherance: And secondly, to the godly and well-affected of this Nation, who pray for, and rejoyce in the thrivings of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. This Narrative was also published, and called, <hi>The clear Sun-shine of the Gospel breaking forth upon the Indians in New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1648. our Letters miscarried many of them, in that the Ship that brought them was taken by the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to the Countries great prejudice, as well as many other Vessels and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding formerly; by which miscarriage I was wholly hindred from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any further account till this instant, 1649.</p>
            <p>And now having received some Letters, and others brought to me by divers of quality here residing at present, that appertaine to <hi>New-England;</hi> and being exceedingly pressed to publish them by many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well-affected of the City and parts adjacent, I shall by Gods help publish them all, or so many of them as concernes the <hi>Indian</hi> work; and if any doubt my faithfulnesse herein, (as I hope none will that know me) I shall most willingly shew them the Originalls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

                  <p n="1">1. There was one <hi>Ieogiscat</hi> about 60. years of age, who was sick of a consuming disease, insomuch as the <hi>Indian Pawwawes</hi> gave him over for a dead man: Upon which resolution of all the <note n="*" place="margin">Such as cure by devil'i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Pawwawes</hi> in the Island, the sick distressed Heathen upon a Lords day came unto mee (the rest of the <hi>English</hi> being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) to desire me to pray unto God for him: And so when I had by reasoning with him convinced him of the weaknesse and wickednesse of the <hi>Pawwaws</hi> power; and that if health were to be found, it must be had from him that gave life, and breath, and all things; I commended this case unto the Lord, whereof he rejoyced, gave me thanks, and he speedily recovered unto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer strength.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this present year 1647. the eldest sonne of one <hi>Vakapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essue,</hi> a great Sagamore of the Island, being very sick, took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to send for me to come unto him; and when I came unto him, I found him not more weak in body, then strong in earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that I should pray unto God for him; so I instructed him, and prayed for him: And when I had ended, of his own accord he spake these words, <hi>Taubot mannit nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:65159:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and contrary to the perswasion of other <hi>Indians</hi> of severall Townes, sought againe unto Witches. The Heathen seeing this, they forsook the <note n="*" place="margin">The Indians so call their houses.</note> 
                     <hi>Wigwam,</hi> saying, We leave the house for the Devill and them that would tarry. This newes being brought me, I much mervailed thereat, yet sent him this message, <hi>viz.</hi> Tell <hi>Saul:</hi> (for the sick man was by the <hi>English</hi> so called) that when I was with him, I thought as then I told him, that he would live, because he sought for life unto the living God, where if any where it was to be found: But tell him now, that I think he will dye. I also added the example of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who because he had the knowledge of the great God, and sought unto an inferiour God; God was angry with him, and killed him: And so for that this <hi>Saul</hi> was informed of the true God, and is fallen from him to the earthen gods here below; that God will kill him also; and so it shortly came to passe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not long after a <note n="*" place="margin">A Prince or Ruler amongst them.</note> 
                     <hi>Sagamore,</hi> called, <hi>Towanquattick;</hi> had his eldest sonne, whose name is <hi>Sachachanimo,</hi> very sick of a Feaver; this young man sent for me to come unto him; and when I came, his father and himself desired me to pray for him, the which I did in their owne language, and promised to come againe unto him very shortly, if he mended not, and use some other meanes also for his recovery: When I came againe unto him, I found him very ill, asked him (together with his friends) whether they were willing I should let him blood? acquainting them that we used so to do in such cases. After some consideration, they consented thereunto, notwithstanding the <hi>Pawwaws</hi> had told them before, that he should dye, because he sought not unto them: so I bound his arme, and with my Pen-knife let him blood; he bled freely, but was exceeding faint, which made the Heathen very sad; but in a short time, he begun to be very cheerfull, whereat they much rejoyced, &amp;c. So I left them, and it pleased the Lord the man was in a short time after very well.</p>
                  <p>In these providences the Lord hath manifested both mercy and judgement, and it is, that he may raise up the Tabernacle of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof, and raise up its ruines, and build it as in the dayes of old, that they may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the Covenant of <hi>Edom,</hi> and of all the Heathen which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by my Name, saith the Lord that doth this.</p>

But I pray you take notice of a speech of <hi>Towanquatticks</hi> (beingthe Father of the young man recovered) who lamenting the losse of their knowledge said unto me, *<note place="margin">An indian speech worthy our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>That a long time agon, they had wise men, which in a grave manner taught the people knowlege, but they are dead, and their wisedome is buried with them: and now men live a giddy life in ignorance till they are white headed, and though ripe in yeares, yet then they go without wisedom unto their graves.</hi> He also told me; that <hi>he wondred the English should be almost thirty yeers in the Country, and the Indians fools still; but he hoped that the time of knowledge was now come;</hi> wherefore himself with others desired me to give them an Indian meeting, to make known the word of God unto them in their own tongue. And when he came to me to accomplish his desire thereabout, he told me, that *<note place="margin">The better sort of them are full of such like expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, affecting to speak in Parables.</note> 
                     <hi>I should be to them, as one that stands by a running River, filling many vessels: Even so should I fill them with everlasting knowledge.</hi> So I undertook to give them a meeting once a moneth; but as soon as the first exercise was ended, they desired it oftner then I could well attend: but once a Fortnight is our setled course. This I present to your consideration; entreating you to present us unto the Lord for wisedom, to preach unto the Heathen the unsearchable riches of Christ, that so the root of <hi>Iesse</hi> standing for an Ensigne of the people, the Gentiles may seek unto it, and his rest shall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Amen.</p>

Letter in 48. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of the Gospel among the Indians.</note> by the way of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to trouble you with a few lines, to expresse the thankfulnesse of my heart unto you, for that one part of your care, love, and labour in furthering this work of preaching Christ to these poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and declaring to them the way of eternall life and salvation; which work I blesse the Lord goeth on not without successe, beyond the ability of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: It is the Lord, the Lord only who doth speak to the hearts of men, and he can speak to theirs, and doth, (blessed be his name) so effectually, that one of them I beleeve verilyis gone to the Lord; a *<note place="margin">A precious testimony of an indian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to dye a Christian.</note> woman, who though she was not the first that came into the  knowledge of Christ and the Gospel, yet she was the first of ripe yeares that hath dyed since I taught them the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, and the onely one. And though of the living I will not say much, yet of the dead I may freely speak; After I began to preach unto them, her husband and she did quickly come in; and after she came, she was a diligent hearer; and out of desire to live where the word of God was taught, they fetched all the corne they spent, sixteen miles upon their backs from the place of their planting: She was industrious, and did not goe about to <hi>English</hi> houses a begging, as sundry doe, (though it is well reformed now with many of them) but kept home, kept her children to labour, making baskets to sell, &amp;c. She quickly learned to spin well (for I got some wheels, but want meanes to supply them and order them.) Her life was blamelesse after she submitted to the Gospel, and was exemplary: She was the first woman that asked a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (by another man propounded for her) which was this; <hi>When my Husband prayeth in his house, my heart think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>th what he prayeth; whether is this praying to God a right or no?</hi> I thought it a sit question for a woman. She dyed of a sicknesse she took in childbed: I seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times visited her, prayed with her, asked her about her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall estate? <hi>She told me she still loved God, though he made her</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65159:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>sick, and was resolved to pray unto him so long as she lived, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse powwawing.</hi> She said also, <hi>that she beleeved God would pardon all her sins, because she beleeved that Iesus Christ dyed for her; and that God was well pleased in him, and that she was willing to dye, and beleeved to goe to Heaven, and live happy with God and Christ there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be you may mervell at, and scarce credit such expressions: but they are the points of Catechisme which I constantly teach the Children; and the Children can very readily answer me in them; and they be truths now familiarly known by the attentive hearers, whereof she was one. And moreover of her own accord, she cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her children to her, especially two up-grown daughters, which she had before she married this man, and said to them, <hi>I shall now dye, and when I am dead, your Grand-Father and Grand-mother, and</hi>

                     <hi>Unckles, &amp;c. will send for you to come live amongst them, and promise you great matters, and tell you what pleasant living it is among them; But doe not beleeve them, and I charge you never hearken unto them, nor live amongst them; for they pray not to God, keep not the Sabbath, commit all manner of sinnes and are not punished for it: but I charge you live here, for here they pray unto God, the word of God is taught, sins are suppressed, and punished by Lawes; And therefore I charge you live here all your dayes.</hi> And soon after this she dyed, and it fell out indeed as she had said, for there was earnest sending and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing for the maids to live with them: so that the case was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me on a Lecture day; and their Father in law oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, not only as adjudging it evill, but because of their mothers charge; and by this meanes I came to know the Story. And though they doe, as you know, abhor the remembrance of their dead friends; yet when I take occasion to speak of her, and my reasons of hope that she is gone to heaven, they entertian it with joy, and sometimes with teares: I have been too tedious in this Story, yet I doubt not but it will be acceptable unto you.</p>
                  <p>For the further progresse of the work amongst them, I doe <note place="margin">Note what hinders the progresse of the Gospel amongst them.</note> perceive a great impediment; Sundry in the Country in divers places would gladly be taught the knowledge of God and Iesus Christ, and would pray unto God, if I could goe unto them, and teach them where they dwell: but to come to live here among or neer to the <hi>English,</hi> they are not willing, because they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:65159:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tooles, nor skill, nor heart to fence their grounds; and if it be not well fenced, their Corne is so fpoyled by the <hi>English</hi> Cattell, and the English so loath to restore when they want fence, that its a very great discouragement to them and me; so that few come to dwell at the neer places where I ordinarily teach, onely some strangers do come to hear, and away again: So that I plainly see, the way to do them good must be this. A place must be found (both for this and sundry other reasons I can give) some what remote from the English, where they must have the word constantly caught, and government constantly exercised, meanes of good subsistance provided, incouragements for the industrious, meanes of instructing them in Letters, Trades, and Labours, as building, fishing, Flax and Hemp dressing, planting Orchards, &amp;c. Such a project in a fit place, would draw many that are well minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but I feare it will be too chargeable, though I see that God delighteth in small beginnings, that his great name may be magnified.</p>
                  <p>Few of our Southern Indians incline this way, onely some of <hi>Tihtacuit.</hi> Young <hi>Ousamequin</hi> is an enemy to praying to God, and the old man too wise to look after it.

And truly I think all the Ministers that live neer them should do well to do the like. I have earnestly solicited many so to do, and I hope God will in his time bow their hearts thereunto. But I perceive our Western Indians up into the Inland do more earnestly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel. <hi>Shawanon</hi> the great <hi>Sachym</hi> of <hi>Nashawog</hi> doth embrace the Gospel, and pray unto God. I have been foure times there this Summer, and there be more people by far, then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; and sundry of them do gladly hear the word of God, but it is neer 40. miles off, and I can but seldom goe to them; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they are troubled, and desire I should come oftner, and stay longer when I come.</p>
                  <p>There is a great fishing place upon one of the Falls of <hi>Merimack</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65159:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
River called <hi>Pautucket,</hi> where is a great confluence of Indians every Spring, and thither I have gone these two yeares in that season, and intend so to doe the next Spring (if God will.) Such confluences are like Faires in <hi>England,</hi> and a sit season it is to come then unto them, to teach them to know God, and Iesus Christ, and call upon his name. For whereas there did use to be gaming and much evill at those great meetings, now there is praying to God, and good conference, and observation of the Sabbath, by such as are well minded; and no open prophanesse suffered as I heare of, and my comming amongst them is very acceptable in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance. This last Spring I did there meet old <hi>Papassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connaway,</hi> who is a great <hi>Sogamore,</hi> and hath been a great Witch in all mens esteem (as I suppose your self have often heard) and a very politick wise man. The last yeare he and all his sonnes fled when I came, pretending feare that we would kill him: But this yeare it pleased God to bow his heart to heare the word; I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of Malachi I. 11. which I thus render to them; <hi>From the rising of the Sun, to the going down of the same thy name shall be great among the Indians, and in every place prayers shall be made to thy name, pure prayers, for thy name shall be great among the Indians.</hi> Whence I shewed them, what mercy God had promised to them; and that the time was now come wherein the Lord did begin to call them to repentance, and to beleeve in Christ for the remission of their sins, and to give them an heart to call upon his name, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their former wayes of <hi>pawwawing,</hi> and praying to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, &amp;c. And when I had done preaching, they began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound questions, and one of them propounded this; If it be thus as you teach, then all the world of Indians are gone to hell to be tormented for ever, untill now a few may goe to Heaven and be saved; Is it so? These principles of a twofold estate after this life, for good and bad people, Heaven and Hell, I put amongst the first questions that I instruct them in, and catechise the children in; and they doe readily embrace it for a truth, themselves by their own traditions having some principles of a life after this life, and that good or evill, according to their demeanour in this life. After a good space, this old <hi>Papassaconnoway</hi> speak to this purpose, that indeed he had never prayed unto God as yet, for he had never heard of God before, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65159:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now he doth. And he said further, that he did beleeve what I taught them to be true. And for his owne part, he was purposed in his heart from thenceforth to pray unto God, and that hee would perswade all his sonnes to doe the same, pointing at two of them who were there present, and naming such as were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. His sonnes present, especially his eldest sonne (who is a *<note place="margin">The same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignification with Sagamore viz one b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And this act of his was not onely a present motion that soon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but a good while after he spake to Capt. <hi>Willard,</hi> who tradeth with them in those parts for <hi>Bever</hi> and <hi>Otter Skins,</hi> &amp;c. that he would be glad if I would come and live in some place thereabouts to teach them, and that Capt. <hi>Willard</hi> would live there also: And that if any good ground or place that hee had would be acceptable to me, he would willingly let me have it. I doe endeavour to engage the <hi>Sachims</hi> of greatest note to accept the Gospel, because that doth greatly animate and encourage such as are well-affected, and is a damping to those that are scoffers and opposers; for many such there be, though they dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare so before me.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see by this short intimation, that the sound of the Word is spread a great way; yea, farther then I will speake of; and it appeareth to me, that the Fields begin to look white unto the Harvest. Oh that the Lord would be pleased to raise up many labourers into this Harvest! But it is difficult, not only in respect of the language, but also in respect of their barbarous course of life and poverty; there is not so much as meat, drink, or lodging for them that go unto them to preach among them, but we must carry all things with us, and somewhat to give unto them: So that the comming of Jesus Christ into these parts of the world, is not as he formerly came amongst the Gentiles, a poore underling, and his servants poore, living upon the Gospel where it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted among the rich Gentiles: But Christ will come unto these, rich, potent, above them in learning, riches, and power; and they shall flock unto the Gospel, thereby to receive externall benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and advancement, as well as spirituall grace and blessings. And thus I bend my selfe to doe to my poor ability: I never go unto them empty, but carry somewhat to distribute among them;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65159:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and so likewise when they come unto my house, I am not willing they should go away without some refreshing, neither do I take any gratuity from them unrewarded; and indeed they doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they have nothing worth the giving unto me; onely once when I was up in the Countrey, a poore creature came to me as I was about to take Horse, shaking me by the hand, and with his other hand thrust somthing into my hand, I looked what it was, and it was a penny-worth of *<note place="margin">A beade they make, and is highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Indians, equal to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>There is another great fishing place about threescore miles from us, whether I intend (God willing) to go next Spring, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the forenamed <hi>Papassaconnaway;</hi> which journey, though it be like to be both difficult and chargeable for horse and men, in fitting provisions, yet I have sundry reasons which bow and draw my heart therennto.

When Gods time is come, he will make way for it &amp; enable us to accomplish it. In the meane time, I desire to wait, pray, and beleeve. But I will proceed no further at this time to trouble you with these things, though I doubt not but they will be acceptable tidings to your heart, and will be an occasion of quickning your prayers for them, and for me also, that utterance may be given mee, and further knowledge of their language, wherein for want of converse, I can make but slow progresse.

                  <p>YOur faithfull and true love to Iesus Christ is expressed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to my heart, among other waies very much in your solicitous thoughts and care about the good of these poor Indians, and the furtherance of their conversion. God guided your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very seasonably in the Letters and Tokens you were pleased to send to those leading men, which reallity of love was very thankfully accepted by them, and they desire thanks to be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Your project for their Apparell which you first mention, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitting, but all the difficulty will be to get so much cloath as you speak of: Yet this they doe; some old things I have gotten and given them, and some they buy; and they carefully keep them till meeting times, and many of them at such times are pretty handsome, both men, women, and children also: And whereas some good people may think fitting to send some gifts that way for them, you shall find directions here inclosed, what will best sute with their condition.</p>
                  <p>Your next project for imployment of them in planting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and Gardens, it suiteth very well with my apprehensions, and I have encouraged them that way, and have promised them many hundred trees, which I reserve in nurseries for them, &amp; hope they shall set them out, or some of them the next Spring. The onely remora the fensing in of an Orchard, we yet being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fencing in of a great Corne field, where they have made (I think) 200. rod of ditching already, setting two rayles in the top, and are to stone up the banks as they raise stones in planting: And when the field is fenced, then they shall fence Orchards, but they are hindred for want of Tooles, and by bad Tooles discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; their skill also being weak though the tooles were good, but of 30. or 40. I have scarce any left. But we must endeavour to get a Magazine for them of all manner of Tooles, &amp;c. They had Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65159:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at work last winter, and will have more this winter (I hope) for they saw very good board and planke, and could I be amongst them oftner, they would both attend it better, and doe things more orderly.</p>
                  <p>They are willing to follow my advice in any reasonable thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely I am confident of what you write, they must not be bent too hard at first, and I find not many that do so duly consider that point as your self; but because they be not in all points of labour as the <hi>English</hi> be, think all is too little or no purpose. Its hard to look upon the day of small things with patience enough. I finde it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to carry on civility with Religion: and that maketh me have many thoughts that the way to doe it to the purpose, is to live among them in a place distant from the <hi>English,</hi> for many reasons; and bring them to co-habitation, Government, Arts, and trades: but this is yet too costly an enterprize for <hi>New-England,</hi> that hath expended it self so far in laying the foundation of a Common-weale in this wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>For their Schooling, a Gentleman in <hi>London</hi> (whose name I could never learn) did give ten pounds towards it the last yeare, which I thus disposed of; five pounds I gave to a grave woman in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who taught the Indian children last yeare; And God so blessed her labours, that they came on very prettily. The other five pounds I gave to the Shcool-master of <hi>Dorcester,</hi> and thither the Children of those Indians that lived thereabout went, with a like good successe, it not better, because the children were bigger and more capable. This 10. l. bill Captain <hi>Harding</hi> paid here, and was to take it at <hi>London:</hi> but I heare nothing from him, no do I know whether the Gentleman will continue his gift: I feare for want of meanes both these Schooles will fall; and the Children like to lose all that they have gotten the first yeare, which is a work had need be closely followed: because they are to learn our language as well as to read; onely I take my constant course of catechising them every Lecture day, and I thank the Lord, they are (many of them) very ready in their answers in the principles of Religion. And in that exercise I endeavour also to use them to good manners.</p>

            <p>Or if thou wilt (Reader) thou mayest eye <hi>this Work of God</hi> as a full <hi>text:</hi> affording matter, both for <hi>Theoretick,</hi> and <hi>practick</hi> conclusions.</p>
            <p>I must professe for my self, I could not passe over so rich a mine without diging nor let passe so full a <hi>text</hi> (as this work of God in <hi>America)</hi> without some short comment: which the request of the worthy Publisher of these precious papers, hath prevailed with me to affix, and publish as an Appendix.</p>
            <p>The palpable and present acts of providence, doe more then hint the approach of Jesus Christ: And the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consent of many judicious, and godly Divines, doth induce <hi>considering minds</hi> to beleeve, that the conversion of the Jewes is at hand. Its the expectation of some of the wisest Jewes now living, that about the year 1650. <hi>Either we Christians shall be Mosaick, or else that themselves Iewes shall be Christians.</hi> The serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the preceding Letters, induceth me to think, that there <note place="margin">Conjectures.</note> may be at least a remnant of the <hi>Generation of Iacob</hi> in <hi>America,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65159:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(peradventure some of the 10. Tribes dispersions.) And that those sometimes poor, now precious <hi>Indians</hi> (mentioned in those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) may be as the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the glorious harvest, of <hi>Israels redemption.</hi> The observation is not to be sleighted (though the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server *<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in the clear Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, &amp; pag. 33.</note> modestly said it was <hi>more cheerfull then deep)</hi> that the first  Text out of which Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> preached, was about the dry bones, Ezek. 37. 9. 10. <hi>That by prophesying to the wind, the wind came and the dry bones lived:</hi> It may be there is not much weight in the observation, that the word which the Indians use for wind, is <hi>Wau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi> and that an <hi>Indian</hi> of that name is, and hath been very sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for their conversion: Yet to me there is ground for a very weighty thought; that, that portion of Scripture should be first of all openned to them, which clearly foretold the conversion of <hi>Israel, i. e.</hi> The 10. Tribes universally understood, and peculiarly meant by the name or notion of <hi>Israel,</hi> when distinct from <hi>Iudah,</hi> as in that prophesy it is) Why may we not at least <hi>conjecture,</hi> that God by a special finger pointed out that text to be first openned, which immediately concerned the persons to whom it was preached: Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if (as some credibly affirme) that the <hi>Iewes of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> (being intreated thereunto) <hi>informe that after much inquiry they found some of the ten Tribes to be in America.</hi> When our Lord came to <hi>Nazaret,</hi> and standing up to read: Its said there was delivered unto him the book of <hi>Isaias,</hi> and he openned the book, and found it written, <hi>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, &amp;c.</hi> The bringing of that Scripture to our Lords hands so providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, was a hint (at least) that the present hearers were in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner concerned in that prophesie. What ever may be in this observation (which I humbly offer to the <hi>searching thoughts of judicious persons)</hi> I am much inclined to conjecture, that there is a sprinkling at least of <hi>Abrahams seed</hi> in these parts, The reasons of my inclination hereunto are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They have (at least) a traditionall knowledge of God, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heaven and earth.</hi> Its true, they talk of other Gods; but yet they hold that the chief God is he, <hi>who made all things.</hi> Which agnition of God, was peculiar to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Hence it was, that when they were Captives in <hi>Babylon:</hi> this was that <hi>Character,</hi> by which they were taught to distinguish the true God (which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew not) that he was the <hi>Maker of all things,</hi> Jer. 10. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65159:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. <hi>What ever they attribute unto others, this they peculiarly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto this God,</hi> viz. <hi>that all things both good and evill, are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his Providence,</hi> and if they doe but hurt themselves, they say 'tis a note of Gods displeasure: Hence</p>
            <p n="3">3. Before ever any of them received any instruction from our <hi>English,</hi> by tradition they were taught, and did <hi>upon observation of a bad year, or other ill successe, meet and weep as unto God; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it to be his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd of displeasure upon them: And on the other side, upon a good year, or good successe in any businesse, as of War, &amp;c. they used to meet and make a kind of acknowledgement of thanks to God</hi> for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is very observable; that they are <hi>carefull to preserve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their Families, mentioning Unckles, Grand-Fathers, and Grand-mothers,</hi> &amp;c. and much studying the advancing of their houses and kindred. A thing which hath a great tang of, and affinitie to the <hi>Iewes</hi> care of preserving the memoriall of their <hi>Tribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Those of them who have been wrought upon, tell of <hi>some face of Religion, Wisedom, and manners which long agoe</hi> their Ancestors had, but that it was lost.</p>
            <p n="6">6. (To omit other grounds of this conjecture.) The <hi>better and more sober sort of them, delight much to expresse themselves in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>  *<note place="margin">See pag. 5.</note> A thing peculiar to the Jewes, as those who read their writings, or consider Christs manner of expressing himself, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see.</p>
            <p>These and the like considerations prevaile with me to entertain (at least) a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> that these <hi>Indians in America,</hi> may be <hi>Iewes</hi> (especially of the ten Tribes.) And therefore to hope that the work of Christ among them, may be as a preparatory to his own appearing.</p>
            <p>If these reasons prevaile not with thee (Reader) to give quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my conjecture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> yet I cannot but perswade my self, that the former Letters soberly &amp; duly weighed, will cause thee to subscribe with me to this conclusion, that, <hi>the work of God among the Indians in America, is glorious, and to be admired by all those, who look after and rejoyce in the appearance of our Lord Iesus,</hi> Surely the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> is risen, with <hi>healirg vertue under his wings,</hi> upon those poor hearts, who sate <hi>in darknesse, and the shadow of death.</hi> And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65159:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these godly persons who fled into <hi>America</hi> for shelter from <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall persecution,</hi> doe now appeare to be carried there by a sacred and sweet providence of Christ, to make known his name to those poor soules, who have been <hi>Captives to Satan</hi> these many Ages. The Christians when scattered abroad, went to and fro preaching the word. And I wish from my soul, that all these <hi>Ministers of the Dispertion</hi> (as I may call them) in <hi>New-England;</hi> would stirre up themselves to this work of the Lord, which (now it seems) he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in his carrying of them thither. Surely these tydings as they are <hi>grounds of rejoycing</hi> to others a far off; so they should be much more <hi>incouragements of putting to the hand</hi> of such as are there unto this harvest of the Lord. And so much the rather, because the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in its advancement amongst these <hi>Western Indians,</hi> appeares to be <hi>not in word only</hi> (as it was by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> among their Indians) <hi>but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance:</hi> Doe not these true reports shew <hi>what manner of entrance the Gospel hath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.</note> 
               <hi>among them: and how they turn unto God from Idels</hi> (from their <hi>paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wawes)</hi> to serve the <hi>living and true God,</hi> and to <hi>look for his sonne</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> *<note place="margin">See the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans speech pag. 7.</note> &amp;c. </p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Reader)</hi> I intreat thee to beare with me, if in <hi>Commenting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this work of</hi> God, I offer a few notes to declare that in truth this work of God is not only in the <hi>Letter,</hi> but in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and power of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> These things I note (and pray doe thou) to <note place="margin">Observation.</note> this purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The questions which are moved by the Indians comming and come in, are such as are of great and weighty concernment; And such as indeed evince a more then common working of the spirit by the word on them. Such are those that concerne <hi>spirituall joyning in prayer,</hi> and a <hi>knowledge of Gods acceptation thereof.</hi> Those questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also that relate to the <hi>marrying of the godly with the wicked:</hi> (much like that of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.) and those that concern the <hi>evill of thoughts and dreames,</hi> &amp;c. See and consider the Questions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The full casting off their <hi>Pawwaws;</hi> and not seeking to them: Although they much idolized them, and albeit they know not as yet, any meanes of help when sick, but them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their sweet and affectionate melting under the word of grace: and their exceeding hungring and thirsting after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65159:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereof. Together with enquiry after <hi>Syon,</hi> and their great joy they declare in their hopes thereof. <note place="margin">Vide pag. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Lastly, and especially the reall and undenyable evidences of the work of grace in power upon some particular persons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: and particular that of the <hi>woman</hi> in whom I cannot but note these things</p>
            <p n="1">1. Her desire to live by the ordinance of the word, although <note place="margin">pag. 6, 7.</note> with great trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Her Exemplarines of life, after the Lord did work upon her.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Her resolutions to love God, <hi>though he made her sick.</hi> Oh! <hi>could she love God, except he loved her first?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Her belief that God was well pleased with her in Christ, and hereupon her willingnesse to dye, in assurance of going to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Her care of her Children upon her first knowing of God: and her charging them not to live with their kindred, pressing it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this, that <hi>they prayed not,</hi> and that they <hi>committed sin, and were not punished:</hi> Oh holy and high attainment! to see an <hi>evlil in sinning and not being punished.</hi> This was the great evill threatned. <hi>Hosea</hi> 9. 14.</p>
            <p>What doe all these things declare? but this: That Christ hath made the <hi>day of his power</hi> to arise upon those poor soules: In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Application.</note> them <hi>a willing people:</hi> And what improvement should we make of this comment upon the work of the Lord, if not this or the like;</p>
            <p>First, To study and search into the works of the Lord, to see how he counterplots the enemy in his designes: In making the late Bishops persecuting of the Godly tend to the promoting of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To take heed of dispising the <hi>day of small things.</hi> It being Gods way to lay most glorious workes upon little and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable foundations: And to advance the Treasury of the Gospel in earthen vessels, even to the ends of the Earth,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To be ashamed of, and bewaile our want of affection to, and estimation of that glorious Gospel, and those great things of Christ: which these poor Heathens upon the little Glymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and tasts so exceedingly value and improve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65159:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fourthly: Doth not the observation of the preceeding reports, clearly confirme the <hi>Doctrine of the Sabboth,</hi> and the <hi>practise of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> Oh tremble ye <hi>Sabboth-slighters,</hi> and <hi>duty-dispisers,</hi> Christ hath witnesses against you in <hi>America!</hi> Be ashamed ye pretended-<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>fathers</hi> in Christ for comming short of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Children!</hi> In truth the very light of Nature will condemne you. Prayer in all ages (and that not mentall, but verball, and expresse) hath been that by which the <hi>Deity</hi> hath been <hi>agnized</hi> and worshipped. The <hi>converted Heathens</hi> in <hi>New-Eng and,</hi> goe beyond you, O ye <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Christians</hi> in <hi>England!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, be incouraged to put to your helping hand unto the work of the Lord. And to that end,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arise ye heads of our Tribes in Old England,</hi> and extend your help to further Christs labourers in <hi>N.-England.</hi> Rather ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l from your sleep an houre, then suffer that good Ordinance to lye asleep so long; which if drawn into an Act, will exceedingly further this blessed work. Surely if you were petitioned to in the name of Christ, and his Gospel, to give money out of your own purse to exalt him in furthering it. Durst you deny it? How much lesse can you deny the passing of an Act to enable some to receive and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose what others would gladly give. The work is so clear, that you need not many houres to debate it: And I hope you are so willing that I shall not need more words to presse it, only let me add this that as Ministers, so Statists do finde personall examples, the most powerfull motives to practick doctrines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rouze up your selves my Brethren; ye Preachers of the Gospel,</hi> this work concernes you. Contrive and plot, preach for, and presse the advancement hereof. Its cleare you may do much: Let not this be your condemnation, that you did nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Come forth ye Masters of money,</hi> part with your Gold to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Gospel; Let the gift of God in temporal things make way, for the Indians receipt of spiritualls. If you give any thing <hi>yearly,</hi> remember Christ will be yout <hi>Pensioner.</hi> If you give any thing into <hi>banke,</hi> Christ will keep <hi>account</hi> thereof, and reward it. You hear of what things are necessary in order to the advancement of that one <hi>thing necessary.</hi> Rest assured of this, what ever you give will be well and wisely improved. And as far as the Gospel is mediately advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by your money, be sure you will be remembred.</p>
