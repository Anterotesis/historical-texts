         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHORS APOLOGY TO THE <hi>READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THeſe poor trifles (courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader) had not now become ſo troubleſome to the World, if it had been in my
<pb facs="tcp:61350:3"/>
power to have prevented them: for at my going once out of <hi>London,</hi> I left them with a friend of mine, who dying, they were diſperſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers hands. Mr. <hi>William God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> got my <hi>Obſtinate Lady,</hi> and though he found it with the laſt leaf torn out, wherein my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the play with the Epilogue were; he procured ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his to ſupply the defect at the end, and ſo Printed it. And though that Comedy, be very much of it writ in number, he put it forth as if the moſt part of it were proſe. Here you have that defect much amended, and my own concluſion and Epilogue added. I was fearful my <hi>Trappolin,</hi> and other Poems ſhould have run the like
<pb facs="tcp:61350:3"/>
misfortune; and therefore made a diligent enquiry after them, and when I had found them out could not get them delivered without parting with ſome money, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing my honeſt friend Mr. <hi>W. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,</hi> (after I had afforded them ſome ſmall correction) I would beſtow them on him, (with my conſent) for the Preſs: For indeed without his (aſſiſtance) I ſhould not have recovered them out of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hands whom I will forbear to name. I hope there is nothing in the whole ſo amorous as to arrive at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, yet nevertheleſs could I have imagined them worthy the trouble of tranſcription, you will find many things here that had been omitted. After this general Apologie I muſt
<pb facs="tcp:61350:4"/>
alſo make my excuſe for ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular pieces. I have been demanded by ſome Perſons of Quality and judgement, why in my copy of Verſes before Mr. <hi>Fletchers</hi> volume of Plaies, I chiefly reflect upon the <hi>Mad Lover,</hi> my noble friend and kinſman Mr. <hi>Charles Cotton,</hi> ſent me that ſingle Play in a Manuſcript, which I had divers years in my hands: therefore when I found the Players were prohibited to act, I writ thoſe poor Verſes with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to have had the <hi>Mad Lover</hi> printed ſingle, and them to have waited on it; (which when the large Volume came forth) my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Cotton</hi> commanded from me, and gave the Printers. Next, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I have been merry with
<pb facs="tcp:61350:4"/>
Mr. <hi>James Strong</hi> and his pretty Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. But ſeeing many thus make as bold with him, I preſumed I might take the ſame liberty. I muſt only requeſt the chaſtwomen of <hi>Lin,</hi> to take no offence at theſe Verſes, I intended them none; if there be any of diſſolute life in that town, let thoſe be accounted of as his <hi>Joanes</hi> and no other: I hope <hi>James Strong</hi> is of <hi>Coriats</hi> gentle diſpoſition, and will endure jeſting with, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (at his leiſure) he hath my leave to be as pleaſant with me. Some few things that I tranſlated out of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> I have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, as accounting them too wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to breath in this chaſter clime: and in truth if any body (either through curioſity, or by any other
<pb facs="tcp:61350:5"/>
accident) ſhould engliſh any ſuch pieces, it will be eſteemed a diſcretion in them to forbear pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I have made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs into a Play, to be called the Tragedy of <hi>Ovid,</hi> which (if my <hi>Obstinate Lady,</hi> and <hi>Trappolin</hi> take) I may be encouraged to perfect, and preſent to you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, with ſome other things that are not yet put into method, fit for the Preſs, if you be not cloid with theſe ſmall Poems already, and hate a farther ſurfeit upon ſuch toyes: If this book hath the fortune to attain to a ſecond impreſſion, you may then hear farther from me: and in the

                        <p>I will tell you Lady. When I was bound thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I was in <hi>Aſia</hi> at <hi>Taxcallau;</hi> there we took ſhip, and in a pair of Oares ſailed to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Catholique Kings Court.
