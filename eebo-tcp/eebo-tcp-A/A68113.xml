            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the time of king Henrie the fourth, as our Engliſh Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles haue kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, liued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe ſturdie and looſe companions in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places about the Citie of London, who gaue themſelues to no good courſe of life, but becauſe the time was ſomewhat troubleſome, watched diligently, when by the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mutinie offered, they might praie vppon the goods of honeſt Citizens, and ſo by their ſpoyle inrich themſelues. At that time liued likewiſe a worthie Gentleman, whoſe many verie famous deeds (wherof I
<pb facs="tcp:6154:3"/>
am ſorie I may here make no rehearſal, becauſe neither time nor occaſion will permitte me) renowne his name to all enſuing poſterities: he, being called ſir <hi>Richard Whittington,</hi> the founder of Whittington Colledge in London, and one that bare the office of Lord Maior of this Citie three ſeuerall times. This worthie man wel noting the dangerous diſpoſition of that idle kinde of people, tooke ſuch good and diſcreete order (after hee had ſent diuers of them to ſerue in the kings warres, and they loath to doe ſo well returned to their former vomite) that in no place of or about London they might haue lodging, or entertainment, except they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelues to ſuch honeſt trades and exerciſes, as might witneſſe their maintaining was by true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meanes. If any to the contrarie were founde, they were in iuſtice ſo ſharply proceeded againſt, as the most hurtfull and dangerous enemies to the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>In this quiet and moſt bliſſefull time of peace, when all men (in courſe of life) ſhould ſhew themſelues moſt thankfull for ſo great a benefit, this famous citie is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with the like, or rather worſe kinde of people, that beare outward ſhew of ciuill, honeſt, and gentleman like diſpoſition, but in very deed their behauiour is moſt infamous to be ſpoken of. And as now by their cloſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies they cheate, coſen, prig, lift, nippe, and ſuch like tricks now vſed in their <hi>Conie-catching</hi> Trade, to the hurt and vndoing of many an honeſt Citizen, and other: So if God ſhould in iuſtice be angrie with vs, as our wickedneſſe hath well deſerued, and (as the Lorde forfend) our peace ſhould be moleſted as in former time,
<pb facs="tcp:6154:3"/>
euen as they did, ſo will theſe be the firſt in ſeeking do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſpoile and ruine: yea ſo they may haue it, it skilles not how they come by it. God raiſe ſuch another as was worthie <hi>Whittington,</hi> that in time may bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the headſtrong courſe of this helliſh crew, and force them liue as becommeth honeſt ſubiects, or els to abide the rewarde of their looſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>By reading this little tratiſe enſuing, you ſhall ſee to what marueilous ſubtil pollicies theſe deceiuers haue atteyned, and how daylie they practiſe ſtrange driftes for their purpoſe. I ſay no more, but if all theſe forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings may be regarded, to the benefit of the well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and iust controll of theſe careleſſe wretches, it is all I deſire, and no more then I hope to ſee.</p>

            <head>The third and laſt part of Conny-catching with the new deuiſed knauiſh Arte of Fooletaking.</head>
            <p>BEing by chance inuited to ſupper, where were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diuers, both of worſhip and good accompt, as occaſion ſerued for entercourſe of talke, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treacheries and wicked deuiſes of the world was called in queſtion. Amongſt other moſt hatefull and wel worthie reprehenſion, the woondrous villanies of looſe and lewde perſons, that beare the ſhape of men, yet are monſters in condition, was ſpecially remembred, and not onely they, but their complices, their confederates, their baſe natured women and cloſe compacters were noted: Namely, ſuch as tearme themſelues Conny-catchers, Croſſe-biters, with their appertaining names to their ſeuerall cooſening qualities, as already is made knowne to the world, by two ſeuerall imprinted books, by meanes wherof, the preſent kinde of conference was occaſioned. Quoth a Gentleman ſitting at the Table, whoſe déepe ſtep into age deciphered his experience, and whoſe grauitie in ſpéeche reported his diſcretion, quoth hee, by the two publiſhed bookes of Cony-catching: I haue ſeene diuers thinges whereof I was before igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, notwithſtanding had I béene acquainted with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he author: I could haue giuen him ſuch notes of notorious matters that way intending, as in neither of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets are the like ſet downe. Beſide, they are ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be knowne, as they will both forearme any man againſt ſuch trecherous vipers, and forewarne the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler ſort from conuerſing with them. The Gentleman being knowne to be within commiſſion of the peace, and that what he ſpake of either came to him by examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:6154:5"/>
or by riding in the circuits as other like officers do: was intreated by one man aboue the reſt (as his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſerued him) to acquaint him with thoſe notes, and he would ſo bring it to paſſe, as the writer of the other two bookes, ſhould haue the ſight of them, and if theyr quantitie would ſerue, that he ſhould publiſh them as a third, and more neceſſary part then the former were. The Gentleman replied al ſuch notes as I ſpeake, are not of mine owne knowledge, yet from ſuch men haue I receiued them, as I dare aſſure their truth: and but that by naming men wronged by ſuch mates, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure would enſue then were expedient, I could ſet downe both time, place, and parties. But the certaintie ſhal ſuffice without any ſuch offence. As for ſuch as ſhal ſée their iniuries diſcouered, and (biting the lip) ſay to themſelues, thus was I made a Conny: their names being ſhadowed, they haue no cauſe of anger, in that the example of their honeſt ſimplicitie beguiled, may ſhield a number more endangered from taſting the like. And ſéeing you haue promiſed to make them knowne to the author of the former two Bookes, you ſhall the ſooner obtaine your requeſt: aſſuring him thus much vpon my credit &amp; honeſtie, that no one vntrueth is in the notes, but euerie one credible, and to be iuſtified if néed ſerue. Within a fortnight or thereabout afterward, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman performed his promiſe, in ſeuerall papers ſent the notes, which here are in our book compiled together when thou haſt read, ſay, if euer thou heardeſt more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table villanies diſcouered. And if thou or thy friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any good by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it cannot be but they wil make a number more carefull of themſelues: thanke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman for his notes, and the writer that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed both the other and theſe, for generall example.</p>

               <p>Not long ſince, a crew of Conny-catchers méeting togither, and in conference laying downe ſuch courſes as they ſeuerally ſhould take, to ſhunne ſuſpect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne a common benefit among them: the Carders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their charge, the Dicers theirs, the hangers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the court theirs, the followers of Sermons theirs and ſo the reſt to their offices. But one of them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, who at their woonted méetings, when reporte was made howe euery purchaſe was gotten, and by what pollycie each one preuailed: this fellowe in a kinde of priding ſcorne, would vſually ſay.</p>
               <p>In faithe Maiſters theſe thinges are prettily done, common ſleyghts, expreſſing no deepe reache of witte, and I woonder men are ſo ſimple to bee ſo beguiled. I would fayne ſee ſome rare and artificiall feate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that ſome admiration and fame might inſue the dooing thereof: I promiſe yee, I diſdayne theſe baſe and pettie paltries, and may my fortune iumpe with my reſolution, yee ſhall heare my boyes with
<pb facs="tcp:6154:6"/>
in a day or two, that I will accompliſh a rare ſtratagem indéed, of more value then fortie of yours, and when it is done ſhall carry ſome credit with it. They wondring at this wordes, deſired to ſée the ſucceſſe of them, &amp; ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing themſelues as they were accuſtomed, left this frollicke fellow pondering on his affaires. A Cittizens houſe in London, which hee had diligently eyed &amp; aymed at for a fortnights ſpace, was the place wherein he muſt performe this exploit, and hauing learned one of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant maides name of the houſe, as alſo where ſhee was borne and her kindred. Vpon a ſonday in the afternone, when it was her turne to attend on her maiſter and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres to the garden in Finſbury fields, to regard the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren while they ſported about, this craftie mate hauing dulie watched their comming forth, and ſéeing that they intended to goe downe S. Laurence lane, ſtepped before them, euer caſting an eye back, leaſt they ſhould turne ſome contrarie way: but their following ſtill fitting his owne deſire, néere vnto the Conduit in Aldermanbury, he croſſed the way and came vnto the maid, and kiſſing her ſayd. Cooſen Margeret, I am verye glad to ſée you well, my vnckle your father, and all your friends in the Countrey are in good health God be praiſed. The Maide hearing herſelfe named, and not knowing the man, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly bluſhed, which hee perceiuing, held way on with her amongſt her fellow apprentiſes, and thus began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. I ſée Cooſen you knowe mee not, and I doe not greatlie blame you, it is ſo long ſince you came foorth of the Countrey, but I am ſuch a ones ſonne, naming her Vncle right, and his ſonnes name, which ſhe very well remembred, but had not ſeene him in eleuen yeares. Then taking foorth a bowed groat, and an olde pennie bowed, he gaue it her as being ſent from her Vncle and
<pb facs="tcp:6154:6"/>
Aunt, whome hee tearmed to bee his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Withall (quoth he) I haue a Gammon of bacon and a Chéeſe from my Vncle your Father, which are ſent to your Maiſter and Miſtreſſe, which I receiued of the Carrier, becauſe my Vncle enioynde me to deliuer them, when I muſt intreat your miſtres, that at Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide next ſhée will giue you leaue to come downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey. The Maide thinking ſimplie all hee ſaid was true, and as they ſo farre from their parents, are not onely glad to heare of their welfare, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to ſée any of their kindred: ſo this poore Maid, wel knowing her Vncle had a ſonne ſo named as he called himſelf, and thinking from a boy (as he was at her lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Countrey) he was now growne ſuch a proper handſome young man, was not a little ioyful to ſée him: beſide, ſhée ſéemed proud, that her kinſman was ſo neat a youth, and ſo ſhee held on queſtioning with him about her friends: hee ſoothing each matter ſo cunningly, as the maide was confidently perſwaded of him. In this time, one of the children ſtepped to her mother and ſaid, Our Marget (mother) hath a fine cooſen come out of the Country, and he hath a Chéeſe for my Father and you: whereon ſhée looking backe, ſaid: Maide, is that your kinſman? yes forſooth miſtreſſe quoth ſhee, my Vncles ſonne, whome I left a little one when I came foorth of the countrey.</p>
               <p>The wilye Treacher, béeing maiſter of his trade, would not let ſlippe this opportunitie, but courteouſlie ſtepping to the Miſtreſſe (who louing her maid wel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indéed ſhée had been a very good ſeruant, and from her firſt comming to London had dwelt with her, tould her huſband therof) coyned ſuch a ſmooth tale vnto them both, fronting it with the Gammon of Bacon and the
<pb facs="tcp:6154:7"/>
Chéeſe ſent from their maides Father, and hoping they would giue her leaue at Whitſontide to viſit the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as they with verie kinde words entertained him, inuiting him the next night to ſupper, when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bring with him the Gammon of Bacon and the Chéeſe. Then framing an excuſe of certaine buſines in the town, for that time he tooke his leaue of the Maiſter and Miſtreſſe, and his new Coſen Margaret, who gaue many a looke after him (poore wench) as he went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ioying in her thoughts to haue ſuch a kinſman.</p>
               <p>On the morrow hee prepared a good Gammon of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, which he cloſed vp in a ſoiled linnen cloth, and ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an old card vpon it, whereon he wrote a ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the Maiſter of the Maide, and at what ſigne it was to be deliuered, and afterward ſcraped ſome of the letters halfe out, that it might ſéeme they had bin rubd out in the carriage. A good Chéeſe he prepared likewiſe, with inſcription accordingly on it, that it could not be diſcerned, but that ſome vnſkilfull writer in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had done it, both by the groſſe proportion of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as alſo the bad ortographie which amongſt plaine huſbandmen is verie common, in that they haue no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtruction. So hiring à Porter to carrie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene fiue and ſixe in the euening he comes to the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens houſe, and entring the ſhop, receiues them of the Porter, whome the honeſt meaning Cittizen would haue paid for his pains, but this his maids new-found Coſen ſayd hee was ſatiſfied alreadie, and ſo ſtraining courteſie would not permit him: well, vp are carried the Bacon and the Chéeſe, where God knowes, Margaret was not a little buſie, to haue al things fine and neat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Coſens comming vp, her miſtreſſe likewiſe, (as one well affecting her ſeruant) had prouided verie

The maiſter of the houſe, to delay the time while Supper was readye, hee likewiſe ſhewes this diſſembler his ſhop, who ſéeing things fadge ſo pat to his purpoſe, could queſtion of this ſort, and that well enough I warrant you, to diſcern the beſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worſt and their appointed places, purpoſing a further reache then the honeſt Cittizen dreamed of: and to bee plaine with ye, ſuch was this occupiers trade, as though I may not name it, yet thus much I dare vtter, that the worſt thing he could carry away, was aboue twentie nobles, becauſe hee dealt altogeather in whole and great ſale, which made this companion forge this kindred and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, for an hundred pound or twaine was the very leaſt hee aimed at. At length the miſtreſſe ſendes word ſupper is on the Table, where vpon vp hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts his gueſt, and after diuers welcomes, as alſo thankes for the Chéeſe and Bacon: To the Table they ſit, where let it ſuffice, hée wanted no ordinarie good fare, wine and other knackes, beſide much talke of the Countrey, how much his friends were beholding for his Coſen Margaret, to whome by her miſtreſſe leaue hée dranke twiſe or thriſe, and ſhée poore ſoule dooing the like againe to him with remembrance of her father and other kindred, which he ſtil ſmoothed very cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Countenance of talke made them careles of the time which ſlipped from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faſter then they were aware of, nor did the deceiuer haſten his departing, becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb facs="tcp:6154:8"/>
what indéed followed, which was, that being paſt tenne of the clocke, and he feigning his lodging to be at Saint Gyles in the field, was intreated both by the goodman and his wife to take a bed there for that night, for faſhion ſake (though very glad of this offer) hee ſaid he would not troble them, but giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many thanks, would to his lodging though it were further. But won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull it was to ſee how earneſt the honeſt Citizen and his wife laboured to perſwade him, that was more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtaye then they could bee to bid him, and what diſſembled willingneſſe of departure hee vſed on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to couer the ſecret villanie intended. Well, at the length with much ado, he is contented to ſtay, when Margaret and her Miſtreſſe preſently ſtirred ſo make ready his bed, which the more to the honeſt mans hard hap, but all the better for this artificial Conny-catcher, was in the ſame roome where they ſupped, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called their hall, and there indeed ſtood a verie faire bed, as in ſuch ſightly roumes it may eaſily bee thought, Citizens vſe not to haue any thing meane or ſimple. The miſtreſſe, leaſt her gueſt ſhould imagine ſhe diſturbed him, ſuffered all the plate to ſtand ſtill on the cupbord: and when ſhe perceiued his bed was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and euery thing els according to her mind, ſhe and her huſband bidding him good night: tooke themſelues to their chamber, which was on the ſame floore but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hauing another chamber betwéene them and the hall, where the maides and children had their lodging. So deſiring him to call for any thing hee wanted, and charging Margaret to looke it ſhould bee ſo, to bed are they gone: when the Apprentiſes hauing brought vp the keyes of the ſtréet dore, &amp; left them in their maiſters chamber as they were woont to do, after they had ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:6154:8"/>
praiers, their euening exerciſe, to bed go they likewiſe, which was in a Garret backward ouer their maiſters chamber. None are nowe vp but poore Margaret and her counterfeit cooſen, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe loth to offend with long talke, becauſe it waxed late: after ſome few more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, about their parents and friends in the countrey, ſhe ſéeing him laid in bed, and all ſuch thinges by him as ſhe déemed needfull, with a low courteſie I warrant ye, commits him to his quiet, and ſo went to bed to her fellowes the maidſeruants. Well did this hypocrite perceiue the keyes of the doores carried into the good mans chamber, wherof he being not a litle glad, thoght now they would imagine all things ſure, and therfore doutleſſe ſleep the ſounder: as for the keyes, he needed no helpe of them, becauſe ſuch as hee go neuer vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of inſtruments fitting their trade, &amp; ſo at this time was this notable trecher. In the dead time of the night when ſound ſleepe makes the eare vnapt to heare the verie leaſt noyſe, he forſaketh his bed, &amp; hauing gotten al the plate bound vp togither in his cloke, goeth down into the ſhop, where well remembring both the place &amp; percels, maketh vp his pack with ſome twenty pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds worth of goods more. Then ſetling to his engin, he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the doore off the hindges, and being foorth, lifteth cloſe to againe, and ſo departs, méeting with in a doozen paces, thrée or foure of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions that lurked ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts for the purpoſe. Their word for knowing each other, as is ſaid, was <hi>Queſt,</hi> and this villains comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble newes to them, was <hi>Twag,</hi> ſignifiyng hee had ſped: ech takes a fleece for eaſier carriage, and ſo away to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brow,</hi> which as I haue heard is as they interpret it, the houſe of a théefe receiuer, without which they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and this houſe with an apt porter to it, ſtandes

ready for them al houres of the night: too many ſuch are there in London, the maiſters whereof beare counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of honeſt ſubſtantiall men, but all their liuing is gotten in this order, the end of ſuch (though they ſcape awhile) will be ſailing weſtward in a Cart to Tiborn. Imagine theſe villanies there in their iollitie, the one porting point by point his cunning deceipt, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (fitting his humour) extolling the déede with no meane commendations. But returning to the honeſt Citizen, who finding in the morning how déerly he paid for a gammon of bacon, and a chéeſe, and how his kinde courteſie was thus trecherouſlye requited: blames the poore maide, as innocent herein as himſelfe, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning her, thinking ſo to regaine his owne: griefe with ill cheriſhing there ſhortens her life: And thus enſueth one hard hap vpon another, to the great griefe both of maiſter and miſtreſſe, when the trueth was knowne, that they ſo wronged their honeſt ſeruant: how it may forewarne others, I leaue to your owne opinions, that ſée what extraordinarie deuiſes are now adayes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the ſimple and honeſt liberall minded.</p>

               <p>The poore man, not ſo wiſe as to remember his owne purſe, when by ſuch a warning hee might haue taken the offendour dooing the déede, but rather proud (as it were) that his money was ſo eaſily earned: walkes to the Alehouſe, which was within a houſe or two of his owne, and finding there thrée or foure of his neighbors with whom he began to ieſt very pleaſantly: ſweares by cocke and pie hee would ſpend a whole groat vppon them, for hee had gotten it and more, cléerely by a good bargaine that morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Good fellow that was newly entered into the nipping craft, and had not as yet attained to any acquaintance with the chiefe and cunning mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that trade: In the Chriſtmas holy-dayes laſt, came to ſee a playe at the Bull within Biſhops gate, there to take his benefit as time and place would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him. Not long had hee ſtayed in the preaſe, but hee had gotten a yoong mans purſe out of his pocket, which when he had, hee ſtepped into the ſtable to take out the money, and to conuey away the purſe. But looking on his commoditie, hee founde nothing therein but white counters, a thimble and a broken three pence, which belike the fellowe that ought it, had doone of purpoſe to deceiue the cutpurſe withall, or elſe had plaide at the Cardes for counters, and ſo carried his winnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him till his next ſitting to playe. Somewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to be ſo ouertaken, he looked aſide, and ſpied a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie youth entring at the doore, and his drab with him: this fellow he had heard to bee one of the fineſt Nippers about the towne, and euer caried his queane with him, for conueiance when the ſtratagem was performed: he puts vp the counters into the purſe againe, and follows cloſe to ſee ſome peece of their ſeruice. Among a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſeemely men was this luſtie companion and his minion gotten, where both they might beſt beholde the playe, and worke for aduantage, and euer this young Nip was next to him, to marke when he ſhould attempt any exployte, ſtanding as it were more then halfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the cunning Nip and his drab, onely to learne

                  <hi>A</hi> Gentleman of the countrey, who (as I haue herd ſince the time of his miſhap, whereof I am now to ſpeake) had about halfe a yeere before buryed his wife, and belike thinking wel of ſome other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, whom hee ment to make account of as his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond choiſe: vpon good hope or otherwiſe perſwaded,
<pb facs="tcp:6154:16"/>
he came vp to London to prouide himſelfe of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as the Countrey is not vſually ſtored with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Beſides, ſilkes, veluets, cambrickes and ſuch like, he bought a Chaine of Golde that coſt him fiftie and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen pounds and odde money, whereof becauſe he would haue the mayden head or firſt wearing himſelfe, hee preſently put it on in the Goldſmiths ſhop, and ſo wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked therewith about London, as his occaſions ſerued. But let not the Gentleman bee offended, who if this Booke come to his handes, can beſt auouch the trueth of this diſcourſe, if heere by the waye I blame his raſh pride, or ſimple credulitie: for betwéene the one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Chaine hee paide ſo déere for about ten of the clock in the morning, the Cunny catchers the ſame day ere night ſhared amongſt them, a matter whereat hee may well gréeue, and I be ſorie, in reſpect hee is my very good friend: but to the purpoſe. This Gentleman walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Paules, with his Chaine faire glittering about his necke, talking with his man about ſome buſineſſe: was well viewed and regarded by a crewe of Conny-catchers, whoſe téeth watred at his goodly Chaine, yet knew not how to come by it hanging as it did, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entred into ſecret conſpiration among themſelues, if they could not come by all the Chaine, yet how they might make it lighter by halfe a ſcore poundes at the leaſt. Still had they their eyes on the honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who little doubted any ſuch treaſon intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſo late bought bargaine: and they hauing laid their plot, ech one to be aſſiſtant in this enterpriſe, ſaw when the Gentleman diſmiſſed his ſeruant, to go about ſuch affaires as hee had appointed him, himſelfe ſtill walking there vp and downe the middle Iſle. One of theſe mates, that ſtood moſt on his cunning in theſe
<pb facs="tcp:6154:17"/>
exploytes, folowed the ſeruing man foorth of the Church calling him by diuers names, as Iohn, Thomas, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, &amp;c. as though he had knowne his right name, but could not hit on it: which whether he did or no I know not, but wel I wot the ſeruing man turned back again, and ſeeing him that called him ſéemed a Gentleman, boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cloaked after the neweſt faſhion, came with his hat in his hand to him, ſaying: Sir, do ye call me? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doe I my fréend quoth the other, dooſt not thou ſerue ſuch a Gentleman? and named one as himſelfe pleaſed. No truely Sir, anſwered the ſeruingman, I know not any ſuch Gentleman as you ſpeake of. By my troth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed thr Conny-catcher, I am aſſured I knew thée and thy Maiſter, though now I cannot ſuddenly remember my ſelfe. The ſeruingman fearing no harme, yet fitting the humour of this trecherous companion, tolde right his Maſters name whome he ſerued, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was euen then walking in Paules. O Gods will (quoth the Cony-catcher, repeating his maſters name) a very honeſt Gentleman, of ſuch a place is he not? na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a ſhire of the Country: for hee muſt knowe both name, Country and ſomtimes what Gentlemen dwell neere the partie that is to bee ouer reached, ere hee can procéed. No in deede Sir (anſwered the ſeruingman, with ſuch reuerence as it had béene to an honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman indéed) my Maſter is of ſuch a place, a mile from ſuch a Towne, and heard by ſuch a knights houſe: by which report the deceiuer was halfe inſtructed, becauſe though he was ignorant of the fellows Maſter, yet wel he knew the Country, and the knight named. So cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon that he had miſtaken him, he returnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Church, and the ſeruingman trudgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his aſſigned buſines. Being come to the reſt of
<pb facs="tcp:6154:17"/>
the crew, he appointes one of them (whome he knew to be expert in deed) to take this matter in hand, for him ſelf might not do it, leaſt the ſeruingman ſhould return and know him, he ſchooled the reſt likewiſe what euery man ſhould do when the pinch came, and changing his cloke with one of his fellowes, walked by himſelfe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the feate: and euery one being as ready, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed fellow makes his ſally foorth, and comming to the Gentleman, calling him by his name, giues him the courteſie and embrace, likewiſe thanking him for good chéere he had at his houſe, which he did with ſuch ſéemly behauiour &amp; proteſtation, as the Gentleman (thinking the other to be no leſſe) vſed like action of kindeneſſe to him. Now as Country Gentlemen haue many viſiters both with neere dwelling neighbours, and freends that iourney from farre, whom they can hardly remember, but ſome principall one that ſerues as countenance to the other: ſo hee not diſcrediting the cunning mates words, who ſtill at euery point alleaged his kinred to the knight neighbor to the Gentleman, which the poore ſeruing man had (doubting no ill) reuealed before, and that both there and at his owne houſe in hawking time with that knight and other Gentlemen of the countrey he had liberally taſted his kindnes: deſiring pardon that he had forgotten him, and offered him the curteſie of the citie. The Conny-catcher excuſed himſelfe for that time, ſaying, at their next meeting hee would beſtow it on him. Then ſeeming to haue eſpyed his chaine, and commending the fairenes and woorkemanſhip thereof: ſaies, I pray ye ſir take a litle counſel of a friend, it may be you will returne thankes for it.

time and place for it, and no where ſooner then in this cittie, where (I may ſay to you) are ſuch a number of Connycatchers, Coſſoners and ſuch like, that a man can ſcarcely keepe any thing from them, they haue ſo many reaches and ſleights to beguile withall: which a very eſpeciall freend of mine found too true not manye dayes ſince. Heerevpon he tolde a very ſolemne tale, of villanies and knaueries in his own profeſſion, wherby he reported his fréend had loſt a watch of gold: ſhewing how cloſely his friend wore it in his boſome, and howe ſtraungely it was gotten from him, that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by that diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urſe waxed halfe affraid of his chaine. And giuing him many thankes for his good warning, preſently takes the Chaine from about his necke, and tying it vp faſt in a handkercher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put it vp into his ſléeue ſaying. If the Conny-catcher get it héere, let him not ſpare it. Not a little did the tretcher ſmile in his ſléeue, hearing the raſhe ſecuritie, but in deede ſimplicitie of the Gentleman, and no ſooner ſawe he it put vp, but preſently he counted it ſure his owne, by the aſſiſtance of his complices, that lay in an ambuſcado for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: with embraces and courteſies on either ſide, the Conny-catcher departs, leauing the gentleman walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there ſtill: whereat the crewe were not a little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that he ſtill kept in the Church, and would not goe abroad. Well, at length (belike remembring ſome buſineſſe) the Gentleman taking leaue of an other that talked with him, haſted to go forth at the furtheſt weſt doore of Paules, which he that had talked with him, and gaue him ſuch counſell perceiuing, hied out of the other doore, and got to the entrance ere hee came foorth, the reſt following the gentleman at an inche.

aboue the reſt, in an euening about Candlemas, when day light ſhuts in about ſixe of the clocke, hee watched to doe ſome feate in the houſe, and ſéeing the miſtreſſe goe foorth with her maide, the goodman and his folkes very buſie in the ſhop: vp the ſtaires he goes as he was wonte to doo, and lifting vp the latch of the hall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall doore, ſaw no body néere to trouble him, when ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the next chamber, where the Cittizen and his wife vſually lay, at the beds féete there ſtood a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome truncke, wherein was verye good linnen, a faire gilte Salte, two ſiluer French bowles for Wine, two ſiluer drinking pots, a ſtone Iugge couered with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and a dooſen of ſiluer ſpoones. This truncke hee brings to the ſtayres head, and making faſt the doore, againe, drawes it downe the ſteppes ſo ſoftlye as hee could, for it was ſo bigge and heauy, as he could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie carry it, hauing it out at the doore, vnſéene of anye neighbour or any body elſe, he ſtood ſtrugling with it to lift it vp on the ſtall, which by reaſon of the weight tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him very much. The goodman comming foorth of his ſhop, to bid a cuſtomer or two farwell, made the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe affraide he ſhould now bee taken for all togither: but calling his wittes together to eſcape if he could, he ſtoode gazing vp at the ſigne belonging to the houſe, as though hee were deſirous to know what ſigne it was: which the Cittizen perceiuing, came to him and aſked him what he ſought for? I looke for the ſigne of the blew bell ſir, quoth the fellowe, where a gentleman hauing taken a chamber for this tearme time, hath ſent me he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this his Troncke of apparrell: quoth the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen I know no ſuch ſigne in this ſtréet, but in the next (naming it) there is ſuch a one indéed, and there dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth one that letteth foorth Chambers to Gentlemen.
<pb facs="tcp:6154:20"/>
Truely ſir quoth the fellowe, thats the houſe I ſhould goe to, I pray you ſir lend me your hand, but to help the Trunck on my back, for I thinking to eaſe me a while vpon your ſtall, ſet it ſhorte, and now I can hardly get it vp againe. The Cittizen not knowing his owne Trunke, but indeede neuer thinking on any ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deceite: helpes him vp with the Trunke, and ſo ſends him away roundly with his owne goods. When the Truncke was miſt, I leaue to your conceits what houſholde greefe there was on all ſides, eſpecially the goodman himſelfe, who remembring how he helpt the fellow vp with a Trunke, perceiued that heereby hee had beguiled himſelfe, and loſte more then in haſte hee ſhould recouer againe. Howe this may admoniſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I leaue to the iudgement of the indifferent opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſee when honeſt meaning is ſo craftily belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd, as good foreſight muſt bee vſed to preuent ſuch daungers.</p>

               <head>How a Broker was cunningly ouer-reached by as craftie a knaue as himſelfe, and brought in danger of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</head>
               <p>IT hath beene vſed as a common by-word, a craftie knaue néedeth no Broker, whereby it ſhould appeare that there can hardlie bee a craftier knaue then a Broker. Suſpend your iudgements till you haue heard this Diſcourſe enſuing, and then as you pleaſe, cenſure both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>A Ladie of the Countrie ſent vp a ſeruant whome ſhe might well put in truſt, to prouide hir of a gowne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſuch directions as ſhe had giuen him, which was of good price, as may appeare by the outſide and
<pb facs="tcp:6154:20"/>
lace, whereto doubtleſſe was euerie other thing agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for the Tayler had ſeuentéen yards of the beſt black ſatten could be got for monie, and ſo much golde lace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſpangles, as valued thirtéene pound, what elſe was beſide I know not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let it ſuffice, thus much was loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore let vs to the manner how.</p>
               <p>The ſatten and the lace being brought to the Tayler that ſhould make the gowne, and ſpread abroade on the ſhop boord to be meaſured, certaine good fellowes of the Conny-catching profeſſion chanced to go by, who ſéeing ſo rich lace, and ſo excellent good ſatten, began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with themſelues how they might make ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaſe of what they had ſéene: and quickly it was to bée done or not at al. As euer in a crew of this quality, there is ſome one more ingenious and politique then the reſt, or at leaſt wiſe that couets to make himſelfe more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous then the reſt: ſo this inſtant was there one in this companie that did ſweare his cunning ſhould deepelie deceiue him, but he would haue both the lace and ſatten, When hauing laid the plot with his companions, how and which waie their helpe might ſtand them in ſtead, this they procéeded.</p>
               <p>Well noted they the ſeruing-man that ſtood in the ſhoppe with the Tailer, and gathered by his diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, that he had ſome charge of he gowne there to be made, wherefore by him muſt they worke their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie intended, and vſe him as an inſtrument to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile himſelfe. One of them ſitting in a ſeate nere vnto the Tailers ſtall, could eaſily heare the talke that paſſed betweene the ſeruing-man and the Tayler, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other communication, it was concluded that the gowne ſhould be made of the ſelfe ſame faſhion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> euery point, as another Ladies was who then lay in the citie,
<pb facs="tcp:6154:21"/>
and that meaſure being taken by her, the ſame would fitlie ſerue the Lady for whome the gowne was to bee made: now the ſeruingman intended to go ſpeake with the Ladie, and vppon a token agreed betweene them (which he careleſlie ſpake ſo lowd, that the Conny-cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher heard it) he would as her leiſure ſerued, certifie the Tailer, and he ſhould bring the ſtuffe with him, to haue the Ladies opinion both of the one and the other.</p>
               <p>The ſeruingman being gone about his affaires, the ſubtill mate that had liſtned to all their talke, acquaints his fellows both with the determination and token ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Tailers comming to the Lady. The guide and leader to all the reſt for villany, though there was no one but was better ſkilde in ſuch matters then honeſtie: he appoints that one of them ſhould go to the tauerne, which was not farre off, &amp; laying two fagots on the fire in a roome by himſelfe, and a quarte of wine filled for countenance of the treacherie: another of that crue ſhould giue attendance on him, as if hee were his maiſter, being bare headed, and ſir humblie anſwering at euery word. To the tauern goes this counterfet gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and his ſeruant waiting on him, where euery thing was performed as is before rehearſed. When the maſter knaue calling the drawer, demanded if there dwelt neere at hand a ſkilfull Tailer, that could make a ſuite of veluet for himſelfe, marry it was to be doone with very great ſpeed.</p>
               <p>The Drawer named the Tailer that we now ſpeake of, &amp; vpon the drawers commending his cunning, the man in all haſt was ſent for to a gentleman, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt make a ſute of veluet foorthwith. Vpon talke had of the ſtuffe, how much was to be bought of euery thing appertayning thereto: he muſt immediatly take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:6154:21"/>
of this counterfet gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he knew not when to returne that waye againe, afterward they would go to the Mercers. As the Tailer was taking meaſure on him bare headed, as if he had bin a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall gentleman indéed, the craftie mate had cunningly gotten his purſſe out of his pocket, at the one ſtring whereof was faſtened a little key, and at the other his ſignet ring: This bootie he was ſure of all readie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould get any thing els or no of the miſchiefe intended, ſtepping to the window he cuts the ring from the purſſe, and by his ſuppoſed man (rounding him in the eare) ſendes it to the plot-layer of this knauerie, minding to traine the tailer along with him, as it were to the mercers, while he the meane time tooke order for the other matter. Afterward ſpeaking alowde to his man, ſirrha, quoth hee, diſpatch what I bad you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure of the clock méet me in Paules, by that time I hope the tailer and I ſhall haue diſpacht. To Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide goeth the honeſt Tailer with this notorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, not miſſing his purſſe for the ſpace of two houres after, in leſſe then halfe which time the ſatten and golde lace was gotten likewiſe by the other villain from the Taylers houſe in this order.</p>
               <p>Being ſure the Tayler ſhould bee kept abſent, hee ſends another mate home to his houſe, who abuſed his ſeruants with this deuiſe: that the ladies man had met their maſter abroad, and had him to the other Ladie to take meaſure of her, and leaſt they ſhould delaye the time too long, hee was ſent for the ſatten and lace, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the token appointed, and withall giuing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſignet ring for better confirmation of his meſſage, The ſeruants could doe no leſſe then deliuer it, being commanded (as they ſuppoſed) by ſo credible teſtimony:
<pb facs="tcp:6154:22"/>
neither did the leaſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of anie one ſerue to goe with the the meſſenger, who ſéemed an honeſt young Gentleman and carried no cauſe of diſtruſt in his countenaunce: wherefore they deliuered him the lace and ſatten folded vp together as it was, and deſired him to will their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to make ſome ſpéede home, both for cutting out of worke, and other occaſions.</p>
               <p>To a Broker fit for their purpoſe, goes this deceiuer with the ſatten lace, who knowing well they could not come honeſtly by it, nor anie thing elſe hee bought of that crew, as often before he had dealt much with them: either gaue them not ſo much as they would haue, or at leaſt as they iudged they coulde haue in another place, for which the ring-leader of this cooſnage, vowed in his mind to be reuenged on the Broker. The maſter knaue who had ſpent two houres and more in vaine with the Tailer, and would not like of anie veluet he ſaw, when he perceiued that he miſt his purſe, and could not deuiſe how or where he had loſt it, ſhewed himſelfe verie forrie for his miſhap, and ſayd in the morning he woulde ſend the veluet home to his houſe, for he knew where to ſpéed of better then anie he had ſeene in the ſhops. Home goes the Tailer verie ſadly, where he was entertained with a greater miſchance, for there was the Ladies ſeruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſwearing and ſtamping, that he had not ſéen their maſter ſince the morning they parted, neither had hee ſent for the ſatten and lace, but when the ſeruantes iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their innocencie, beguiled both with the true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rehearſed, and their maſters ring, it excéedeth my cunning to ſet downe anſwerable wordes to this excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding griefe and amazement on their part, but moſt of al the honeſt Tailer, who ſped the better by the Brokers wilfulnes, as afterward it happened, which made him
<pb facs="tcp:6154:22"/>
the better brooke the loſſe of his purſe. That night all meanes were vſed that coulde bee, both to the Mercers, brokers, goldſmiths, goldſiners, &amp; ſuch like, where hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſuch thinges doe come to bee ſolde: but all was in vaine, the onely helpe came by the inuenter of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, who ſcant ſléeping all night, in regard of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers extreme gaining, both by him and thoſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: the next morning he came to the Tailers houſe, at what time hee eſpied him with the Ladies ſeruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, comming forth of the doores, and into the tauern he went to report what a miſhap hee had vpon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for him thether the daie before.</p>
               <p>As he was but newly entered his ſadde diſcourſe, in comes the partie offended with the broker, and hauing heard all (whereof none could make better report than himſelfe) he takes the tailer and ſeruing-man aſide, and pretending great griefe for both their cauſes, demands what they would thinke him worthy of that could help them to their good againe. On condition to méete with ſuch a friend, offer was made of fiue pound, and after ſundrie ſpéeches paſſing betwéen them alone, he ſeeming that he would worke the recouerie thereof by arte, and they promiſing not to diſcloſe the man that did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, he drew forth a little booke out of his boſome, whether it was latine or engliſh it ſkilled not, for hee coulde not reade a word on it, then deſiring them to ſpare him alone a while, they ſhoulde perceiue what hee woulde doe for them. Their heartes encouraged with ſome good hope, kept all his wordes ſecret to themſelues: and not long had they ſitten abſent out of the roome, but he called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in againe, and ſéeming as though he had bene a ſcholler in déed, ſayd he found by his figure that a broker in ſuch a place had their goods loſt, and in ſuch a place of the
<pb facs="tcp:6154:23"/>
houſe they ſhould finde it, bidding them go thether with all ſpéed, and as they found his wordes, ſo (with reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to themſelues how they came to knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) to méet him there againe in the euening, and reward him as he had deſerued.</p>
               <p>Awaie in haſt goes the Tailer and the ſeruing-man, and entering the houſe with the Conſtable, found them in the place where hee that reueald it, knew the broker alwaie laid ſuch gotten goods. Of their ioy againe, I leaue you to coniecture, and thinke you ſée the broker with a good paire of bolts on his héeles, readie to take his farewell of the worlde in a halter, when time ſhall ſerue. The counterfet cunning man, and artificial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-catcher, as I heard, was paide his fiue poundes that night. Thus one craftie knaue beguiled another, let each take héed of dealing with anie ſuch kind of people.</p>
