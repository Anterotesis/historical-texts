            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

loue, which is ioined with the reuerence of ſonnes. Like as the needle or briſtle (ſo one compares it) drawes in the thred after it, or as the potion brings health. The compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction  of feare (ſaith <hi>Gregorie)</hi>

liues ſhame vs. If wee fear'd the Lord, durſt we dally with his name, durſt wee teare it in pieces? Surely we contemn his perſon, whoſe name we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne. The Iewes haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the ſinne of that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite which was ſtoned for blaſphemie, was onely this, that hee named that ineffable name of foure letters <hi>Iehouah.</hi> Shall their feare keepe them from once mentioning the dreadfull name of God, and ſhall not our feare keepe vs from abuſing it? Durſt we ſo boldly ſinne God in the face, if wee feared him? Durſt wee mocke God with a formall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27760:15"/>
flouriſh of that, which our heart tels vs wee are not, if wee feared him? Durſt wee be Chriſtians at Church, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſts at home, if we feared him? Pardon mee, if in a day of gratulation, I hardly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per my tongue from reproof; for as the Iewes had euer ſome malefactour brought forth to them in their great feaſt; ſo it ſhall bee the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt peece of our triumph and ſolemnitie, if wee can bring forth that wicked profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherewith wee haue diſhonor'd God, &amp; blemiſht his Goſpell, to bee ſcourged, and diſmiſſed with all holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27760:16"/>
From this feare, let vs paſſe as briefly, through that which we muſt dwel in all our liues, the ſeruice of God. This is the ſubiect of all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, mine ſhall but touch at it. You ſhall ſee how I haſten to that diſcourſe, which this day &amp; your expectation calls me to.</p>
            <p>Diuine Philoſophy teaches vs to referre, not onely our ſpeculations, but our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to action. As therefore our ſeruice muſt be grounded vpon <hi>feare,</hi> ſo our <hi>feare</hi> muſt be reduced to <hi>ſeruice.</hi> What ſtrength can theſe Maſculine diſpoſitions of the ſoule yeild
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27760:16"/>
vs, if with the Iſraelites brood they bee ſmoothered in the birth? Indeed the worſt kinde of <hi>feare</hi> is that we call ſeruile; but the beſt <hi>feare,</hi> is the <hi>feare</hi> of ſeruants. For there is no ſeruant of God, but feares fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lially. And againe God hath no ſonne but he ſerues. Euen the natural ſonne of God, was ſo in the forme of a ſeruant, that hee ſerued indeed; and ſo did hee ſerue that he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ſorrow, and fulfilled all righteouſneſſe. So euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a ſonne and heyre to the King of heauen, and his word muſt be, <hi>I ſerue.</hi> Wee all know what ſeruice meanes.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27760:17"/>
For wee all are, or were (I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine) either ſeruants of maiſters, or ſeruants of the publique, or maiſters of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, or all theſe. Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be ignorant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what we require of ours, or what our ſuperiors require of vs. If ſeruice conſiſted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in wearing of liueries, in taking of wages, in making of curteſies, and kiſſing of hands, there were nothing more eaſie, or more common. Al of vs weare the cognizance of our chriſtianity in our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, all liue vpon Gods trencher in our maintenance, all giue him the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27760:17"/>
of a faſhionable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But, be not deceiued, the life of ſeruice is worke; the worke of a Chriſtian is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God. The Centurion when hee would deſcribe his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in the Goſpell, needed ſay no more but this; I bid him doe this, and he doth it. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice then briefely is, nothing but a readineſſe to doe as wee are bidden; and therefore both <hi>Salomon,</hi> and he that was greater then <hi>Salomon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it by keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and the choſen veſſell giues an euerlaſting rule: <hi>His ſeruants ye are to whom</hi>

               <hi>yee obey.</hi> Now I might diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this ſeruice into habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and actuall. Habituall; for as the ſeruant, while hee eates or ſleepes, is in ſeruice ſtill; ſo are wee to God: Actuall, whether vniuerſal in the whole carriage of our liues (which <hi>Zacharie</hi> tels vs is in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, holineſſe <note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> to God, righteouſneſſe to men) or particular, either in the duties which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to GOD, Inuocation and Attendance on his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance (which by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is termed his ſeruice) or in thoſe which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to vs, as wee are peeces

of a Family, Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; the ſtations whereof GOD hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that wee may ſerue him in ſeruing one another. And thus you ſee I might make way for an endleſſe diſcourſe; but it ſhal content me (paſſing ouer this world of matter) to glance onely at the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this infinite theme.</p>
            <p>As euery obedience ſerues God, ſo euery ſin makes God ſerue vs. One ſaid wittily, that the angry man made himſelfe the iudge, and God the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner. There is no ſin that doth not the like. The glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton makes God his cator, and

            <p>Theſe were great things indeed, that God did for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; great that hee hath done for vs; Great for the preſent, not certaine for the future. They had not, no more haue wee, the bleſſings of God by entayle, or by leaſe. Onely at the good will of the

There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little prioritie in time betweene them. The Angels did wickedly, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh't by their fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The old world did wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, they periſh't by waters from heauen. The Sodomites did wickedly, they periſh't by fire from heauen. <hi>Corah</hi> and his company did wickedly,

they periſh't by the earth. The Egyptians did wickedly, they periſh't by the Sea. The Canaanites did wickedly, they periſh't by the ſword of Iſrael. The Iſraelites did wickedly, they periſh't by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, ſerpents, Philiſtims. What ſhould I runne my ſelfe out of breath, in this endleſſe courſe of examples? There was neuer ſinne but it had a puniſhment, either in the Actor, or in the Redeemer. There was neuer puniſhment, but was for ſinne.

            <p>But what ſhall bee the iudgement? Periſhing. To whom? To you and your King. He doth not ſay, If your King doe wickedly you ſhall periſh, as ſometimes he hath done. Nor if your King doe wickedly hee ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, although Kings are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuiledged from ſinnes, nor from iudgements.
