            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But now the time is come wherein the Kingdomes of the World are become the Kingdome of the Lord and of his Chriſt, and thouſands witneſſe it, to the prayſe of his everlaſting name. And therefore the Nations are angry, and the Princes of the Earth, becauſe <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince is ariſen to pleade with all who make warre againſt him.

you as the filth of the World, and as the off-ſcouring of all things, whom the World calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> in whoſe Foreheads is Written the name of the living God; and unto you I ſay that make Warre againſt them, and now take part with the Dragon againſt the Lambe, you ſhall all drinke of the cup of fury and indignation of the Lord. And unto the living God, who is holy and jealous for his owne glory and his name, which hath manifeſted his minde and will by his Eternall Spirit unto us, ſhall you all bow and ſtoope. For now the Lord hath rent the vayle of the covering which hath beene ſpread over all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all Profeſſions, and you are all ſeen by the Eternall Eye which is opened in thouſands, even all, from the higheſt to the loweſt, who have ſtolen and painted your ſelves with other mens Words.

And ſeeing you have caſt reproach upon the name of the God of Heaven and Earth, whom we worſhip, and which you call deluſion. For the truths ſake are we moved to lay open your nakedneſſe, that you may be judged by that which you ſay is your Rule: Here in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Booke, thou who haſt any honeſty in thee, or any deſire of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wilt ſearch the Scripture, thou wilt ſee, that all the Teachers of the World in all Formes, and all profeſſors ever cryed out (who had but the Forme) againſt them who had the life and power, as you all doe now againſt them who Worſhip God in the Spirit, and have no confidence in the fleſh. And therefore, in this following Diſcourſe, which is Wretten by the ſame ſpirit that gave forth the Scripture, thou ſhalt ſee who are the falſe Prophets, and who they are that Preach another Goſpel, and who they are that deny the Scriptures.

               <p>To theſe falſe accuſations, I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is no new thing nor no ſtrange thing to the children of light, who are ſeperated from the World, and Worldly Worſhips, and from the Works of darkeneſſe, to be accuſed falſely, and to be ſlandered, by being called deceivers, and ſeducers, by the generation of chiefe Prieſts and Phariſees; in which generation are the Teachers and Profeſſors of this age, who have a Forme of godlineſſe, but deny the power. Chriſt was called a deceiver, and a blaſphemer; and the Apoſtles were called, Movers of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Heretiques, and turners of the World upſide downe, by them who profeſſed in word what <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in ſubſtance, and what the Apoſtles witneſſed, and ſo it is now. We who are ſcornefully called <hi>Quakers,</hi> doe live in, and declare forth no other thing but the ſubſtance of what the Prieſts have Preached upon, and the Profeſſors have talked upon in their carnall mindes by their imaginations. He is a falſe Prophet, and a deceiver, which hath not the Word from the mouth of the Lord, but takes that which the Lord ſpoke to another, and calls it his, and uſeth his Tongue, and ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaith it,</hi> when the Lord never ſpoke to him. And here are the Teachers of the World themſelves, guilty of that, whereof they falſely accuſe us; for they take the Prophets words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Apoſtles Words to talke upon, but have not received the Word from the mouth of the Lord; and their Propheſie and Preaching would ſoon be ended, if they had not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is other mens Words, and that which was ſpoken to others, to ſpeake their imaginations from. And theſe are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:167894:4"/>
the falſe Prophets, and Deceivers, which runne, and are not ſent, which ſpeake to others, pretending to be ſent of God, but walking contrary to all that ever God ſent to declare his Name in former generations, and ſo are knowne to us by their fruits, having no example from the Prophets, Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles for their practice; but doe walke in the example of the falſe Prophets of Iſrael, of the Scribes and Phariſces, and of the falſe brethren. O fooliſh people, which have eyes and ſee not, which have hearts, and doe not underſtand: Is the Lord changed from what he was? Were they falſe Prophets and deceivers in <hi>Iſayahs</hi> time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he was ſent to cry out againſt, which ſought for their gaine from their quarter? and are not your Teachers falſe Prophets now which act the ſame things?

Were they falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in <hi>Michas</hi> time, which he was ſent to cry out againſt, which Preached for hire, and devined for money, and cryed peace to them that put into their mouthes, but prepared war againſt them that did not? and are not your Prieſts falſe Prieſts and Prophets which act the ſame things? Were they deceivers of the people in Chriſts time which he cryed woe againſt which were called of men Maſters, and which had the chiefe place in the Aſſemblyes, and which ſtood Praying in the Synagogues, and which went in long robes, and which loved greetings in the Markets? and are not your Teachers decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the people now, which are found acting the ſame things?

And this Goſpel we witnes to have received not from man, but by the revelation of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which is contrary to man; for which we are perſecuted and ſuffer by man: neither doe we ſpeake to the wiſedome and reaſon, but we preach to the ſpirits in priſon, that the fleſhly man may be judged in the fleſh, that man may live according to God in the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this will many witnes with us, that by the preaching of our Goſpel, liberty is brought to the <hi>captives,</hi> and the <hi>fleſhly</hi> man is judged, and the ſpirit which was in priſon is ſet free.

And here you ſee plainely when the deceivers and falſe Prophets came in; they were come, and comming in, in the Apoſtles dayes, and then was the Propheſie of Chriſt fulfilling and fulfilled: and the Apoſtles ſuffered under Tyrants, and were put to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell deaths, and then they came in more fully; for ſince the Apoſtles dayes hath been a great Apoſtacy, and many Formes of worſhip and wayes of Religion have been imitated from the letter through imaginations, and but one generation of Teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though one above another, in the comprehenſion and ſenſuall wiſedome, and at enmity one againſt another, though all in one birth and nature. But they are all diſcovered by the light, Prayſes (from all that know God) unto him for ever Since the Apoſtles dayes hath darkneſſe been ſpread over all, though the Lord had ſome which he preſerved for himſelfe in the middeſt of Apoſtacy and darkeneſſe; who the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are which Chriſt Propheſied of to every honeſt heart and ſingle eye may be known; Chriſt ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>By their fruits ſhould they be knowne;</hi> And the fruits of the Teachers of the world are plainely made appeare to be the fruits of deceivers, and not of the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> none have gathered Grapes nor Figgs from them. And thus I have cleared my conſcience in the preſence of God concerning the falſe ſlander and accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Teachers and people of the World doe caſt upon us; and to that in every ones conſcience it is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare who they are to whom this accuſation juſtly belongs.</p>

Oh blinded, ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked people, which are not aſhamed to call ſuch Miniſters of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Goſpel (and by your corrupt wills and Laws to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defend them) which ſeeke for their gaine from their Quarter, and which feed themſelves with the Fat, and cloathe themſelves with the Wooll; and which Preach for hire, and divine for money, and prepare Warre againſt them that put not into their mouthes: here you juſtifie ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord were ſent to cry againſt, and deny <hi>Iſayah, Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Micha</hi> to be true Prophets; for if you did beleeve that they ſpoke from the mouth of the Lord, the word of the Lord, then would you not uphold them which act thoſe things which they declared againſt; for that which was abomination to the Lord then, is abomination to him now; and that ſpirit which declared againſt theſe things then, cannot uphold them now.

And you are not aſhamed to call ſuch Miniſters of Chriſt which (walk in the ſame ſteps, and act thoſe things that they did, which Chriſt cryed woe againſt) are called of men Maſters, and have the chiefe places in the Aſſemblyes, and ſtand Praying in the Synagogues, and goe in long Robes, and love greetings in the Markets, as they did;

here you juſtifie ſuch as Chriſt cryed woe againſt, and deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke the truth what was the minde of his Father; for if you did beleeve that he ſpoke the will of his Father, then would ye not uphold theſe that act the ſame things which he cryed woe againſt. And he changes not, that which he once cryed againſt, the ſame ſpirit where it is witneſſed, cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame things. And here againe the Teachers of the world are tryed not to have the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the ſpirit of the Scribes and Phariſces, who act that which they acted, which he cryed woe againſt. And herein Magiſtrates and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtrive againſt the Lord God, by upholding that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> cryed woe againſt. And ſuch who are Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and walke in his Doctrine, and in the ſame ſteps, which he and his Apoſtles walked in, witneſſing for that which they witneſſed, for and againſt that which they witneſſed againſt them you call deceivers, and falſe Prophets, and accuſe them for vagabonds, and wandering Beggars, and Idle, and careleſſe Perſons; and that they have left their Families, and careleſſely wander up and downe. And herein you Magiſtrates and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtrive againſt the Lord, by perſecuting, and ſlandering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and falſely accuſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and condemning ſuch as the Scripture juſtifies, and the ſervants of the Lord which ſpoke forth the Scripture doe witneſſe of to be true. What would you have called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had no where to lay his head? he was no vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, nor Idle, not careleſſe Perſon. And what would you have called the Apoſtles and Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had loſt their Families and Callings, and went up and downe, and had no certaine dwelling place, but went from <hi>City to City,</hi> and cared not for the World; not what to eate, nor what to drink, nor wherewith to be cloathed? this they did, and yet were no vagabonds, nor Idle, nor careleſſe Perſons, but abode in the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they were hated by your generation, as we are now by you: And they were called <hi>peſtilent fellowes, and movers of Sedition, and Haretiques, and men of erronious judgements:</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>they were troublers of their Cities,</hi> as you doe now call us falſe Prophets and Deceivers I doe declare this generation to be the ſame which perſecuted the

Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, as it doth perſecute us; for by the ſame power we ſtand, as they did; and by the ſame power we are commanded and acted, as they were: And to the power by which we ſtand, and are commanded, ſhall all the powers of men, and of the Earth bow, and be ſubject. O all you magiſtrates and people conſider of your blindeneſſe, and Ignorance, who doe abſolutely juſtifie and uphold ſuch as the Scripture declares and witneſſes againſt; and doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and perſecute ſuch as the Scripture juſtifies, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of; and doe put them out of your Synagogues and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; ſearch the Prophets, and Chriſts, and the Apoſtles Writings, in them you may reade your example, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The vengeance of God you cannot fly, his fierce wrath will come upon you, and weeping, and bowling, and lamentation, and miſery will be your portion. O tremble to thinke upon your Ignorance, to what purpoſe have you made a profeſſion of the Scriptures, who juſtifie thoſe things, and thoſe men, which it plainely Declares againſt; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe practiſes and thoſe men, which it plainly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of.
