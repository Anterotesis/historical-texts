            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right worshipfull Sir Philip Sydney knight.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the maner of most writers (Right worshipfull) in dedicating of their bookes, to praise and extoll the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities of such men as they choose to be the patrons of their works, whereby to winne some credit and countenance to themselues: the which thing I see to be doone by a great number of writers (as well strangers as countreymen) who haue set out the praise and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your noble gifts: I am therefore at this time to direct my stile the rather to admonish
<pb facs="tcp:22768:3"/>
you how to emploie and vse the same, to that end that they are bestowed vpon you, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise vainelie with suspicion of flatterie to speake of them. And first I would haue you to consider with your selfe, that you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all the good gifts you haue at the hands of almightie God, who is the giuer of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for the which your dutie is to render most humble and hartie thanks vnto his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maiestie. The end also for the which they are giuen vnto you, is at no time to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that is, the setting foorth of the glorie of God, &amp; the benefit of your countrie. Call al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to remembrance, that they be talents deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto you of credit to vse for a time, for the which you must render an account when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it pleaseth the owner to call you to it: the more you haue, the greater your account will be; for he that hath receiued fiue talents is further to be charged than he which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued but one; and he that hath receiued ten, deeper than he that hath receiued but fiue. Vse them therefore and hide them not in a napkin, for they are the better for the wearing; the more you vse them, the more they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; the more you laie out, the richer you shalbe. Haue alwaies before your eies the
<pb facs="tcp:22768:3"/>
glorie of God, neuer forget the same in anie thing you doo: seeke the weale publike of your countrie, labour to doo it good in anie thing you may, while you haue time so to doo: for you haue but a while to remaine heere, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie you must go after the common course of nature. Let the remembrance of your account when your stewardships is ended, be neuer out of your mind. These be the cheefe points leading the right path to true nobilitie: these you shall find set out at large in that booke, wherewithall you are most delighted.</p>
            <p>For the putting of these things in practise, I am to laie downe two examples for you to imitate, the which (because they are domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) ought to mooue you to be the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow them. The one in your own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble father, who alwaies hath beene and yet is more inclined and bent to doo good to his countrie, than to benefit or inrich himselfe, as Wales and Ireland, beside his owne can beare him witnesse. The other in your honorable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe, Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties cheefe Secretarie, a man for his zeale of Gods glorie, and loue towards them that feare God vnfainedlie, well knowne to the world. Follow their steps, with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb facs="tcp:22768:4"/>
of that noble house, out of the which you are descended by your honourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then you cannot doo amisse. Labour by the example of your father to discouer and bring to light, the acts of the famous men of elder times, who with conference of the estate and gouernment of all ages, will bring you to the perfect experience of those things that you haue learned out of <hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> by your trauell in philosophie. Your father, with his great expenses and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hauing procured &amp; gotten to his hands the histories of Wales and Ireland (which countries for manie yeeres with great loue and commendation he gouerned) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto me this of Wales, to be set foorth in print, with direction to proceed therein, and necessarie bookes for the dooing thereof. And although I was vnsufficient for dooing of it, yet I haue doone mine indeuour, and now doo present the same vnto your worship, as by good reason due to the sonne and heire of him that was the procurer and bringer of it to light: desiring you to accept it with as good will as the same is offered vnto you, and so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the godlie zeale, loue of the common wealth, and care to doo it good, of so noble
<pb facs="tcp:22768:4"/>
and worthie parents, to beare countenance and fauour to the countrie of Wales, which hartilie wisheth you honourable preferment in the feare of God. The Lord increase his gifts in you to his glorie, the benefit of the commonwealth, and your end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse comfort. From my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in London the 25. of March. 1584.</p>

               </note> wherein were contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned besides, such notable occurrences hapning within this Ile of Brytaine, as they then thought worthie the writing: which order of registring and noting conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in those Abbeis vntill the yeare 1270. which was a little before the death of the last Lhewelyn who was slaine at Buelht. These collections were copied by diuers, so that there are at this daie of the same in Wales a hundred copies at the least, whereof the most part were written two hundred yeares ago. This booke Humffrey Lhoyd gentleman (a paineful and a worthie searcher of Brytish antiquities) translated into English,
<pb facs="tcp:22768:6"/>
and partlie augmented, chieflie out of Matthew Paris, and Nicholas Triuet: but before the booke was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished (hauing yet manie imperfections, not onelie in the phrase, but also in the matter and substance of the historie) it pleased God to take him awaie in the floure of his time: who (if God had spared him life) would not onelie haue set out this historie absolute and perfect, but also haue opened vnto the world other antiquities of this land, which now lie hidden and vnknowen. The copie of his translation, the Right honorable Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sidney Lord President of Wales (whose disposition is rather to seeke after the antiquities, and the weale pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike of those countries which he gouerneth, than to obtaine lands and reuenewes within the same, for I know not one foote of land that hee hath either in VVales or Ireland) had lieng by him a great while, and being desirous to haue the same set out in print, sent for me in September last, requesting me to peruse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, in such sort as it might be committed to the presse. But I (knowing my selfe to be far vnable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and accomplish those things which are requisite to the publishing of such an historie, and being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called and imploied) was verie loath anie thing to medle therein, and so excused my selfe; yet he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a better opinion of me than there was cause, would needs haue me to doo mine indeuour in that behalfe. VVhose request I was not of dutie to gainesaie or withstand, and therevpon I promised to doo my best, which trauell two things haue caused me to be the more willing to take it in hand.</p>
            <p>First, because I see the politike and martiall actes of all other inhabitants of this Iland, in the time of their gouernment to be set out to the vttermost, and that by diuers and sundrie writers: and the whole doings and
<pb facs="tcp:22768:6"/>
gouernment of the Brytaines the first inhabitants of the land, who continued their rule longer than anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rob. Caenal. li.</hi> 2. <hi>Par.</hi> 2.</note> to be nothing spoken of nor regarded of anie, especialie sithence the reigne of Cadwalader, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so manie monuments of antiquitie to declare and testifie the same, if anie would take the paines to open and discouer them to the vew of the world.</p>
            <p>The second thing that mooued me therevnto, is the slanderous report of such writers, as in their bookes do inforce euerie thing that is done by the Welshmen to their discredit, leauing out all the causes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the same: which doo most commonlie not onelie eleuate or dissemble all the iniuries and wrongs offered and done to the Welshmen, but also conceale or deface all the actes worthie of commendation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued by them. Search the common Chronicles touching the Welshmen, and commonlie thou shalt find that the King sendeth some noble man or other with an armie to Wales, to withstand the rebellious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, the proud stomachs, the presumptuous pride, stirre, trouble and rebellion of the fierce, vnquiet, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, fickle and vnconstant Welshmen, and no open fact laid downe to charge them withall, why warre should be leuied against them, nor yet they swaruing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brod out of their owne countrie to trouble other men. Now this historie dooth shew the cause and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of most of those warres, whereby the qualitie of the action may be iudged. And certeinlie no man is an indifferent witnesse against him whom he counteth his enimie or aduersarie, for euill will neuer speaketh well. The Welshmen were by the Saxons and Normans counted enimies, before the twelfth yeare of Edward the first, while they had a gouernour among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and afterward, when king Edward had brought
<pb facs="tcp:22768:7"/>
the countrie to his subiection, he placed English offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to keepe them vnder, to whome most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he gaue the forfaits and possessions of such Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as disobeied his lawes, and refused to be ruled by the said officers: the like did the other Kings that came after him. The said officers were thought oftentimes to be ouer-seuere and rigorous for their owne profit &amp; commoditie: which things caused the people often to disobeie, &amp; manie times like desperate men to seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, hauing those for their iudges which were made by their ouerthrow, and also wanting indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in their causes and matters of griefes: for the Kings alwaies countenanced and beleeued their owne offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by them preferred and put in trust, before their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, whom they liked not of. Wherevpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of England fauoring their countriemen and freends, reported not the best of the Welshmen. This hatred and disliking was so increased by the stirre and rebellion of Owen Glyndoure, that it brought foorth such greeuous lawes, as few Christian kings euer gaue or published the like to their subiects. These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, anie man may easilie perceiue the verie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those parentheseis and briefe notes of rebellion and troubles obiected to the Welshmen, without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of cause or declaration of circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Normans hauing conquered England, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all the lands of the Saxon nobilitie, would faine haue had the lands of the Welshmen also, wherevpon diuers of them entred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> VVales with an armie, so that the VVelshmen were driuen for their owne defense to put themselues in armour: for the which fact they are by some writers accused of rebellion, wheras by the law of Nature it is lawfull for all men to withstand force by force.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vim vi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellere licet.</hi>
               </note> They were in their owne countrie, the

land was theirs by inheritance and lawfull possession: might they not therefore defend themselues from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and wrong, if they could? What right or lawfull title had the Earle of Chester to Ryuonioc &amp; Tegengl? or the Earle of Salope to Dyuet, Caerdigan, &amp; Powys? or Rob. Fitzhamon to Glamorgan? or Barnard New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march to Brechnoke? or Ralph Mortimer to Eluel? or Hugh Lacy to the land of Ewyas? or anie other of them to anie countrie in VVales? By what reason was it more lawfull for those men to dispossesse them of these countries with violence and wrong, than for them to defend and keepe their owne? Shall a man be charged with disobedience, because he seeketh to keepe his purse from him that would robbe him? I meane not by this to charge those Noble men, which wan these countries by the sword: but I speake it to note the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dealing of the writers &amp; setters foorth of those hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, that should haue reported things indifferentlie, as they were done, and laid downe the causes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of euerie action truelie, who being altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parciall, fauoring the one side &amp; hating the other, do pronounce of the fact according to their priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, condemning oftentimes the innocent, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieng the wrong doers.</p>
            <p>These considerations I saie, besides my bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, caused me to venture to take this thing in hand. The translation of H. Lhoyd I haue conferred with the Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish booke, whereof I had two ancient copies, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the same, when there was cause so to doo. And after that the most part of the booke was printed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued another larger copie of the same translation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better corrected, at the hands of Robert Glouer Somerset Herald, a learned and studious Gentleman in his profession, the which if I had had at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:22768:8"/>
manie things had come foorth in better plight than they now be. Againe, I got all the authors that I could come by, which haue anie thing written of the affaires of VVales, as Gildas, Asser Meneuensis, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride, William of Newborow, Matthew Paris, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Westminster, Thomas Walsingham, Ponticus Virunnius, Polydor Virgil, Io. Leyland, Io. Bale, I. Prise, Matthew Parker, Io. Caius, VVilliam Lambert, and all the English Chronicles printed. In written hand I had Gildas Sapiens <hi>alias</hi> Nennius, Henrie Huntington, VVilliam Malmsbury, Marianus Scotus, Ralph Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall, Io. Euersden, Nicholas Triuet, Florentius Vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niensis, Simon of Durham, Roger Houedon, and other which remaine in the custodie of I. Stowe citizen of London, who deserueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation for getting togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ancient writers of the histories of this land. I had also the Brytish books of petegrees. I. Castoreus, &amp; Syluester Giral. Cambrensis, which with diuers other rare monuments of antiquitie, I receiued at the hands of the Right Honorable the Lord Burghley high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of England: who also directed me by his letters to all the offices where the Records of this realme are kept, out of the which I haue gathered a great part of this historie, and more would haue done, if the time had permitted. The copie I haue conferred with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed authors, and where I found them to intreat of the matters therein contained, I haue noted them in the margine, and in such authors as are printed I haue most commonlie directed thee gentle Reader to the page or chapter of the booke where thou shalt find the same historie treated of. Againe, where I found anie thing of Wales worthie the noting in the said au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors being not conteined in the copie, I haue inserted
<pb facs="tcp:22768:8"/>
the same in a smaller letter with this marke * before it, whereby it may be discerned from the copie it selfe. Further, such things as were breefly set downe in the copie without signification of cause or declaration of circumstances, if I found the same in anie of mine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors treated of and further opened, I haue likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted it in his due place. In the possession and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of families, I haue sought what I could for the time, and haue laid downe most of the noble families of England, which had lands in Wales, or descended out of that countrie. I was greatlie furthered in this worke by the painefull and studious trauell of the right worshipfull Sir Edward Stradling Knight, Thomas Powel of Whittington parke, and Richard Broughton Esquires.</p>
            <p>In the description I haue taken the lesse paines, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dailie for the comming foorth of the painefull and studious trauell of some other, who hath labored in that behalfe, and studied all the Romane and Brytish histories concerning the ancient names of nations and places within this Iland, so that my labour were super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in that behalfe. Herein if happilie I haue swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or omitted anie thing, which should haue beene laid downe in this historie, I neither did it wittinglie nor willinglie: and therefore being readie vpon better information to amend that which shalbe found to be amisse, if any so shalbe, I am the rather to be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, because I am the first setter out in print of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for things can neuer be so well doone at the first when there is but few that doo trauell therein, as they maie in processe of time, when euerie man putteth to his helping hand, which curtesie I am to desire of thee gentle Reader for the perfecting of this worke.</p>
            <p>Concerning the alteration of the estate, there was
<pb facs="tcp:22768:9"/>
neuer anie thing so beneficiall to the common people of Wales, as the vniting of that countrie to the crowne and kingdome of England, whereby not onelie the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie and hurt of the dissention that often hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Princes of the countrie, while they ruled, is now taken awaie, but also an vniformitie of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established; whereby all controuersies are exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, heard &amp; decided within the countrie: so that now the countrie of Wales (I dare boldlie affirme it) is in as good order for quietnes and obedience as anie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in Europe: for if the rulers and teachers be good and doo their duties, the people are willing to learne, readie to obeie, and loath to offend or displease. And if it please God once to send them the Bible in their owne language according to the godlie lawes alreadie established, the countrie of Wales (I doubt not) will be comparable to anie countrie in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

Therefore after the three sonnes of <hi>Brutus</hi> had diuided the whole Ile of Brytaine into three parts; that part conteined within the French seas, with the riuers of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne (called in Brytish <hi>Hafren</hi>) Dee and Humber, fell to the eldest sonne <hi>Locrinus,</hi> which was after his name called <hi>Lhoyger,</hi> which name it hath in the Brytish toong to this daie, and in English now it is called <hi>England,</hi> and is augmented North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:22768:10"/>
to the riuer Tweed. The second sonne <hi>Albanactus</hi> had all the land Northward from Humber to the sea Orkney, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Brytish toong <hi>Mor Werydh,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Mare Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonicum.</hi> The third sonne <hi>Camber</hi> had to his part all that which remained vndiuided, lieng within the Spanish and Irish seas, and separated from England,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cambria.</hi>
               </note> with the riuers Seauerne and Dee, and this part was after his name called <hi>Cambria,</hi> and the inhabitants thereof <hi>Cambry,</hi> and their language <hi>Camberaec,</hi> and so are at this daie. So that they haue kept the same countrie and language this 2690. and odde yeares, without commixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with anie other nation, especiallie in Northwales, as it shall hereafter appeare.</p>
            <p>And bicause the name of this countrie is changed, or rather mistaken by the inhabitants of England, and not by them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cambry,</hi> but Wales: I thinke it necessarie to declare the occasion thereof, which is, that where the Saxons a people of Germanie were the first that after the Brytaines inhabited and ruled the greatest part of this Ile, &amp; droue the Brytains to that corner, which according to the maner of their countrie they called Wales, and the people Welshmen, and the toong Welsh, that is to saie Strange, or not of them vnderstanded. For at this daie the inhabitants of the lowe countries call their next neighbours language of <hi>Henegaw,</hi> or other that speake French, Walsh, as a language to them vnknowne. Likewise the dwellers of Tyroll &amp; other the higher countries of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doo name the Italian their next neighbour a Welshman, and his language Walsh. And this is an euident proofe, that they which harped vpon a Queene <hi>Gwalaes,</hi> and of a Prince <hi>Wala</hi> (of whom neither Brytish, Latine, nor English historie maketh mention) were fowlie deceiued: and so likewise was a great historiographer of late daies, which saith, that it was called <hi>Walia, quasi Italia,</hi> bicause the rest of the Romans which remained in the Ile were driuen thither. Neither is this anie new inuention, although <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> with an <hi>Italian</hi> brag dooth glorie himselfe to be the first that espied it out, for diuers ancient writers doo alledge the same cause of the name of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22768:10"/>
Wales, of whom <hi>Syluester Giraldus</hi> is one, who wrote in the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the second after the conquest, before 380. yeares passed: which is an euident token, that the said <hi>Polydore</hi> did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer see nor read the ancient histories of this realme, or dissembleth the same to the aduancement and praise of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his countrie: which to the learned and indifferent reader shall appeare to be the onelie occasion he tooke that worke in hand, for all his booke redoundeth onlie to the praise and honour of the Romans, as well spirituall as temporall, and to blase forth their acts and deeds within this realme: and vpon the other part dooth either openlie slaunder, or els priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie extenuate, or shamefullie denie the martiall prowesse and noble acts, as well of Saxons, Danes, and Normans, as of the Brytains, all inhahiters of this Ile. Which thing he that list to prooue, let him read and conferre <hi>Caesars</hi> Commentaries, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Tacitus, Herodianus,</hi> and other ancient writers, as well in Latine as in Greeke, with his worke.

To make an end I saie, that he being first a straunger borne, and also ignorant as well in the histories of this realme, as of those toongs and languages wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same were written, could neuer set foorth the true and perfect Chronicle of the same. But he hauing a good grace and a pleasant stile in the Latine toong, and finding himselfe in a countrie where euerie man either lacked knowledge or spirit to set forth the historie of their owne countrie, tooke this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise in hand, to their great shame, and no lesse dispraise, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he a blind leader shall drawe a great number of vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and rash folowers, as well Geographers and Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as Chroniclers and Historiographers, to the darke pit of ignorance, where I leaue them at this time, remitting the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the apologie of Sir <hi>Iohn Pryse</hi> knight, and his Brytish hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,

written by him of purpose against the enuious reports and slaunderous taunts of the said <hi>Polydor,</hi> where he shall see a great number of his errors confuted at large. And to returne to my former matter of the name of Wales,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> which name to be giuen of late by a straunge nation may be otherwise prooued: for the Welshmen themselues doo not vnderstand what these words VVales and Welsh doo signifie, nor know anie other name of their countrie or themselues but <hi>Cambry,</hi> nor of their language but <hi>Cambraec,</hi> which is as much to saie as <hi>Cambers</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or speech. So likewise they know not what England or English meaneth, but commonlie they call the countrie <hi>Lhoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> the Englishmen <hi>Sayson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A Locrino. A Saxonib.</hi>
               </note> and the English toong <hi>Saysonaec.</hi> Which is an euident token that this is the same language which the Brytaines spake at the beginning: for the works of <hi>Merdhyn</hi> and of <hi>Taliessin,</hi> who wrote aboue 1000. yeares past, are almost the same words which they vse at this daie, or at the least easie to be vnderstanded of euerie one which knoweth perfectlie the Welsh toong, especiallie in Northwales.</p>
            <p>Beside this, where at this daie, there doo remaine three rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Brytaines, diuided euerie one from other, with the seas which are in Wales, Cornewall (called in Brytish <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niw</hi>) and little Brytaine, yet almost all the particular words of these three people are all one, although in pronunciation and writing of the sentences they differ somewhat, which is no maruell, seeing that the pronunciation in one realme is often so diuers, that the one can scant vnderstand the other. But it is rather a wonder, that the Welshmen being separated from the Cornish, well nigh these 900. yeares, and the Brytaines from either of them 290. yeares before that, and hauing small traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fike or concourse togither sithence that time, haue still kept their owne Brytish toong. They are not therefore to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which denie the Welsh to be the old Brytish toong. And here I cannot passe ouer what one of these fine Chroniclers wrote of late, of the name of Brytaine, affirming that it should be so called of Brytaine in France, as the elder of that name. But surelie he had either neuer seene <hi>Ptolomie</hi> nor <hi>Caesar,</hi> nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22768:11"/>
anie other ancient writer, or read them with small iudgement and memorie. For there he might haue learned, that when this land was called <hi>Brytaine,</hi> the other was called <hi>Armorica,</hi> &amp; how in <hi>Maximus</hi> time,<note place="margin">

But passing ouer this matter vntill an other time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The meares and bounds of Wales.</hi>
               </note> I will returne to the description of Wales, which (as I said) was of old time compassed almost about with the Irish seas, &amp; the riuers Dee and Seauerne, although after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saxons wan by force from the Brytaines all the plaine and champion countrie ouer the riuers, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>Offa</hi> king of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who made a ditch of a great breadth and depth, to be a meare betwixt his kingdome and Wales, which ditch began at the riuer Dee, by Bassing werke betweene Chester and Ruthlan, and ran along the hils sides to the south sea a little from Bristowe, reaching aboue a hundreth miles in length, and is in manie places to be seene at this daie, bearing the name of <hi>Clawdh Offa,</hi> that is to saie, <hi>Offas</hi> ditch, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie betweene it and England is commonlie called in Welsh <hi>Y Mars,</hi> although the greatest part of it be now inhabited by Welshmen, namlie in Northwales, which yet keepeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient limits to the riuer Dee, and in some places ouer it. Other (as <hi>Syluester Giraldus</hi>) make the riuer <hi>VVy,</hi> called in Welsh <hi>Gwy,</hi> to be the meare betweene England and Wales on the South part called Southwales; who measureth the breadth of Wales, from Salowe or Willoweford called <hi>Rhydyrhelig</hi> vpon <hi>VVy,</hi> to Saint <hi>Dauids</hi> in <hi>Meneuia</hi> 100. miles, and the length from <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lheon</hi> vpon <hi>Vsce</hi> in <hi>Gwentland,</hi> to Holihead called <hi>Caergybi</hi> in <hi>Anglisey,</hi> in Welsh called <hi>Môn,</hi> aboue 100. miles, and these be the common meares at this daie, although the Welsh toong is commonlie vsed and spoken Englandward, beyond these old
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22768:12"/>
meeres a great waie, as in Herefordshire, Glocestershire, and a great part of Shropshire. And thus for the generall description of Wales, which afterward about the yeare of Christ 870. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus Magnus,</hi> king of Wales, diuided it into three territories which they called kingdomes, which remained vntill of late daies.</p>
            <p>These three were, <hi>Gwynedh,</hi> in English Northwales, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heubarth,</hi> in English Southwales, and <hi>Powys</hi> land; in euerie of the which he ordeined a princelie seat or court for the Prince to remaine at most commonlie: as in <hi>Gwynedh</hi> (which some old writers call <hi>Venedotia</hi> for <hi>Gwynethia</hi>) <hi>Aberffraw</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Môn</hi> or <hi>Anglesey.</hi>

               </note> And bicause this historie dooth as well intreate of warres betwixt these three prouinces, as betwixt them and the Saxons, Normanes and Flemings: I thinke it good to set foorth the particular description of euerie part by it selfe. And first of Northwales as the cheefest part, which he gaue his eldest sonne, ordeining that either of the other two should paie him yearelie 200. pound of tribute,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Northwales.</hi>
               </note> as it appeareth in the lawes of <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> which are to be had in Welsh, and also in Latine. Therefore <hi>Gwyneth</hi> (called Northwales) had vpon the Northside the sea, from the riuer Dee at Basingwerke to <hi>Aberdyui,</hi> and vpon the West and South west the riuer <hi>Dyui</hi> which diuideth it from Southwales, and in some places from <hi>Powys</hi> land. And on the South and East it is diuided from <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ys</hi> sometimes with mountaines, and sometimes with riuers, till it come to the riuer Dee againe. This land was of old time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to foure parts, of which the cheefest was <hi>Môn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Môn.</hi>
               </note> in English called <hi>Anglesey,</hi> where the Princes cheefe house was at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraw,</hi> which is an Iland separated from the maine land, with an arme of the sea called <hi>Maenai,</hi> &amp; had in it selfe three Cantreds or hundreds, which were subdiuided to sixe comots, as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tref <hi>Aberfraw,</hi> to comot <hi>Lhion,</hi> and comot <hi>Malhtraeth,</hi> Cantref
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22768:12"/>

But here I cannot winke at that notable error of <hi>Polydor,</hi> which (after his accustomed fashion) denieth this Ile to be called <hi>Môna,</hi> but <hi>Anglesia,</hi> or <hi>Anglorum insula,</hi> bicause it is called in English <hi>Anglesey,</hi> and giueth this name <hi>Môna</hi> to Man, and so hath lost the names of both Iles: which ignorance and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes might be forgiuen him, if he had not drawne a great number to this error with him, which in their charters doo dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wrong name these Iles, which may be easilie prooued. First, bicause the inhabitants of the Ile doo know none other name but <hi>Môn:</hi> and it is called through all Wales, <hi>Tîr Môn,</hi> that is to saie, the land of <hi>Môn</hi> vnto this day. So that neither by memorie of man, neither by anie monument in writing in the Brytish <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ong can it appeare, that euer it had anie other name but <hi>Môn,</hi> yet there be manifest monuments for these 1000. yeares. It is also growne to a prouerbe through Wales, for the fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ground, <hi>Môn mam Gymry,</hi> that is to saie, Môn mother of Wales.</p>
            <p>The ancient historie of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> (which belike age had beaten out of <hi>Polydors</hi> head) saith, that the soldiours of <hi>Paulinus Suetonius,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> after they had passed through Northwales, then came ouer against Môna, where they did swim ouer an arme of the sea of 200. pases, and so by force wanne the Ile. Now whether is it more reasonable thus to swimme ouer 200. pases, or 20. miles? I know there is no man that beleeueth <hi>Polydor</hi> in this point: let all men therefore by this iudge the rest. As for that which he saieth of the great woods, it is nothing: for both the Romanes, and after when the Christian faith tooke place in this realme, the Christians did fall and roote them out, for the idolatrie and absurd religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was vsed there: that the king of Man sent for tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Môn: read the life of <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of Chester; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is euident by the great beeches and other trees found in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22768:13"/>
the earth at these daies. His other reason is, bicause it is called Anglesey in the English toong: so is <hi>Lhoyger</hi> England, and <hi>Cambry</hi> Wales, are those therefore the old names? No surelie. And what if the inhabitants called it so? (as they did not) had it not a name before the Angles wanne it? Yes I warrant you, but he had forgotten that.

Mountgomerie called in Welsh <hi>Treualdwyn,</hi> a pretie towne and a faire castell. The castell of <hi>Clunn</hi> called <hi>Colunwy,</hi> which is the Earles of Arundell.

            <p>And here I thinke it good to let the reader vnderstand what the Brytish chronicle saith of Northwales, which affirmeth that three times it came by inheritance to women.

England, about the yeare 540. after the incarnation of Christ, and hearing how the mingled nations of Irish Scots, and Pictes, had ouer runne the sea shore of Caerdigan, which was part of his inheritance, sent his sonnes thither to enioie their inheritance, of the which <hi>Tibiaon</hi> his eldest sonne died in Man, which land the said Irish Scots had wonne. For <hi>Gildas</hi> saith, that of the children of <hi>Glam Hector,</hi> which peopled a great part of Ireland, <hi>Yscroeth</hi> with his people inhabited <hi>Dalrienda,</hi> which is a part of Scotland: <hi>Builke</hi> with his people came to Man. But I thinke it good to put in <hi>Gildas</hi> words, which saith: <hi>Builke cum filijs suis inhabitauit Euboniam insulam vulgò Manaw, quae est in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullio maris inter Hyberniam &amp; Brytaniam</hi>; that is to saie, Builke with his children inhabited the Ile Eubonia, commonlie <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naw</hi> (for so it was and is named in Brytish) which lieth in the middle of the sea, betweene Ireland and Brytaine.

            <p>By these toies and fables, men may learne what follie and vanitie the wit of man, being not staied and directed by the word of God, is prone and subiect vnto.

            <p>
               <hi>Alan</hi> therefore counselled <hi>Cadwalader</hi> to fulfill the will of God, who did so, and taking his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to <hi>Rome,</hi> liued there eight yeares in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and died in the yeare of Christ, 688.

            <p>The <hi>Brytaines</hi> being sore troubled with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> and denied of aid at the hands of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> sent for the

About the end of Lent he chose out of that companie twelue men of the wisest, grauest, and of the greatest experience: to whome he added one clearke or doctor of the lawes, named <hi>Blegored,</hi> a singular learned and perfect wise man. These had in charge to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the old lawes and customes of <hi>Wales,</hi> and to gather out of those such as were méete for the gouernement of the countrie: which they did, reteining those that were whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and profitable, expounding those that were doubtfull and ambiguous, and abrogating those that were superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hurtfull, and so ordeined thrée sorts of lawes. The first, of the ordering of the kings or princes houshold, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his court. The second, of the affaires of the countrie and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> common wealth. The third, of the speciall customes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to particular places and persons. Of all the which, being read, allowed, and proclamed, he caused thrée seuerall bookes to be written, one for his dailie vse to follow his court, another to lie in his palace at <hi>Aberffraw,</hi> and the third at <hi>Dinevowr,</hi> that all the thrée prouinces of <hi>Wales</hi> might haue the vse of the same when néede required. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22768:48"/>
for the better obseruation of these lawes, he caused the Archbishop of <hi>S. Dauids</hi> to denounce sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against all such of his subiects, as refused to obeie the same. Within a while after, <hi>Howel</hi> (because he would omit nothing that could procure countenance and authoritie to his said lawes) went to <hi>Rome,</hi> taking with him the Archbishop of <hi>S. Dauids,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Bangor</hi> and <hi>S. Asaph,</hi> and thirtéene other of the learnedst and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest men in <hi>Wales,</hi> where the said lawes being recited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope, were by his authoritie confirmed: then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing finished his deuout pilgrimage, and emptied his purse, he returned home againe with his companie.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By these lawes they might not morgage their lands but to one of the same familie or kindred, which were <hi>De ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem parentela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Euerie tenant holding of anie other than of the prince or lord of the fée, paid a fine <hi>Pro defensione regia,</hi> which was called <hi>Arian ardhel,</hi> in Latine <hi>Aduocarij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 No legacie of goods by will was good, otherwise than those which were giuen to the church, to the lord of the fée, or for paiment of debts.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Euerie man might distraine as well for debts, as for rent of lands, anie goods, or cattell, sauing horsses, which were counted to serue for a mans necessarie defense, and were not distrainable without the prince his licence.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Causes of inheritance were not heard or determined but from the ninth of Nouember, till the ninth of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; or from the ninth of Maie, vntill the ninth of August. The rest of the yeare was counted a time of vacation, for sowing in the spring, and reaping in the haruest.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This also is to be obserued, that all matters of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of land were determined and adiudged by the King or Prince in person, or his speciall deputie (if he were sicke or impotent) and that vpon view of the same land, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto him the fréeholders of that place, two elders of his counsell, the Chiefe iustice attending alwaies in the court, the ordinarie iudge of the countrie where the land
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22768:48"/>
laie, and the priest. The maner of their procéeding was thus. The king or prince sate in his Iudiciall seate higher than the rest, with an elder on his right hand, and another on his left, and the fréeholders on both sides next vnto them, which for this cause (as I thinke) were called <hi>Vchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyr.</hi> Before him directlie a certaine distance off, and a little lower, sate his Chiefe iustice, hauing the priest on his right hand, and the ordinarie iudge of that countrie on the left. The court being set, the plaintife came in with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, champion, and <hi>Ringylh</hi> or sergeant, and stood on the left side: then came in the defendant in like maner with his aduocate, champion and <hi>Ringylh,</hi> and stood on the right side: and last of all, the witnesses of both parties came, which stood directlie before the Chiefe iustice at the lower end of the hall, vntill they were called vp to testifie the truth of their knowledge in the matter in variance.</p>

Whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the king or prince after consultation had with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or seniors which sate by him, gaue definitiue sentence; except the matter was so obscure and intricate, that right and truth appeared not: in the which case it was tried by the two champions, and so the cause ended. This shall be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this time. Now therefore let vs go forward in the historie.</p>
            <p>At this time the foresaid kings <hi>Aulafe</hi> and <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi> entered the land of <hi>Edmund,</hi> who gathering his strength together, folowed them into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and ouercame them in plaine bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and chased them out of the land, and so remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a whole yeare in those parts, setting things in order, and quieting of that countrie.

                  <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Madoc</hi> defended themselues manfullie: but at the last they and their men were driuen backe, and so they fled, <hi>Owen</hi> to <hi>Caerdigan</hi> to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers countrie, and <hi>Madoc</hi> to <hi>Powys.</hi> Then <hi>Owen</hi> with his companions made diuerse roades to <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet,</hi> and spoiled the countrie, carieng awaie the men and the cattell to the ships that they came in from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and after ransomed them, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a great number to him, &amp; set vpon a towne of <hi>Flemings</hi> and burned it, and returned to <hi>Caerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> nothing esteeming his fathers danger, nor the kings displeasure. At this time it chansed that <hi>Owens</hi> men among other mischeefes laid wait for a bishop that was towards the king, whose name was <hi>William de Brabant,</hi> and slew him and all his men. Then <hi>Iorwerth</hi> &amp; <hi>Cadogan</hi> were at the court to speake with the king, concerning certaine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their owne: and as the king talked with them, behold there came in a <hi>Fleming,</hi> brother to the dead bishop, who made an exclamation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how <hi>Owen ap Cadogans</hi> men had slaine his brother and a great number moe, and how they were succoured in <hi>Cadogans</hi> land. Then the king being therewith sore displeased, asked <hi>Cadogan</hi> what he could saie to the matter, and he putting all the fault in his son, excused himselfe as well as he could. Then said the king to <hi>Cadogan;</hi> Seeing thou canst not keepe thine owne, but that thy son and thy companions shalbe receiued and succored therein in disorder, I will giue it one that will keepe them out, &amp; I will keepe thee at my charges all thy life, charging thee vpon thine allegeance, that thou enter not within <hi>Wales,</hi> vntill such time as I haue taken further order.

Then <hi>Iorwerth</hi> himselfe seeing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, aduentured rather to be slaine than burned and came out: but his enimies receiued him vpon sharpe speares, and ouerthrew him in the fire, and so he died a cruell death. As soone as the king vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood this, he called <hi>Cadogan</hi> before him, &amp; gaue him his brothers land, which was <hi>Powys,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Owen</hi> his pardon, willing his father to send for him to <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>About this time king <hi>Henrie</hi> preferred his base sonne <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> to the marriage of <hi>Mabil,</hi> daughter and sole heire of <hi>Robert Fitzhamon</hi> Lord of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> in whose right the said <hi>Robert</hi> was Lord of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and was also at the same time by his said father, created Earle of <hi>Glocester:</hi> he builded the castell of <hi>Cardyff.</hi>

               <p>Now when <hi>Madoc</hi> saw his other vncle <hi>Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> rule the countrie, he hid himselfe in rough and desert places, and adding one mischiefe vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, determined also to murther him by one waie or other. Therefore after that <hi>Cadogan</hi> had brought the countrie to some staie of quietnesse, and saw right and iustice ministred therein, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer an eie &amp; respect to the king, he came to the <hi>Trallwng</hi> (now called the <hi>Poole</hi>) and the elders of the countrie with him, and minding to dwell there, began to build a castell.

suddenlie vpon him, &amp; <hi>Cadogan</hi> thinking no hurt, was slaine before he could either fight or flee.

Now <hi>Meredyth</hi> the sonne of <hi>Blethyn</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the death of both his brethren, sped himself to the king, desiring of him the lands of <hi>Iorwerth,</hi> which <hi>Cadogan</hi> had latelie obteined, and the king gaue him the rule thereof, till such time as <hi>Owen</hi> sonne to <hi>Cadogan</hi> was come from <hi>Ireland:</hi> who came shortlie after, and went to the king, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him to his peace, and gaue him his lands.

The Prince also hearing of this sent to the king to haue his peace, which (because the king could not come by him) he obtained for a great summe of monie.</p>
               <p>Some Brytish copies affirme, that the submission both of <hi>Gruffyth ap Conan</hi> &amp; also of <hi>Owen ap Cadogan,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the subtile policie of <hi>Meredyth ap Blethyn</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Chester:</hi> the one working with <hi>Gruffyth,</hi> and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him in hand, that <hi>Owen</hi> had submitted himselfe to the king, &amp; made his peace with him, before it was so in déede: so that the prince somewhat yéelding to the Earles request, if <hi>Owen</hi> had so done contrarie to his oth (for they were sworne either to other, the one not to agrée without the as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent of the other) séemed to incline to peace.

Then <hi>Owen</hi> tooke vpon him the keeping of the castell, and the castell of <hi>Robert Courtmaine</hi> in <hi>Abercomyn</hi> or <hi>Abercorran</hi> was committed to <hi>Blethyn ap Gadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.</hi> Shortlie after, <hi>Gruffyth ap Rees</hi> sent spies to vnderstand the estate of <hi>Caermarthyn</hi> and the castell, who vewed it, &amp; brought him good tidings: therefore he came with his power suddenlie vpon the towne, and gaue a great shout; and <hi>Owen ap Caradoc,</hi> which kept it, ranne to the place where the shout was giuen, thinking that his men would haue followed him, but the most part of them fled, and so <hi>Owen</hi> was staine fighting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, and the towne wonne and destroied all saue the castell, which was sore defaced.

Whereat <hi>Gruffyth</hi> was nothing dismaid, but boldlie came to <hi>Caerdigan Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coed,</hi> and laid siege to a strong hold which Earle <hi>Gilbert</hi> &amp; the <hi>Flemings</hi> builded at <hi>Blaen Porth Gwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> Where after long fight, &amp; diuerse assaults, with the slaughter of diuerse within, and but one of his men, they burned the towne, and brought the countrie to subiection.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22768:111"/>
vntill it was the euening, at which time the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> (seeing their disorder) sent archers to the riuer side, to skirmish with them, to intice the <hi>Welshmen</hi> to the bridge, that the armed horsemen might suddenlie issue out and set vpon the naked footmen. Then the <hi>Welshmen</hi> approched neare to the bridge and skirmished with them, &amp; suddenlie issue foorth one horseman, and would haue passed the bridge, but his horse was wounded with a pike and began to faile, &amp; as he returned to the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he fell of his horse, and the <hi>Welshmen</hi> pursued him ouer the bridge. When the <hi>Englishmen</hi> sawe that, they fled towards the castell, and the <hi>Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> folowed to the hill top, and suddenlie the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of horsemen that laie vnder the hill thrust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them that had passed ouer &amp; the bridge, and they that fled turned backe with more strength, and so the <hi>Welshmen</hi> were compassed on either side, and the bridge so kept that no rescue could come to them, where they were slaine for the most part all, being all naked men. Then the rest seeing the great number of the men armed which they looked not for, turned backe, and departed the countrie. Now when the king heard of all these slaughters and spoiles, he sent for <hi>Owen ap Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> to him, to whom when he came the king said: <hi>Owen</hi> I haue found thee true and faithfull vnto me, therefore I desire thee to take or kill that murtherer <hi>Gruffyth ap Rees,</hi> that doth so trouble my louing subiects; I assure thee my cheefe trust is in thee, and in <hi>Lhywarch ap Trahaern,</hi> who shall go with thee, and you two shall waite vpon my sonne <hi>Robert,</hi> whom I will send shortlie against that traitour with an armie. And looke how thou
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22768:111"/>
seruest me at this time, so will I recompense thee without faile. Then <hi>Owen</hi> being wonderfull glad that the king put such confidence in him, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his men to doo their indeuour at this time to pleasure the King, as they had doone heretofore to offend him: and so ioining with <hi>Lhywarch,</hi> they went towards <hi>Stratywy,</hi> to meete with the kings sonne. And when they came to the confines of the countrie, they made a vowe that neither man woman nor child should escape their hands aliue. When the people vnderstood of this cruell band, they fled out of the countrie, some to woods, some to rocks and caues, and some to the kings ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels to saue their liues. Then they diuided their people to enter the woods and straits, which be verie manie in that countrie. And <hi>Owen</hi> himselfe tooke with him about 100. men, and entred the wood, and perceiued that men and cattell had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that waie, whom he followed and ouertooke, &amp; slaieng some of them, put the rest to flight: then taking their cattell returned backe towards his companie. But at that instant, behold, <hi>Gerald</hi> steward of <hi>Penbroke,</hi> with all his power of <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> was comming to meete the kings sonne, and met with them that fled, who cried out vnto him for helpe, and declared that <hi>Owen ap Cadogan</hi> had spoiled them of all their goods. Now when <hi>Gerald</hi> and the <hi>Flemings</hi> vnderstood that <hi>Owen</hi> was there with so litle companie, they thought it a meete time to be reuenged of their old wrongs, and so pursued him to the woods. <hi>Owen</hi> being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his men, that a great number pursued him, and counselled to make hast awaie, would not so doo, bicause he vnderstood them that followed to be

for his prowesse in the field and his discretion in consultation, was counted the floure of chiualrie, whose presence also was thought onlie sufficient to ouerthrowe anie hold; who being desirous to win honor, gathered his men, and came to these lords before the castell of <hi>Gwys,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they receiued ioifullie.

With which answere the yoong Lords were greatlie offended, that a priest should staie their prosperous proceedings, and thervpon assaulted the castell so sore, that after they had beaten downe the walles, they entred by force, and slew and wounded all the garrison, sauing the Abbot, who escaped awaie priuilie by meanes of freends whom he had in <hi>Howels</hi> armie.</p>

meane time there was a peace concluded betwixt the king and the Prince, vpon condition that <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walader</hi> should haue his lands againe, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should be his friend.

            </p>
            <p>At that time also <hi>Iorwerth Goch ap Meredyth</hi> got the castell of <hi>Yale,</hi> and burned it.

Therefore the king sent for him to come to his court, to conclude a peace before the power of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Wales</hi> were sent for him: wherevpon <hi>Rees</hi> after consultation came to the king, and an order was taken that <hi>Rees</hi> should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the <hi>Cantref Mawr,</hi> as it should please the king, so that his land should be whole togither, and not in diuerse places and shires: but the king did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his promise, appointing <hi>Rees</hi> lands in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places, and lordships intermingled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens lands.

            <p>Then <hi>Rees</hi> sent to the king to complaine, and to haue a redresse, who had onelie faire words and nothing else: for the king winked at the faults of the <hi>Englishmen</hi> and <hi>Normanes,</hi> and punished the <hi>Welshmen</hi> cruellie. <hi>Rees</hi> seeing this, laid siege to <hi>Lhanymdhyfri,</hi> and in short space wan the castell. Also <hi>Eneon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Anarawd Reeses</hi> brothers sonne, being a lustie gentleman, and desirous to make his countrie free from seruitude, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his vncle to be discharged of his oth to the king, laid siege to the castell of <hi>Humfrey,</hi> &amp; by force wan it, slaieng all the garrison, wherein he found horses and armour to furnish a great number of men. Likewise <hi>Rees,</hi> seeing he could enioy no part of his inheritance but that he wan by the sword, gathered his power, &amp; entring <hi>Caerdigan,</hi> left not a castell standing in the countrie, of those which his enimies had fortified, and so brought all to his subiection. Wherewith the king being sore offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, returned to <hi>Southwales,</hi> and when he saw he could doo no good, he suffered <hi>Rees</hi> to enioy all that he had gotten, and tooke pledges of him to keepe the peace in his absence.

               <hi>Rees</hi> prince of <hi>Southwales</hi> did lead his power to <hi>Dyuet,</hi> and destroied all the castels that the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> had fortified there, and afterward laid siege to <hi>Caermarthin.</hi> Which thing when <hi>Reynold</hi> Erle of <hi>Brystow</hi> the kings base sonne heard, he called to him the Earle of <hi>Clare,</hi> and his brother in law <hi>Cadwalader</hi> the brother of prince <hi>Owen,</hi> with <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> and <hi>Conan</hi> prince <hi>Owens</hi> sonnes, and two other Earles, and came to raise the siege with a great armie: whose comming <hi>Rees</hi> abode not, but got him to the mountains called <hi>Kefn Rester,</hi> and there kept himselfe, and they camped at <hi>Dynwyl hîr,</hi> and builded a castell there, who after they could not heare of <hi>Rees,</hi> returned home without doing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie notable act.

            <p>Also about that time there was great warre in <hi>Northwales,</hi> for <hi>Dauid ap Owen</hi> of late prince, came with a great armie aswell <hi>Englishmen</hi> as <hi>Welshmen,</hi> purposing to recouer the land againe; but <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> his nephue, who was the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of the same, and then in possession thereof, came boldlie and met him, and gaue him battell, and putting his people to flight tooke him prisoner and kept him in safetie, and afterward enioied the countrie quietlie. Toward the end of this yeare, <hi>Owen Cyuelioc</hi> lord of the higher <hi>Powys</hi> died, and left his land to <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> his sonne, after whom that part of <hi>Powys</hi> was called <hi>Powys Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynwyn,</hi> for a difference from the other called <hi>Powys Vadoc,</hi> being the possession of the lords of <hi>Bromefield.</hi> At this time also died <hi>Owen</hi> the son of <hi>Gruffyth Maylor</hi> lord of <hi>Bromfield,</hi> and <hi>Brychtyr</hi> the sonne of <hi>Howel ap Ieuaf,</hi> likewise <hi>Maelgon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cadwalhon ap Madoc</hi> lord of <hi>Melienyth.</hi>

               <p>In witnesse whereof to this present writing I haue put my seale: Dated at <hi>Alnet</hi> by the riuer of <hi>Elwey,</hi> in the feast of the decollation of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist,</hi> in the 25. yeare of the reigne of the said king.</p>
               <p>For the obseruations of these articles, the said prince <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Ednyuet Vachan</hi> were sworne.

That all, or one of them whome the king shall appoint, may excommunicate him, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his land vpon breach of anie the said articles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he procured the bishops of <hi>S. Bangor,</hi> and <hi>S. Asaph</hi> to make their charters to the lord the king, whereby they granted to execute and denounce all sentences, aswell of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as of interdiction sent from the foresaid Archbishop,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:22768:174"/>
bishops or anie of them.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Dauid</hi> also sent priuilie to the king, to desire him that he would suffer him being his nephue, and the lawfull heire of <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> his father, to enioy the principalitie of <hi>Wales</hi> rather than <hi>Gruffyth,</hi> which was but a bastard, and no kinne vnto the king. Giuing him withall to vnderstand, that in case he did set <hi>Gruffyth</hi> at libertie, he should be sure to haue the warre renewed. Wherevpon the king knowing these things to be true, and vnderstanding also that <hi>Gruffyth</hi> was a valiant stout man, and had manie fréends and fauorers of his cause, inclined rather to assent vnto <hi>Dauids</hi> request than otherwise to be in danger of further troubles, and therefore willinglie granted the same.</p>
               <p>Shortlie after <hi>Dauid</hi> sendeth his brother <hi>Gruffyth</hi> vnto the king, and other pledges for himselfe, for performance of the said articles, which the king sent forthwith to the towre of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there to be safelie kept, allowing to <hi>Gruffyth</hi> a noble a daie for his finding.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Man.

When <hi>Gruffyth</hi> saw how althings went, &amp; that he was not like to be set at libertie, he began to deuise waies and meanes to escape out of prison.</p>
               <p>Wherefore deceiuing the watch one night, he made a long line of hangings,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.

The king being certified thereof, commanded <hi>Gruffyths</hi> sonne to be better looked vnto, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the officers for their negligence.</p>
               <p>Then the king fortified the castell of <hi>Dyserth</hi> in <hi>Flyntshire.</hi> Also the king gaue to <hi>Gruffyth</hi> sonne to

               <p>The yeare after, king <hi>Henrie</hi> went to <hi>France</hi> with an armie to succour <hi>Hugh de Brune</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe, meaning also to recouer some of that which his father had lost: but all in vaine, for the people fauoured the <hi>French</hi> king, therfore hauing lost a great number of his men, amongst whom was <hi>Gilbert de Clare,</hi> he returned home againe. <hi>Maelgon Vachan</hi> about this time fortified the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel of <hi>Garthgrugyn, Iohn de Mynoc</hi> also fortified the castell of <hi>Buelht,</hi> &amp; <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> the castell of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyenyth.</hi> The summer folowing, the king began to trouble the <hi>Welshmen</hi> verie sore, and to take their lands by force without iust title or rightfull cause. This yeare died <hi>Hugh de Albineto</hi> Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi> whose inheritance was diuided betwixt his foure sisters. Whereof <hi>Isabel</hi> the eldest had mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iohn Fitzalan</hi> lord of <hi>Oswalstree</hi> and <hi>Clun,</hi> whose sonne named also <hi>Iohn Fitzalan</hi> was in the right of the said <hi>Isabel</hi> his mother created Earle of the Earledome of <hi>Arundell,</hi> in the which house it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to our time. Within a while after, <hi>Rees Mechylh</hi> sonne to <hi>Rees Gryc</hi> of <hi>Southwales</hi> died. This yeare prince <hi>Dauid</hi> sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the Pope, how the king of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him vniustlie to hold his lands of him.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:22768:175"/>
Therefore the Pope sent to the abbots of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conwy</hi> and <hi>Cymer</hi> a commission to enquire of this matter.</p>

that we may haue the peace dulie kept and obserued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs and our people. Who they be, which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with bloodshed and warre, is manifestlie apparant by their deedes and behauiour: for we would liue qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etlie vpon our owne if we might be suffered, but the Englishmen comming to our countrie did put all to the sword, neither sparing sex, age or sicknesse, nor any thing regarding churches or sacred places, the like whereof the VVelshmen neuer committed. That one hauing paid his ransome was afterward slaine, wee are right sorie to heare of it, neither do we maintaine the offender, who escaping our hands keepeth himselfe as an outlaw in the woods and vnknowne places.

Concerning those things which we commit against God: with the assistance of his grace, we will (as it becommeth Christians) repent and turne vnto him.

we are most readie: but what peace can be established when as the kings charter so solemnlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, is not kept and performed? Our people are dailie oppressed with new exactions: we send vnto you also a note in writing of the wrongs and iniuries which are done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs contrarie to the forme of the peace before made. VVe haue put our selues in armour, being driuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by necessitie: for we and our people were so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, troden vnderfoote, spoiled, and brought to sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie by the kings officers, contrarie to the forme of the peace concluded against iustice, none otherwise than if we were Saracens or Iewes: whereof we haue often times complained vnto the king, and neuer could get any redresse: but alwaies those officers were afterwards more fierce and cruell against vs. And when those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers through their rauine and extortion were enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, other more hungrie than they were sent afresh to flea those whom the other had shorne before: so that the people wished rather to die than liue in such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. And now it shall not be needefull to leuie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie armie to war vpon vs, or to moue the prelats of the church against vs, so that the peace may be obserued duelie and trulie, as before is expressed.

Which arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was not obserued in the lands in <hi>Arustly,</hi> and betwixt the waters of <hi>Dyui</hi> and <hi>Dulas,</hi> for that when the said <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> claimed the said lands before the lord the king at <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and the king granted him the cause to be examined according to the lawes and customes of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the aduocates of the parties were brought in, and the Iudges which vulgarlie they call <hi>Ynnayd,</hi> before the king, to iudge of the said lands accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lawes of <hi>Wales.</hi> And the defendant appeared and answered so, that the same daie the cause ought to haue béene fullie determined according to the appointment of our lord the king. Who at his being at <hi>Glocester,</hi> had assigned the parties the said daie: and though the same cause was in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces often heard and examined before the Iustice, and that the lands were in <hi>Northwales,</hi> and neuer iudged but by the laws of <hi>Wales,</hi> neither was it lawfull for the king but according to the lawes of <hi>Wales</hi> to proroge the cause; all that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he proroged the daie (of his owne motion) contrarie to the said lawes. And at the last the said <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> was called to diuers places, whither he ought not to haue béene called: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he obteine iustice, nor anie iudgement, vnlesse it were according to the lawes of <hi>England,</hi> contrarie to the said article of the peace.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:22768:198"/>
to the foresaid lawes: and at the last the king himselfe at <hi>London</hi> denied him iustice, vnlesse he would be iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the English lawes in the said matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All iniuries, trespasses and faults on either part doone, be clearelie remitted vnto this present daie. This article was not kept; for that as soone as the lord <hi>Reginald Gray</hi> was made Iustice, he mooued diuers and innumerable accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the men of <hi>Tegengl</hi> &amp; <hi>Ros,</hi> for trespasses doone in the time of king <hi>Henrie:</hi> when they bare rule in those parties, wherby the said men dare not for feare kéepe their own houses.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Where as it was agréed that <hi>Rees Vachan ap Rees ap Maelgon</hi> shall enioie his possessions, with all the land which he now holdeth, &amp;c. After the peace concluded he was spoiled of his lands of <hi>Geneu'rglyn</hi> which he then held, with the men and cattell of the same.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Also our lord the king granteth, that all tenants hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lands in the foure <hi>Cantreds,</hi> and in other places which the king holdeth in his owne hands, shall hold and enioie the same, as fréelie as they did before the time of the warres, and shall vse the same liberties &amp; customes, which they vsed before. Contrarie to this article, the lord <hi>Reginald Gray</hi> hath brought manie new customes against the forme of peace aforesaid.</p>
               <p n="5">5 All controuersies mooued, or to be mooued betwixt the Prince and anie other, shall be decided after the lawe of the marches (if they haue their beginning in the marches) and after the lawes of <hi>Wales,</hi> such as in <hi>Wales</hi> haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Contrarie to this article, the king dooth and sendeth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices to <hi>Anglesey,</hi> who presume to iudge there the men and subiects of the Prince: setting fines vpon them, contrarie to the lawes of <hi>Wales,</hi> séeing neither this nor anie like was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard in times past; imprisoning some, outlawing others, when the Prince is at all times readie to doo iustice to all men that complaine vpon anie of his men.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Where it is in the peace, that <hi>Gruffyth Vachan</hi> should doo homage to the king for the land in <hi>Yale,</hi> &amp; to the Prince for the land in <hi>Ederneon,</hi> the kings iustices brought the ladie of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>

into all the said lands of <hi>Edeyrneon.</hi> The knowledge of which cause onelie pertained to the Prince, and not to the said Iustices: and yet for peace sake, the Prince did tollerate all this, being at all times readie to minister iustice to the said Ladie.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And though the said Prince submitted himselfe vnto vs and our will, yet we neuerthelesse will and grant, that our will in no case goo furder, than is conteined in those arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Contrarie to this article, gold was exacted for the Quéenes workes at euerie paiment made to the King: which gold was neuer demanded in time of king <hi>Henrie,</hi> or anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king of <hi>England.</hi> Which gold yet for quietnes sake the Prince paid, though it were not spoken of or mentioned in the peace. And now further it is exacted for the old Quéene the kings mother that now is (for the peace concluded with king <hi>Henrie</hi>) 2000. marks and a halfe: and vnlesse it be paid, the king threatneth to occupie the goods and lands of <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> and his people, which he could find in his realme; and sell men and beasts vntill the said summe were paid.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Item when the king inuited the Prince to his feast at <hi>Worcester,</hi> promising with verie faire words, that he would giue his kinsewoman to him to wife, and enrich him with much honor: neuerthelesse when he came thither, the selfe same daie they should be maried before Masse, the king requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a bill to be sealed by the Prince; conteining amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that he would neuer kéepe man against the kings will, nor neuer mainteine anie, whereby it might come to passe, that all the Princes force should be called from him. The which letter sealed, he deliuered the king by iust feare, which might mooue anie constant man; yet was not this conteined in the peace, whereas the conclusion of the peace was, that the king should require nothing that was not conteined in the same.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Item where in the said peace all customes be confirmed to the said Prince, as his ancestors of long and dailie obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued custome haue receiued to their owne vse, all wrecks hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

vpon his owne lands: the Iustice of <hi>Chester</hi> tooke a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of the Prince for goods of shipwrecke receiued by him before the warres, contrarie to the forme of the said peace. By the which all trespasses of either side were remitted; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the customes before said: and if in case it were forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet he tooke such a distresse, fiftéene pounds of honie, and manie horsses, and imprisoned his men. And this he tooke of the Princes owne proper goods, and further tooke booties of <hi>Bagiers</hi> which came to <hi>Lyrpoole</hi> with merchandize, and neuer redeliuered the same, vntill he had taken so much monie for the same, as it pleased him.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Item when certeine men of <hi>Geneurglyn</hi> had taken certeine goods of some of their neighbors of <hi>Geneurglyn,</hi> when they were in the dominion of the prince in <hi>Meyreon,</hi> the kings men of <hi>Lhanbadarn</hi> did take awaie the said goods out of the said dominion of the Prince: and when the Prince his men came thither, and asked the cause why they tooke the said preie: the kings men killed one of them, and wounded other, and the rest they did imprison, neither could the prince get anie iustice for the said goods to this daie.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And where it is conteined in the peace, that all things committed in the <hi>Marches,</hi> should be redressed in the <hi>Marches</hi>; yet the kings men would no where heare the princes men, but put them in the castell of <hi>Lhanbadarn:</hi> which is against the peace afore said. In these articles and diuers others, the king standeth sworne to the prince, and to his people. And although the prince as well by himselfe as by his people, haue often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the king to cause the said peace to be kept, yet was it in no point kept, but dailie the kings Iustices doo more and more heape iniuries and griefs vpon the people of those parts. So that it cannot be blamed, if the Prince did assent to them that first began the wars, séeing the oth which the lord <hi>Robert Typtost</hi> sware for the king, was kept in no point: and chéeflie séeing the Prince was forewarned, that he should be taken so soone as the king came to <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> as he had béene in déede if the king had come thither after Christmasse, as he purposed.</p>

               <p>The Archbishop receiuing these and other articles, came to the king, and requested him to consider these wrongs, and to cause amends to be made, or at the least excuse the <hi>Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> hauing so iust cause of gréefe.

to doo iustice to all them that complained.

For that the foure <hi>Cantreds</hi> be of the more tenure of the Prince, where alwaies the Princes of <hi>Wales</hi> had more right, since the time of <hi>Camber</hi> the sonne of <hi>Brutus:</hi> so that they be of the principalitie of <hi>Wales.</hi> The confirmation of the which the Prince obtained by <hi>Octobonus</hi> the Popes legate in <hi>England,</hi> by the consent of the king and his father: as it doth appeare by the letters patents. And more iust and equall it is, that our heires doo hold the said <hi>Cantreds</hi> of the king for monie and vsed seruice, than the same to be giuen to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which abuse the people by force and power.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All the tenants of all the <hi>Cantreds</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> altogither doo saie, that they dare not submit themselues to the king, to doo his pleasure. First, for that the king kept neither coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor oth, nor grant by charter from the begining, to the Prince or his people. Secondlie, for that the kings men doo cruellie exercise tyrannie towards the Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Thirdlie, that they be not bound to anie such matter, séeing they be the Princes tenants: who is readie to doo vsed and accustomed seruice, and to obey the king, with and by the said seruice.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To that which is said, that the Prince should simplie commit himselfe to the kings will, it is answered, that none of vs all dare come to the king, for the causes aforesaid,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:22768:212"/>
we altogither will not suffer our Prince to come in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Item, the Prince ought not to dismisse his inheritance, and his predecessors in <hi>Wales,</hi> since the time of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and confirmed by the sea apostolike, as is aforesaid, and to take lands in <hi>England,</hi> where he knoweth neither toong, maners, lawes nor customs, wherein he shall be soone trapped by his neighbours the <hi>Englishmen,</hi> his old malicious enimies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should lose the land too.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Item, séeing the king goeth about to depriue him of his ancient inheritance, it is not like that he would suffer him to possesse lands in <hi>England,</hi> where he claimeth no right; séeing that the Princes lands in <hi>Wales</hi> of his owne inheritance is but barren and vntilled, it is lesse like the king would suffer him to enioie good fertile ground in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="8">8 Item, the people of <hi>Snowdon</hi> doo saie, that although the Prince would giue the king possession of it, yet they would neuer doo homage to strangers: of whose toong, maners, and lawes they should be ignorant. For so they should be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer captiued and cruellie handled, as the <hi>Cantreds</hi> haue béene by the kings bailiffes and other the kings men handled more cruellie than <hi>Sarracens,</hi> as it dooth well appeare by the notes of their gréefes, which the men of the <hi>Cantreds</hi> sent to you holie father.</p>

Uerie manie in our countrie doo much maruell that you counselled vs to leaue our owne land, and to go to an other mans lands among our enimies to liue: for séeing we cannot haue peace in our owne land, which is our owne right, much lesse should we be quiet in an other mans, amongst our
