            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>65 Which be the ceremonies of the ould law?</head>
                  <p>Some were ceremonies of the whole church, and of our whole redemption: As the Garden of Eden after the fall of man. For the Tree of lyfe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall of Adam was but a token of his obedience, of his welfare and happie life thereby, was nowe made a signe of life in Christ Iesus: Also his driuing from the tree &amp; garden, was a signe that he should seeke life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by Christ in his Church.</p>
                  <p>For the Garden also did shadowe out the Church, as the Tree did shadowe Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>Also the Altar, and place togither where it stoode before the Tabernacle was commaunded. For the Church of God is as holie grounde, for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare Christ Iesus: and we, are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place which he hath chosen to put his name there. Christ is the Altar, because that as by the Altare, the place and all that was done in it, was sanctified, so by Christ both we and all that we doo in our regeneration is cleansed and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. And therefore is Christ the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, because that as it was for burnt and sinne offerings, and for meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes, and peace offerings, &amp;c. So Christ was slaine to be our burnt and sinne offeringe, and he ouercame and tooke awaye sinne and miserie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored our happines, to be our meate offering and peace offering.</p>
                  <p>The Arke of Noah, and the doare thereof, and the safetie of his familie therin, did signifie the spiritual house, and Church of God, whereof Christ is the doore: and also the spirituall safetie and happines therein, which shal be perfected after this life.</p>
                  <p>The land of Canaan and the increase, and blessinges therof, were figures of the Lords Church and people, and of the spirituall graces which the Lorde bestoweth thereon. For as the landes of the kingedome is the Kinges inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, so we are the Lordes spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, inheritaunce, and his Canaan, ouer which he raigneth. The same also is to be sated of some places in the lande of Canaan.</p>
                  <p>The Passeouer and comminge out of Egypte did foreshew our redemption from Satan and Antichrist, and from all wickednes and miserie. For wee eate the Paschall Lambe Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, when we feede spirituallie on his death and tormentes, and so die with him by repentaunce vnto sinne, and when we receyue the graces of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and happines with God, and so partake and growe togither in one bodie and church, in one Christian communion of graces, whereby wee goe out of Egypt, as did the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</p>
                  <p>As the Rocke from whom doth flow the spiritual drincke. The Tabernacle framed and made for a dwelling to the Lord wherein he delighteth. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Ierusalem. Mount Zion. The Temple. The Sanctuarie. The Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Midianites: and such great Deliuerances. The Returne from the Captiuitie. &amp;c. Also certaine Families houlding the ceremonies, and true Religion: As the familie of Noah: and those before him, which were raised vp in Abels roume. Abraham and his seed. Moses and the Kingdome of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in the handes of good Kinges &amp; Iudges. Aaron &amp; his seed the Priestes and Leuites.
