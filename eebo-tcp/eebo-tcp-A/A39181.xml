            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGIE UPON SEVERAL Eminent DIVINES LATELY DECEASED.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>ADieu bleſt Souls, go take Eternal bliſs,</l>
               <l>Where anguiſh, ſorrow, and all pains do ceaſe,</l>
               <l>In the bright Regions of Eternal Days,</l>
               <l>Where Heaven born Souls enjoy the milder Rays,</l>
               <l>In the fair Dwellings, where there is no room</l>
               <l>For Blood, and where the impious never come.</l>
               <l>But ſtay, their Souls do live among the bleſt,</l>
               <l>Their Bodies are but dorment, and in reſt.</l>
               <l>If neither Souls, nor yet their Bodies die,</l>
               <l>Inſulting Death can vaunt no Victory.</l>
               <l>What though their Eys be dim'd, they dwell in light,</l>
               <l>And Death hath only turn'd their Faith to fight;</l>
               <l>Death hath but broke the Glaſs, that refract Rays</l>
               <l>Should be no more the Viſion of their days,</l>
               <l>But direct Beams in that Coeleſtial place,</l>
               <l>Where Saints behold the Almighty Makers face.</l>
               <l>What though their Bodies in the Duſt do fall,</l>
               <l>'Tis ſure, but for to make them ſpiritual;</l>
               <l>To make them fitter for to tune thoſe Pſalms</l>
               <l>Which Saints do ſing, that bear triumphant Palms:</l>
               <l>But if you'll call this ſleep a death, then ſay</l>
               <l>They'r but withdrawn to reſt till it be day;</l>
               <l>Till Chriſt ſhall wake them, that they may put on</l>
               <l>Like glorious Robes with thoſe which Cloath the Sun,</l>
               <l>The Lordly looks of Death do tumble down</l>
               <l>Imperial Thrones, and talleſt Monarchs Crowns;</l>
               <l>All things below do here uncertain ſtand,</l>
               <l>The firmeſt Rocks are plac'd upon the Sand;</l>
               <l>Impartial Death permits none to go free,</l>
               <l>Reſpects no Ages, Sexes, nor Degree,</l>
               <l>Scarce lighted are our Lamps, and do burn clear,</l>
               <l>But fadeing die, and quickly diſappear.</l>
               <l>Alas, alas, our Morning's but begun,</l>
               <l>When ſhades of ſilent Night obſcure the Sun:</l>
               <l>Seeing Deaths Lordly hand prevails o're all,</l>
               <l>And by his ſtroke impartially we fall;</l>
               <l>Let's live in Heaven, while here on Earth we be,</l>
               <l>Continuing mindful of Mortality:</l>
               <l>Let's watch and pray, and chuſe the better part,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Mary</hi> let us lay Chriſt next our heart;</l>
               <l>And like theſe Saints let's keep a general love</l>
               <l>For every one whoſe Birth is from above;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>That when Death to our days an end ſhall bring,</l>
                  <l>With them we may bleſt Hallelujah's ſing,</l>
                  <l>And pour forth Praiſes to the Almighty King.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>With numerous Mourners, now they are compaſt round,</l>
               <l>When like good Seed they'r laid into the Ground;</l>
               <l>Their light afflictions, which on Earth have been,</l>
               <l>Such a Maſs of glory have acquired for them;</l>
               <l>What though in largeneſs could our hearts ariſe</l>
               <l>To his whom valid wit pronounc'd moſt wiſe;</l>
               <l>Yet could we not conceive, much leſs expreſs,</l>
               <l>The vaſtneſs of that glory they poſſeſs:</l>
               <l>Their Fight of Faith is done, even that good ſtrife,</l>
               <l>And they have laid hold on an eternal life:</l>
               <l>The Conflict's ended, and the Courſe is run,</l>
               <l>The Butt is touched, and the Prize is won:</l>
               <l>Their Race is at an end, they the Faith keep;</l>
               <l>Their work being finiſht, now they are aſleep;</l>
               <l>Let us them trace in Paths of Holineſs,</l>
               <l>So that we may obtain Coeleſtial Bliſs:</l>
               <l>When unto Fate we bow, and end our days,</l>
               <l>We may have nought to do but ſing forth Praiſe,</l>
               <l>And look on Death, the mighty King of fears,</l>
               <l>But as a Bridge over this vail of Tears,</l>
               <l>To land us on thoſe Banks, along whoſe ſide</l>
               <l>Streams of pure Pleaſure evermore do glide;</l>
               <l>And at the laſt day may rejoycing ſtand</l>
               <l>With Pious Saints at <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s right hand.</l>
               <l>Why make we then for them ſo great complaint?</l>
               <l>As though, we envy'd Heaven ſo good a Saint:</l>
               <l>No, let us rather joy at their great Gain,</l>
               <l>Which doubtful we ſtill labour to obtain.</l>
               <l>And let this be comfort t'all thoſe that weep</l>
               <l>For Pious Saints, that they'r not dead but ſleep.</l>
