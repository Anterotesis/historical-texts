            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Let Judgements fill thy heart with dread &amp; fear;</l>
                  <l>For God is Just, do not thy self deceive,</l>
                  <l>The Fiends of Hell do all this Truth believe:</l>

                  <l>The Soul of Man is precious in God's sight,</l>
                  <l>In Man's well doing God doth take delight;</l>
                  <l>And it doth grieve his Spirit for to see</l>
                  <l>Man so delighting in Iniquity:</l>

                  <l>They would believe that Oaths do God provoke;</l>
                  <l>For by His Laws Divine he did decree,</l>

                     <hi>ADULTERY</hi> it is a Crying Sin,</l>
                  <l>That Rich and Poor too many wallow in;</l>
                  <l>And though they know God doth this Crime forbid,</l>
                  <l>Yet do't they will, and strive to keep it hid:</l>
                  <l>But His All-seeing Eye can plain discover,</l>
                  <l>The sweet Imbraces of the Wanton Lover,</l>
                  <l>Who when the doors are fast as fast can be,</l>
                  <l>He thinks himself secure in secresie:</l>
                  <l>But 'tis in vain for Man to think to hide</l>
                  <l>His fault from him who doth in Heaven abide,</l>
                  <l>Who sees and knows the secrets of the heart,</l>
                  <l>Better than he who acts the Sinners part;</l>
                  <l>And blushing at the thoughts of what he did,</l>
                  <l>Endeavours what he can to keep it hid:</l>
                  <l>But all in vain, for the All-seeing eye,</l>
                  <l>Can all your Chamber-Sins plainly descry,</l>
                  <l>And bring to Punishment for his offence,</l>
                  <l>Those that offend his great Omnipotence.</l>
                  <l>How many hundreds for this very Sin,</l>
                  <l>Of God's just Wrath have sad Examples been!</l>
                  <l>What strange Prodigious deaths this Sin hath wrought!</l>
                  <l>And unto misery Great Persons brought!</l>
                  <l>Yet this beloved Sin too much is us'd,</l>
                  <l>Man's Soul is wrong'd, and God himself abus'd;</l>
                  <l>While the poor Sinner little thinks upon</l>
                  <l>The pains that follow, if they will run on</l>
                  <l>Till Judgements overtake, and then too late</l>
                  <l>Perhaps they may repent their wretched State;</l>
                  <l>And when they'r overwhelm'd with fear and pain,</l>
                  <l>Of time mispent, perhaps they may complain:</l>
                  <l>Their Consciences in their faces then will flye,</l>
                  <l>Horrour surprize them when they come to dye;</l>
                  <l>Their Charming Kisses turn to deadly frights,</l>
                  <l>And change to fearful pains, their chief Delights:</l>
                  <l>Oh then! what would they give for to be free?</l>
                  <l>And pardon gain for their <hi>Adultery.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Well then 'tis so, that all are born to dye,</l>
                  <l>Endeavour by all means from Sin to flye:</l>
                  <l>Abandon Wantonness immediately;</l>
                  <l>Repent you of your Sins while you have space,</l>
                  <l>Else are your Souls in a most dreadful case;</l>
                  <l>Repent, I say, lest Sin do you surprize,</l>
                  <l>And e're you are prepar'd, doth close your eyes.</l>

            <head>A short Exhortation to all those who wilfully commit the above-mentioned Crimes.</head>
            <p>ALas! what will become of poor Sinners, that will boldly and audaciously persist in their Iniquities! What can you expect from a God so justly offended as yours is, but Everlasting misery! a heap of unquenchable Torments! the noysome smells of Fire and Brimstone! the unwelcome company of Fiends and Devils? Oh! consider, poor Sinners, are momentary Pleasures, or present sinful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, to be prized at such a rate, as that you will run the hazard of an Eternal overthrow, for an invalu'd injoyment? Will you not believe what God hath said, <hi>That Swearers, Blasphemers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, VVhoremongers, Drunkards,</hi> and many others, <hi>shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?,</hi> This is a dreadful Sentence, to be banisht from Gods presence into utter darkness; where is nothing but fearful Fiends to torment you for ever: but in Heaven, there you shall be blessed with Saints and Angels singing Hallelujahs for ever; and that we may partake of these Eternal joys, shall be the wish of your Friend</p>
