            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF THE mind of man (most gratiouse
Souuerain) in respect of vvhich vve
are made after the image of the hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hest,
excelled not in passing degrees,
the lumpe of mortall fleshe, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vvhereof it vttereth his naturall functions, iff
the qualitees of the one surmounted not infinitly
the conditions of the other, neither should it seme
vvorthe the vvhile to set penne to paper for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of true religion, in these perilous times of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and heresy, neither vvould it be sitting for one
of my calling to commend such labours to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve
of your Maiesty. For, as in the vvriting I haue
good cause to remembre that <hi>Truthe purchaseth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi>
so in the commending of the same I can not
forgett that a younge scholer, and base subiect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth
to talke vvith a right mighty Princesse
and his lerned Souuerain. Notvvithstanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the invvarde man and better portion off
my selfe, I haue to comforte me bothe in the one,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:3"/>
and in the other. In the one, respect of the profit
vvhich may arise hereby to the deceiued conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of my dere countreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your highnes subiectes,
my regard to Gods honour and zeale to the truth
do make me lesse to feare the displeasure that may
ensue. In the other your highnes most gratiouse
Clemency, and knovven good affection to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the truth, enboldeth me to present par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to your most Royall Maiesty, that vvhich
I publish to the vvhole Realmes commodite. For
as that vvhich the body receiueth, the Head first
vevveth and considereth, so thought I most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
that the generall history of the realme off
England shoulde first be commended to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely
head and Souuerain gouuernour of the same.
Againe, the history in Latin being dedicated by
the Author to a kinge of this realme, one of your
most Noble progenitours, it semed no lesse then
duty, that the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and nevv publishing of it
ought to come forth vnder your highnes protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
succeding in the Imperial Crovvne of the same.</p>
            <p>The matter of the History is such, that if it may
stande vvith your Maiesties pleasure to vevve
and consider the same in vvhole or in part, your
highnes shall clerely see as vvell the misse informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a fevve for displacing the auncient and
right Christen faith, as also the vvay and meane of
a spedy redresse that may be had for the same, to
the quietnesse of the greater part of your Maiesties
<pb facs="tcp:1516:3"/>
most loyal and lovvly subiectes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences. In this
history it shall appeare in vvhat faith your noble
Realme vvas christened, and hath almost these
thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinevved: to the glory of God, the
enriching of the crovvne, and great vvelth and qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>et
of the realme. In this history your highnes shall
see in hovv many and vveighty pointes the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
refourmers of the church in your Graces do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
haue departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the patern of that soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
and catholike faith planted first among Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemen
by holy S. Augustin our Apostle, and his
vertuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, described truly and sincerely by
<hi>Venerable Bede,</hi> so called in all Christendom for his
passing vertues and rare lerning, the Author of this
History. And to thentent your highnes intention
bent to vveightier considerations and affaires may
spende no longe time in espying oute the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
I haue gathered out of the vvhole History a
number of diuersities betvvene the pretended reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Protestants, and the primitiue faith of the
english church, and haue annexed them streight
ioyning to this our simple preface. Maie it please
your most gracious highnes to take a short vevv of
it, and for more ample intelligence of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
(if it shall so like your highnesse) to haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the booke and chapter quoted.</p>
            <p>Beside the vvhole history of holy and lerned S.
Bede, I haue published a short and necessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to mete vvith the only argument of such as
<pb facs="tcp:1516:4"/>
vvill pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this vvhole booke to be but a fard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of papistry, a vvitnesse of corrupted doctrine, a
testimony of that age and time vvhich they haue
already conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for the time of no true Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
at all: of such I saie as haue altered the faith vve
vvere first Christened in, condemning our dere
forefathers of allmost these thousand yeares, the
Christen inhabitants of your graces dominions.
This I haue done principally in ij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> partes. In the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
by expresse testimonies of holy Scripture, the
psalmes, the prophets, and the nevv Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by
remouing the obiections of the aduersaries taken
out of holy Scripture, by the glorious successe of
these later 900. yeares in multiplying the faithe of
Christ through the vvorlde, last of all by clere and
euident reasons I haue proued that the faith of vs
Englishmen all these ix c. hundred yeares, coulde
not possibly be a corrupted faith, traded vp in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
blindnesse, and idolatry, as it is falsely
and vvickedly surmised of many, but that it is the
true and right Christianite no lesse then the firste
vj. c. yeares, and immediat succession of the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.
In the second part, vvhere vve gather a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of differences in doctrine, in ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
in the order and maner of proceding,
in the course and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of both religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I haue shevved by the testimonies of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
<pb facs="tcp:1516:4"/>
auncient and approued Fathers, of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and histories of that time, that in all such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
our faith first planted and hitherto conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevved

proued first out of Gods holy vvorde and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

ready redresse of present schismes, a compendious
quieting of troubled consciences, and an open pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
to returne to the faith, vvithoute vvhiche is no
saluation. As vve knovve right vvell, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

I beseche the same, to beholde a fevve examples
of the most puissant Princes that haue ben in
Christendom, vvhich in that singular vertu haue
principally excelled.</p>
            <p>At vvhat time Princes and Emperours (hauing
certaine hundred yeares fought and striued all in
vaine against the light of the ghospel and publis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing
of Christen religion) beganne at length them
<pb facs="tcp:1516:5"/>
selues to take the svvete yoke of Christe, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their Sceptres to his holy Crosse, and ioyning
deuoute humilite vvith vvordly policie began to
procure their soule helth, and to prouide for the
vvorlde to come, then the prophecy of Esaie vvas
in them fullfilled saying to the churche of Christ.
<hi>Beholde I will stretche out mine hande to the gentils, and sett

possible and semely to his princely vocation to

            <p>THe kingdom of heauen is compared in holy scripture
(christen Reader) to a marchant aduenturer, whiche
seking and trauailing to finde precious stones,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> hauing
at length founde out one of singular and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
value, goeth and selleth al that he hath to bye that one. What
this singular and most excellent perle is, whereunto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen is compared, if we weigh and ponder diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we shall finde it to be no other thing, then the <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
Iesus,</hi> whereby the kingdom of heauen is vndoubtedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.
This perle is of price so singular, and of value so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
that to gett it we sell al that we haue, we renounce the
worlde, the fleshe and the diuell with all the pompe thereoff,
we cleaue onely to this, we professe to lyue and dye in it.
This precious pearle off <hi>Fayth,</hi> this singular iewell of true
belefe, this heauenly treasure off the right knoweleadge
off God and off his commaundements, as all nations att
one tyme receyued nott,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> God off hys secrett and right iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
sufferring the Nations to walke on their waies, but in
seuerall ages, and by seuerall meanes, as and when it pleased
God was opened and made manifest, so haue al nations not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that, solde all which they had, yelding and submitting
them selues only and wholly thereto, but also haue stedfastly
and assuredly cleaued vnto it, haue by longe succession preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it, and enioyed it. If any haue in time vtterly lost this most
excellent and rare iewell (as we see, alas, all the Southe and all
most all the East part of the worlde hath) the cause thereof
hath ben the alteration, and new deuised furbishing of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
from the former and natural shape thereof, first and formest
receiued. Such nations and partes of the worlde as haue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:1516:14"/>
ages and, do yet kepe and enioy this riche and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treasure, do therefore yet kepe it and enioye it bicause they
continew and remaine in it after such order and maner only,
as they receiued it: bicause they kepe it as they founde it, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
they continue it, as they begonne it. Of the first if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
the breaking in of the Wandals in to Afrike about the
yeare of our Lorde 400. men soone after infected with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
haeresy, if we call to minde the great rage and tumult of
heresies, in the Greke Churche, Arrians, Macedonians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,
Monothelites, and a numbre of such other, if we
will truste the reporte and course of Hystories thereof, we shall
euidently see, that this inestimable iewell off the Christen
faithe hath in Afrike and Grece vtterlye ben loste, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
they departed from the first paterne deliuered vnto them,
bicause they altered the faith first receiued amonge them,
brefely bicause they yelded to heresies. Of the later if we haue
an eye to the vniformite of the Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith first receiued in al
such countres as yet remaine Christians, with the faith first
planted and graffed amonge them, if we looke to Italy, to Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce,
to Spaine, to the catholike territories of Grece, of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of Suicerland, to the kingdomes of Poole, of Portugall, and
of other maine landes in other places off the worlde dispersed,
where the precious iewell of this faith is knowen and enioyed,
we shall finde that all those countres haue and do therefore yet
continew in the same, bicause they varie not from the first
faith receiued, bicause they mangle not the iewell geuen vnto
them, neither alter the naturall shape thereof, brefely bicause
they beleue al one thinge and after one sorte as their first tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Apostles beleued and taught them. For why? They
haue well reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the admonitions of S. Paule to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians

And as many as haue remembred and folowed them, haue

of our owne deuising, no late compiled matter, where bothe for

might iustly be suspected, but it shal be an history writen in the

            <p>Touching the Author of this History, he was a countrema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of oures borne in the Northe countre, by Weimouth not farre
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dyrrha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Of the Author of this History.</note> He flourished in the yere 730. He was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great
lerning and vertu, much reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced not only at home, but also
through out al Christendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his life, time and much more
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:1516:15"/>
after his death. Of his rare lerning and knowleadg his writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
yett extant,<note place="margin">Of his lerning.</note> are a clere and sufficient testimony. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
of Basill haue of late yeares sett forthe his whole
workes now extant, in eight tomes contayning four great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.
In them it appeareth that S. Bede was a man vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
sene in all good lerning, as well of humanite and philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
as of diuinite, expert off the tounges, ready in holy
scriptures, perfectly conuersant in the olde fathers. He was so
great a folower of S. Augustin, the worthyest piller of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
sence the Apostles time, that his commentaries vpon holy
Scriptures bothe of the olde and newe Testament, are allmost
worde for worde out of S. Augustin. He was so diligent a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that lerned Father, that whereas in the wordes of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
no perpetuall commentary vpon the epistles of S. Paule
being extant, and yet that worthy Fathers in diuers places of
his lerned workes hauing by occasion touched and expounded
euery text of those epistles, <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> for the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his posterite, as a man borne to edifie Christes Church,
hath so gathered those scattered places out of the mayne sea off
S. Augustins workes, that placing them in order and facion, he
made a iust and full commentary vpon all the epistles of S. Paul
with S. Augustins owne wordes, noting to the reader allwaies
the booke and chapter of S. Augustin, from whence he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
those places. This worke is intituled <hi>Collectanea Bedae.</hi> In
which worthy worke, we may doubte whom to maruaile more
at or commend. S. Augustin which had so ofte in his workes
treated of S. Paul, and omitted no one sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnexpounded, or
S. Bede which so gathered into a iust commentary the sayinges
of S. Augustin, meaning no such thinge. As S. Bede was a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
writer, so he was a continuall preacher. His homelies yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
do testifie, made not only vpon the ghospells and epistles
of the Sondaies through out the yeare but also vpon the festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
daies of Saintes. They are to be read in the seuenth tome
<pb facs="tcp:1516:16"/>
of his workes. These homilies of his were so highly estemed
that (as Trithemius reporteth) they were openly read in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Lib. de scri. ecclesiasti.</note>
while he yet lyued, through out our countre. Euen as we
reade of holy Ephrem that lerned deacon of Edessa, that his
writinges also were openly read in churches,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Cata. vir. illust.</note> next after holy
scripture. After his death they were receiued of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Christendom, Fraunce especially (as Platin noteth)
and are to this daye read in principall festes with no lesse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite
and reuerence then the homilies of S. Ambrose,<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note> S.
Augustin, S. Gregory, and other. Briefely the whole occupation
and businesse of this lerned man was, to lerne, to teache and to
write, as in his owne wordes placed after the ende of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he recordeth him selfe. Againe for the more commendation
of his lerning, it is to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred what lerned scholers he had.
Amonge the rest the most famous were (as Polidore specifieth)
Rabanus,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Histor.</note> Alcuinus, Claudius, and Ioannes Scotus, not the
scholeman but an other of S. Benets order. These were all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and lerned writers, as in Trithemius who hath write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
liues the lerned may reade. Alcuinus S. Bedes scholer beinge
sent of Offa kinge of the middleenglishmen in embassage to
Charlemain the first and most glorious Emperour of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
was for his vertu and lerning retained with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and became his scholemaster and instructer in all kinde
of good lerning. He taught after at Paris, and persuaded the
Emperour Charlemain to erect there an vniuersite: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with that vertuous fountaine S. Bedes scholer and our
countre man, we see now to what a great riuer it hath multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and how many lerned men these vij. hundred yeares and
vpwarde haue from thence ben deriued. To returne to S. Bede,
he had two lerned brothers, <hi>Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Haymo</hi> bothe famous
writers and lightes of the church, as in Honorius, Trithemius,
Platin,<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note> and other ecclesiasticall writers it may be sene. And thus
much of his lerning, which who list farder to trie, he may reade
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1516:16"/>
his lerned workes, lately sett forth (as I saied) and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the protestants the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues of Basill. For more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the english reader, I will after the preface place his whole
life shortly writen by Trithemius, with the enumeration of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his workes in his time knowen.</p>
            <p>As touching the vertu of holy S. Bede,<note place="margin">Of his vertu.</note> which properly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
an historiographer, and dischargeth him from all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and suspicions of false reporting or poeticall fayning, yt
may be to any well meaning man a sufficient argument that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the age of seuen yeares (as he writeth him selfe)
he liued in cloyster and serued allmighty God day and night in
religion to the last houre of his life, which was the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce
of lxv. yeares. All which time he so attended to praier, to
daily and howrely seruing of God in the church, to priuat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, that (as one writeth) if ye consider his life, ye would
thinke he had studied nothing, and againe if ye beholde his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ye would suppose he had spent no time in praier. For his
great vertu and modesty he was in his life time called <hi>Venerable
Bede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In vitae Bedae.</note> as Trithemius noteth, of whom also Platina in that sence
speaketh, saying.<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note>

Bede an english man, then whom none more chaste, none off

credit with the Nobilite of our countre, but also he was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
with other Christen princes (being but a monke by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
<pb facs="tcp:1516:17"/>
in greate estimation and muche reuerenced. Therefore
lyke as we reade of S. Antony, S. Hierom, before his tyme,<note place="margin">Tripart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that in their priuat celles they had yet a care of publike quyet,

               <hi>Cum Africa &amp; Hispania á Sarracenis

               </gap>mented this calamite in letters writen to
Christen Princes, to the entent that they should make warres
against the enemies of God and men. Wherein bothe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
zele and religions care of common quiet in holy S.
Bede appereth, and the authorite also whiche he hadd abrode
with other Christen princes is signified. Vnto whom also a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
before his death in familiar letters he prophecied of the great
waste of Europe and the West church, whiche soone after his
death ensued by the Sarazens. For as Afrike by their meanes
lost the faith and lacketh it yet, so Spayne off late only recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the faith againe. Thus muche off his learning and vertu.
Other especialls of his life, as where he was borne, howe he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

which we haue translated and placed a part after the

            <p>The Authour of this history being a man of suche lerning
and vertu, a countreman of oures, one that writeth the history
of thinges done at home, done in his lyfe time, or in few yeares

He is an indifferent reporter. There is no suspicion of partes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

other, whiche are knowen to maintaine a faction and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

be made of S. Bede, who lyued aboue eight hundred yeares pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,

like spiders. Reade it with charitable simplicite, not with
suspicious curiosite, with vertuous charite, not with wicked

in the seconde booke the first chapter of this history reporting
how that holy man seing in Rome certain of our countremen

holy S. Bede writeth diligently as an argument of his greate
good zele and tendering of Christes religion, and construeth
it to the beste, as no honest Reader can other wyse do. But
baudy Bale according to the cleanes of his sprit and holy
ghospell, like a venimous spider being filthy and vncleane him

            <p>In this history it shal be no losse time to peruse the lerned,

obseruation of Easter, which al Christendom hetherto kepeth,

the lewde lies and slaunderous reproches of protestants daily
preaching and writing that after <hi>S.</hi> Gregory al faith was lost,
Gods honour was trode vnder foote, all right religion was

God geueth giftes of the holy Ghoste to the godly, and more
excellent to such as excell in godlynes. And this I speake to
them which are not acquainted with the secret works of God.

stagger, to beleue the miraculous workes of Moyses, of Iosue,
of Elias and of Elizeus. Yea the miraculous workes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
he will accompt for very fables. Otherwise, if he wil
beleue those other thinges to be al true, why wil he mistrust
these for false? For the same grace of god which wrought in the

they did. For this grace being continual and euer running, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

and that by the spirit of prophecy he foreknew all this, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
promised before to her husbande that he woulde see her.
For iff he hym selfe was present to the woman in her drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
truly that was done by miraculous grace not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the ghifte off God, not by his owne power. But iff
he being otherwise occupied, or sleaping hym selfe, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
with other phantasies, yet the woman sawe hym in her
sleape, truly then it semeth not much vnlike to that we
reade in the Actes of the Apostles, where our Sauiour speaketh
to Ananias of Saul,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> and telleth him, that Saule did see Ananias
coming toward him, Ananias him self not knowing any thing
thereof. Which so euer of all these that man of God should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
vnto me, I would farder yet aske him touching the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
whither they them selues be present in visions, or by some
other meanes do appeare to such as see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in what forme they
list, and specially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deuils in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bodies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that they
are tormented of them, and desire them to spare them, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all these thinges be done at the will of God by the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
powres for the honour and commendation of Saints, and
for the profitt of men, the martyrs them selues being in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,
in most perfect quiett, occupied with more excellent sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
seuerally from vs and praying so for vs. For at Millain also
at the toumes of the holy Martyrs Protasius and Geruasius, the
deuills naming them, as also other departed men, confessed also

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1516:22"/>
the bishop then being otherwise occupied, and not knowing at
all thereof. Last of al whither these thinges be some times done
by the very presence of the Martyrs, sometime by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Angels, and then whither it may be discerned of vs, and by
what tokens we may discerne it, or whither none els can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it, but such as hath that gift by the Spirit of God diuiding
peculiarly to euery one as he willeth.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> Al these thinges, I thinke,
this Iohn would discusse and declare vnto me: that either at his
teaching I might lerne and knowe such thinges to be true and
certain, or els I might beleue without knowleadge, he teaching
yet such thinges as he knew. But if perhaps he would answere
to all these my doubtes out of holy scripture, and saie vnto me.<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note>
Seke not such things as passe your capacite, nor serche not after

               <hi>Non enim paruus est fructus, si aliqua

putans prodesse si sciat, discat non obesse si nesciat.</hi> For it is no small
profitt, if in such darke and doubtefull matters as by reason we
can not finde, yet we may clerely and euidently see that such
thinges are not by reason to be founde. And that euery one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to knowe, thinking such knowleadge might profitt him,
may lerne it is nedelesse to knowe, which he can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
knowe. Thus farre S. Augustin in that place, beleuing the
miraculous operations of holy Martyrs, and visions of holy
men, though he could not attaine to the reason of either other.
In like maner he beleueth that S. Felix the holy Confessour off
Nola,<note place="margin">Lib. eodem Cap. 16.</note> when that cyte was greuously assieged, <hi>non solis beneficio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

such miracles holy and lerned men sticke not to beleue,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:23"/>
though the reason therof they perce not vnto. And euen so such
holy and miraculous examples as abund in this History, though
they can not perhaps sinke in to the hartes of protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, whose
faith is limited by reason, and builded vpon wordly witt, yet
Catholikes which haue lerned of S. Paule <hi>to subdue their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> and whose faith is guided by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

easely beleue the report of so holy and lerned a man,<note place="margin">Heretikes will not beleue mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles.</note> as <hi>Venerable
Bede</hi> in all Christendom hath these many hundred yeares ben
accompted. Let protestants folowe the Arrians, which when a
blinde man was restored to sight at the toumes of S. Geruasius
and Protasius at Millain S. Ambrose then being bishop,<note place="margin">Confes. lib.</note> and S.
Augustin not yet christened being then present also, saied yet

they can not torment the deuill, they can not helpe men.
And againe. <hi>Ariani dicunt. Non sunt daemonum vera tormenta,
sed ficta &amp; composita ludibria.</hi> The Arrians do saie. These are not
true torments of the deuills, but fayned and imagined illusions.
Let protestants folow their forefathers, olde cursed heretikes,
let them scoffe at the miracles done at the toume of S. Alban
that holy Martyr, and of S. Cutbert that holy Confessour. We
will with Theodoret, with S. Augustin and with S. Ambrose
beleue such vertu and miraculous power of holy Martyrs and
Confessours mentioned by <hi>Venerable Bede,</hi> as they beleued the
report of good men, before them.</p>
            <p>For the farder contentation of the Reader in this pointe,
beside all whiche hath ben saied, we shall in the history it selfe,

note in the margin other lyke examples auouched by
the most approued writers of the primitiue churche. To make

cauilles of protestants, bicause of the miracles here repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

miracles such as they be, are to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And to speake somwhat
particularly, he that in this history will discredit such miracles
as S. Bede reporteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> report of one brother or sister, let him
geue a reason why he beleueth the tale of Elyzabeth Lawnson
and Symo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Harlston.<note place="margin">Pag. 1677.</note> Who mistrusteth miracles reported vpon
coniecture, let him, considre the miracle tolde of Tindall.<note place="margin">Pag. 520.</note> If it
seme incredible that the bodyes of dead men may remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted

al that are present seme fabulous,<note place="margin">Pag. 355.</note> let it be a fable (as in dede it is,
being thereof eye witnesse my selfe) that he telleth of Latimers
hart bloud, when he suffred in Oxford. Iff the Crosse of saint
Oswalde seme a superstitious tale, how much more fonde and
fabulous is the tale of one that suffred at Bramford,<note place="margin">Pa, 1670.</note> with a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

truth with falshood, light with darknes, true miracles with
light tales, we see as much vncredibilite, if we looke to reason,
as great vanite in respect of the matter it self, in the one as in the
other. But how farre more credit this auncient history of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable

            <head>THE LIFE OF S. BEDE: WRITEN BY TRITHEMIVS.</head>
            <p>BEde a monke and priest of the monastery of S. Peter
and Paul, of S. Benets order in England, a man in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture much conuersant and very well lerned.
In other good lerning of great knowleadg. As in philosophie,
Astronomie, Algorisme and Poetry. Skilful of the greke toung:
of an excellent witt. His tounge and stile not curious, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
and semely. He wrote many volumes in the which his
witt and lerning is tried. This man at the age of seuen yeares,
was by his frendes committed to Benedictus, and after to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olfridus
the Abbbat of the forsaied monastery, at<note n="*" place="margin">At VVei mouth at the riuer VVere whiche runneth by Dyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</note> Murmouth,
to be brought vp and instructed. From the which age continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all daies of his life in that monastery, he bestowed all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the study of holy scripture. And obseruing with all
the rule of his order, singing daily gods seruice in the church, in
the rest he delighted allwaies, to lerne, to teache, or to write. In
the nintenth yere of his age he was ordred deacon. In the xxx.
yere he was made priest. Bothe which orders he receiued at the

were openly read in Churches, by the appointment of the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

the church, bearing the name of the Author, as the maner is,
were intituled <hi>The homelies of the venerable priest Bede,</hi> not being

            <p>THE History of thinges don in the church of
the Englishe nation which of late I had set
fourth, I did both first very gladly send your
grace desiring then to haue a sight and proufe
therof, and now againe do send it you, to the
entent you may both coppy it out, and more fully at your le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
consider it. I can not but highly commend this yower ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
and good desyre you haue not only to geue good eare to the
holyscriptures, but also to know of things both don and spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by worthy men before your time, and specially of our owne
country. For whither an history containeth good thinges don
by good men, the wise hearer is therby prouoked to wel doing:
ether reporteth euill things don by euil men, the vertuous and
wel disposed reader neuerthelesse is moued therby both to flye
that is euill and noisom to his soule, and embrace the thinge
he knoweth to be good and acceptable vnto God. Which thing
you wisely pondering, desire to haue the sayd history published
both to the instruction of your selfe, and also to the edifieng of
such other whom God hath committed vnto your gouernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
And to thentent I may put both your grace and all other
that shall heare or reade it, out of all doubt of the verite of the
sayd History, I will briefly shew you what authours I haue
chiefely folowed in the making therof. The chiefest authour
and aider I had in compiling this worke, was the right reuerent
abbat <hi>Albinus,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great learning, which being brought vp
in the church of Canterbury vnder <hi>Theodorus</hi> Archebishop of
blessed memory, and <hi>Adrianus</hi> abbat, both me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great worship
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1516:26"/>
and learning, hath procured and sent vnto me al such thinges as
wer don by Saint Gregory the Popes disciples, ether in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
of ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ether other places adioyning and bordering vpon
the same. Which thinges the said Abbate hath learned partly by
writinges partly also by tradition of elders, and such things as
he hath in such sorte learned, he hath sent vnto me by the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of <hi>Nothelmus</hi> priest of the church of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be receiued
ether in writting ether by mouth and relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the said <hi>Nothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
Which also going after vnto Rome was permitted by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
bishop, which is now head of that church, to search the
closettes of the saied holy church of Rome, where he founde
out certaine epistles of saint Gregorie and other bishops there,
and at his returne hath deliuered vnto vs the sayd epistles to be
put in to our history with the counsell and aduise of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
father <hi>Albine</hi> aboue mencioned. So that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this booke vnto the time that the countrye of England
receiued the faith of Christe, we learned such thinges as we
bring, gathered out of the workes of such as had wrote thereof
before our time. And from thence vnto this present such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as hath ben don in the church and diocese of Canterbury
by the disciples of Saint Gregory or their successors, or vnder
what kinge they haue ben done, we haue knowen by the
industrie of the sayd Abbate Albine, at the reporte of <hi>Nothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
who also hath brought me in sum parte of knowledge of
such things as wer don in the prouinces of the<note n="a" place="margin">Essex.</note> east and<note n="b" place="margin">Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury. Exceter VVelles.</note> west

is to wit, by what bishops preaching, and vnder what king
ech of the said prouinces wer conuerted vnto the faith of Christ.
And to be shorte, by the exhortation of the sayd Albine, I was

not only made warme therby but also skalding whot. This Iland
is stored wyth mynes of sundry metalles, as of brasse, lead, iron,

the fire, and then is of vertu good to chase away serpentes. If you
rub him till he be warme, he holdeth fast such thinges as ar layd
vnto him euen as Aumber doth. This Iland had in it sumtimes
xxviij fayre cities, beside an innumerable sort of castles whiche
also wer well and strongly fensyd wyth walles, turrettes, gates,
and bullwarkes. And for as much as it is placed right in manner
vnder the north pole, it hath light nightes in the sommer, so that

This Iland at this present to the number of the v. bookes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wyth v. sundry languages doth study and set furth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

the Britannes, the Scotts, the<note n="*" place="margin">The Redshan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> Pictes, and the latine, which
by study of the scriptures is made common to all the rest. At the
first this land was inhabited of none other nation but only of
the Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, of whom it receiueth his name: which Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
out of <hi>Armorica</hi> (called now litle Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny) as it is thought,
chose vnto them selues the sowth parte of this land. And after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1516:28"/>
when they from the sowth forward had in their possession a
great parte of the Ile, it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that certaine people of the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
coming owt of Scythia, as it is sayd, trauailing vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seas
with a few long shippes, the winde dryuing them in cumpasse
rownde about the coaste of Britannye, blewe them a land on
Irelands syde, on the north partes therof. Which they finding
inhabited of the Scottes, besought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to allow them some part
of the land, where they might plante them selues. But they coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
not obtayne their desire. This Ireland, next vnto Britanny is
the greatest lland of the Oceane sea, and standeth westward of
Britanny. But as Northward it is not so longe as it, so westward
it is much longer, and reacheth vnto the North partes of Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
hauing the mayne sea runnyng betwext. The Pictes (as I
haue sayd) arriuing wyth their nauy in Ireland, required of the
inhabitants, that they might be suffered, there to rest and place
them selues. The Scottes aunsered that the Iland was not bigg
inowgh to hold them both. But we can geue you good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
(quoth they) what we thynke best for you to doe. We
know well there is an other Iland not farre from oures stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
easte ward from hence, which we may see owt of this land
in a fayer sonnye day. If you will goe thether, you may inhabit
ther at will. And if there be any resistance made against you, we
wil ayde you. Whervpon the Pictes arriuing in Britanny plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them selues in the North partes therof. For as for the sowth
partes the Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes had taken vpp before. And wheras the Pictes
hauing no wyues did require of the Scottes to marry their
dawghters, the Skottes agreed to graunt them their bone, vnder
condition, that as often as the matter was in dowt, they should
choose their kyng rather of the next of the howse of the woman
then of the man. Which order, it is well knowen the Pictes
kepeth euen to this day. In processe of yeres, after the Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and
the Pictes, the Skottes also wer receiued in to Britanny amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the
Pictes. Which coming owt of Ireland vnder Rewda their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:29"/>
either by force or frendship, entered and inhabited the
country in Scotland, which they possessed. Of which capitaine
euen vnto this day they ar callid <hi>dall reudini,</hi> for in their langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

skant iij. dayse to gether: and no man there for foddering of his
beastes, ether maketh hay in the sommer, or buyldeth stawles for
his cattaile. There is no noysom creping beast to be sene there,
no serpent that can liue there. For many times serpentes which
hath ben brought thether owt of Britanny, the ship drawing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
vnto the land, as sone as they ar towched wyth the smell of
the ayer, they dieth owt of hand. Yea more then that, all thing in
maner that cometh from the sayd Iland, is of souerayne vertue
against poyson. And this we sawe with oure eyes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
men, that wer stinged of venemous serpents, had taken the
scraping of certaine leaues of bookes which had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and
had dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke it in water, forthwyth all the force of the venim was
staynched, and the swelling of the stinged bodies vtterly asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
This Iland is rich in milk and hony, nor voyd of vines, fish
or foule, and full of stagges. This is properly the country of the
Skottes, owt of the which they isshuing hath inhabited Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny
being before possessed of the Britons and the Pictes. Ther is a
great creke of the sea whiche seuered of ould time the Britons
from the Pictes, which from the west runneth far in to the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
Where vnto this day there is a citty of the Britons very stronge
and well fensed called <hi>Alcuith.</hi> At the north side of the which

with anger for that he feared not voluntarily to offer him selfe
vnto the souldiars and perell of death, for his geste, whom he
had harbored, he commaunded him to be brought before the

suffer, if thou refuse to practise the rites of ower religion. But

all beaten of the tormentours, thinking his constance would
relent at strypes, which refused to yeld to words: but he shewed
him self not only patient, but also ioyful in the middle of all his
torments. The iudge when he sawe he could be nether won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

of Christes faith, commaunded that he should be behedded.
In the way as he was ledd to his death, he came to a floudde
which with a very swift course ranne betwixt him and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
where he should suffer. Now he saw a great company of all
sexes, degrees, and ages going with him to the place of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
in so much that it semed the iudge was left alone at
home without any to attend vppon him. This company was
so great, and the bridge they had to passe ouer so litle, that it
would be toward night, er they all could get ouer. Albane lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
much for his blessed death, and hasting to his Martyrdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
cumming to the riuers side and making there his prayer
with lifting vp his eyes and harte to heauen, sawe furth wyth
the bottom to haue bin dried vp, and the water geue place for
him and the people to passe ouer dryshod as it were vpon euen
grownde. Which when among other the executioner which
should haue beheddid him did see, he made hast to mete him, at
the place appointed for his death, and there (not without the
holy inspiration of God) he fell downe flat before his feete, and
casting from him the sword which he held in his hande ready
drawen, desired rather that he might be executioned ether for
him or with him, rather then to do execution vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Where
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being now made a fellow of that faith wher of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other officers staggering and doubting all who might
take it vpp and doe the execution, the holy confessor of God
with the people there assembled went vnto a hill almost half a
mile of from that place beautifully garnished with diuers her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
and flowers not rough or vneasy to climme, but smothe,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:33"/>
plaine and delectable, worthy and mete to be sanctified with
the blood of the blessed Martyr, vnto the the top where of
when he was ascended, he required of God to giue him water:
and strayt there arose a spryng of fayer water before his feete
whereby all might perceaue that the riuer before was by his
meanes dried. For he which left no water in the riuer, would
not haue required it in the topp of the mowntaine, but that it
was so expedient, for the glory of God in his holy martyr.
For beholde the riuer hauing obeyed the Martyr, and serued
his deuotion, leauing behinde a testimony of duty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(the Martyr hauing now suffered) returned to his nature
againe. Here therfore this most valiaunt martyr being behed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
receiued the crowne of life which God promiseth to them
that loue him. But he which there tooke vppon him to doe
that wicked execution, had short ioy of his naughty deede: for
his eyes fel vnto the ground with the head of the holy martyr.
There also was behedded the souldiour which being called of
God refused to stryke the holy confessor of God: of whom it
is open and playne, that though he was not Christened in the
fount, yet he was baptised iu the bath of his owne blud, and so
made worthy to enter in to the kingdome of heuen. Now the

his father. It is also forebidden the to marry with thy brothers
wife, for that by her former mariage she was one flesh with
thy brother, for whiche cause Iohn Baptiste was behedded
and suffered holy martyrdome. To whom though it was not
sayd, that he should deny Christe, yet was he killed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

I am the truth, for that he was killed for the truth, he shed his

English people, which whiles they were yet infideles, were thus
vnlawfully coupled, when they commeth to the faith they are

the communion of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
least you may seeme to punish such thinges in them, which
they committed by ignorance before their baptisme. For at
this present time the holy church with a zele doth punish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
thinges, some other of a mekenes it doth tolerat, at some
other it winketh vppon consideration. Yea it so beareth and
dissembleth, that the euill which it hateth, by bearing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
it redresseth. All such as commeth to the faith, ar
to be warned that they committe no such thing, and if they
then doe, they are to be restrained from receiuing the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
For as they are sumwhat to be borne withall which of ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

                  <hi>Gregorius aunswereth.</hi> In the church of England in which
thou only art as yet a bishop, thou canst ordaine none, but
without other bishops. For when come there any bishops oute
of Fraunce which might assist you in ordaining bishops? We
will therefore you ordaine bishops, but so that they may not
be one far from an other, that there be no such necessitie, but
that they may hereafter come together at the creation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Curats also whose presence may do good ought ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
come together. When then by the helpe of god, the bishops
shall be so made that they shall not be far a sunder one from
the other,<note place="margin">Of creati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> there shall be no bishop created without iij. or iiij.
bishops assembled together. For in spirituall matters howe
they may be wiselye and prouidently disposed, we may take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of carnall matters. We see when mariages ar solemnized
in the worlde, other that ar maried ar called there vnto that
such as were married before, should ioye with such as are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

entreating them, by counselling them, by geuing good

mindes of the euell disposed. For why? It is written in the law,
he that passeth through an other mans feilde, shall not thrust
his syckle in to his corne, but rubbe the eares with his hande,

rub of the chaffe of syn from gods corne, and by treating and

                  <hi>Augustines question.</hi> Whether a woman that is great with

                  <hi>Gregorius answereth.</hi> I doubt not but you haue ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
counsell in their matters, and I think also I haue made
you already aunswer herein. Yet that which youerselfe could
say and thinke herein, I think you wold haue it confirmed
with my aunswer. The woman with child, why should she not
be christened, seing to be teeming is no synne before the eyes
of allmighty God? For our first fathers, when they had syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in paradise by the right iudgment of God, they lost the
immortalite which they had receiued. And for so much as
God wold not vtterly destroy mankynd for his syn in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his syn, he tooke from him the benefite of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talite.
And yet of his mercy and goodnes he reserued vnto
him the encrease of issue. That then which of the gift of God
is reserued vnto the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by what reason should it be
restrained from the grace of baptisme? For in that sacrament
by the which all syn is vtterly taken away, it is great folly to
think any man to be restrayned from the gift of that grace
which is willing to receiue it. When the woman is deliuered,
how many daies after she shall cum to the church it is plaine
to be knowen by the commaundement of the ould testament
which saith thus.<note place="margin">Leuit. 12.</note>

is to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it is taken in mistery: for if the same hower
that she is deliuered she should cum to the church, she should
run in no danger of gods displeasure. For it is the pleasure
of the flesh not the paine that causeth the syn. The plesure is
in begetting the childe, but bearing is the paine and trauaile.

wherof she is deliuered, yea the very first hower ether of the

So that the ould law doth punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hath to doe with
a woman being in that case. Which woman yet neuerthelesse
is not then forbidden to cum to the church, because the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluite
of nature can not be imputed for syn: and for that she
suffereth that against her will, it is no reason she should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the church. For we know that the
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was deseased with the bluddy flix coming hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly
behind our lord,<note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> touched the hem of his garment, and by
and by she was cured of her said infirmite. If then the woman
which had the bluddy flix, might laufully touch the garment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1516:51"/>
of our Lord, why may not she enter into the church which
suffereth her monethly flours? But you will say: as for her, her
malady forced her to seeke remedy, this other is taken of
her customable sycknes.<note place="margin">Of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infirmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties.</note> Consider this with thy selfe deare
brother, that all that we suffer in this mortall flesh by feblenes
of nature, it was by the iust iudgement of God ordained after
our syn. As hunger, thrist, heate, cold, werinesse, procedeth of
the infirmite of nature. And what other thing is it to seeke
foode against hunger, drinck against thirst, open ayre against
heate, garmente against colde, rest against wearinesse,
but to take medicine againste sycknes? So vnto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that monthly course of her body is a desease. If then
she did well presume which being sycke touched the garment
of our Lorde, that which is graunted to one woman, why
should it not be graunted vnto all other, which by nature ar
greued with like sycknesse? Nether shall she be forebidden in
the sayd daies to receiue the holy sacrament: but if of a great
reuerence which she hath there vnto, she will not presume to
receiue it, she is the more to be praised: but if she doe receiue
it, she is the lesse to be iudged.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For it is the point of well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
mindes there to acknoledg their fault sum times, where
there is none in dede. For many times that is committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fault, which yet proceded of a fault. Where vppon to eate
when we ar hungry is no faute, and yet hungar began and
sprange first of the syn of our first father. And that mounthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
custome is no syn to the woman, for that it happenyth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally.
But yet bycause nature is so corrupted, that without
the mans will, it semeth to be defiled, it had his first originall
of syn, and remaineth as a punishment, to thintent man might
now know what he is becum through the iustice of God by
syn. And that man which did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit sinne with his wil, should
feele the punishment of syn against his wil. And therfor we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
when they do consyder them selues herin, if they meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

which findeth him selfe possessed with vnchaste desires.
Though of this thinge diuers countries ar of diuers myndes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1516:52"/>
and sum vseth one thing, sum an other, yet the maner of the
Romans was euer of auncient time, after the company of
their owne wyues both to purify them selues in the bath, and
of reuerence a while to forbeare cumming in to the church.
We say not this for that we take mariage to be syn.<note place="margin">VVhether in the acte of maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge be any sinne.</note> But for
that the very laufull company of man and wife is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pleasure of the flesh: and that pleasure can not be all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without sum syn. For he was not borne of aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
or fornication but of laufull wedlocke which sayeth:<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I am begotten in iniquite, and my mother hath conceiued me
in syn.</hi> He which knewe him selfe to haue ben concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in syn, mourned to remember his synfull byrthe.
For the tree doth beare in his braunches, the corrupte humours
which he drew of the roote. In the which wordes yet he
dothe not call the carnall company of man and wife synne,
but the pleasure therein. For there be many thinges, whiche
of them selues be lawfull and allowable, and yet in the doing
of them we ar sumwhat defiled. As oftentimes being angry we
punish other mens faultes, whereby the calmnes of our mind is
troubled: and though it be well done that we doe, yet is it not
well that in doing it our minde is putt out of quiet.<note place="margin">Psal. 30.</note> For he was
angry with the vice of the offenders, which said, <hi>Myne eye is
troubled with anger.</hi> For whereas the minde can not lift him self
vp vnto the light of contemplation, except it be still and quiet,
therefore he sorowed to see his eye distempered with anger.
For while he was forced to looke downeward to punish the
transgressours, he was forced also to be withdrawen from the
contemplation of thinges which are aboue. So then it is a
commendable thing to be moued with anger against synne,
and yet is it a grief and a hinderance to the well disposed min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: for
in that he hath ben angry, he knoweth that he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
Wherefore, to come to the purpose, the right vse of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
company betwene man and wife, is to come together for
<pb facs="tcp:1516:53"/>
procreation of children, not for lust and pleasures sake. And if
any man doth vse his wife not for carnall pleasure, but to the
ende of procreation only, this man truly is to be left vnto his
owne discretion, both for comming vnto the church and also
for receiuing of the holy sacrament of the body and bloud of
our Lord. For he is not to be kept ether from the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which being in the fire yet can not be burned. But when
on the contrary, not the desire of issue, but the pleasure of the
body beareth the chiefest rule in the worke of copulation, they
haue both cause to bewaile their frailte. For thoughe the worde
of god did graunt them so much, yet doth it not so graunt it
them, that they should be out of feare of offence.<note place="margin">1. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

haue aboue sayd, saithe him to be defiled, and suffereth him not
to enter the church before euening, and not but first bathed.
Which thing the spirituall people otherwise vnderstanding,
shall take it in like sense as we haue aboue declared. For he is
deluded as it were by dreame, whiche being tempted with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenesse,
is defiled with true imaginations in his thought. But
he washith him selfe with water, that is, he washeth away with
teares the filth of his thoughtes: And except the fire of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
go out, let him take him selfe guilty as it were vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening.
But in this maner of elusions, there is a difference to
be had. For a man must narrouly search and discusse him selfe,
of what cause this thing commeth into his minde, when he is
a sleape. For sometimes it commeth of surfet, sometimes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluite
or weakenes of nature, and somtimes also of vncleane
thoughtes. When it commeth of the superfluite or infirmite of
nature, it is nothing at all to be feared. For the minde in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
case more soroweth that it hath willingly suffered, then that it
hath any thinge wittingly committed. But when it hath risen
thourow inordinat excesse of diet, wherby the vessels of these<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
humours ar replenished, the minde thereby is not cleare
and voide of fault: yet it is not guilty of so great fault, that the
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereby is to be withholden, ether from receiuing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
ether from saying of masse. Bicause it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
ether it is holy day, ether of necessite the partye must say mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
for that there is no other priest to be gotten in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
And if there be other at hand, yet the illusion comming
only of surfet, is no sufficient cause to make a man forbeare the
receite of the holy mysteries. Yet from the offering of the holy
sacrifice he ought (as I thinke) meekely forbeare, though not
from receiuing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:1516:54"/>
vncleane phantasies. And though the partye do not remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber,
that in his dreame he sustayned any such phantasies, yet by
his owne iudgement he is not guyltles, if in the dayes before, he
remembreth he had offended in gluttonous feding of the body.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But if it riseth of any foule thoughtes, which he had wakyng,
the offence is open and manifest of it self. For he doth see owt
of what roote that pollution did spring. For the euell that he
wittingly thought vppon, that vnwittingly he committed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But here agayne we must consider, whether that thought
sprang of suggestion, of delite, or of consent. For by these three
all maner of synne is fulfilled. Suggestion is by the diuel, delite
by the flesh:<note place="margin">Suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Delight. Consent.</note> consente by the spirite: The diuell was the first
prompter to synne. Eua as it wer the flesh took delite therin.
Adam as it wer the spirite consented. And herin is requisite
great discretion, that the mynde as iudge ouer him selfe should
discerne betwext suggestion and delite, betwext delite and
consent. For when the wycked fend doth rayse the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto synne in ower harte,<note place="margin">How sin bredeth in the har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> if there follow no delite therin
in the mynde, there is no synne at all committed. But when
the flesh begynneth to take delite therin, then synne begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to springe: If then aduisedly he doth agree thereunto,
then syn is perfyted. So that in suggestion is the begynning, in
delite the feeding, in consent the finishing of synne. And it
ofte chaunceth that the euill, that the diuell soweth in the
thought, the flesh therin deliteth, add yet the soule doth not
agree ther vnto. And though the flesh can fele no delite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the soule, yet the soule stryuing against the pleasures of
the flesh, is against his will hampred with the plesure of the
flesh in such sorte, that with reason he doth gaynsaye and not
agree vnto it, and yet is bound with delite, but so that he much
lamenteth his bande. Wher vppon that principall champion
of the heauenly army S. Paule, bewayled him selfe saying:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>I

If he wer prisoner, then he did not fight: and if he did fight
why was he prisoner? He then stryued wyth the law of his
mynd, against the which the lawe of his flesh dyd fyght. Then
if he fought, he was not in bondes. Man therefore is both bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

Writing thus. Vnto his deare beloued son Mellitus abbat,

bring you vnto our reuerend brother <hi>Augustine</hi> bishop tell
him, what I haue of longe time deuised with my selfe of the
cause of the English men.<note place="margin">Holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aultars and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note> That is to with that not the temples
of the Idols, but the Idoles which be in them be broken, that
holy water be made and sprinkled about the same temples, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
buylded, relikes placed. For if the sayd churches be well
made, it is nedefull that they be altered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worshipping of
diuels in to the seruice of God: that whiles the people doth not
see their temples spoiled, they may (forsaking their error) be
moued the more ofte to haunt their wont place to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and seruice of God. And for that they are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te to kill oxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in sacrifice to the diuells, they shal vse the same slaughter now,
but chaunged to a better purpose. It may therefore be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, that in the dedication dayes or other solemne daies
of martyrs, they maketh them bowers about their churches,
and feasting together after a good religious sorte, kill their ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
now to the refreshing of them selues, to the praise of God,
and encrease of charite, which before they wer wont to offer
vp in sacrifice to the diuells: that whiles sum outward comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ar reserued vnto them, they may thereby be brought the
rather to the inward comfortes of grace in God. For it is dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
impossible from men being so rooted in euell customes,
to cut of all their abuses vppon the sodaine. He that laboreth
to clim vpp vnto a highe place, he goeth vpward by steppes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1516:56"/>
and pases, not by leapes. So vnto the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel being in
Aegipt our Lord was wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yet he suffered them to
doe sacrifice vnto him still in offring vp of beastes vnto him,
which otherwise they wold haue offered vpp vnto the diuels,
as they wer wont to doe in the land of Egypt, that altering
their intente, they should leue sum, and also kepe sum of their
ould sacrifices: that is, that the beastes which they offred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they should now offer still. But yet in offring them vnto
the true God, and not vnto the diuels they should not be the
same sacrifices in all pointes as they wer before. These be the
thinges which I think expedient you declare vnto our sayd

Wherevpon it is nedefull that of that heauenly gifte, both thou

that by meanes of the said miracles the Englishmens soules are
wonne to the faith. Thou hast to feare, leste through the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which be don by thee, thy weake mind be lifted vp in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption

and. 10. dayes) departed this lyfe, and was
translated to the eternall seate of the kyngdome of heauen.
Of whome it becometh me in this our historie of the churche
of England more largely to speake: bycause by his diligence he
conuerted our nation, that is, the Engleshmen from the powre
of Satan, to the fayth of Christ. Whome we maye well, and
also must call our Apostle. For as sone as he was high Bishop

lately conuerted to the belefe of the trueth, he made our
nation the churche of Christe, which had ben euer vntill that

of him the sayng of the Apostle: That althowgh he

was a Roman borne, his fathers name <hi>Gordian,</hi> his pedegre of
awncient stocke not only noble, but also religiouse. For Felix
somtime bishop of that same see Apostolique, a man of greate

father. This nobilite of religion he kept, and maintayned,
with no lesse vertue, and deuotion, then his parents, and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
kinsfolke had done befor him. But his woldly nobilite he
<pb facs="tcp:1516:60"/>
forsoke alltogether and by the speciall grace of God turned
the same to the purchasing of eternall glorie in heauen.<note place="margin">S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> For
changing sodenly his secular habite he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into a monasterie:
Where he began to lyue in such grace of perfection, that vnto
his mynde (as often after he was wont to wytnes with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
teares) all transitorie things were already subiecte, that he
far surmounted al worldly workes, that he was wont to thinke
of nothing, but heauenly things, yea, that being yet clogged
with his erthly bodie, he now by contemplation did passe the
verie naturall bounds of his flesh, and that he derely loued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath
also, whiche to most men is a paynfull payne, as an entra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce
of lyfe to him, and reward of his labour. All which things
he sayd of him selfe, not craking of his encrease in vertues, but
rather lamenting the lacke, and decaye of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In which defecte
(as he was wont to saye) he thought himselfe nowe to haue
fallen by reason of his ecclesiasticall charge, and occasion of
greater care. For talking on a time secretly with Peter, his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
when he had recompted the olde giftes, and vertuous gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his minde, strayght way he sayde sorowfully. But nowe
alas, by the meanes of this my ecclesiastical charges, my mynde
is encombred againe with secular affayres, and after the good
quyet and rest whiche it had, is nowe defiled againe with the
dust of earthly busines. And when condescending to manie, it
wandereth and roueth aboute owtward matters, after desiring
inward good thowghtes, it returneth therunto no dowbte, the
weaker. Therfore I weigh with my selfe what I doe now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and I weigh also well, what I haue forgone. And when
I behold, what I haue lost, this that I suffer wexeth more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueouse.
Thus sayde this holie man of a greate and passing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.
But we must thinke that he lost none of his monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
perfection by anye occasion or trowble of ecclesiasticall
charge or office of a Bishop: but rather that then he did much
more good, and profited more in vertue by the laboure of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1516:60"/>
conuerting manye to the faythe, then he hadd done before
with the priuate quiet of his owne conuersation onlye. For
euen being bisshopp, he ordered his house like a monasterye.
For as sone as he was taken owte of the monasterye, and
ordayned to the ministerye of the aulter, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
sent as legate from the see Apostolike to Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,

he neuer intermitted his purpose of heauenly conuersation.
For he toke with him certaine brethern of the monasterie
(which for verie brotherly loue folowed him to that Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
citie) for the better keping, of his regular obseruance: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
by their example (for so he writeth) he might be fastned
as with a stronge cable or anker to the pleasaunte porte of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
when soeuer he were tossed withe the raging whaues of
wordly cares, and might also strengthen his minde by daylie
conference, and reading with them, whensoeuer it shuld be
shaken with secular affaires. And truly he was by these mens
companie not only defended from the assaultes of the worlde,
and earthly troubles, but also more and more stirred vp to the
exercises of heauenly life. For they exhorted him, that he
would discusse and expound with some godly and misticall
interpretation the booke of blessed Iob, which was enwrapped
with manie greate obscurities. Neither could he denie them his
paines, which of brotherly loue moued him to this profitable

with decent order, and colour of their heare, beholding them a
while, he demaundyd at last owt of what region, or land they
were brought? And it was answered that they came owt of the
yle of Britannie, where the inhabitantes were all of that beutie.
Then asked he whether the people of that ylande were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

made, that they were all paynyms. Then this good man heauely
syghing from the botome of his harte, Alas, quoth he, it is a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouse

should receaue and feele warre from their enemies. And yf
they wold not preache to the English men the waye of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,

it happened afterward, that the most mighty king of English

this vnfaithfull, and naughty people. For being now redy to

stand a parte from the rest in a sure and safe place, he
demaunded, what they were, and to what end they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Now the most parte of these priestes were of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie

none of these compaines had lesse then 3. hundred persons,

Manie therefore of them after their 3. dayes fast, came with the
rest to thafforsaide armie, to pray for the souldiers:<note place="margin">Fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not.</note> hauing also
by them a defendour named Brockmal, who should keape, and
preserue them from the weapons and strokes of their enemies,
while they were thus ernestly bent to their prayers. This the
cause of their comminge thither, when king Edelfrede had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode,
he sayd: Yf these men crie and call vppon their God
against vs, truly although they haue no armoure, yet they fight
against vs, who with their wicked wordes, and hatefull curses
persecute vs. Therefore he commaunded his souldiers first to
assault them. And so he vanquished after, the other parte of this
detestable hoste, but yet not without greate losse of his owne
men. It is reported, that there were slaine in that warres of
them which came to praye, aboute a thousande, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, and only fiftie to haue escaped by flight. For Brock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
at the first comming of his ennemies fled straight with
all his souldiers, and whome he ought to haue defended, lefte
them all naked and bare to the strokes of the sworde. So in this
manner was fulfilled the prophetie of holye bishop Austin.
Who was himself longe before that taken out of this life to the
kingdom of heauen. And thus these vngratiouse, and false peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
suffred the punishment of temporal death, bicause they had
refused, and despised the holsome counsell of perpetuall life,

a safegard, aud surtie for them, whom, and whose doctrine he
had now receiued. This Elbert was the son of Irminrike
whose father was Octa, and Octaes father Orrich, called also
Oiske. Of whom the kinges of ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are wont to be called Ois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges.

with suche a fornication, as the Apostle witnesseth neuer to

straightwaie and openly to folowe idolatrie, which while their

after he had celebrated the solemnites of the masse geaue
the people the sacrament, being puffed vpp with barbarouse,

wont to call their father Sabareth) and which thou doest not

he answered: Yf ye wil be washed in that holsome font, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein

off the bishop, that it could not be, that without holy purging,
and clensing by baptisme any man might communicate of this
most holie oblation, they at last in their furie and rage sayde to
the bishop: well, if thou wilt not consent to vs in so smalle a

that better it were for them all, to returne into their
countries, and there to serue God with a free minde, and quiet

the occasion that these peoples came to the faith, was suche:
The before named king <hi>Edwine</hi> was ioyned in affinite to the

called <hi>Tate,</hi> daughter to king <hi>Elbert.</hi> Which Ladie when king
<hi>Edwine</hi> woed sending thether his embassadours, answer was ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
by her hrother <hi>Edbald</hi> then king of Kent, that it was not
lawfull for a Christian woman, and virgin to be maried, or
spoused to a paynime, leste the faith and sacramente of the king
of heauen might be profaned by the companie of suche a
king as knew not the trew worshipping of God. Which answer
when the embassadours brought backe to kinge <hi>Edwine</hi> he
promised, that in anie case he wold doe nothing that shuld be
contrarie to the Christian faith, which this virgin professed,
but rather permitte that she with all the men and women, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes

after the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s maner their faith, and customes of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Neither did he denie, but that himselfe also would receaue
the same religion, so that after the examination of wise men, it
were founde more holie then his, and meter for God. Then
vppon these conditions this virgin was promised, and sent also
vnto kinge Edwine. And according to appointment made the
man of God <hi>Paulinus</hi> was ordained Bishop, and chosen to goe
with her, to confirme her, and her companie, that they might
not be polluted with the felowship of painimes. Who did so

               <p>THus much did Pope Boniface by his letters, for the

<pb facs="tcp:1516:78"/>
of Christian doctrine by an oracle, and vision from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Which the goodnes of God vowchesafed to shewe
him, while he laye bannished in kinge Redwaldes courte, king
of the east Englishmen. For when bishop Pauline had well
perceaued that the princes haughty courage could hardly be
brought to the lowly humblenes of Christianite, and that it
would styfly be bowed and bent to beare the mysterie, and
burden of Christes crosse: when he remembred also, how he
had nowe laboured a longe tyme bothe with preaching to
the people, and with praying to Gods mercie for the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

lerned in sprite (for so it is most lykest to be,) what was
that vision, which had longe before ben shewed to the kinge
from heauen, he made no delayes at all, but came spedely to

whiche in the vision that appeared to him he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to doe in case he were deliuered from his present miseries
and restored againe to his raygne, and kingdome. Nowe was
this vision suche, as foloweth: At what time king Edelfry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

of other realmes for manie yeres space as a bannished man:
at the lenghth Edwine came to king Redwald, besechinge
him, that he would saue him, and defend his life from the
traynes, and ernest serche of this his dedly ennemie. Who
gladly entertained hym, and promised to fullfill this his reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
and petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But after that king Edelfride had heard say that
Edwine was seene in that prouince, and vnderstood that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ther, and dwelled familiarly with all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, forthwith
he sent out his Embassadours to king Redwald, with a greate
somme of monie, to procure Edwines deathe. But it preuailed
nothing. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sent he the second tyme, and the thyrd tyme also
offring greater gyftes, and more plentifully bothe gold and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1516:78"/>
syluer thretning him at the laste warres, yf his request were
accomplished. Then king Redwald other dreading the threts
or corrupted with the brybes graunted his request, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he would put Edwyne to death himselfe, or els yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
him vp to thimbassadeurs. Which thing when a certayne
faythfull frend of Edwynes had marked and well vnderstoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
he entred incontinent to the chamber where Edwyne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to take his rest. For it was now an houre within nyght
and calling him forth, told him what the king had promised to
doe against him: sayeng in the end this muche: I shall therfore
(yf it so please yowe) leade yowe owt of this prouince, and
bryng yow into suche a place, that nother king Redwald, nor
yet king Edelfryde shalbe able to fynde yowe. To whome Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyne
answered in this maner: Sir, I thanke yow most hartely
for this your greate gentlenes. But I can not folowe your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unsell
herin. For first, I must not breake my promesse, which I
haue made to so greate and mightie a Prince as is king Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,
especially wheras he hath done me no harme, ne wronge,
nor hath as yet shewed anie hatred, or displeasure towardes me.
And truly if I must of necessite dye thus, I had rather he shuld
put me to deathe, then anie baser man or person of lesle nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite.
Agayne whether I pray yow shuld I flee nowe, who haue
so many yeares, and so long tyme walked lyke a vagabounde
through all prouinces of this yle of Britannie, only to auoyd
and eschewe myne enemies snares, and assaultes? Now when
this his frend was gone, Edwyne remained without alone and
sytting sadly before the palace bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to be troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
stormes, and vexations of thoughts, as a man not witting
what to doe or whither to goe in this so ruefull case. After he
had ben longe vexed with inwarde, and priuie troubles of
mynde, burning inwardly with close fyre of secret sorowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
in the greate sylence, and quyet of the mydde nyght
he sawe a man vtterly vnknowen to him bothe for visage and
<pb facs="tcp:1516:79"/>
countenaunce, and also for his aray and apparell to approche
and drawe toward him. Whome bycause he had espyed thus at
a blushe, and so straungely desguised, he was not a lytle a fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
The straunger cometh euen vnto him, greteth him and
asketh him, wherfore he sate so soroufull on the stone abrode
watching, and all alone at that howre especially when other
men were within at rest, and in their depe sleape: Then Edwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
lykewise demaundyd of him, what he had to doe therwith,
yf he passed ouer the nyght within dore, or els without. To
whome this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> answered, and sayde: Thinke ye not but that I
know the cause of your heauynes, and watche. And also of this
your solitarie syttinge with out dores. For I know certainly
who ye be, and wherfore you are so sad, and soroufull. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
what myscheffe yow feare shortly shall befall you. But tell
me of fryndshippe, what reward would you geaue him, that
shuld now rydde yowe quyte out of all these sorowes, and
trowbles and persuade king Redwald, that neyther he himselfe
shuld hurte yowe, nor yealde yowe vp to your enemies, that
they myght slaye yow? When Edwyne answered that he
would geaue all that he possible could to anie suche a one for
reward of so good a turne, this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> added moreouer and sayde:
But what if besyde this, he do warrant you, that ye shalbe a
kinge, and all your enemies vanquished, yea and that in suche
sorte that you shall not only excell all your auncient proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours,
but also far passe in powre all the kinges of Englishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which haue euer ben in this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie. Here Edwyne being
made more firme, and constant by ofte questioning doubted
not to promis, that in all pointes, and at all tymes he wold be
answerable with worthie thankes geauing to the man that
shuld bestowe on him such greate benefites. Then this man
spake the thyrd tyme and sayde: But tell me againe, what yf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde
all this, the same man, which sheweth yow now before,
truly, and vnfaynedly, that yow shall hereafter surely, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1516:79"/>
doubtedly haue suche and so greate benefites, can geaue yowe
also better cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, and more profitable for your sowles health,
and saluation, then euer any your parentes, and auncesters
heard of, could ye then consent, and obey him, and harken to
his holsome sayenges? Here Edwyne promised owt of hand
without anie lenger delaye, that he would altogether followe
his lerning, and doctrine which both could, and would deliuer
him presently from so manie miseries, and so greate daungers
as he was in, and exalte him afterward to the raygne and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie
of his countrie. Which his answer was heard, and taken.
Then this man straightwaye, which had so long talked with
him, layde his right hande vpon Edwines heade, and said: when
these thinges therfore shall happen herafter in suche sorte to
yowe, remember well this tyme, and this our talke. And dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not at that time to fulfil and accomplishe this, that yow do
nowe promesse me. Which being sayde, by and by he vanished
awaye. To the entent that Edwine might vnderstand and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
that it was no man, but a ghoste which appeared to him.
Now when this younge prince was lefte alone, and sate there
solitarie, reioysing with himselfe for this gentle consolation,
and good comforte, but yet very careful, and muche counting
with himselfe who it shuld be or whence he shuld come which
had thus spoken, and talked familiarly with him: beholde his
forsayd frende came againe, and greating him cherfully, Arise
Edwine (sayde he) and come in. Let passe this your carke
and cares. Set your harte at rest, and take your quiet sleape.
For the kinges minde is chaunged. Neither dothe he purpose
nowe, or intend to doe yow any wronge, but rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to defend
yowe, and accomplishe his promised fayth vnto yowe. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had shewed the Quene in secret that his purpose, which
I told yowe of before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he dehorted him moste ernestly, and

that it was in no wise mete for suche a king, of so greate

prowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, and honour, as he was, to sell his best, and derest
frend, being now browght into straightes and miserie, for a
litle gold. Nor that he should breake his faith, and promesse,
which owght to be more estemed then al treasures, or not bide
by his word for the coueit, and loue of monie. But to be shorte
the king did euen as his Ladie had counselled him to doe. For
he not only not betrayed, and yelded to thembassadours this
his banished man Edwine: but helped him rather to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For as sone as these embassad ours were thus with deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
departed home againe, he gathered incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly a myghtie
armie to conquer king Edelfrede. Whome he slewe without
difficultie (bicause he marched forth against him hastely and
with a weake and vnordred oste) in the borders of the March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
men, at the Este syde of the riuer called Idle. For in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade
kinge Edelfride had not time, and space enowgh grawnted
him to gather all his force together, and to ioygne his powre
with well disposing his hoste, and sowldiers in order. In this
skirmishe Renier king Redwalds sonne was slayne. And thus
Edwin according to the oracle which he had receiued, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
auoyded the dawnger of his most dedly enemie, but also by
his death succeded in thonor of his Souerainte, and kingdome.
Now therfore to returne againe vnto my purpose, thowgh
Bishop Pawline seriously preched the word of God, yet kinge
Edwine slacked and lengered to beleaue him. Vsing yet for a
certaine space, at diuers competent howres to sitte solitarie, (as
I haue sayde before) and diligently to compte with him selfe,
what were best to be donne and what religion was best to be
folowed. At which solitary meditation of the prince this good
and godly bishoppe Pawline entred on a daye in to the palace,
and cominge to the kinge, laied his right hand on his heade
and asked hym, whether he remembred that sygne, or no?
The king sodenly trembled therat for feare. And when he
wold haue fallen downe at Paulinus feate, the bishoppe lyfted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1516:80"/>
him vppe, and spake after a familiar sorte thus vnto him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
o Soueraine Prince, by the bountifull hand and powre of
our Lorde, and God, you haue eskaped the hande and vengean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of your moste hated, and dredfull enemie. Behold also, by
his most gratiouse goodnes you haue obtained the Souerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of raigne, and rule of the kingdome. Remember now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the third thinge, which yowe promised him, and differ no
lenger to performe, and accomplishe the same, by receauing his
faithe, and keaping his commaundements, who hath deliuered
you from your temporall aduersities, and exalted you to the
honour, and maieste of a king. Whose holy will yf you will he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter
obey and euer more doe his pleasure, which by me he
preacheth, and declareth to yowe, he will also deliuer you from
the perpetuall tormente of hell, and make you partakener

Coyfi an other of the nobles consenting sayde by and by:
Suche semeth to me, dere Soueraine, the lyfe of men present
here in earthe (for the comparison of our vncertaine time, and

But after the shorte space of this faire wether, and warme

Thus or in like manner sayd the rest of the elders, and the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

when he had so donne according to the kinges will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he returned againe, and with a lowde voice sayde. I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode

nought which we worshipped as God. For the more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously

certainly the farder was I from it, and the lesse I founde hit.
But now doe I plainly perceaue and knowe, that in this <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>

is able to geaue vs the greate giftes of life, of saluation, and of

Marry (quoth he) I will. For who maye better then I,
which ons by folishnes worshipped, and highly estemed them?
Therefore to the good example of all other, I will now my sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe

abomination of our temples. So sorsaking in this wise all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiouse
custome, and vaine dreade, he besought the king to
graunte him harnesse, and armoure, and therewith a greate
courser, and mighty couragious stalyon horse. On which he
mounted lustely, and with all spede rode forth to batter, and
beate downe to grounde the idols. Now was it not laufull for
a bishop of the sacrifices either to were harnesse, and armoure,
or to ride on other then a mare. But Coyfi made smalle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pte

with a swerd about his loynes, sitting fast on the kinges
courser and stought stalyon, he tooke also in his hand a speare,
and so did marche and sette fourthe against the pernitiouse
idols. Which sight when the people sawe, they thought he had
ben madde. Yet he for all that staied not. But as sone as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched
nere the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, profaned it, casting thereon the speare,
which he held in his hand, and muche reioysing now, bycause
he knew the true worshipping of God, commaunded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
which was there with him to destroye the temple, to fyre
the idolatrouse aulters, and breake the barres, grates, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

those Idols sometime were, is now to be seene, not far from
Yorke at the ryfing of the riuer Derwent. And is at this present

Coyfi by holy inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true God, polluted, and destro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed

cried out a loude to his whole armie: Let vs all kneele apon

yeres after that he cam into Britain to preach. But befor that he

whiche for the great store of okes is in the Scottish tong called
<hi>Dearmach,</hi> that is to say, a fild of okes: of both the which mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
very many mo religious houses were afterward erected
by his scholars both in Britaine, and also in Ireland. Of all the
which the same abbey that is in the yle where in his bodye
lieth buried, is the head house. This yle is alwayes wont to haue

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his lyfe and sayings: but yet what maner of man so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he was, we know this of him for a surety, that he left suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
men that excelled in great continence, in passing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and vertuous trade of religious lyfe. In obseruing the
high feast of Easter they trusted to vncertaine compasses,
and no maruaile consydering that no man sent vnto them, the
decrees made in generall counsayles for the keping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Yet they diligently obserued all such workes of deuotion
and chast conuersation as they could learne in the prophets, in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1516:94"/>
the ghospels, and the Apostles writings. This keping of Easter
continued no small time with them, that is to witt, vntill the
seuen hundreth and sixteneth yere of our Lordes incarnation,
by the space of an hundreth and fiftie yeres after, they receiued
the faith. But when the right reuerend and holy father and
priest Egbert came to them from England, liuing in Christes
quarell in exile in Ireland, being a man very well learned in
the holy scripture and singular for the perfett lyfe, which he
had lead many yeres together, they were reformed by him, and
brought to kepe Easter on the true right and laufull day. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
they did not alway before that time solemnise and
keepe the feast of Easter vppon the fourtenth daye after the
chaunge of the moone according to the Iewes custome (as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

of liuing he left the Clerkes a most holsome example of
abstinence, and continence. This thing did chiefely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his doctrine to all men, that the learning whiche he
taught was correspondent to the life that he lead. And why?
He was not desyrous after wordly goods, he was not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
with present Vanitees. His ioye and comforte was
foorthwyth to distribute to the poore that mette him all that
was geuen him of kinges or other wealthy men of the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
He vsed to trauayle continually bothe in the citye
and in the countrey, neuer on horse backe, but allwayes
on foote, except peraduenture greate neede had forced him
to ryde. And in his trauaile what dyd he? Forsoothe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
so euer he mette, riche or poore, incontinent abyding

the faythe, if they were in it, exhorting them eftsoones no les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
in workes then wordes to almesse geuing and other good

And if by chaunce it had happenned (whiche yet happened

spared to tel them of it, but with sharpe rebuking amended
them. If any gesse or straunger had come vnto him, were he
neuer so worshipful, he neuer gaue mony but only made them
good chere. As for suche gyftes as in monye were liberally
geuen him by ryche men, he dyd eyther (as we haue sayed)
geue them in a dole for the reliefe of the poore, or els he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed it
out for the raunsomyng of those that had been wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
solde: finally many of such, as by mony he had redemed,
he made after his scholers, bringing them vpp in learning and
vertue and exalting them to the highe dignite of priesthod.
The report is that (when kynge Oswald desired first to haue
a Prelate out of Scotland, who might preach the fayth to him
and his people) an other man of a more austere stomacke was
first sent: Who when after a lyttell while preaching to the
Englishe nacion, he did nothing preuaile ne yet was wyllingly
heard of the people, he returned into his country, and in the
assemble of the elders, he made relacion, how that in teaching
he could do the people no good to the which he was sent, for
as much as they were folkes that might not be reclaymed, of a
hard capacite, and fierce nature. Then the elders (as they say)
began in counsaile to treate at lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge what were best to de done,
being no lesse desyrous that the people should attayne the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
whiche they sought for, then sory, that the preacher
whom they sent, was not receiued. When Aidan (for he also
was present at the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>saile) replyed against the priest of whom
I spake, saying. Me thinketh brother, that you haue ben more
rigorous, then reason would with that vnlerned audience, and
that you haue not according to the Apostles instruction, first
geuen them milke of milde doctrine, vntell being by litle and
litle nourished and weaned with the worde of God, they were
able to vnderstand the more perfect misteries, and fulfill the
<pb facs="tcp:1516:96"/>
greater commaundementes of God. This being saied, al that
were at the assemble, looking vpon Aidan debated diligently
his saying, and concluded that he aboue the rest was worthy of
that charge and bishopricke, and that he shoulde be sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
those vnlerned paynims. For he was tried to be chiefely
garnished with the grace of discretion, the mother of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
Thus making him bishop they sent him forthe to preach.

And thus at his preaching of the gospell in the forsaid prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,

wrought by this holv virgin. We only will be contented to
speke somewhat shortly of her departure out of this worlde,
and passage to a better lyfe. The time and houre of her calling
to God being at hand, she began to visit in the monasterie the
celles of the sicke: especially of such her sisters, as either for age,
or for vertuous conuersation were most notable. Vnto who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
prayers lowly commending her selfe, signified vnto them
the houre of her death approching, according as she had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by reuelation. The reuelation (as she reported) was such.
She said, she had seen a company of men apparelled in white
enter into the same monasterye, of whom asking what they
sought for, or what they would there, it was answered her that
they were sent thither, to thend they might take with them
that golden coyne, which came from kent to that place. And
on the same night, in the last part thereof, that is to saye when
the sonne began to rise, she passing ouer the darkenesse of this
present world, went vp to the light that is aboue. Many of the
brethren of the same monasterie which were in other houses,

she began in her monastery to build a church in the honour of
all the Apostles wherein she willed her body to be buried. But
the worke being wel nere half done she died, and was buried in
that very place of the church, (though yet not finished) where

               <p>OF all other miracles I suppose it must in no wise be left
vnwritten, how heauenly a miracle was shewed when
king Oswalds bones were found out, and translated to
the church wherin they are now reserued. This was done by the
industry of the queene of the Marshes, Offride by name, who
was his brother Oswines daughter which Oswin after Oswalds
raigne came to the croune, as we shall declare in the processe
that foloweth. Ther is a famous monastery in the prouince

Adilrede did greatly loue, honour, and reuerence, wherin
she desyred to lay vp her vncles honorable bones. When the
chariot was come, wherin the same bones were brought toward
the euening, the men that were in the monastery, would not
gladly receiue these bones, into the forsaid monastery: because
although they had knowen that he was a blessed man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
forasmuch as he was a forrain borne, and toke
vpon him to be their king, they hated him also after his death,
like as they did of long time by his lyfe. Wherby it came to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that, that same night the relikes that were brought thither,
did remaine still without: yet was there a great pauilion stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out ouer the chariot wherin the relikes were: but the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of heauenly miracle did manifestly declare, with how
great reuerence those bones ought to be receiued of all faith
full people. For all that night long a pillour of light, reaching
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1516:101"/>
from that chariot vnto he auen, stoode so, that it was plainly
seen in al places almost of the same prouince of <hi>Lindisse.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the morning was come, the brethern of that mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
who on the day before had denied began now to desyre
earnestly, that the same holy relikes, might be laied vp in their
house. These bones were after enclosed in a shrine, which they
had prouided for that purpose. The shrine also was placed in
the church with honour conuenient: And to thend that the
holy mans princely personage might alwaie be remembred,
they erected ouer his tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be his standerd, made of gold and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Also whereas the very water wherin they washed his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they poored out into a corner of the vestrey, from that day
forward it came to passe, that the earth it selfe, which receiued
that holy washing, had also especiall grace to driue awaie diuels
from the bodies that were possessed. Furthermore in processe
of time, when the forsaide Quene abode in the same monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
there came to salute her a certaine honorable Abbesse, which liueth vntill this day: her name is <hi>Edilhild</hi> sister to the blessed
man <hi>Edelwin</hi> and <hi>Aldewin,</hi> the first of the which was a bishop
in the prouince <hi>Lindisse,</hi> the second was the Abbot of a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
the which is called <hi>Peartane</hi> not far from the place where
that Abbesse had her monastery. This abbesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moning with
the Quene, after they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fal in talke of Oswalde, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters she saied, that she also had seene, on the very same
night a light vpon his relikes whiche in height reached vp to
heauen. Wherunto the Quene added that many sicke folckes
were now healed with the very dust of the pauiment, on the
which the water of his wasshing was poured out: Then the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse
desyred to haue some deale, of the dust geuen her, and as
sone as she receiued it, she knit it vp in a cloth, laied it vp in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

in her owne monastery, a certaine straunger came thither,

the bruite of this kings holines was then farr abrode sowen in

we haue thought good to write in this owr present historye.
In a tyme of mortalytie (sayd this man) which by a greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath
destroyed Britayne, and Ireland, a certayne scholer whose
auncetours were scottes, was stroken with the same pestilence,
a man skilfull certesse in the studye of learning, but one that
vsed no diligence, and tooke no labour at all for the attayning

to be at deaths doore, trembled and was troubled in sprite, for
death so nye approching, fearing, (as his lewde life deserued)
to be throwen down into the doungeon of hell. And therwith
he cryed to me being lodged not far of, and fetching depe and
sorowfull sighes, in a trembling and lamentable voyce, made
thus his mone vnto me. Yow see, (quoth he) that now by the
increase of my bodely greefe, I draw to the poynt of deathe.
And I know surely that by and by after the deathe of this my

truce and respyte to liue: except peraduenture by the help of
such, as haue faithfully serued God, he will of his tender mercy
vouchsafe, to forgeue me so wretched and miserable a synner.
For we haue heard it commonly reported, that there hath ben
in your nacion a king of wonderfull holinesse called <hi>Oswalde,</hi>
the excellencie of whose faith and vertue, yea after his deathe,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:104"/>
was well knowen by working of many miracles. I besech yow
therfore, if yow haue any of his relikes left with yowe in your

thinges were fulfilled in order, as the bishop prophesied. Truly
at the beginning of the tempest, when the waues and surges of

all in vaine. For the tempest encreased, the whaues multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
so faste, and water so filled the shippe, that nothing but
present death was looked for. In this distresse the priest at the

did cast of the oyle into the sea, which being done (according

Thus the man of God by the sprit of prophecy, forshewed

and might profit the readers. As that he was a man of
greate charity and quyet, of great contynency and humilitie, a
conquerer of wrathe and couuetousnes and one that was far
from all pride and vaine glory. Againe I commend in him
his greatindustry both in keping and in teaching the comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undements
of God, his diligent reading, continuall watching,
his priestly grauitye in rebuking the proude and haughty, and
mild demeanour in comforting the weake, and refreshing the
nedy. And to be short, I commend him as one that laboured all
dayes of his life (as of his most nere acquaintance I vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d)
to obserue and fulfill all that was writen and commaunded in
holy scriptures the Prophets and Apostles. These thinges in

vndoubtedly pleasing almighty God. But that he obserued
not Easter in his due time, either as ignorant therof, or witting
it well, yet being lead with the authoritye of his countre, not
acknowleadging it, this I neither commend nor allowe. Yet
in this very point this I allowe in him, that in his manner of
obseruing Easter he beleued, reuerenced, and preached no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, then we doe, that is the redemption of mankynde
by the passion, resurrection and ascension of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the
mediatour betwene God and man. And therfore he obserued
his Easter not (as many falsely do suppose) altogether with the
Iewes, that is the fourtenth day of the moone, what so ever day
it fell vpon, but he kept it euer vpon a sonday reakoning from
the fourtenth day of the moone to the twentith: and that for
the faith vndoubtedly which he had in our lordes resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
beleuing it to be in the first fery after the sabooth day in hope
of our resurrection to come, which the holy churche beleueth

fyres, not farre distant one from the other Asking therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the Angells what fyres those were, it was tolde him that
those were the fyres which should burne and consume the

of Scotland appeared, vertuous priestes in their life time, and
men of great opinion of holynesse, of whom he lerned diuers
thinges very profitable both for him selfe and for other, which
would lerne of him. Who after they had ended their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
departing vp to heauen again with the other blessed
company, thre Angels remained with <hi>Furseus</hi> to reduce him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1516:110"/>
of them which they tormented in the fires, threwe him at him,

holy Angell taking away spedely the tormented soule, threw
him againe in to the fyre. Whereat the wicked sprit saied, repell
him not now whom ye receiued before. For as ye tooke the
goods of this sinner, so ought ye also take parte of his paynes
and tormentes. Vnto whom the Angell answering, saied, he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it not of couetousnes, but for the sauing of his soule: with
this the fire ceased. And the Angel turning to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, said. That
which thou hast kindled hath now burned in the. For if thou
haddest not taken the mony of this man dying in his sinne, the
torment of his fire had not touched the. And here in many
wordes the Angell taught him, what was to be done concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their saluation which did repent. The man liuing longe
time after, bore the signe of that fire which he suffred in soule,
visible and euident to all men in his shoulder and cheke. And
the flesh maruailously openly shewed that, which the soule pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely
suffred. He endeuoured euer after, as he was also wont be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to preache bothe by worde and example to all men the
trade and duty of a vertuous life. The maner of his visions
he communicated only to such, who of vertuous desire and
holy zele desired the same.</p>
               <p>It remaineth yet (touching this man) that we recite here the
credible reporte of an auncient brother, of our monastery, who
saieth he heard of a very trusty and vertuous man, that he had
sene this <hi>Furseus</hi> in the prouince of the East costes of England,
and had heard of his owne mouth these visions. Reporting
moreouer, that in the most sharp frost of depe winter, that holy
man sitting but in a slight garment, as he recounted these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
through the great feare, and pleasure also conceiued by
the remembraunce thereof, he would sweat as if it had ben the
<pb facs="tcp:1516:111"/>
hottest daye in the middest of sommer.</p>
               <p>To returne to our principall purpose, this holy man hauing
preached the worde of God many yeares in Scotlande, and not
being able to endure any longer the commotion of the people,
leauing all that he had, departed from his natiue countre and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lond
that he was borne in. From thence he came to the easte
coast of England, preaching there the worde of God, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
at last (as we touched before) a noble Monastery. Al whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thinges duly perfourmed, intending vtterly to abandonne
all worldly cares and troubles, he leste also the busy gouuerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the monastery committing that charge of soules to
his brother <hi>Fullanus</hi> and to <hi>Gobbanus</hi> and <hi>Dicullus</hi> priestes: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the most solitary life of an Anchoret. He had an
other brother called <hi>Vltanus</hi> who also after longe proufe and
triall in the monastery, went vnto a wildernesse and lead an
Eremites life. To him he went alone, liuing one whole yeare
with him in continency, prayers, and daily hand labour. The
countre being after much disquieted by often inuasions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and monasteries them selfes being in danger, leauing al
thinges in good order, he sailed in to Fraunce. Where being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
receiued of the French kinge Clouis the second, and
of Erkinwald then preuost of Perone he builded a monastery
in a place there called <hi>Latiniacum.</hi> Where not longe after fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sicke he died. Whose body Earkinwald the preuost taking
thence kept it in the porche of his church vntell the church it
selfe was consecrated in Perone. Which being solemnely done
within six and twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty daies after the body was brought thither,
and being remoued from the porche to be layed by the high
aultar, it was founde as whole and vncorrupted as if the man
had but that houre departed. Foure yeares after a litle chappell
being erected at the east syde of the aultar wher the body shuld
more honourably betoumed, being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp againe to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

of corruption. In the which place it is well knowen that his
merites haue much ben renowned by sundry miracles wrought
by the allmighty power of God. Thus much of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his body we haue brefely touched, that the reader might
more clerely vnderstande, of what excellency and vertu this
man was. All which thinges, and of other his vertuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyons

vsed yet oftentimes to visit his owne countrie of
Northumberland and preache the gospell there. <hi>Edil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi>
sonne to kinge Oswald who raigned in parte of Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humberland,
ouer the people called <hi>Deiri,</hi> perceauing this bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to be a holy, wise and vertuous man, required him to take
of his gift a piece of ground toward the building of a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation of monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>
wherein he and his people might resort to heare the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of God, to praie, and to bury their dead. For he beleued he
should much be comforted and holpen by their good prayers

<hi>Celin</hi> brother to bishop <hi>Cedda,</hi> a man of no lesse vertu, who
preached and ministred the sacramentes (for he was a priest) to
him and all his court. By whose meanes he came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg
of <hi>Cedda,</hi> and was induced to loue him. The holy bishop
at the kinges request, chose out a place to erect a monastery in
the high and desert mountaines. Where before that time we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
rather starting holes for theues or dennes for wilde bestes,
then mete mansion places for men. Hereby the prophecy of
Esaie<note place="margin">Esaiae. 35.</note> semed to be accomplished, saying, that <hi>in the poisonned cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1516:114"/>
the frutes of good workes should blossom and springe, where
before bestes or men bestly liuing made their abode. This ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
bishop desiring by prayer and fasting to purge as though
it were the place from the former filth of iniquites there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and so to set vpon the foundation of the monastery,
obtained licence of the kinge all the Lent that then appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to remaine in that place to fast and praie there after his
maner. In all which time, fasting euery daie, except the Sonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes
vntell the euening,<note place="margin">Fasting in Lent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> as the maner is, he receiued then but a
litle bread with one egge, and a litle milke mingled with water.
For, as he saied, the custome of them of whom he lerned the
trade of monasticall life, was that in the new erecting of any
monastery or church, the places should be first consecrated<note place="margin">Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> to
God with fasting and prayer. In this his fast, ten daies yet only
remaining of the fourty, the kinge sent for him vpon occasion
of certain affaires. But to the entent that so godly a purpose
might not be interrupted by occasion of the Princes busines,
though he brake of him selfe, yet he intreated <hi>Cinbellus</hi> his
priest and naturall brother, to make an ende of that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne.
Which being of him gladly and vertuously fulfilled, he
erected the monastery now called <hi>Lesting,</hi> geuing vnto it, the
same rules and order of religion as the monkes of <hi>Holy Iland</hi>
vsed, where he was brought vp in. Thus gouuerning both his
bishopricke and this monastery many yeares, at the length as
he visited the monastery in the time of a plage, falling sicke
there with other died. He was first buried abrode, but after a
church being there builded of stone in the honour of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
he was taken vp and layed at the right side of the aultar. The
bishop at his departure left the monastery to be gouuerned of
his brother <hi>Ceadda,</hi> who after also was made bishop, as we shall
anon declare. For foure german brothers (which is a rare thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge)
<hi>Cedd, Cymbill, Celin,</hi> and <hi>Ceadda</hi> wer al vertuous priestes, and
two of them bishops. When it was knowen in Northumberland
<pb facs="tcp:1516:115"/>
that their bishop was dead and buried, thirty brethern of the
monastery which he erected amonge the east Saxons, came to
the place where he died. Desiring by the body of their father
either to liue, or (if it so pleased God) to die and be buried there.
Who being gladly receiued of the brethern, in that time of
mortalite,<note place="margin">Intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints.</note> were all taken out of this life, except one litle boye,
who (as it is well knowen) was saued by the praiers of the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
For liuing many yeares after, and studying holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
he lerned at lenght that he had not ben yet baptised. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon
being forthwith christened, afterward was promoted to
priesthood, and proued a profitable member to the church. Of
whom we doubt not to pronounce but that (as I saied) he was
by the speciall intercession of that blessed bishop (whose bodye
of charite he came to visit) saued from the danger of death, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
that he might thereby escape eternall death, and might be
occasion also of life and saluation to other by his doctrine.</p>

he vnderstode the obseruation of Easter in such
sorte, that according to the custome and commaundements of
the lawe he looked for (euen as S. Iohn did) the rising of the
Moone at euening, in the fourtenth day of his aage, in the first
moneth. And at the rising thereof at euening, if the morow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were Sonday (which then was called, the first day after the

Easter, as all we do euen to this daye,<note place="margin">This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we vnifor mely in al Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>

But if Sonday were not the next morow after the fourtenth
day of the chaunge of the Moone, but the sixtenth, seuenteth,
or any other daye of the Moone vntell the one and twentith,
he taryed for the Sonday, and the Saterday before vppon the
euening he began the most holy solemnite of Easter. Thus
it came to passe that Easter sonday was kept only either the
fiftenth day of the chaunge of the Moone in the first moneth,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1516:119"/>
or the one and twentith, or in some daye betwene (as the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

               <p>Neither dothe this new obseruation of the ghospell and of

which kepe your Easter allwaies vpon a Sonday. Againe <hi>S.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

quoth <hi>VVillfrid,</hi> It is well knowen that <hi>Anatholius</hi> was a
right holy man, very well lerned, and worthy of much praise.
But what is that to you, who vary also from his decrees and
doctrine? For <hi>Anatholius</hi> in his Easter (according to the truth)
accompted the vsuall compasse of xix. yeres, whiche you either
vtterly are ignorant of, or if ye know it, yet though it be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh
all Christendom obserued, ye sett light by it. Againe
thoughe he obserued the Easter Sonday sometime vpon the
xiiij. daye of the moone, yet he accompted the same daye at
euening to be the fiftenth of the chaunge, after the accompt of
the Aegyptians. So vpon the xx. daye he kept the Easter, that
at the sonne setting, he reaconed it for the xxj. Which his rule
and distinction, that ye be ignorant of, it is manifest by this,
that same time ye kepe your Easter cleane before the full of the
moone, euen the xiij. daye of the chaunge. As touching your
father <hi>Columba</hi> and those whiche folowed him, whose holy
steppes ye pretend to folow, as the which haue ben confirmed
by miracles, to this I may answer that in the daye of iudgment
whereas <hi>many shall saie vnto Christ, that they haue prophecyed, cast
out diuells,</hi>

not to deme the best. Therefore I deme not but they were
men of God, and acceptable in his sight, as the whiche loued
God though in rude simplicite, yet withe a godly intention.
Neither do I thinke that the maner of their obseruation coulde
be much preiudiciall against them, as longe as they had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
no instructions to the contrary. But rather I verely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

can he by any meanes be preferred to the moste blessed
prince of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> to whom our Lorde sayed, <hi>Thou

returned home to his countre, <hi>Deusdedit</hi> the

<hi>Ercombert</hi> also kinke of kent departed this world the very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
moneth and day, and left to his sonne <hi>Ecgbert</hi> the Crowne
and kingdom, which he receiued and held by the space of ix. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
At that time the See of Caunterbury being vacant a great
while, and the diocese desirous of a bishop, <hi>VVighart</hi> a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
priest, a man very well lerned, skilfull of the Canons, rules,
and disciplines of the church, and an english man borne was

(as we haue mencioned before) and with him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
presents to the Pope Apostolike, as great store of plate,
bothe siluer and golde. Being arriued to Rome in the time that
<hi>Vitalianus</hi> gouuerned the Apostolike see, and hauing declared
the cause of his coming to the saied Pope, within short space,
he and almost all his company were taken with the pestilence
and died. Whereupon the Pope with aduise and counsell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
diligently, whom he might direct for Archebishop o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the churches of England. In the monasterie of <hi>Niridan</hi>
not farre from <hi>Naples in Campania,</hi> there was an Abbat named
<hi>Adrian,</hi> an African borne, a man very well lerned in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:127"/>
thouroughly instructed bothe in monasticall discipline,
and in ecclesiasticall gouuernement, very skilfull of the greke
and latin tounges. This man being called to the Pope, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of him to take the bishoprike vpon him, and trauail vnto
England. But he answering that he was no mete man for so
high a degree, promised yet to bringe forth one, which bothe
for his lerning and for his age were more worthy of that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And offred to the Pope a certain monke liuing in a
Nunnery there by called <hi>Andrew,</hi> who though he were of all
that knewe him, estemed worthy of tke bishoprike, yet for the
impediment of his weake and sickely body, it was not thought
good to sende him. Then Adrian being required againe to take
it vpon him, desired certain daies of respit, if happely in the
meane time, he could finde any other mete to supplie that rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
At this time there was in Rome a certain monke of Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

bothe in prophane and diuine knowleadg, and in the greke and
latin tounge excellently lerned, in maners and conuersation
vertuous, and for age reuerend, being then lxvj. yeres olde.
Him Adrian offered and presented to the pope, and obtained
that he was created bishop. Yet with these conditions that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian
should accompany him in to England, bicause hauing
twise before trauailed in to Fraunce for diuers matters, he had
therefore more experience in that iourney, as also for that he
was sufficiently fournished with men of his owne. But chiefely
that assisting him alwaies in preaching the ghospell, he should

he held at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> where he dyed also and was buried, and
where vntill this day cotineweth the see of the bishops that suc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cede
in the same prouince. This man had made himselfe not
far from the churche a certaine closet and priuate mansion, in
which as often as he was at leysure from the busynesse and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
of the ghospell, he was wont to pray and reade secretly
with a fewe, that is to saye, vij. or viij. bretherne with him. And
when he had gouerned the church most worthely in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
two yeres and an halfe, by the dispensation and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement

                  <hi>There is a time to lay abrode stones, and a time to gather

which by the death of the body remoued the liue stones of the
churche from the earthly places to the celestiall building in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen.
For very many of the churche of this most reuerend bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
were taken out of this life. And when his howre was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to, that he should passe out of this worlde to our Lorde, it
happened on a certaine day, that he abode in the foresayd clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
and had no mo but one brother with him, whose name was
<hi>Owen,</hi> all the reast of his felowes being retourned to churche,
as the cause and houre required. This same <hi>Owen</hi> was a monke
of great perfection, and one that had forsaken the world with
pure intent and hope of the rewarde of heauen, a man for all
pointes worthy to whome God in speciall wise might reuele
and shewe his secrettes, and well worthy to whose wordes the
hearers may giue credit. For coming with Quene <hi>Edildride</hi>
from the prouince of the East English, and being the chief off
her seruauntes, and gouernour of her house, for the great zeale
of faith that encreased in him determining with himselfe to
renounce the world, did in dede accomplysh the same not slac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely
and negligently, but in such sort vncladd himself of worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly
matters, that forsaking all that euer he had, being clothed
<pb facs="tcp:1516:131"/>
but with plaine and poore apparayl and bearing an hatchet or
axe in his hand, came to the monasterie of the same most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
father, called Lestinghe. For he signified that he would
entre into the monasterie not for ease and idlenesse, as some do,
but to trauaile and labour: which thing he well shewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
in his doinges: for the leasse able and apte that he was for
the studie and meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the scriptures, the more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and
painfull he was to worke with his handes. Finally his reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and deuotion was such that the bishop accepted him for one
of his brethern to accompany him with the other fewe in the
foresaid closet. Where while they with in were occupied in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and prayer, he without dyd those thinges abrode that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
necessarie to be done. And on a certaine day as he was doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some such thing abrode, the reast being gone to churche,
as I began to say, and the bishop being alone in the oratorie of
the house, occupied in reading or prayer, this <hi>Owen</hi> heard so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
(as he after told) a most swete noyse of voyces singing
and reioysinge comming downe from heauen to the earth: the
which voice, he sayd, he first heard begynning from the south
east, that is, from whence the depth of winter comes, and then
by litle and litle drawinge nere him, vntill it came to the
roofe of the oratorie where the bishop was, where it entred, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it within, and compassed it all rownd about. Whereat ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
earnestly mind to marke the thinge that he heard, he did
againe as it were about an houre after heare the same ioyfull
song go vp and ascend from the roofe of the said oratorie, and
retourne vp to the heauens the very same way that it came,
with vnspeakeable swetenes. Whereat as he mused a space and
was as it were astouned, imagining and deuising depely in his
minde what this might be, the bishop opened the oratorie
windowe, and as he vsed to doo, made a noyse and signe with
his hand, and bad some man come into him, if there were any
body without. Then came he straight way, to whome the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1516:131"/>
said: Go to the churche quickely, and cause those vij.
bretherne to come hither, and come you with them to.
And when they were come, first he admonished them to kepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them selues, and toward all faithfull folke the vertue of
charitie and peace, and also with vnweary continuance to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the rules and orders of monastical discipline, which they
had either learned of him, and sene in him, or founde in the
doings or sayings of the former fathers. And then did he tell
them moreouer, that the day of his departing was very nigh at
hand. For that most louely geast, quod he, who was wonte to
visit our bretherne, hath voutsafed this day to come to me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and to call me out of this world. Wherefore go your waies
to churche againe, and speake vnto the bretherne that with
their prayers they both commend vnto our Lorde my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and remember also with fasting, watching, prayers, and
good workes to preuent their own departing the houre wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is vncertaine. And when he had spoken these and mo like
wordes, and that the brethern had taken his blessing, and
wer gone forth very heauy and sad, he that only heard the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
song, came in againe, and casting himselfe flat on the
ground, sayed: I beseke you good father, may I be so bold as to
aske you a question? Aske what you will, quod he. Then, quod
the other, I pray you tell me, what was that song which I heard
of that ioyfull company descending from heauen vpon this
oratorie, and after a time retourninge to heauen againe. He
aunswered and saied to him: If you haue hearde the voice of
the song, and vnderstoode the comming of the heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paines,
I commaund you in the name of our Lorde to tell no
man herof before my death. They were in dede the spirites of
angelles, which came to call me to the heauenly rewardes,
which I haue alway loued and longed for, and after vij. daies
they haue promised to come againe and take me with them.
The which was in dede fullfilled euen as it was foretolde
<pb facs="tcp:1516:132"/>
him. For straight way was he taken with a feyntnes of bodye,
which daily grewe more greuouse vpon him and the vij. daye
(as it had bene promised him) after he had first forewarded his
departing with the receiuing of the bodie and bloud of our
Lord,<note place="margin">How se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath.</note> his holy soule loosed from the prison of the bodie was
caried and lead (as we may well beleue) of the company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles
to the ioyes euerlastinge. And it is no meruaile, if he
gladly behelde the day of death, or rather the day of our Lorde,
which daye he did alwaies carefully looke for till it came. For
among his manifold merites of chastitie and abstinence, of
preaching,<note place="margin">The gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at feare of God in B. Chadd.</note> of praier, of wilfull pouertie, and other vertues, he
was so far humbled to the feare of our Lorde, so much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his later end in all his workes, that (as a certaine brother
named <hi>Trumbert</hi> was wont to tell me, one of them that read
the scriptures to me, and was brought vp in his monasterie
and gouernement) if perhaps while he were reading, or doing
some other thing, there rose any sodaine great blast of wind, by
and by wold he cal on the mercy of our Lord, and beseke him
to haue pitie on ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kinde. But and if there came a blast yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
vehement, then wold he shut vp his booke and fall downe
on his face, and set him selfe more feruently to prayer. And if
any stronger storme or blustreing showre continewed long, or
that lightning and thunders did make both the earth and ayre
to shake for feare, then would he go to churche, and earnestly
set his mind to praier and saying of psalmes, vntill the ayre
waxed clere againe. And when some of his companie asked
him, why he did so: Haue ye not read, quod he: <hi>That our Lord
hath thundred from heauen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and the most high hath giuen his voice?
He hath sent out his arrowes, and scattered them abrode, he hath
multiplied lighteninge and troubled them?</hi> For our Lorde moueth
the ayre, reyseth vp windes, shooteth out lighteninges, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
from heauen, to styrre vp the creatures of the earth to
feare him, to cal againe their hartes to the remembraunce of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1516:132"/>
iudgement to come, to plucke downe their pride, and abate
their boldenes, and thus to bringe to their mindes that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time, when both heauens and earth shall burne, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
come vpon the clowdes with great power and maiestie
to iudge both the quicke and the dead.
And therfore, quod he,
it behoueth vs with dewe feare and loue to yelde and giue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to his warning from heauen that as ofte as he trowbleth the
ayre, and lyfteth vpp his hande as it were threatning to strike,
and doth not yet strike, we strayght way call vpon his mercie,
and boulting owt the very botome of our hartes, and casting
owt the dregges and relikes of synne, do carefully prouide that
we neuer deserue to be striken at all. With the reuelation and
relation of the foresayd brother concerning the death of this
bysshopp, the wordes also of <hi>Ecgbert</hi> the most reuerend father
do well agree, of whome we spake before. Whiche <hi>Ecgbert</hi> at
the tyme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sayd <hi>Chadda</hi> was a youngman, and himself of
lyke age to, dyd in Ireland strayghtly lead a monasticall lyfe
both together in prayers, continence, and meditation of the
holy scriptures. But Chadda being afterward retourned to
his countree, <hi>Ecgbert</hi> abode there styll as a pilgrime for our
Lordes sake vnto the end of his lyfe. Nowe a long tyme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there came to visite him from England a certaine most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and vertuous man named <hi>Higbalde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lincolne shere.</note> who was an <hi>Abbot</hi> in
the prouince of <hi>Lindisse.</hi> And as they talked together of the
lyfe of the former fathers, as is the maner of such holy men to
doo, and gladly wold wysh to followe the same, they fell vpon
mention of the most reuerend byshop <hi>Chadda.</hi> And than sayd
Ecgbert: I knowe a man yet remayning aliue in this Ilande,
which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brother Chadda passed owt of the world, dyd see
a companye of Angelles descend from heauen, and take vp his

all in common treate and debate such thinges as appertaine to
the right faith, keging vprightly and straighly the decrees and

These and such like thinges for the preseruation of charite and

It pleaseth vs all very well, that those things which the canons
of the holy fathers haue defined and appointed, we all do kepe

vnto them the booke of canons, and out of the same booke I

places, bycause I knew them to be most necessarie for vs,
and I besought them, that the same mougthe be receaued

               <p>The first article was, that we al in common do kepe the holy
feast of Ester on the sonday after the xiiij. day of the moone in
the moneth of Marche. The second that no bishop should haue
ought to do in an others diocese, but be contented with the
chardge of the people committed vnto him. The third, that no
bishop should moleste or anye wise troble such monasteries as
were consecrated and giuen to God, nor violently take from
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought that was theirs. The fourth, that monks shuld not go

from place to place, that is to say, from one monasterie to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
onlesse by the leaue of their own abbot,<note place="margin">Vowe of obedience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and entring into religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The fift, that none of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
forsaking his own bishop shuld runne vp and down wher he
list, nor whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came any whither, should be receaued without
letters of commendation from his diocesan. And if that he be
ones receaued, and will not retourne being warned and called
both the receauer and he that is receaued shall incurre the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of excommunication. The sixte, that such bishops and
clerkes as are strangers, be content with such hospitalitie as is
giuen them, and that it be laufull for none of them to execute
any office of a priest, without the permission of the bishop in
whose diocese they are knowen to be. The seuenth, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas
by the auncient decrees a synode and conuocation ought
to be assembled twise a yere, yet bicause diuerse inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
doo happen amonge vs, it hath semed good to vs all, that it
should be assembled onse a yere the first day of August at the
place called Clofeshooh. The eight, that no bishop should am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously
preferre him selfe before an other, but should all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the time and order of their consecration. In the ix.
article it was generally entreated, that the nomber of bishops
should be encreased, the nomber of Christian folke waxing
daily greater, but hereof at this time we sayed no farther. The
x. for mariages, that noman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit aduoutrie, nor formication,
that noman forsake his owne wife, but for only fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the holy ghospell teacheth. And if any man put away his
wif being laufully maried vnto him, if he wil be a right Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an
man, let him be ioyned to none other: but let him so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
still sole, or els be reconciled againe to his owne wife.
And thus these articles being in common treated of, and agreed
vpon, that no offence of contention should ryse from any of
vs hereafter, or any other decrees should be published in stede
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1516:135"/>
of these, it semed good, that eche of vs should confirme these
thinges that were decreed, subscribing thereto with his owne
hand. Which sentence and somme of our appointement I gaue
<hi>Titillus</hi> the notarie to write out. Yeuen the moneth and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

to doo against this ordinaunce and sentence prescribed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the decrees of the canons, and confirmed also with our
consent and subscribinge of our handes, let him knowe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in so doinge to be excluded from all charge and office of
priesthood, and also from our felowship and companie. The
grace of God kepe vs safe, liuing in the vnitie of his holy chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.

in her among her vertues, it might al be perboyled out
by the fire of long tribulation. This same woman on a certaine
night, when the day light began a litle to appere, as she went
out of her chamber that she abode in, sawe plainly as it were a
corse, brighter than the sonne, wound vp in a shete and caried
vpward from the dortery where the sisters were wont to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste.
And as she diligently marked what it shoulde be that drewe

as it were certaine cordes brighter than gold, which drewe
it vp so hye, till it was taken into the open heauens, and than
she could see it no longer. Which vision when she thought v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
with her selfe, she douted no whit, but some person of that
company should dye shortly, whose soule should be lifted vp
to heauen by the good workes it had done,<note place="margin">Good workes.</note> euen as by golden
cordes. Which thing happened so in dede. For not many dayes
after, the mother of that couent, for the loue that God bare her
was deliuered out of the prison of this flesh. Whose life was
certainly such, that no man which knewe it, can dout, but that
the entring in to the heauenly mansion was open vnto her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of this life. There was also in the same monasterie a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
holy Nonne, both noble for the dignitie of this world,
and more noble for the loue that she had of the world to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
The which many yeres was so bereafte of al vse of her lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
that she was not able so much as to moue one parte of her
bodye. This Nonne when she knewe that the body of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Abbesse was brought and layed in the churche vntill it
should be buryed, desired that she might be caried thither, and
be layd by the same, bowing downe as folke doo at their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.

and so longe tormentes. And not long after her petition was
heard and graunted: for xij. dayes after she was taken out of
this life also, and receaued euerlasting rewarde in chaunge of
those temporall afflictions. Nowe when <hi>Torithgid</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
handmayd of Christe had lyued three yeare more after the
death of the Abbesse, she was so far pyned away with the sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse
that we spake of before, that the skyn and bones did
scant cleaue together. And at last the time of her departing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nowe at hand, she could not only styr none of all her lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
but was speachelesse and could not moue her tongue. In
which case as she lay three daies and as many nightes, sodainly
being relieued with a ghostly vision, she opened her mouthe
and eyes, and looking vp to heauen bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus to speake to the

and thou arte hartely wellcome. And when she had so sayd,
she held her peace a litle, as it were abyding for an aunswere of
him whome she sawe and spake to. And then as it were a litle
angerly she sayed againe: I can not gladly suffer this. And
straightway holding her peace a litle, she spake the third tyme
and sayd: If it may not by any meanes be to day, I beseche the
that the meane time be not longe delayed: wherewith holding
her peace a litle as she had done before, she ended and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

which wordes, being demaunded of them that sate about her,
to whom she spake, forsoth, quoth she, to my most dere mother
Edilburge. Whereby they vnderstode she came to bringe her
word that the time of her passing hence was nye. For euen as
she made request, after one day and one night passed, she was
deliuered both of the bond of the flesh, and of her sickenesse,

               <head>The. 11. Chapter.</head>
               <p>AT that time, as also the foresayd booke sheweth, there
raigned ouer the East Saxons a man very deuout and
godly named <hi>Sebbi,</hi> of whome we made mention ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oue.
For he was very much geuen to exercises of religion, and
vertu, to much and often praier, and to charitable al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mesdedes,
esteming the solitarie and monastical life before all the ryches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
and honours of a kingdome. Which kinde of lyfe he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
long time before, and giuen vp his kingdome had not the
selfewilled mind of his wife refused to separate from him. And
therfore some men thought (as it had bene often sayed) that a
man of such a nature and well disposed mind, was more mete
to be made a bishop then a king. Nowe when this souldiour of
the ecclesiasticall kingdome had passed ouer xxx. yeres in his
temporall reigne, at lenght he died. But first he admonished
his wife, that then at least they should wholly geue themselues
both together to serue God, whereas they could no lenger now
enioye or rather serue the world together. Which thing when
he had with much a doo obtained of her, he came to the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of London named Waldher who had succeded <hi>Ercon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi>
and at his hand and blessing receaued the habit of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he had long desyred. To which bishop he brought a
great somme of mony to be bestowed and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the poore, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruing
<pb facs="tcp:1516:140"/>
nothing at all for him selfe, but rather desyring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
poore in spirite for the kingdome of heauen. And when
he perceaued the day of his death to be at hand, bicause the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resayd
sicknesse grewe on still vpon him, for the princely
haught courage that he had, he began to feare least at his death
throughe the bitter pange of the same, he might hap either to
vtter with his mouth, or with some other part of his body
doo any thing, that were not mete and comly for his person.
And therefore he sent for the bishop of London, where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
then continewed, and desyred him that at his departing and
passing out of this world, there should be no mo present but
the bishop himselfe, and two of his chapplens. Which thing
when the bishop had promised moste gladly to doo, not long
after, the said man of God setting him selfe to slepe, sawe a
comfortable vision, which toke from him all care of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
feare and shewed him moreouer on what day he shoulde
ende this lyfe. For he sawe (as he after reported him selfe) three
men come to him araied in bright shining clothing, and one
of them, while his felowes, that came with him, stode by and
asked how the sicke man did whom they came to visite, sate
before his bed and sayed, that his soule should departe from the
bodie both without pain, and also with great light and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And he farther also declared vnto him that he should
die the third day after. Both which things (as he learned by the
vision) were so fulfilled in dede. For the third day ensuyng
when the ix. houre was come, sodainly as if he had fallen
in to a softe slepe he gaue vp the ghoste without feeling any
grief at all. And whereas for the buriall of his body, they had
prepared a tombe of stone when they began to lay his bodie
in it they found it to be longer then the tombe by the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of an handbreadth. They hewed therefore the stone as
much as they might, and made it longer than it was about two
fingers breadth, but yet it could not receaue the bodie not so
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1516:140"/>
neyther. Whereupon bicause of this distresse of burying him
they were minded, eyther to seke an other tombe, or els, if they
might, to gather in the body by bowing of the knees, that so it
might be holden and receaued of the same tombe. But a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
case happened, and not withowt the working of God
from heauen, the whiche kept them from doing any of those
thinges. For sodainly, the byshopp standing by and the sayd

raigned with his brother <hi>Frede,</hi> and also a great company of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, the very same tombestone was found to be of a fyt
length for the quantitie of the bodie. Yea and so much that
at the head there might also a pillowe be layde betwene: and
at the feete there remained in the tombe bysyde the body about
the quantitie of fowre fingers. And thus was he buried and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed

sone after were christened by the priestes <hi>Eappa, Padda, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelin,</hi>
and <hi>Oidda.</hi> The Quene also named <hi>Ebba</hi> was christened

was the doughter of Eanfride who was <hi>Eanberes</hi> brother, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
were both christen men, and all their people. But all the
prouince of the South Saxons had neuer before that time he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
of the name of God nor the faith. Yet there was in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untree
a certaine monke, a Scot borne named <hi>Dicul,</hi> which had
a very litle monasterie in a place called <hi>Bosanham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Bosam a monaste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie before the faith openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in Sussex.</note> all compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the miserie and perill of eternall damnation, but also from an
horrible morraine of this temporall death. For in three yeares
before his comming to that prouince, it had not rayned one
drop in all those quarters. Whereby a very sore famine came v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the common people, and destroyed them by hole heapes
in most pitifull wyse, In so much that it is reported, that diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

the baptisme and faith, there fell a goodly and plentifull
shoure of raine, wherewith the earth florished againe, and
brought a most ioyfull and frutefull yere, with goodly greene
fieldes euery where. Thus their old superstition being layed
away, and idolatrie blowen out and extincted, the hartes and
bodies of them all did reioyse in the liuing God: knowing that
he which is the true God, had by his heauenly grace enryched
them both with inwarde and outward giftes and goodes. For
this bishop also when he came into the countree, and sawe so
great a plage of famine there, taught them to get their suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
by fysshing. For the sea and riuers there about them,
had great abundance of fysh. But the people had no skill at all
to fish for any thing els but eeles. And therefore they of the
bishops company gat somewhere a sort of eelenettes together,
and cast them into the sea, and straight way by the helpe and
grace of God they tooke CCC. fishes of diuerse kindes. The
which they diuided into three partes, and gaue one hundred to
poore folke, and an other to them of whom they had the net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and the third they kept for themselues. By the which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the bishop tourned the hartes of them all much to loue him
and they began the more willingly to hope for heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things
at his preaching, by whose helpe and succour they receaued the

was at that time in the same monasterie a certaine litle bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye,
that was lately come to the faith, a Saxon borne, which was
taken with the same sickenesse, and had kept his bed no small
time. And when the second day of the said fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was nowe come, it happened that about vij. a clocke in the
morning, as the boy was leafte al alone in the place where he
lay sicke, sodainly by the appointement of God there vowtsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to appere vnto him the most blessed two chiefe Apostles
S. Peter, and S. Paul. For the boy was of a very innocent and
meke mind and nature, and with sincere deuocion kepte the
sacramente of faith which he had receaued. In this vision the
Apostles first saluted him with most gentle wordes, saying:
Feare not, Sonne, the death, for which thou art so pensife: for
we wil this day bring thee to the kingdom of heauen. But first
thou must tary til the Masses be said, and after thou hast recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thy viage prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the body and bloud of our Lord, being
so released both of sickenes and death thou shalt be lifted vp to
the euerlasting ioyes in heauen. Therefore doo thou call for
priest <hi>Eappa</hi> vnto thee, and tell him, that our Lorde hath heard
your prayers and deuocion, and hath mercifully looked vpon
your fastinge, neither shall there any one more dye of this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
either in this monasterie, or in any of the possessions that
adioyne to the same. But as many as belonge to you any where
<pb facs="tcp:1516:144"/>
and lye sicke, shall rise againe from their sickenes and be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their former health, saue only thow, which this daye
shalt be deliuered from death, and be brought to heauen to the
vision of our Lord Christ, whome thow haste faithfully ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Which thing it hath pleased the mercy of God to doo for
you, through the intercession of the godly and dere seruant
of God king Oswald,<note place="margin">Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Saintes.</note> which sometime gouerned the countre
of Northumberland most nobly both with the authoritie of
this temporall kingdome, and also in holynesse and deuotion
of Christen pietie which leadeth to the euerlasting kingdom.
For on this very day the same king being bodely slaine in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
of the infidels and miscreants was straight take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the eternal ioyes of the soule, and felowship of the chosen
and electe companies. Let them seke in their booke that haue
the notes of the departing of the dead, and they shall fynd that
he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world on this selfe day, as we haue sayd.<note place="margin">Masse in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Saints.</note>
And therfor let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say Masses and geue thankes that their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
is heard, and also for the memory of the sayd king. Oswald,
which sometime gouerned their nation. For therefore did he
humbly pray our Lord for them, as being strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers and exiles
of his people. And when all the bretherne are come together
to the churche, let them all be houselled and so fynish their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
and refresh their bodies with sustenaunce. All the which
wordes when the boy had declared to the priest being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto him, the priest enquired of him, what maner of aray
and lykenes the men had, which appeared vnto him. He aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sweared,
they were very notable and goodly in their aray and
countenaunces, and exceding ioyfull and beautifull, such as he
neuer had sene before nor beleued that any men could be of
so great comlynesse and beautie. The one was shauen like a
priest, the other had a long beard. And they sayd, that the one
of them was called Peter and thother Paul, and that they were
the ministers and seruantes of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1516:144"/>
Christ of whome they were sent from heauen for the sauing
and defense of our monasterie. Wherefore the priest belieued
the wordes of the boye, and went out by aud by and sought in
his booke of Cronicles, and found that king Oswald was
slaine on that very day. Then called he the bretherne together
and commaunded dyner to be prouided, and masses to be sayd,
and that they should all communicat after the accustomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And also willed a parte of the same sacrifice of our Lordes
oblation to be brought to the sicke boye: which thinge so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after the boy died the very same day, and proued by
his death, that the wordes were true which he had heard of
Christes Apostles. And this morouer gaue witnesse to his wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des,
that at that time no creature of the same monasterie was
taken out of the world, except him only. By which vision ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that might heare of the same, were meruaylowsly styrred
and enflamed, both to praye and call for Gods mercy in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
and also to vse the holesome helpes and medicines of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge.
And from that time not in that monasterie only, but in
very many other places to, the birthe day of the sayd kinge and
champion of Christ began yearely to be kept holy with mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and deuout seruice most reuerently.</p>

brethren of that monasterie, but such as were skilled in songe
came together to here him almost from all the monasteries of
the same prouince. And many to did earnestly desyre and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him in such places where he taught to come to them him

preached one only working and will in Christe. Which Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
he brought with him, and gaue it to be writen and copyed
out in the foresayd monasterie of the moste vertuouse Abbot

Churche was, and howe clere it was from the pestilent conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions

before, was called together in England for this purpose, the

And a copie of the same was geuen him to carie to
Rome. But in his retourning homewarde, not long after he
passed the sea, he fell sicke by the way and died. His body for
the loue of S. Martin, whose monasterie he gouerned, was by
his frendes brought vnto Tours, and there buried honorably.

thus died by the way, yet neuerthelesse the copie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique

it semed good to her sayd syster nowe Abbesse, to haue
her bones taken vpp, and put in a newe tombe, and remoued
into the churche. Whereupon she wylled certaine of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne

leafte desolate and vnhabited, the which was not far from

straight way they found by the walles of the citie a tombe of
white marble ready made very fayre, and couered very trym
and fyt with a couer of the same stone: wherby vnderstanding
that our Lorde hadd prospered their iourney, they gaue him
thankes therefore, and browght it to the monasterie. And
when the graue was opened and the body of the holy virgin
and spouse of Christ taken owt into the light, it was found so
cleane from corruption, as if she had dyed or bene put in the
grownd the very same daye, euen as bothe the aforesayd by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Wilfride, and many other that knewe it, beare wytnesse.
But Cinfride a certaine phisition, whiche was present by her
bothe when she dyed and when she was taken owt of the tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,
was wonte of more certaine knowledge to tell, that when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1516:149"/>
she lay sicke she had a very great swelling vnder her arme pit,
and they bad me, quoth he, to launce that swelling, that the yll
humour that was within might issue owt. Which when I had
done, for the space of two dayes after she semed to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better at ease, so that some thowght that she might be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of her grief. But the third day her former paynes tooke
her againe, and straight way was she taken owt of the worlde,
and chaunged all paine and death with health and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
And when after so many yeres her bones showld be
taken owt of the graue, they spred a tent ouer the same, and all
the company of the bretherne on the one syde, and systers on
the other, stode round about synging and the Abbesse with a
fewe other went in, to take vp and bring forth the bones. But
sodainly we heard her within crye owt withe a lowde voyce,
Glorie be to the name of God. And anon after, they called
me in, opening the entraunce of the tente, where I sawe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

and lyeng on the bead like one that were a slepe. Then dyd
they also open the couering of her face, and shewed me the

wherwith she was buried there appered than but litle smal sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

in the citie, which of his name is called vnto this day
Tunnacester: who when he heard that his brother was slaine
in the battaile came to seeke, if he might happely fynd his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Where he finding one that was in all pointes like him, and
thinking it to be him in dede, brought him to his monasterie,
and buried him honorably, and did often times cause masse
to be saied for his soule: By the saying of which masses
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1516:152"/>
that, which I sayd, came to passe, that noman could bynd him,
but that he was straight way loused againe.<note place="margin">The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> Then the Erle that
kepte him began to wonder here at, and to enquire of him,
what the cause was that he coulde not be bound, and whether
perhaps he had about him any loosing letters, such as men tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
of that he could not be bound by the vertue of them. But
he aunsweared, that he knewe no such arte nor conning: but
I haue a brother, quod he, in my countre, one that is a priest
and I knowe that he thinkes I am slaine, and therefore doth oft
saye masse for me: and if I were nowe in an other world, my
sowle showld be there loused from paynes throughe his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
and prayers as my body is here from bondes. And
while he was thus kept a certaine space in the Erles howse,
some that marked him more diligently, sawe by his countena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce,
behauiour, and talke, that he was not (as he had sayd) of
the common poore sort of people, but of some good house and
degree. Therefore the Erle called him secretly, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him more straightly of whence he was. Promising that
he wold doo him no harme in the world, if he wold playnly
vtter and shewe himselfe, what he was. Which thing when he
had done, and declared himselfe to be one of the kinges serua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untes,
wel, quoth the Erle, I knewe by thy wordes and awnswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
that thow were no husbandman of the countre. And thou
art well worthy to dye nowe, for that all my bretherne and
kynnesmen were slaine in that battaile, yet I will not put the
to death, for breaking of my faith and promyse. And therfore
as soone as he was full cured, the Erle sent him to <hi>London</hi> and
solde him to a marchant of Friseland. But neither he, nor any
man els as he was lead thither, could bynd him by any meanes.
And yet his enemies dyd lay on him many and sundry kindes
of fetters which yet allwaies were loosed. When he that hadd
bowght him, sawe, that he cowld be kept and holden in no
bondes, he gaue him leaue to ransome himselfe, if he were able.
<pb facs="tcp:1516:153"/>
For after abowt viij. a clocke in the morning when masses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be sayd, his bondes and fetters were euer lowsed. And
thus vpon his othe either to come againe, or els to send his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
he was let go, and came to kent to kinge <hi>Lodhere,</hi> who
was sonne to the sister of Quene <hi>Edildrede</hi> of whom we haue
spoken before, and himselfe had bene sometime a seruaunt of
the sayd Queenes. There he sued to the kinge for so much as
wold pay his ransome, which he obtained, and sent it (as he had
promised) to him whose prisoner he was. Afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to his countree, and came to his brother, and declared
him in order all the aduersities that had happened vnto him,
and also what comfortes and succours he had had in the same.
And he knewe, by that his brother told him, that his bondes
were loosed at those times specially, in which masses were said
and songe for him. He vnderstoode also, that the other hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
and succours that happened to him in his danger, came of
the heauenly gyfte and grace throwgh his brothers intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

godly seruaunt of Christe Hilda Abbesse of the monasterie,
that is called Streanes halch (as we before mentioned) after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heauenly dedes that she did in this world, passed owt of this
lyfe to receaue the rewardes of the lyfe of heauen, the xvij. day
of Nouember, when she was three score and six yeres of age.
The which nomber of yeres equally diuided into two partes,
she lyued, the first xxxiij. in secular lyfe withe most noble and
worthy conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as many after did she dedicate to our
Lord more nobly and worthely in monastical life. For she was
come of noble birth, and was the dawghter of kinge <hi>Edwins</hi>
nephewe named <hi>Hererike,</hi> with which kinge also at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of <hi>Paulinus</hi> of blessed memorie the first bysshopp of
Northumberland, she receaued the fayth and sacramentes of of
Christe, and dyd syncerely kepe the same, vntill she deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to come to his sight and vision, whome only to serue after
she had determined, and forsaken this secular lyfe and world,
she went to the prouince of the East english. For she was allied
to the king there, and from thence she desyred, if she might by
any meanes, to forsake her countre and al that euer she had, and
go into Fraunce, and there in the monasterie named <hi>Cate</hi> to
leade a pilgrimes and exuls lyfe for our Lordes sake, that she
might the more easyly deserue to enioye an euerlasting coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
in heauen. For in the same monasterie her syster <hi>Heres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wide</hi>
mother to <hi>Adulphe</hi> king of the East english did at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
very tyme lyue vnder rules and disciplines of religion aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and looking for the crowne euerlasting: whose example
she mynding to followe and liue a straunger out of her owne
countree, dyd abyde in the said prouince one hole yeare. After
which being called home againe into her countree by bisshopp
<hi>Aidan,</hi> she had deliuered her the landes of one Lordeship at the
north coast of the riuer Were, in which she liued also the space
of one yeare, and lead a monasticall lyfe with a fewe other of
her companie. After this she was made Abbesse in the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
<pb facs="tcp:1516:154"/>
that is called <hi>Heortheu,</hi> which monasterie had bene buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
not long before of the godly and deuout handmayed off
Christ <hi>Heiu.</hi> Which is said to be the first woman in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
of Northumberland, that tooke the vowe and habit of a
Nonne,<note place="margin">Vow and habit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall.</note> being blessed and consecrated by bisshop <hi>Aidan.</hi> But
not long time after the making of the monasterie she departed
thence to the citie of <hi>Calcaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> whiche is called of the english
men <hi>Calcacester,</hi> and there she appointed to abyde and contine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we.
Now this other handmayd of Christ <hi>Hilda</hi> being placed
to rule this monasterie, dyd strayght procure to order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the same in all pointes with regular lyfe and discipline, in
such wise as she could be best enstructed of them that were
learned. For both bishop <hi>Aydan,</hi> and as many religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as knewe her, for the great wysedome and loue to serue
God, that was in her, were wont ofte times to visit her, louin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
to helpe her, and diligently to instructe her. Thus when
she had certaine yeres gouuerned this monasterie in great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
and straighnes of regular lyfe and order, it was her
chaunce to take in hand the buylding and disposing of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie
in the place called <hi>Straneshalch,</hi> which busynes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto her she finished with all speede and diligence. For
she fournished and framed it with the same rules and orders of
regular lyfe, with which she had disposed the other monasterie
before. And truly she dyd there teache singularly the workes
of righteousnes, deuotion, chastitie, and other vertues, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of peace and charitie, in such wise that after the example
of the primitiue church, there was none riche there, none poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
but all thinges common to all, for nothing semed peculiar
and priuate to any one. She was of such wysedome, that not
only all meane persons in their necessities, but also kinges and
princes dyd seke and find counsel of her: Such religious men, as
liued vnder her gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, she made to bestow their time in the
reading of the holy scriptures, and in the exercise of the workes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1516:154"/>
of vertue, that out of her monastery many might easely be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde,

And in dede we haue sene in a short space fiue bishops oute of

Of the first we haue spoken before, howe he was consecrated

and there he remained a long time, preaching the word of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
and also giuing himselfe for an example of life to all that

named <hi>Boselus</hi> being so sicke and weake, that he could
not himselfe fullfill the office a bishop, by all mens iudgement

bishoppe out of the monasterie of the said Abbesse: but he
<pb facs="tcp:1516:155"/>
was taken away and died before his time, ere that he might be
consecrated. This foresaid handmayde of Christ Abbesse <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
whome, all that knewe her, were wont to call mother for her
notable grace and godlinesse, was not only in her owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie
an example of lyfe to them that were with her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to many other that were far of the ministred occasion of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
and amendement, to whom the happy report of her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vertuous liuing came. And so was fulfilled the dreame,
that her mother <hi>Bregoswid</hi> had, when this was but an enfant.
For when her husband <hi>Heriric</hi> was out of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawe
vnder <hi>Cerdix</hi> kinge of the Britons, where also he was att

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it semed to shine and glister with brightnesse of so great a
lighte, that it filled all the borders of Britannie, with the grace
thereof. The which dreame was proued true in her doughter,
whome we speake of. Whose lyfe not to her selfe only but to
many other that wold lyue well, did geue examples of the
workes of light. But nowe when she had many yeres ruled this
monasterie, it pleased the mercifull worker of our saluation,
that her holy soule should also be examined and tried with
long sicknesse of the body, that after thexample of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
<hi>her vertue might be made perfect in infirmitie and weakenesse.</hi>

worldly aduersities, or bodely infirmities and sickenesse. And
thus the seuenth yere of her sicknesse, the grief and paine
tourning toward the hart and inward partes she came to her
ende and last day in this worlde, and about the crowing
of the cocke after she had receaued the viage prouision of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
howsell she called vnto her he handmaides of Christ that
were in the same monasterie, whome as she admonished and
counselled to kepe the euangelicall vnite amonge them selues
and with other, at the very last worde and making of this her
exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she gladly and willingly saw the houre of her death
yea rather (to speke with Christs owne wordes) she passed from
death vnto lyfe. In which very night our almightie Lord vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesafed
to reuele her death and departing by a manifest
and plaine vision in an other monasterie that was a good way
of, named <hi>Hacanes,</hi> the which she had buylt the same yere. For
there was in the same monasterie a certaine Nonne named
<hi>Begu</hi> which had serued our Lord in monasticall conuersation
and blessed virginitie xxx. yeres and more. This Nonne taking
her reast at that time in the dortour howse, heard sodainly in
the ayer the knowen sound of the bell, wherewith they were
wonte to be called vp to prayers, when as any of them was
called out of the worlde. And opening her eyes (as she
thought) she sawe the roofe and top of the house vncouered,
and all aboue full of light. Which light as she earnestly marked
and looked on, she sawe the soule of the foresayd handmaid
of God in that light caried vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, accompained and lead
by Angells. And as she then started out of her sleape, and sawe
other systers taking their reast about her, she knewe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
that that which she sawe was shewen her either in a
dreame or in some vision of minde. And by and by she rose vp
for ouermuch feare that she had, and ranne to the virgin, which
was then gouernesse of the monasterie in the Abbesse stede,
<pb facs="tcp:1516:156"/>
whose name was Frigit, and with much weping and teares, and
drawing long sigthes told her that the mother of them al Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse
<hi>Hilda</hi> was nowe departed this worlde, and with a mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailouse
great light, which she sawe, and company of Angells
leading her, ascended vp to the gates of euerlasting lighte and
felowship of the heauenly citisens. Which when she had heard,
she raised vp all the sisters, and called them to churche, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them to be occupied in prayers and psalmes for the soule
of their mother. Which thing as they diligently did the rest of of
the nighte, at the breake of the day there came certaine bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
from the place where she died, to bring worde of her
departing. Which the other aunswered that they knewe of
before. And when they had declared in order howe and when
they had learned the same, it was found that her passing was
shewed them by the vision at the very same houre, that
they reported her to passe out of the world. And with a goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and agreement herein it was by the worke of God so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that when the one sawe presently her departing out of
this lyfe, at the same time the other did knowe her entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the perpetuall lyfe of soules. These two monasteries are
distant a sonder almost xiij. myles. It is also reported, that
in the same monasterie to, where the foresayd handmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of God died, one of those vowed virgins to God,
that loued her more then the rest had her departing shewed
vnto her the same night in a vision, and sawe her soule go to
heauen with angells, which thing the very same houre it was
done she opened and declared to those handmaydes of Christ
that were with her and called them vp to pray for her soule,
and that, before the reast of the company knewe of her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
which thing to be so, was anon after declared to the hole
company when morninge came. For at that houre this Nonne
was alone seuerally with certaine other handmaydes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,

               <head>The. 24. Chap.</head>
               <p>IN the monasterie of this Abbesse there was a certaine bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notably endewed with the speciall grace of God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was wont to make songes and meters fit for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
godly meditation, in so much that what so euer he learned of
the holy scriptures by other mens expounding, he tourned and
made the same anon after with poeticall and musicall wordes
set together withe wonderfull swetenesse and melodie in his
owne mother tonge. With whose verses and songes the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of many men were ofte enflamed to the contempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spysing
of the world, and desire of the euerlasting lyfe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
After whome diuerse other among the english men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed
to make godly and deuowt meters, but noman cowlde
matche his connyng therein. For he learned this arte of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and making, not towght of men, nor by any mans helpe,
but he receaued the gyfte therof freely by the only ayde and
grace of God. And therefore he cowld neuer make any fond or
vayne balade, but such things as belonged to religion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meditation were only mete to come owt of his religiowse
and godly mowth. For as long as he was a secular man, which
was, tyll he was well striken in age, he neuer had learned any
such matter of singinge. In so much that sometimes at the
table, when the company was set to be mery, and agreed for the
nonse, that eche man showld syng in order at his cowrse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he,
when he sawe the harpe to come nere him, rose vp at myds of
supper, and gat him owt of doores home to his owne howse.
And as he so dyd on a certaine time, getting him owt of the
<pb facs="tcp:1516:157"/>
place where they were drinking and making mery together, to
the stable among the beastes which he had appoynted him to
kepe and looke to that nighte, and when the howre of slepe
came, was gone his way quietly to bed, as he laye, he dreamed
that acertaine man stoode by him, and bad him, God spede,
and calling him by his name, sayd to him, <hi>Cednom,</hi> I pray thee
singe me a songe. Whereto he made awnswere and sayd, I can
not synge. For that is the matter why I came owt from the
table to this place here, bicause I cowld not singe. But yet,
quoth he againe that spake with him, thow hast somewhat to
syng to me. What shall I syng? quoth he. Sing, quoth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the begynning of al creatures. At which awnswere he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
by and by to singe in the lawde and prayse of God the
creatour, verses which he had neuer heard before, of which the
sense and meaning is thys. <hi>Nowe must we prayse the maker of
the beauenly kingdome, the power of the creatour, his cownsell
and deuyse, the workes and actes of the father of glorie. Howe he
being God eternall was the maker and author of all miracles, whiche
first vnto the children of men created heauen for the top of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place, and after the omnipotent keper of mankinde created the
earthe for the flowre thereof.</hi> This is the meaning, but not the
order of the wordes which he sange in his sleape. For verses
be they neuer so wel made can not be tourned out of one tonge
into an other word for worde, without leasing a great pece of
their grace and worthynesse. Now when he awooke and rose
vp, he remembred stil by harte all the thinges that he had songe
in his slepe, and dyd straight way ioyne thereto mo wordes in
the same maner and forme of meter, and made vp a song fytte
to be songe and applyed to God. And on the morowe he came
to the farmar or baylie vnder whome he was, and tolde him of
the gifte that he had receaued, and being browght to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse
he was commaunded in the presence of many learned
men to tell his dreame, and rehearse the song, that it might by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1516:157"/>
the iudgement of them all be examyned and tryed, what or
whence the thing was which he reported. And it semed to
them all, that some heauenly grace and gifte was graunted
him of our Lorde. For more triall whereof they recited vnto
him the processe of some holy storie or example, willing him,
if he cowld to tourne the same into meter and verse. Which he
tooke vpon him to doo and went his way, and on the morowe
after came againe and browght the same made in very good
meter, which they had willed him to doo. Whereupon straight
way the Abbesse acknowledging and embracing this grace and
gifte of God in the man, enstructed and exhorted him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the world, and the lyfe thereof, and to take the monasticall
lyfe and profession vpon him. Which he did and was thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
by the commaundment of the Abbesse placed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the bretherne, and by her appointement tawght and
enstructed in the course of holy scripture. But he what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he cowld heare and learne, would afterwarde thinke vpon
the same againe by him selfe, and chewinge theron lyke a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
beast at his cudd, would turne it into very swete meter,
and melodiously singinge the same, made his teachers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his hearers againe. His songes were of the creation
of the world, and beginnyng of mankynd, and al the storie of
Genesis, of the going of Israel out of Aegipt, and their entring
into the land of promise, and of many other histories of the
holy scriptures. Of thin carnation of our Lord, of his passion,
resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the holy
ghost, of the doctrine and preaching of the Apostles. Also he
was wont to make many songes and meters of the dread of
domes day and iudgement to come, of the horrible paynes of
hell, and of the ioyes and swetenes of the kingdome of heauen.
And many other also of the benefits and iudgementes of God.
In al which, his endeuour was to pull away men from the loue
of wickednesse, and styrre them vp to the loue and readinesse
<pb facs="tcp:1516:158"/>
of vertue and good lyfe. For he was a man very deuout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouse,
and humbly obedient to his rules and disciplines. And
very zelouse and feruently bent against them that would doo
otherwise. And therefore he ended his lyfe with a good ende.
For when the houre of his departing was at hande, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before and diseased xiiij. dayes with bodyly sickenesse, and
yet so temperatly, that he might all that tyme both speake and
walke.<note place="margin">The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

were sicke were wont to be brought, and such as were lykely
shortly to dye. This man desyred him that serued him, the same
eueninge before the night that he should depart out of the
world, to go and prouide him a place to reast and lye in that
house. The other maruailed why he desired the same, for he
was nothing likely to dye so sone. But yet he did as he was bid.
When they were there placed, and were meryly talking and
sporting amonge themselues and them that were there before,
being now about midnight he asked and enquired of them all,
whether they had the sacrament there within. What nede,
quoth they, is there of the sacrament, for your tyme is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

them, whether they were all of a quiet minde and persit chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
toward him, without any quarell, grudge, debate, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
They aunsweared all, that they were of very good mynd

And there withall arming him selfe with that heauenly foode
made him ready to enter into the other lyfe. Then he asked,
howe nyghe the houre was, that the bretherne should ryse to
saye their night laudes and seruice to our Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he layd downe his head on the bolster, and so falling a litle
in a slomber ended his lyfe in quiet and silence. And thus God
wrought with him, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had serued our Lord with a
simple, plaine, pure mynde and quiet deuotion, so lykewise he
might come to the fight and vision of God, leauing this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

and shut vp the last wordes in the praise and lawde of the
same, blessing himselfe, and commending his spirite into the

happened also for the wyckednes of them that dwelled in the

might easyly see that knewe it. And the open scourge of God
dyd mercifully whippe them euen at the beginning, that being
thereby corrected they might lyke the <hi>Niniuites</hi> tourne awaye
the wrath of the iust iudge from them by fastings, weaping,
and prayers. In the same monasterie there was a certaine man
a Scotborne named <hi>Adaman,</hi> leading a very deuout lyfe vnto
God in chastitie, abstinence and prayer, in such sort, that he
neuer dyd eate nor drinke, saue only eche Sonday and thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:
and ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times also he passed ouer whole nightes watching
<pb facs="tcp:1516:159"/>
in prayer: which straightnes of hard lyfe he began at the first
of dewtie and necessitie to amend his former syn and ylliuing,
but in processe of time he had tourned that necessitie into a
continuall custome. For whereas in his youth he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a certain greuouse offense and sin, that coming ofte to
his mynd and remembrance, considering in his hart the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
thereof, he abhorred it and trembled therat excedingly, and
feared the pounishement of the sharp iudge vppon him for the
same. Resorting therefore to a priest and hoping of him to
lerne some remedy of saluation, he confessed his syn to him,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the priest.</note>
and desyred him to giue him counsell, whereby he might flee

priest when he had heard his offense and sin, said. A great wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
requireth a greater cure and medicine: and therefore geue

the ende that <hi>coming before the face of our Lorde in confession</hi>
thou maiest deserue to fynde him mercifull vnto thee. But he
for the passing grief of the giltie conscience that held him, and
desyre that he had to be sone assoyled of the inwarde bondes
of synnes wherewith he was laden, sayd: I am yonge of age,
and strong of bodie. And therefore what soeuer ye put me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
so that I may be saued in the day of our Lorde, I will easely
beare it all, and thoughe ye bid me to stand the whole night
and spend it in prayers, and passe ouer the whole we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
in abstinence. It is very much (quod the priest) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the whole weke without sustenaunce of the bodie,<note place="margin">Penaunce enioyned.</note>
but it suffiseth to faste two or three daies at onse. And this doo
thowe vntill I come againe to the after a short time, and shewe
thee more fully what thou must doo, and howe long thou
must continewe in penaunce. After which wordes the priest
appointed him what penaunce he shoulde doo, and went his
way. And through a sodaine occasion that happened he passed
into Ireland, where he was borne, and came not to him againe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1516:159"/>
as he had promised to doo. Yet the yong man remembring
both his commaundement, and also his owne promise, gaue
himselfe wholly to weping, penaunce, holy watchinge and
continence, in such wise that (as I sayd before) he neuer tooke
sustenaunce saue only thursdaies and sondayes, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fasted all the other daies of the weke. And when he had
heard that his ghostly father was gone into Ireland, and there
departed, euer after from that time he kept this maner of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
according as it was first appointed him. And the thing
which he had onse begon to doo for compunction of his syn
and dread of Gods vengeance, the same did he nowe, without
lothesomnesse or werynesse, yea with pleasure and delight for
the reward that followed, and for the feruent loue of God.
And as he nowe long time had continewed diligently the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
it chaunced that on a certaine day he went out of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie
to some place a good way of, hauing one of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
with him in his companye. And when they had done
their iourney and were comming home againe, drawing nere
the monasterie they beheld and vewed the goodly high buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the same, wherat the man of God brast out all into tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and with his weping countenaunce bewrayed the heauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his harte. Which thing when his fellowe sawe, he asked
him why he so did. O quod he, al these buildinges that you see,
both the common that belong to many, and the priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of particular persons shall shortly be tourned into ashes and
consumed by fyre. Which he hearing, as sone as they came
into the monasterie, found the meanes to tell that to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the couent, named Ebba. Who being troubled at such a
warning and fortelling, as good cause was, sent for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

he knewe the same. Of late, quod he, being occupied at night
time in watching and saying of psalmes, I sodainly sawe one
stand by me, of a straunge and vnknowen fauour. At whose
<pb facs="tcp:1516:160"/>
presence when I was sore afraide, he bad me not to feare, and
then in familiar wise he spake to me thus and sayd. Thou doest
well in that this night time of reast, thou hast had the strength,
not to geue thy selfe to ease and sleape, but to be occupied
in watching and praying. Whereto I aunswered and sayd,
that I knewe my selfe to haue great nede to continewe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lsome
watching, and to make diligent and dewe intercession
to our Lord for my synnes. Thou sayest true, quod he farther,
that thou and many other haue nede to redeme and satisfie for
their synnes with good workes, and at such time as they are at
leasure from worldly paines and busynesse, to labour the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
freely for the desyre of euerlasting wealth: but yet very fewe
doo so. For right nowe haue I walked through all this mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
in order, and looked in euery selle and bead, and of them
all, sauing thee, haue I found not one occupied aboute the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of his owne soule: but they are all both men and wemen
either depely drowned in sleape, or watching vnto wickednes
and syn. For the litle houses that were made to pray or reade
in, are nowe tourned into chambers of eating and drinking,<note place="margin">Abuses of religious persons punished by God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note>
and talking, and other enticemente of yll. And the virgins, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vnto God, contemning the reuerence and regard of their
profession, as ofte as they haue any leasure thereto, do occupie
themselues in weauing and making fine clothes, wherewith
they may set forth themselues lyke brydes, to the daunger and
great perill of their estat and professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or els to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue

prepared from heauen for this house and them that dwel ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a greuouse punishment and vengeance by fyre. Then quod
the Abbesse, And why wold ye not soner tell me herof when
ye knewe it? Forsooth, quod he, I feared so to doo for respecte
of you, least ye wold perhap be ouermuch troubled therewith.
And yet take ye this comfort herein, that this plage and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment
shall not fall in your dayes. This vision being spread
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1516:160"/>
abrode and knowen, they of the place began somewhat to
feare for a fewe daies, and to amend them selues, and leaue
their naughty lyfe. But after the death of the Abbesse they
retourned to their old naughtynesse, yea and to worse to. And
when they sayd and thought themselues in peace and saftie,
they were anon stricken with the punishment of the foresayd
vengeance. All which thinges to haue bene thus done in dede,
the most Reuerend Giles my felow priste reported vnto me,
who lyued than in the monastery: and afterward, (for that
many dwellers there went thence bycause of this ruyn) lyued a
long time in owr monasterie, and there dyed. This haue I

warne the reader and put him in mynd of the workes of owr
Lorde, howe dreadfull and terrible he is in his iudgementes
and counselles ouer the children of men. And that we serue

For the next yere after this, the same king against the aduise

xv. yere of his raigne, and xx. day of maye. And in dede (as I

there, departed with his company that were in the monasterie
of Ebbercune, the which standeth in the Englysh region, but
nighe vnto the straight that diuideth the landes of the english

far and nere thereabout from the lyfe of their carelesse conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
to the loue and longing of the ioyes of heauen. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
folke at that time did profane and defyle the fayth that they
had with wicked workes and dooinges, some also in the time
of the great death and plage, setting at nought the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of fayth (wherewith they were endewed) ranne to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous

but moo times on fote, and come to the villages lyeng the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reabout,
and preache the way of truthe to them that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straye.
Which thing also <hi>Boisill</hi> was wont to doo in his tyme.
For it was the maner of the people of England at that time,
that when any of the clergy or any priest came to a village,
they would all by and by at his calling come together to heare
the worde, and willingly harken to such thinges as were saied,
and more willingly followe in workes suche thinges as they
could heare and vnderstande. Nowe this man <hi>Cutbert</hi> had
such a grace and skill in vtteraunce, such a zele in persuading,
such an Angels face and countenaunce, that none that was
present durst presume to hyde the secrettes of his hart from
him: but dyd all openly declare in confession the thinges that
they had done: both for that they thoughte that the same could
in no wyse be hid from him, and also that they might be shry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and cleansed from their synnes throughe the dewe frutes
of penaunce as he should appoint them. This good man was
wont to resorte vnto those places and villages most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that stoode a far of in stipye and craggie hylles, and whiche
other men were afraid to come at, or els being lerned lothed to
visit bicause of the vnsemely dwelling and vplandish rudenesse
of the inhabitants. And yet he dyd so ioyefully giue himselfe to
this godly and charitable labour, and so diligently instructed
them with good and holesome doctrine, that he would go out
of the monasterie oftetimes, and not come home againe in an
whole weke, sometimes not in two or three, yea not in a
whole moneth, but all that time tarie in the hylles among the
poore folke of the countree, exhorting them to the ioyes of
<pb facs="tcp:1516:163"/>
heauen both with the worde of preaching, and worke of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
example. When this reuerend seruante of our Lord had
lyued many yeares in the monasterie of <hi>Mailros,</hi> and excelled
in great signes of vertues, the most reuerend Abbot there <hi>Eata</hi>
remoued him to the yle of Lindesfarne, that he might there
also set forth to the bretherne the keping of regular discipline
both with the authoritie of an head and ruler, and also expresse
and shewe the same by his owne doing and example. For this
most reuerend father did at that time gouuerne the same place
as Abbot there of. Though of olde time in that place both the
bishop was wont to abyde together with his clergie and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of his church, and the Abbot with the monks, who did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

vertues both in heroicall verse, and in prose, yt shall suffise at

goodnes of God doo graunt me in that place, that I may liue
by the worke of mine owne hande I will gladly abyde there:
if not I will God willing very shortly retourne to you againe.
Now this place was quite destitute both of water and graine
and wodde, and also not mete for any man to dwell in bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of the wicked spirits and fendes that haunted there. Yet at
the prayer and desyre of the man of God it became such in all
respecte, that it mighte well inough be enhabited. For at his
comming the euill spirits went their way. Which enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so driuen out, and that he had made himselfe a narrowe
and small dwelling place, compassed about with a trenche, and
with the helping hand of the bretherne had bylded necessarie
howses in the same, that is to saye, a chappell and a common
dwelling place, he commaunded the brethern to make a pyt in
the pauement of the same dwelling place. Which they did, and
yet the earth was very hard and stonye, and semed not to haue
any moisture in the world, nor any vaine of water or spring in
it. But the next day at the faith and praiers of the seruaunt of
God, the pyt was found full of water, which vnto this day doth
geue sufficient vse and aboundance of that heauenly grace to
all that come thither. Beside this he desyred to haue ploughing
tooles brought him and wheate withall, and when he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
and made ready ground before and sowen it in dewe
season, it so happened that at the very time of sommer ther gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
therof not only no eares, but not so much as any blade or
grasse. Wherefore when the bretherne came to visit him as
their maner was, he willed barly to be brought him, to see if
happely the nature of that soile, or the will of the highe
geuer were, that the sede of that graine could growe any better
<pb facs="tcp:1516:164"/>
there. Which when it was brought him, and that he had sowen
it in the same field, out of all season of sowing, and out of all
hope of hauing any frute againe, yet there arose and
grewe vp anon corne plentifully, and gaue to the man of
God the ioyfull refresshing and sustenaunce of his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
And when he had there serued God solitarily many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
(for the banke wherewith his house was compassed and
trenched about was so highe,<note place="margin">The third Synod of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish church.</note> that he could see nothing
els out of it, but heauen, which he thyrsted and longed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

synode assembled in the presence of king <hi>Egfride</hi> by the riuer
of <hi>Alua,</hi> at a place called <hi>Atwiforde,</hi> which signifieth as much,
as, at the two fordes, in which Archebisshop <hi>Theodore</hi> of blessed
memorie was president, and there this foresayd man with one
mind and consent of them all was chosen to be bishop of the
churche of <hi>Lindisfarne.</hi> Who when he could in no wise be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
out of his monasterie for all the messengers and letters
that were sent him, at last the foresayd king himselfe hauing the
most holy bishop <hi>Trumwine</hi> with him and many other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse
parsons and men of power and authoritie, did passe ouer
vnto the Iland. Also many of the bretherne of the ile of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desfar</hi>
came thither for this purpose: all which on their knees
most earnestly desyred and required him for Gods sake and
with weping teares in our Lords name they besought him so
longe, that they made his eyes stand full of swete teares to, and
so they gat him out of his caue, and brought him to the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
And when he came thither, though much againe his owne
will he was ouercomed by the one assent and will of all the
reast, and compelled to submit his necke to beare the yoke and
office of a bishop. And the wordes that forced him most, were,
that the seruaunt of God <hi>Boisil</hi> (who did with the propheticall

had also prophecied and fortelde that <hi>Cutberte</hi> should be bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.

Nowe his consecrating not appointed to be straight way
but after the winter passed which then was at hand, in the feast
and solemnisation of Easter it was finished at Yorke, in the
presence of the foresayd king <hi>Egfride,</hi> where there came to his

vpon him this degree and office of byshop, he dyd setforth and
adorne the same with the workes of vertues and holinesse, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

with continuall prayers make intercession for the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

them to thirst after the ioyes of heauen.<note place="margin">S. Cutbert the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a good Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe.</note> And (the thing

in the vertue of patience, excedingly giuen to deuotion of
praying, affable and familiar to all men that came to him for
comfort and counsell. For he tooke this for a kynde of prayer
too, if he dyd helpe and succour with his exhortation such as
were weake and vnperfecte, knowing that he that sayed, <hi>Thow

the oracle and admonyshment of god, that the day of his death
was nowe at hand, or rather the entraunce and beginning of
that lyfe, which only in dede should be called lyfe. Which thing

               <p>THere was in the same monasterie a certaine monke
named <hi>Beadwegen,</hi> whose office of longe time was to

thither to beare witnesse and testifie. And that obediently and
dewly he doth the office put vnto him, only for the rewarde

he had washed in the sea the mantels or clothes that he occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in the hospitall, comming home againe was in the myd
way sodainly taken with a paine in his bodie, in such wise that
he fell downe on the earth, and laye flat on the ground for a

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1516:167"/>
rysen vp he felte the halfe part of his body from the head to
the fete to be greuously taken and stryken with a palsey, and
so with much paine he came home to the howse leaning on a
staffe. The disease grew and encreased litle, and litle: and when
night came, was waxen so greuouse and painfull, that the next
day he was scant able to ryse vp or go by himselfe. Into which
paine and aduersitie he being thus brought, conceaued in his
mynd a profitable way and counsell, which was to get him to
the churche by some meanes or other as well as he could, and
enter into the tombe of the blessed father <hi>Cutberte,</hi> and there
vpon his knees humbly to beseche the highe soueraine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

with meke mynd beare and suffer this paine and afflicton put
vpon him. And as he had deuised and purposed in his mynd,
so he did in dede, and bearing vp and staying his feble lymmes
with a staffe he went into the churche, and there fell downe
prostrate at the corse of the man of God, praying with feruent
entent and deuotion that through his helpe and intercession
our Lorde wold be good and mercifull vnto him. And as he
was at his prayers falling as it were in a certaine softe slumber,
he felte (as he him selfe was afterward wont to tell) like as a
great brode hand touche his head in that place where the grief
was, and with the same touching passe along ouer all his body
to the very feete, on that syde where the paine laye, and there
with al by litle and litle the grief we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t away, and straight thero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

is buylt by the riuer of Dacore, and thereof hath his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
in whiche that time <hi>Switbert</hi> a good religiouse man
was head and Abbot. In that monasterie there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

put him in danger of the losse of his eye. The physitians layed
salues and plaisters thereto to assuage the swelling, but they
could doo no good: some men wold haue it to be cut of, other
sayed no, for feare of a farther danger. And thus the foresayd
poore brother continewed in this case no small time, and could
get no helpe at mans hand against this perill of the losse of his
eye, but rather it daily encreased and waxed worse, till at last
it was his chaunce through the grace and goodnes of God to
be healed sodainly by the reliliques of the most holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

they tooke partes of the heare of his head, which in maner

before he was made bishoppe. Whose worthynesse and good
lyfe, that all men may more euidently perceaue, I will declare
one miracle wrought by him as one of the same company for
and in whome it was wrought, declared to me: to wit <hi>Gutfride</hi>
a faithfull seruante of Iesus Christe by vocation a priest,<note place="margin">Holy Ilond.</note> who
afterwarde was Abbot of the same church of Lyndisfarne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

father <hi>Aedilwald.</hi> And when we had talked with him a
whyle to our greate comforte, and afterwarde receiuing his
blessing haste nyd homewarde againe, beholde, sodainly as we
were in the mydest off the sea, the caulme in which we sayled
was taken awaye, and so greate a tempest and terrible storme
came vppon vs, that neither with sayle nor ower we coulde pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaile,
nor presently looke for any thinge but deathe. And when
we striuing longe with the wynde and the seas to no effecte,

and no hope of escape in our selfes: Afterwarde when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried

same, we sawe in <hi>Farne</hi> islande that vertuous and holy father
<hi>Aedilwalde</hi> come out of his caue to loke howe we sayled awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye.
For as sone as he heard the blusteringe of the winde, and
rage of the Ocean sea, he came foorthe to see what might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

against the surges of the sea, and in cleane desperation of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
the lande, he fell downe vppon his knees: and prayed to
almighty God, father of our Lorde Iesus Christ to deliuer vs
from that present daunger of death: And when he had ended
his prayer, he appeased the rage of the sea in such sorte, that the
violence of the storme all together ceasing, we had winde and
wether at will without any surges of the sea or greate waues
of water, vntill we came to lande. When we were on grounde,
and had layde our shippe at ancre, streytwayes the same storme

               <p>THe same good Abbot Berecht tolde me an other greate
miracle done by the sayd bisshop: and this it was. When
that lerned prelate and Reuerend father <hi>VVilfride</hi> after
longe exile and banishement was recouered againe to the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke
of <hi>Hagulstalde,</hi> and the same bishop Iohn translated
to Yorke after <hi>Bosa</hi> (a man full of all godlynesse and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
was departed oute of this transitory lyfe, he came on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time to a Nunnerie in a toune called <hi>Vetade,</hi> wher <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buge</hi>
was abbesse. When we were there said he, and intertained
gently with good harte and chereful countinence of al, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse
tolde vs that one of her couent and younge nonnes (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was her owne daughter) beinge sicke, lay languishinge and
pininge awaye, because she was lett blood off late in her arme:
and while she was thinking off it in her fonde and foolyshe
fantasye, the sodayne payne made her very weake: whiche
growing vppon her more and and more, the arme where
the vaine was opened, waxed very sore, and so piteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
swollen, that a man coulde scarse clippe it with bothe his
handes, and she lyinge in her bed for the greate intolerable
paine semed to be almost dead and at the pitts brimme. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Abbesse besought this good bishop to go in and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
her. Because she beleued stedfastly that if he did other blesse
her or touche her, the vehemency of her desease wolde cease,
and she shuld stratyways beginne to amende: He asked them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1516:171"/>
when she was lett blood, and vnderstanding it was donne at
the prime of the mone, sayed, that it was very vnskilfully and
and vndiscretly donne to lett her blud at the prime of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
I remember well (quod he) Archebishop <hi>Theodore</hi> (renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among all his posteritie) tolde me that letting of blud and
opening the vaine was very daungerous about the first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the moone, and rysinge of the sea. And what can I do for
this maiden, nowe she is at deathes doore? Not withstandinge
she besought him very instantly for her daughter, which she
loued tenderly (for she purposed to make her abbesse after her)
and at the lenght with much a doo obtained, so much of him
as to go into the chamber, and see the sicke maiden: Wherefore
he tooke me with him, and went to the maiden which lay lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishinge
(as I said) with greate and intolerable paine in her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
so swellinge that it coulde not once bowe at the elbowe.
And standinge there he sayd certaine prayers ouer her, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had blest her, went out againe. When we had sate an
houre at the table, one came in and called for me, and leading
me a syde from the company, sayde, Coenburge (for that was
the maides name) desyreth you to come to her as sone as
you can. When I came in to the chamber I founde her very
cherefull and mery and as it were almost hole. And when I
had sate by her a whyle, shall we call for some drinke saide she?
mary with a good will quod I, and I am right glad you ar able
so to do. When we had bothe dronke, she beganne to declare
vnto me, that sense the bishoppe had prayed for her and blest
her, and went out of the chamber, she beganne to amend and
waxe better and better, and albeit I haue not recouered my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

is gone bothe out of my arme (where it was most feruent) and

promised that he wolde do great almes to the poore, if he
wolde vouchsaffe to go home to his house that daye and

yowe desire. At the last not able to withstande nor gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say

with stoppe and turne, as could be, the bisshoppe and
I beholding all their pastime, I strayt waies ouercomed with

heard those wordes, notwithstanding with willful will I min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and force lept ouer a deeke by the waye, downe fell I to the
grounde, and as one ready to dye by and by, lost all my senses,
and was not able to moue any one ioyncte of my bodye. For
whereas in the same place lay a stone close to the grounde co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

<pb facs="tcp:1516:174"/>
in all that plaine vally and leuell grounde, it fortuned by
chaunce, or rather by the diuine prouidence off God to punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she
my disobedience it happened, that I pitched vppon the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
stone with my head, and hande which in the fal I putt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

head, that (as I said before) I lay there leeke a dead man ready
for his graue. And bicause I coulde not be remoued thence,
they stretched foorth a pauilion, and made me a lodging the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
This was aboute seuen of clocke in the morninge: from
that houre vntill night I taried there with out any noyse or
disquietnes euen as it had ben a dead man: than I beganne to
reliue and came to my selfe againe, and was caried home to the
bishops lodging, by certaine of my fellowes where I lay speach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
al that night, casting and vomiting blud, because my bulc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

for the tender affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and singular good fansie he bare to

and woulde not all that night after his accustomed manner
tarry with his clergy, but continuing alone in watch all that
night, as I may well coniecture, besought the goodnesse of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God for my health and preseruation. And cominge to
my, chamber early in the morninge, said certaine prayers ouer
me, and called me by my name, and when I waked, as it were
oute of a greate slumber, he asked me, if I knewe, who it was
that spoke to me. And I casting vpp my eyes, saied yea right
well, you ar my dere bishop and master: than said he can you
recouer or liue? Yea quoth I, by yower good prayers if it please
God. So streytwaies laying his hand vppon my head, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peting
the worde of benediction returned again to his praiers,
and coming to see me againe a litle while after, founde me fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vppe in my bed, and well able to speake. Then moued, as
it were with some inspiration from heauen, asked whether I
knewe without all scruple and dowte, whether I was baptized
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1516:174"/>
or no: to that I aunswered, yea forsothe I knowe with oute all
doute I was wasshed in the holly fonte of baptisme in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of synnes, and knowe the priestes name very well that
baptized me: but he foorthwith replyed saying: if you were
christened of him doubtlesse you are not well christened: for I
knowe him well, and am right assured that when he was made
priest he coulde not for his dulheddid witt lerne, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe
nor to baptise. And for that cause I straightly chardged
him not to presume to that mynisterie which he could not do
accordingly: As sone as he had spoken those wordes he began<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to instructe and informe me in the faith againe: and it came
to passe that as he breathed in my face, the payne vanished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye,
and I felt my body much better than it was before. Than
he called for a surgion, and commaunded him to sett my skull
againe, and knitt it vpp together as it should be, and by and by
with his blessing I was so well recouered, that the next daye I
was able to mounte to my horse and ride with him to the next
place where he minded to lodge: And not longe after being
fully recouered I was baptized. This good bisshopp continued
in the see, three and thirty yeres, and so translated thence to the

               <p>THe very same time was wrought in Britanny a miracle
worthy of perpetuall remembraunce and not vnleke to

their soules, a certayne man starke dead for a tyme, rose from
death to lyfe, and tolde many notable thinges that he had seene,
of the which I thought it good to touche certayne briefly in
this historie: There was in the coast of Northumberlande (in a
place callyd Incunning) an honest householder of the countrie
which with all his family lyued a godly and vertous life: He
fell sicke, and by vehemency of his dysease growing more

reuiuing agayne, and fittinge vpp sodaynly: made all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
aboute the corse, runne a way as men wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mased
with feare. Only his wife which loued him tenderly (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she tremblyd and quakyd) tarried still. And he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her sayed, be not afraide. For I am nowe rysen in very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
from death which had me as it were in prison, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to liue in earth amongst men againe, but not after the
same maner and trade as I did before. From hence forth my
conuersation must be farr vnleeke to my former life. And ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by and by, he went to the paryshe churche and continuing
there in prayer vntill it was fayre day light forthwyth diuided
all his goods into thre partes: one parte he gaue to his wife, an

after dispatched of all worldly cares he went to the Monas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery

or intermission (as I might then see) with this alteration
and interchaunge of paynes, I beganne to thynck with my selfe,
peraduenture this may be hell of whose intolerable torments I
haue heard men oftentimes talke. But to this cogitation and
thought of myne, my guyde answeryd sayeng. Na thinke not
so for this is not hell as thowe doest suppose. But when he
brought me farder beinge altogether amased with that terrible
sight, I sawe the places rownde aboute vs sodaynly leese
their lyght and euery corner full of darknes. As we entred
in to them, within a litle space they were so thycke that
I could see nothing, but the bright shewe and cote of him
which did conducte me. When we went forward all alone in
this darknesse beholde sodaynly there appeared before vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rounde flawes of fier ascending as it were oute of a greate
pitt and falling downe againe into the same: When I was
brought thither my conductour and guide vanished away, and
left me alone in the midest of that darknesse, and horrible
sight. But as those flawes of fyer flew vppe into the element
still without intermission, and fell downe into the deape do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ungell
againe, I sawe the topp of euery flawe that ascended
full of mens soules, which in maner of litle sparcles of fyer fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vppe with the smoke were somtimes a hye, and when the
heate and vapors of the fier were gone, fell downe againe into
the pitte. Moreouer a foule and noysom sauour, breaking out
with the same vapours infected all the darke places rownde
<pb facs="tcp:1516:182"/>
about. And as I tarried there somewhat longe in greate horrour
and feare, not knowing what I should do nor whether I shuld
go, nor what should be come of me, in the ende, I heard so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
behinde my backe most lamentable and pitifull crying,
and withall a lowde skournefull lawghing, as it had bene of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
rude and barbarous people, insulting ouer their enemyes
brought in captiuitie and thrauldome. As sone as the noyse wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xing
more brimmer and brimmer came fully to my eares, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried
a multitude of wicked sprites, which did hale, teare, and
plucke, the myserable and wretched soules of men, in to the
midst of darknes, weaping, wayling, and lamenting their state:
the wicked sprits in the meane skornefully laughing and triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
at their myserie: amongest whome, as well as I could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne,
there was a moncke, a lay man, and a woman. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
sprites drawing and haling them, went downe into that
deape fyery flaminge dongell. And it came to passe, that when
they were gone a greate way of, I could neither discerne the
lamentable crye of those soules: neither the skornefull laughter
off the deuills, but had alwaies in my care a confuse noyse. In
the meane season came vp from the fiery flaming dongell, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
euill fauoured blacke sprites and compassed me rounde
aboute, and with there fiery eyes, and foule stinking sauours
which they breathed out had almost strangled me: Besides they
threatned to take me with the fiery forkes in their handes: yet
they could in no wise touche me, although they aduentred to
fraye me. When I was compassed in euery side with such foule
finnes, and ougly darknesse I cast my eies now this way nowe
that way if happely there might come any assistaunce or help
to saue me: and behold there appered behinde me, (euen the
very same way I came) the glimsing of a starre, shining in the
midst of that darkenesse, which waxing brighter and brighter
and coming a pace to me, dispersed those wicked sprites away,
which with their fyery pronges were ready to rent me in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1516:182"/>
He that came and put them to flight was the guide which
conducted me before: Who turning streytwayes vppon the
right hande, lead me as it were somewhat northward where
the sonne riseth in the winter, and with a trice brought me out
of darknesse into the faire brode light. And as he lead me in the
faire shining light, I sawe before vs a greate walle, which was so
longe and so hye, that on nether side I could see any ende. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to maruell and muse with my self, why we should go to
the walle, specially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I saw nor gate, nor loope hole, nor any
other entrance vp to it: but when we were come thither I can
not tell by what meanes, we mounted quickly to the toppe, and
beholde there was a faire brode fielde, both comfortable and
pleasaunt so ful of swete fragra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sauours, and of fresh florisshing
floures, that incontinent the swete smel droue away quite and
cleane all the stinking and lothsom sent of that darke firy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
which had almost stifled me. So goodly and clere a light
shined there in euery place that it semed more fayrer, than the
brightnesse of the day and beames of the some, when it is at
the highest. There were in that field innumerable companies
of white couloured men, many seates, and infinite multitudes
of soules reioysing and triumphing. As he lead me through
the middest of those blessed soules, I beganne to thinke with
selfe, perchaunce this may be heauen, of the which I haue hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
men oftentimes preache. To this my imagination and
thought, he answered saying, this is not the kingdom of heauen
as thou doest imagine. As we went forward and passed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
places of those blessed and happie soules, I sawe a more
brighter shining light before vs than the other was, and heard
a sweete melodious noyse of Musicians, besides that such a
swete perfume and fragra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sauour brake out in euery place, that
the other which I smelled before, and thought excessiuely pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
was in comparison vnpleasaunte and nothing worthe, in
leeke manner as the other bright shininge light of the pleasant
<pb facs="tcp:1516:183"/>
grene fielde in comparison of this semed somewhat darke and
obscure. In to the which paradise of pleasure as I hoped well
we should go, sodainly my conductour and guide stoode
still, and turning backe brought me agayne the same waye
we came. In our returne, when we came to the mansions
and resting places of those blessed soules, he asked me, this
question. Do you knowe what all this is that yowe haue seene?
I answered no: Then he saied vnto me. The vally which you
saw horrible with hotte flaming fyer, and sharp byting colde is
the place, where their soules remaineth to be examined and tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
which differring the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of their synnes, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life had recourse to penaunce in the instant and
pointe of deathe, and so departed owte of this wolrde.
Yet bicause they made humble confession of their synnes and
repented euen at the houre of their deathe, they shall come to
the kingdome of heauen at the day of iudgement, and some
before. For the good prayers, charitable almes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
fastinge of those that yett lyuethe, and especially
the holy sacrifice of the masse, helpe to delyuer many
out of those torments, before that terrible daye. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the the fiery flaminge pitt, and stinkinge doungell, which
thowe didst see is hell mouthe, into the which whosoeuer fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
he shall neuer be delyuered thence. The goodly grene
field full of odoriferous flowers, where thowe sawest all ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
iocund, and mery, is the very same place where their sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
ar receiued which departe oute of this lyfe in the state of
grace, but yet not of such perfection, that they deserue to be
brought streytwaies in to the kingdome of heauen, but for all
that in the day of iudgement, shall haue the sight and fruition
of Christes deity and immortall ioye with his chosen and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Only they which are perfecte in all their wordes,
thoughts, and dedes, ar caried strayt to heauen after they haue
passed their transitory life. The place where thow heardest the

sweete melodious singing, with the goodly flagrante sauours
and bright shyning light, is next adioyninge to this. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge

and lyue amongest men in the wordle ones again, if thowe
wilt diligently examin thy doinges vppon earthe, and directe
thy maner of lyuing in vprightnesse and simplicitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
thy tounge from vaine and ydell talke, certainly assure
thy self to haue a resting place amongest these blessed soules
which thou seest here: for when I went awaye for a tyme and
left the alone, it was for no other cause but to lerne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what should be come of the. When he had talked with
me in this sorte, I vtterly detested this present life and was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
to returne to my naturall body againe. I was so rauished
with the swete fragrant sauoures, and beutifull sights of that
place which I did see, and especiall their society which for the
time made their abode there. Notwithstandinge I durst not be
so bold, as to demaunde or aske any question of my conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
or guide, but in the midest of these meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I perceued
(by what meanes I can not tell) that I was in the world again,
and liued as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did. These sightes and many other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ells, this vertuous and holy man wold not report to sleuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sluggards and idell folkes, men that had no regard of their

torments or rauished with hope of eternall ioye, wolde glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiue and sucke oute of his woordes, some heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte

where is celle stoode, dwelled a monke called <hi>Hengils</hi> promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

sawe, after his body and soule were departed, and by his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>FVrthermore I my self knew a religious man (whom wold
God I had neuer knowen) placed in a good and famous
monasterie, notwithstanding he him selfe was infamous
for his lewde behauiour and loose lyfe. I could tell his name
also, if it were worth the telling. This man was earnestly rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of his bretherne and other head officers of the monastery,
for his enormities, and exhorted to a better trade of lyfe, but
all was in vaine. Notwithstanding, albeit he would not geue
eare nor humbly obey their charitable exhortations, yet they
did tolerate him very longe for his externalll seruice, which
was very necessarie for them. For he was a singular good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter.
This man was much geuen to dronknesse and other

in his shopp both day and night, than to come to the church to
singe or pray, or heare the trew worde of life with his brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

with much lamentation and deepe sitghes, leeke a man dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

cast in flaminge fier, hard by him: and next to them (oh,

of eternall perdition prepared for me. His bretherne hearing
these wofull wordes exhorted him earnestly to repent and be

extreme desperation answered, No No. There is no time for me
to amend my former life, especially seing I perceiue my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

died without receauing the sacrament. His bodie was interred

came againe, for obseruation of which feaste he should haue
bene forced to much variaunce and discorde by such as wold

               <p>This <hi>Wilfride</hi> being but a childe was of such towardnesse
and good nature,<note place="margin">The lyfe of bishop VVilfrid the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Sussex.</note> induced with so many goodly qualities, of
such modest and honest behauiour in all pointes, that all the
elders and auncients did with a speciall good loue reuerence
him. After he was xiiij. yere olde, he more estemed a monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and solitarie lyfe, than all secular and wordly wealth. The
which thing when he had communicated with his father (for
his mother was departed to the mercy of God) he gladly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
to his holly requestes and godly desires, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to persiste in that godly purpose,<note place="margin">Holy Ilond.</note> which he had enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Hereuppon he came to the isle <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> and there atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the monks, he dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly lerned, and gladly practised, al
pointes of chastity, and godlinesse required in a solitarie and
religious man. And because he had a goodly pregnant witt
he lerned spedely psalmes and certain other bookes of prayers,
being not yet shoren in or professed, but well garnished with
those vertues, which far surmounted the outward profession
to witt of humility and obedience. For the which he was wel
loued and estemed bothe of the elders, and also of his equals.
When he had serued God certaine yeares in that monastery
he perceaued by litle and litle being growen in iudgement (as
a wife younge man that could quickly fore see) the waye of

The which determination of his, after notice geuen to
his Bretherne by preuy conference, eche man did well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
it, and persuaded him to go forward in his good purpose.
Incontinent coming to Quene <hi>Eamflede</hi> (who knew him wel,
and by whose counsell and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation he was receaued into
that monastery) declared to her hyghnesse that he had an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and feruent desyre to visit the monuments of the holy
Apostles. The Quene much delited with the younge mans
good purpose and zele, sent him to Caunterbury to kinge
<hi>Ercombert</hi> which was her vncles sonne requiring that it might
please his highnesse to send him honorably to Rome: at what
time <hi>Honorius</hi> one of the blessed Pope Gregories schollers, a
man profoundly lerned in holy scripture, was Archebishop
there. When this younge man lackinge nor good courage, nor
lyuely sprite, had tarried there a space, and employed his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to lerne and commit to memory, that which he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loked,
there repaired thither an other younge gentilman who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
name was Bishop, and Christen name Benet, one of the
nobles of Englande, desyrours to go to Rome, of whom I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
mentioned before. The kinge committed <hi>VVilfride</hi> to this
younge gentilman and his company, with chardge that he
shuld conduct him safe to Rome. When they came to Lyons
in Fraunce, <hi>VVilfrid</hi> was stayd there by <hi>Dalphine,</hi> bishop of that
city. The gentleman went on his iourney to Rome. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleasure, which the bishop had in <hi>VVilfrides</hi> wyse tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
aminable continaunce, ioly actituity, and graue inuention,
was the occasion why he was staied there. For that cause also
he gaue him, and all his company frendfull intertainement as
long as they continued there: and furder offred him the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
of a greate parte of Fraunce, the mariadge of his
<pb facs="tcp:1516:192"/>
brothers daughter, (whiche was yet in the flower of her
virginity,) brefely to adopte him for his heyr, if he wolde make
his abode there. But he rendring lowly and harty thankes for so
great courtesy and gentilnesse, that the bishop vouchsafed to
shew vnto him being but a straunger, answered, that he was
fully determined to an other conuersation and trade of lyffe:
and therfore had forsaken his country, and taken this iourney
to Rome. The which when the bishop heard, he sent him to
Rome, with a guide to conducte him in the waye, and gaue
him mony sufficient to beare his chardges, desyringe that at his
returne he wolde remember to take his house by the waye.
<hi>VVilfride</hi> with in fewe dayes after cominge to Rome, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypuing

according to his first determination fel acquainted with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
holy and lerned man called <hi>Boniface,</hi> who was Archedea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
and one of the Apostolike Popes counsellers. By whose
instruction he lerned orderly the foure bookes of the Gospell,
and the trewe counte of Easter, and many other godly lessons
commodious and profitable to vnderstande the orders and
disciplines of the churche, which he could not attaine vnto in
his owne country. And when he had passed certaine mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
there, in godly exercise and study, he returned to <hi>Dalfine</hi>
againe in Fraunce, and after he had tarried with him iij. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
he toke the inferiour orders of the bishop, and was so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly
loued of him that the bishoppe fully determined to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
him his successour. But by cruel death he was preuented and
<hi>VVilfride</hi> reserued to a bishoprike in his owne natyue country,
England. For Brunechild Quene of Fraunce sent a power, and
commaunded the bishop to be put to death: whom <hi>VVilfride</hi>
his chappellain folowed to the place of execution, desyring to
die with him, albeit the bishop did vtterly forbid him. But
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the executioners knew, he was a stranger and an English
man borne, they spared him, and wold not put him to death,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1516:192"/>
with the bishop. Wereuppon returning to England he was
brought to be in frendship and amity with kinge Aldfride.
Who leke a good Prince had lerned to folow and reuerence
the general ordinaunces and rules of the catholike church.
And for that he perceaued this <hi>VVilfride</hi> to be Catholique, he
gaue him streytwayes a Lordshippe, of x. tenements in Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:
and within a while after a monastery with xxx. tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Rhippon: which he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but late to build an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay
forsuch as folowed the Scottes: but because they being put
to liberty and choise, had rather departe thence then to receiue
the trewe and Catholique celebration of the feast of Easter,
and other canonicall rites and ceremonies after the custome
of the church of Rome, and see Apostolike, he gaue it to him,
whome he sawe better qualified both for lerninge and for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The same time in the very selfe same monastery he was
made priest by <hi>Agilbert</hi> bishop of<note n="*" place="margin">The countre about Salisbury</note> 
                  <hi>Geuisse</hi> (of whom we spake

depriued of his bisshopricke, and others consecrated and put in
<pb facs="tcp:1516:193"/>
his place, of whome we made mention before. But when he
had taken shipp to go to Rome, and pleade his cause before the
Apostolike pope he was dryuen by a Sowthweast winde into
<hi>Freslande,</hi> where he was honorably receaued as well of the rude
and barbarous people, as of the Kinge <hi>Aldgiste.</hi> Where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ached
also vnto them Christ and his ghospell, conuerting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousandes to the faith, and with baptisme wasshing away

ghospell in those countries, which the Reuerend father
and holy byshopp <hi>VVilbrord</hi> perfited and finyshed afterward.
But when he had passed ouer a winter with this people newly
conuerted to Christe, he went forwarde his iourny to Rome.
When his cause was debated to and fro, in the presence of Pope
<hi>Agatho,</hi> and many other bishopps, he was founde in processe by
all their iudgementes to haue bene most vniustly accused, and
best worthy of that bishopprick. At what time the same <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>

declare his faith and the faith of the countrie from whence he
came, sittinge amongest the other bishops: Wherin when he

isles of Englande and Irelande, whiche ar inhabited with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe
men, Britons, Scottes, and Pictes, the trewe and catholike
faith, and confirmed the same with his subscription. After his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1516:193"/>
returne to Britanny againe,<note place="margin">Bishopp VVilfride the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Sussex.</note> he conuerted the South saxons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

concluded in the fore said Synod assembled by Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> of
blessed memory, kept but of late when he hym selfe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

furder his cause. For when the Actes of the Synode, as occasion

iudged by the see Apostolik, euen the very same which of late
coming hither for the false accusations of his aduersaries, was

                  </gap> Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> after the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
and controuersie was well examined of bothe parties, and
thought to haue ben depriued of his bishopricke against all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we,
and more than that hadd in such honour and estimation
of Pope Agatho of blessed memory, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to
sitt in the Synode which he assembled at Rome, as a man off a
trew perfect faith and syncere minde. All these allegations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard, the Pope and all that were present sayed, that a man
of such authoritie which had bene bisshoppe xl. yeares, ought
not to be condemned, but once agayne dischardged and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the false accusations and malicious surmises of his
enemies, and sent home againe with honour to his countrie.
With this iudgement returning towardes England, he fell so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
sicke, when he came to Fraunce, and was so weakened,
the desease growing vppon him more and more, that he could
not ryde, nor kepe his horse, but was caried in a bed by strength
of his seruauntes. Being thus brought to <hi>Meldune</hi> a citye in
Fraunce, he lay iiij, dayes and iiij. nights as though he had byn
dead. Only declaring by a litle breath, which he drewe very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yntly
and short, that he was a lyue. Thus continuing iiij. dayes
without meate and drinke, as speachelesse, and past hearing, he
rose the fifte daye, and sate vppe in his bed, as a man awaked
out of a deape sleepe, and when his eyes were open, he sawe a
company of his brethern aboute him, some singing, some wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and fetting a litle sigthe, asked for his chaplyn <hi>Acca.</hi> By
and by he was called. Who entring into the chambre, and seing
his bishoppe somewhat better amended, and able to speake, he
fell downe vpon his knees, and gaue thankes to God with all
the company that was present. And when they had sate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a litle while, and entred talke fearefully, of the high iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, the bishop commaunded al to auoide the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1516:194"/>
for an houre, and beganne to talke after this manner to his
chaplin <hi>Acca.</hi> There appeared vnto me euen now a terrible
vision, the which I wil haue thee heare, and concele withal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I know knowe furder the pleasure of almighty God, what
shal become of me. A certaine man clothed all in white, stode
by me, saying. I am <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell sent hither for this
only purpose, to deliuer thee from daunger of death. For our
Lord hathe geuen the longer tyme to lyue for the earnest pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
and lamentations, which thy scholars and bretherne here
haue made, and also for the intercession of the blessed virgin
Marie his mother: Wherefore I say vnto the, that presently thou
shalt be healed of this infirmitie and sickenesse, but yet be in a
readynesse: for after iiij. yeares I will returne againe and visit
the. Agayne, as sone as thou art returned to thy countrye,
the greatest part of thy possessions, that haue ben taken away
from the, thou shalt receiue againe, and ende thy life in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie
and peace. Vppon which comfortable wordes the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
recouered to the greate ioye of all men, reioysing and
praysing God for him. Thus going forward on his iourney he
came to England. When the letters brought from the see Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique
were reade, <hi>Berechtwald</hi> archebisshop and <hi>Edilrede</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes
kinge (but then made an Abbot) receiued him gladly
in fauour againe. <hi>Edilred</hi> also entreating <hi>Coenrede</hi> whom he
had made kinge in his place, to come and speake with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
him to be a good and gratious Lord to the saied bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp,
which also he obtained. But <hi>Aldfride</hi> king of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland
which would not receiue him, died within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
By which occasion it fel out in the raigne of kinge <hi>Osred</hi>

the one and fourtith yeare, after he was directed from Pope
<hi>Vitalian</hi> and made coadiutor to <hi>Theodore,</hi> and the 39. after he
came to Englande: Of whose profounde knowledge and ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
amongest other thinges, this may be a sufficient testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that <hi>Albine</hi> his schollar, who had the gouernaunce of

holy scripture, that he had greate knowledge in the greeke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unge,
and did speake latin as eloquently withoute staggering
or staying, as he did english, which was his naturall language.

and Martirs reliques, to the ende he might in honour of them
builde certaine aultars a parte by them selues in litle chapels
made for the same purpose, within the precincte and walles
of the same churche. Besides he sought with al possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
the histories of their martyrdome and other ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
writers, and made vp a very large and worthy library. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
he zelously prepared holy vessels, lightes, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
appertaining to the better furniture and adorninge of the
church of God. Againe he sent for a cunning Musician named
<hi>Mabam</hi> which was taught by the successours of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
his schollars in Canterbury, to teach him and his clergy to tune
<pb facs="tcp:1516:196"/>

of the church which they could not yet singe, partly by his

tunes as for lacke of vse had ben quite, and cleane forgotten.
For bishop <hi>Acca</hi> him selfe was a very cunninge Musician, wel

doth not plainly see, that from the xiiij. day to the xxj. be nott

to the euening of the xxi. (as the veritie of holy scripture dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
searched oute doth declare) we shall well perceiue, that
the xiiij. daye so beginneth the feast of Easter in the euening,
that all the whole weeke hath no more but vii. dayes and vij.
nightes. Wherefore our proposition is proued trew, wherin we
saied that Easter must be kepte in the first moneth of the yere,
and the thirde weeke of that moneth. And that is in dede truly

fell vppon the saboth daye, euery man should take a lambe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their families and householdes, and offer him vpp in
sacrifice at the euening. That is to saye, all christian churches
through out the whole world (which all ioyned together ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

the selffe same night that the people of Israell were deliuered
oute of Aegypte by the bloude of the lambe. This is the same
night in whiche the people of God were delyuered from aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death, by Christes glorious resurrection. In the morning
folowing, being Sondaye, the solemne feast of Easter should
be celebrated. For that is the day, wherein our Sauiour, opened
the glory of his resurrection, appearing diuers times in that one
day to his disciples, to their vnspeakeable comfort and ioye.
This is the first daye of the swete bread of the which clere

the next sounday also should be expected and looked for from
the xv. day to the one and twentyth off the same monethe. For

in the same. And that because it appertaineth to the number of
these vij. daies in which the feast of sweete bred is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

any force of necessitie the time apointed in the lawe, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
for al men to espye. For they anticipate and preuent the
time appointed in the lawe without any force of necessity,
which thinke that Easter day must be kepte, from the xiiij.
moone of the firste moneth to the xx. of the same. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they begynne the eue of that holy feast, from the eueninge
of the xiij. it appereth that they appointe that day in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
of their Easter wherof they finde no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion in the law.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1516:199"/>
And whereas they refuse to kepe the Easter soundaye the xxj.
daye, in it appereth truly that they exclude vtterly from their
solemnity that day which the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth to be obserued
and had in memory with ioy and mirth aboue al other. And so
they end their Easter after a peruerse ordre keping it somtimes
altogether in the seconde weeke, but neuer in the vij. day of the
third weeke. Againe they which thinke they shuld kepe Easter
from the xvj. day of the saide moneth to the xxij. day roue far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
wide from the truth, and runne though an other waie, yet as
farre out of the waie, as the other did, falling (as the common
prouerbe sayth) in to the greate gulff, and swalloing sandes of
Charibdis, while they seeke to escape the dangerous straites of
Scilla. For wheras they teach, that we shulde beginne frgm the
rising of the xvj. moone of the first moneth (that is from the
eueninge of the xv day) it is manifest, that they vtterly seclude
from their solemnity, the xiiij. day of the same moneth, which
the law doth principally and before the rest commend: so that
they scarse come to the eueninge at all of the xv. day in the
which the people of God were deliuered out of the bondage
of Aegipt, in the which our sauiour Christ delyuered the
worlde from synne by sheding his precious blud, in the which
he being buried, put vs in comfort and hope of resurrection
and aeternall rest after deathe. And these men by occasion of
their former errour, falling in to an other in punishment of
the first, whereas sometimes they kepe their Easter in the xxii.
day of the saied moneth, they do expressely passe the bondes
of Easter commaunded in the lawe. For in the euening of that
day they beginne their Easter, in which euening they ought
by the lawe cleane to haue ended and finished their Easter.
Againe by this meanes they make that day the first daye of
Easter, which in the lawe is not mentioned at all: to wit, the
first day of the fourth weeke. And both these sortes of men are
deceaued not only in counting the age of the moone, but also
<pb facs="tcp:1516:200"/>
in finding out of the first moneth. The debating of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is more tedious and lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, then that either it can or may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in an epistle. Only this I say, that the time being ones cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day is as long, as the night, and the night

of the moon, and which ought to be the last. In the spring
the day is as longe as the night, and so the night as long as the
day after the opinion of all lerned men in the East, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the Aegiptians which beare the price for calculation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other Astronomers<note n="*" place="margin">The xxj. daie of marche.</note> the xii. calendes of Aprill, as we
also haue had experience by triall of the dyall. Whatsoeuer
moone therfor is at ful befor the day and night be of one le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght
being xiiii. or xv. dayes olde, that mone pertaineth to the last
moneth the yere befor, and therfor is not meet or conuenient
for the feast of Easter. But that mone which is at full either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the day and night be of one and equal lenght, or in the very
pointe of that equalitie, in that doubtlesse (because it is the full
moone of the first moneth) we must vnderstand that the olde
au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cients wer wount to kepe Easter, and that we ought to kepe
ours in leeke manner, when the Sondaie cometh.<note place="margin">Gene. 1.</note> That it
shuld be so, this reason semeth somwhat to enforce: In Genesis
it is written that God made ii. great lights the greater to rule
the day, and the lesser ouer the night: or as some other transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath, the greater light was made to begynne the day and
the lesser to beginne the night. Therfore as at the first begin|
ning, the son rising from the full middest of the East made
by that his rising, the equalite of day and night in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the yere: and as the moone in the very first day of the
worlde the son going downe, folowed also at the full, rising
in the midst of the East: so euery yere in leeke manner the
first moneth of the moone must be obserued after the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
rate: so that she be not at the full, before the day and night
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1516:200"/>
be of one length but either on the very same day (as it was at
the first creating of the worlde) or when it is paste. For if the ful
mone go but one day, befor the day and night be of one length,
the former reason proueth manifestly that the same mone must
not be ascribed to the firste moneth of the yere, but rather to
the laste of the yere that is past: and for that consideration not
meete nor conuenient for the solemnisinge of Easter daye. Els
in one yere we should haue ij. Easters. Now if it like yow to
heare also the mysticall reason hereof, this it is. In the firste
moneth of the yere, (which is called <hi>mensis nouorum,</hi> that is,
the<note n="*" place="margin">The moneth of Aprill.</note> moneth of new springe) we are commaunded to kepe the
feaste of Ester, because our hartes and mindes being renewed
toward the loue of heauenly thinges, we ought to celebrate and
honour the mysteries of Christes resurrection and our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
We are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to keepe the third weeke of the same
moneth, first because Christ him self promised vnto vs before
the lawe, and in the time of the lawe, came in the thirde age off
the worlde in the time of grace, and was made our Easter, and
passeouer. Secondarely becawse he risinge from deathe the
third daye after his bitter passion vpon the crosse, woulde haue
that daye to be called the daye of our Lorde,<note n="*" place="margin">Dies Dominic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
men to kepe the feast of Easter yearly the very same day in
honour of his glorious resurrection. The thirde cawse is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do then truely keepe this solemne feast, if we ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to the vttermost of our power to make our passeouer
(that is to saye ower passage owte of this wordle to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
with the triple knot of faith, hope, and charytie. After
theequalite of the daye and night we are commaunded yet to
tary for the full moone of the moneth in which Easter falleth,
to thend that first the sonne may make the day longer then the
night, and afterward the moone also may appeare to the world
in her full light, to signifie vnto vs, that the son of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in whose beames is our saluation, that is to sayour Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:1516:201"/>
Iesus Christe by the victory and triumphe which he had in his
resurrection, hath ouercomed the darknesse of deathe, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendinge
to heauen hath replenished his churche: (whiche is
ofte signified by the moone) with the inwarde light of his
grace, by sendinge downe the goly ghoste. The which ordre
of ower saluation the prophete beholdinge, said, <hi>Eleuatus est
sol &amp; luna stetit in ordine sno.</hi> The sonne is lyfted vppe, and the
moone stode in her ordre. They therefore which contendeth
that the full moone of the moneth in which Easter should fall
may come before the Son maketh the daye and night of equall
length, as they disagree in the celebration of most high and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
misteries from the doctrine of holy scripture, so they seme
well to agree with them, which trust to be saued with owt the
preuenting grace of Christe.<note place="margin">He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Pelagians</note> Which in dede presume to teache
that man myght haue had perfecte iustification, though Christ
the trewe lyght had neuer ouercomed the blyndnesse off the
world with his painefull death and glorious resurrection. To
conclude therefore, we about the equinoctiall springe, when
the day and night be of one length, and when the full moone
of the firste moneth orderly folowing the same (that is to saye)
after the xiiij daye of the said moneth is fully expired (the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of all which tymes is commaunded in the lawe) do
expecte yet in that thirde weeke (accordinge as in the ghospel
we lerne) the next Sonday folowing, and then we keepe the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
feaste of Ester: And that to thende we may testyfie by
ower doings, that we cellebrat not this solemnytie with the old
fathers, in remembraunce that the children off Israel had the
harde yoke of bondage shaken from their neckes in Aegipte, but
that we woorshipp with deuoute faith, and perfecte charitie the
redemption of all the world, prefigured in that deliuerance off
gods old people owte of thrauldome, and fully ended in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

that, where as before the bishop of Alexandria was wonte eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

of the Easter that yeare to be obserued, now from hence forth
the course of the full moone being brought in to this order, and

reached euen to ouer tyme. The which now approching nigh
to the date and terme prefixed, there is nowe adayes, such store
of calculatours, that in our churches through owte all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
there be many, which can by the olde preceptes of

to memory) extende and drawe forthe the circle and
course of Easter, in to as many yeares, as them listeth, euen
to the numbre of 532. yeares. Which number of yeares
being expired, all that appertaineth to the course of the son,

<pb facs="tcp:1516:202"/>
the dew obseruation of Easter, accordinge to yower
highnesse requeste, we exhorte you most humbly to prouide
that your clergy haue the same tonsure which the church doth
receiue and vse as most agreable to the Christian faith: wherof
you required also our letters. We know right wel that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were not shauen all after one sorte. Neither now the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
catholique church as it agreeth in one faith, one hope, and
one charite towardes God, so vseth also one and the self same
order of tonsure. Againe that we may consider the time befor
vs, to wit, the time of the holy patriarches, Iob a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of patience, when his tribulation and aduersite beganne,
shore his head. Wherby we learne that in time of prosperity
he was accustomed to lett his heare growe. Yet <hi>Ioseph</hi>
a trewe teacher and practiser of chastity, humility, piety and al
other vertues, is written to haue bene shauen, when he came
out of preson. Wherby it appeareth that in prison for the tyme
of his induraunce he was wounte to remaine with longe heare
nor clipte nor shorne. Lo here two vertuous and godly men
who inwardly in hart and mind wer one, shewed yet in outward
behauiour some diuersite and contrariete. But though we may
boldly saye that the diuersite of ecclesiasticall tonsure hurteth
nothing at all such as haue a pure faith in God, and perfecte
charitie towarde their neighbour, especially seing we reade no
controuersie betwene the catholike writers, touching the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and diuersitie of shauing, as ther hathe bene for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of Easter, yet notwithstanding amongest all kynde off
tonsures which we finde to haue ben vsed or in the church, or
vniuersally amongest all other men, I may well saye, that none
is rather to be folowed and receaued of vs, than the very same,
which he ware on his head, to whom Christ saied after he had
confessed him to be the sonne of God.<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note>

and debate this matter so largely, as though I iudged
them worthy to be condemned which vse this manner of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge,
yff they tender in hart and dede the vnytie of Christes
catholique churche. Nay I boldly protest, and affirme that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them haue bene vertuous and holy men. Of the which
<hi>Adamannus,</hi> priest and Abbot of the Columbines is one. To
whom amongest all other thinges, when he was sent in emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
for his owne countrie to kinge <hi>Alfride,</hi> and as he passed was
desyrous to see our monasterie, and shewed in his behauiour
and talke, much wisdome, humilitye, and godlynesse, I saied
these wordes vnto him. I beseke you good brother. Why do
you, beleuing that you shall passe hence to a crowne of lyfe
that hath no ende, weare in your head the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of a crowne, which hath an ende, seming in behauiour to
be contrary to your faith? And if you seke the felowshipp off S.
Peter, why do you follow that manner of shauing, which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
whom S. Peter did ex communicate and deliuer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,
and do not rather shewe that you loue entierly with al your
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1516:203"/>
harte his habite, with whom you desire to lyue in eternall blys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se?
Knowe you for a suerty my derely beloued brother (quoth
he) that albeit I vse the same fasshion of shauing which Symon
Magus did after the custome and manner of my country, yet I
vtterly detest and abandone the vnfaithfulnesse and infidelyty
of Symo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus and desire with al my hart to follow the step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
of the most blessed head of the Apostles <hi>S. Peter</hi> so farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
as my poore habilitie wil serue. To that I replyed and saied.
I beleue it is so in very dede. Yet it may be a more manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that you embrace euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottom of your hart al
that the holy Apostle Peter taught, if you kepe that outwardly
which you knew was vsed of him generally. For I thinke your
wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do easely iudge it most conuenient vtterly to seclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your presence and face (dedicated to God) the habit, proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and figure of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinaunce, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you abhorte with all harte,
and minde. And contrariwise as you desyre to folow his steps
and counsell, whome you looke to haue as a patrone before
God the father, so it besemeth you to follow his outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.
This for that time I spoke to <hi>Adamanus.</hi> Who after well
declared how much he had profited by seinge the ordinaunces
and rules of our churche. For after his returne to Scotland he
reduced by his preaching many of the same cuntry, to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
obseruation of Easter. Albeit he coulde not reduce
the monkes that liued in the Iland Hij (where he was Abbat)
thereto as yet. He thought also to redresse the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
tonsure amongst them, if his authority could haue
preuailed. And I nowe also (most puissant prince) do exhorte
you to endeuour with all the country, where the kinge of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and lorde of lordes, hathe geuen you the souerainte, to
obserue and kepe all that agreeth with the vnity of Christes
catholike and Apostolike church. So it will come to passe, that
after you haue had dominion and rule here vpon earth, the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mat
and head of the blessed Apostles will gladly open to you
<pb facs="tcp:1516:204"/>
and yowers the gates of heauen to rest with the holy angells,
and other dere fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of God. The grace of God, of our Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
kinge and lord preserue you (most derely beloued son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in Christe) and graunte you longe prosperous raigne to
our quietnesse and peace. When this epistle was reade in the
presence of kinge <hi>Naitane,</hi> with many other lerned men besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
being truly translated into the kinges natiue tounge, by
them which did well vnderstande it, he much reioysed at that
exhortation as some make reporte: euen so much that rising
from the place where he and many of the nobility were sate,
he fell downe vppon his knees, and gaue God thankes, that he
had deserued to receiue such a benefit out of Englande. And
treuly, saied he, I knewe before that this was the trewe celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and kepinge of Easter: but nowe I do so well knowe the
cause and reason, why it shuld be so obserued, that me thinketh
I had no knowledg of it at all before: wherfore I professe and
openly protest before you all, that ar here present, that from
henceforth I and all my people, wil kepe the feast of Easter at
the time which is here described. I thinke it good also that all
priests and religious men in my realme ought to receaue this
kinde and manner of shauing, which we haue heard to be very
reasonable. And without any furder delaye by his princely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he performed that which he spoke. For forthwith the
accompte of xix. yeres,<note place="margin">This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the golden numbre.</note> were sent abrode by a publique edicte,
to be copied oute, lerned, and obserued through out al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
