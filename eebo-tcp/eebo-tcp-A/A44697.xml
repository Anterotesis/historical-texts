            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my much valued Friends, The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and other Inhabitants of Great-Torrington
in Devon, with the several
Worthy and Religious Persons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of my acquaintance in those Parts.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is likely that the Title of the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
will put many of you (my dearly esteemed
Friends) in mind, that sundry Sermons were
preach't twenty years ago among you upon this
Subject. I had it indeed in design, to have given
you some abstract of those Sermons; But searching
among my Papers, could find none but so imperfect
and broken Memorials as would be of little use for
that purpose. And yet being desirous to present you with
somewhat that might both be a testimony of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and an advantage to you: And knowing this
Subject was grateful to many, and affords what may
be useful to all of you; I have for your sakes, applied
my self to a re-consideration of it. Few passages or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
probably, will occur to you that you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
yet you will find the substance of the Doctrine
the same: As from so plain a Text, it could not
well but be, whosoever should have had the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it. The <hi>First Part</hi> is even altogether
new, except the introductive suppositions in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
Nor do I remember I then had more than
one Discourse to you on that Subject, before the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
application of it. The <hi>other Part</hi> contains many
things formerly delivered to you, though perhaps
not in the same order, much less in the same words,
<pb facs="tcp:32156:5"/>
whereto the short Notes in my hands could no way
inable me.</p>
            <p>The matter here treated of, is the very Substance
of Religion; The <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last;</hi> The <hi>root</hi> and
the <hi>flower;</hi> Both the <hi>basis</hi> and <hi>foundation,</hi> and
the <hi>top</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Practical Godliness;</hi>
And which runs through the whole of it. Nor knew
I therefore what to present you with, that could have
in it a fitter mixture and temperament of what
might be both useful and pleasant to you.</p>
            <p>As there is therefore no need, so nor do I desire
you should receive the <hi>matter</hi> here discours'd of,
<hi>meerly</hi> for my sake; there being so great reason, it
should be chiefly acceptable on higher accounts. I
do very well understand your affection to me; and
could easily be copious in the expression of mine to
you, if I would open that Sluce: But I do herein
resolvedly, and upon consideration restrain my self;
Apprehending, that in some cases (and I may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it possible that in our case) a gradual mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
ought to be endeavoured of such affection as is
often between those so related as you and I have been.
Which is no harder supposition, than that such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
may be excessive and swell beyond due bounds:
So it would, if it should be accompanied with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
resentments towards any Providence or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby it finds it self crossed, or from whence
it meets with what is ungrateful to it: If it prove
turbulent and disquieting to them in whom it is,
or any others: Or if it occasion a looking back with
distempered lingerings after such former things as
could be but means to our great End<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the neglect
of looking forward to that End it self still before us. Far
be it from me, to aim at the keeping any thing alive that
ought to dye; that is, in that degree wherein it ought
so to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32156:5"/>
But our mutual affection will be both innocent and
useful, if it be sutable to mortal objects, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not expecting the converse we have had together
any more in this world. If also in the mean time it
preserve to us a mutual interest in each others prayers.
If it dispose us to such acts and apprehensions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as our present circumstances can admit. And if,
particularly, as it hath moved me to undertake, it may
contribute <hi>any thing</hi> to your acceptance of this small
labour, which is now designed for you. The <hi>subject</hi>
and <hi>substance</hi> whereof, as they are none of mine, so
they ought to be welcome to you, for their own sake,
and His who is the prime Author, though they were
recommended to you by the hand of a stranger, or one
whose face you never saw.</p>
            <p>They aim at the promoting of the same End which
the course of my poor labours among you did, (as He
that knoweth all things knoweth), <hi>The serious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the great things of Religion,</hi> which are
known and least liable to question; without designing
to engage you to or against any party of them that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about circumstantial matters. They tend to let you
see, that Formality in any way of Religion, unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Life, will not serve your turn, (as it will
no mans); Than which, there is nothing more empty,
sapless, and void both of profit and delight.</p>
            <p>I have reflected and considered with some satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this hath been my way and the temper of my
mind among you. Great reason I have to repent, that
I have not with greater earnestness prest upon you the
known and important things wherein serious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do generally agree: But I repent not I have been
so little engag'd in the hot contests of our age, about
the things wherein they differ. For, as I pretend to
little light in these things (whence I could not have
<pb facs="tcp:32156:6"/>
much confidence to fortifie me unto such an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king);
so I must profess to have little inclination to
contend about matters of that kind.</p>
            <p>Nor yet am I indifferent as to those smaller things,
that I cannot discern to be in their own nature so. But
though I cannot avoid to think that course right which
I have deliberately chosen therein, I do yet esteem that
but a small thing upon which to ground an opinion
of my excelling them that think otherwise, as if I
knew more than they. For I have often recounted thus
seriously with my self, That of every differing Party
(in those circumstantial matters) I do particularly
know some persons by whom I find my self much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in far greater things than is the matter of that
difference. I cannot ('tis true) thereupon say and
think every thing that they do; which is impossible,
since they differ from one another as well as me. And I
understand well, there are other Measures of Truth
than this or that excellent Persons Opinion: But I
thereupon reckon I have little reason to be conceited of
any advantage I have of such in point of knowledg,
(even as little as he should have, that can Sing, or
Play well on a Lute, of him that knows how to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Armies, or Govern a Kingdom); And can
with the less confidence differ from them, or contend
with them. Being thereby, though <hi>I cannot find</hi>
that I err in these matters, constrain'd to <hi>have some
suspicion</hi> lest I do; and to admit it possible enough, That
some of them who differ from me, having much more
light in greater matters, may have so in these also.
Besides, that I most seriously think, Humility, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Patience, would more contribute to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of these lesser Differences, or to the good estate
of the Christian Interest under them, than the most
fervent Disputes and Contestations. I have upon such
<pb facs="tcp:32156:6"/>
considerations little concern'd my self in contending
for one way or another, while I was among you; or
in censuring such as have differed from me, in such
Notions and Practices as might consist with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
great End; or as imported not manifest hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereto. Contenting my self to follow the course that
to my (preponderating) judgment seemed best, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stepping out of my way to justle others.</p>
            <p>But I cannot be so patient of their <hi>practical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement,</hi>
(not only with all serious Christians,
but even their own Judgments and Consciences also),
<hi>who have no Delight in God,</hi> and <hi>who take no
pleasure in the very substance of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been grieved to observe, That the case hath
too apparently seemed so, with some among you: Some
have been openly profane and dissolute, and expressed
<hi>more Contempt of God</hi> (which you know was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
insisted on the one part of the day<note n="*" place="margin">From <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 13.</note>, when I had
<hi>this subject</hi> in hand the other) <hi>than Delight in
him.</hi> I know not how the case may be altered with
such since I left you; or what blessing may have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the endeavours of any other hand: Death I am
sure will be making alterations, as I have heard it hath.
If these lines may be beforehand with it, may they be
effectually monitory to any such that yet survive! That
however this or that <hi>external from of godliness</hi> may
consist with your everlasting well-being, <hi>real ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and the <hi>denial of the power</hi> never can; which
<hi>power</hi> stands in nothing more than in <hi>love to God,</hi>
or <hi>delight in him.</hi> Therefore seriously bethink your
selves, <hi>Do you delight in God or no? If you do,</hi>
methinks you should have some perception of it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if you delight in a friend, or some other outward
comfort, you can perceive it. But <hi>if you do not,</hi> What
do you think <hi>alienation from the life of God</hi> will
<pb facs="tcp:32156:7"/>
come to at last? It is time for you to pray, and cry,
and strive earnestly for a renewed heart. And if any
of you do in some degree find this yet many degrees are
still lacking. You cannot delight in God, but upon that
apprehension as will give you to see, you do it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
Therefore reach forth to what is still before.
I bow my knees for you all that a living delightful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may flourish in your hearts and families, in the
stead of those dry, wither'd things, <hi>worldliness, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,</hi>
and <hi>strife about trifles.</hi> Which will make
<hi>Torrington</hi> an <hi>Heph-zibah,</hi> a place to be delighted
in; your Country a pleasant Region: And (if he
may but hear of it) add not a little to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

TREATISE
OF
Delighting in GOD:
From <bibl>PSAL. 37. 4.</bibl>

               <p>THIS <hi>Psalm,</hi> by the Contents of it,
seems to suppose,</p>
               <p>An afflicted state of <hi>good men,</hi>
by the oppression of such as were
(in that and other respects) <hi>very wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prosperity of these <hi>wicked ones</hi> in
their oppressive course.</p>
               <p>An aptness in the <hi>oppressed</hi> to impatience
under the <hi>evils</hi> they suffered.</p>
               <p>A disposition to behold, with a lingering
and an envious eye, the <hi>good things</hi> which their
oppressors enjoyed, and themselves wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32156:12"/>
Hence the composure of it is such as might
be most agreeable to these suppositions, and
serviceable to the fortifying of the Righteous
against the <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> which such a state
of things might prove the occasion of unto
them.</p>
               <p>This Verse hath a more direct aspect on
the last of these cases, or on this last mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thing considerable in the case, of Upright
men suffering under the oppression of violent
and prosperous wickedness, <hi>viz.</hi> That they
might hereupon be apt both to <hi>covet</hi> and <hi>envy</hi>
the <hi>worldly delights</hi> of their enemies; To be
desirous of their dainties, and grudg they
should be <hi>theirs,</hi> who, they knew, deserved
worse things: And while themselves also felt
the pressure of worse, which at their hands
they deserved not.</p>
               <p>What is here offered to the consideration
of the sufferers, tends aptly to allay their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
to check and repress their inordinate
desire towards inferior things; or to divert
and turn it another way; as in case of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to excess and danger, the way is to open
a Vein, and stop the course of that profusion
by altering it.</p>
               <p>As if it had been said, <q>You have no such
cause to look with displeasure or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
desire upon their delicacies; You may
have better, Better belong to you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
you, The Lord himself is your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
It becomes both your state and spirit,
to apply your selves to an holy delight in
him; To let your Souls loose, and set them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32156:12"/>
at liberty, to satiate themselves, and feed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fulness upon those undefiled and satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleasures unto which you have a right;
and in which you will find the loss and want
of <hi>their</hi> meaner enjoyments abundantly made
up unto you. You have your natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and cravings as well as other men; and
those may be too apt to exceed their just
bounds and measures; But if you take this
course, they will soon become sober and
moderate, such as will be satisfied with what
is competent, with an indifferent allowance
of the good things of this earth. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lord, let them be as vast and
large as can be supposed, they can never be
larger than the Rule will allow; nor than
the object will satisfie. The direction and
obligation of the former being indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the immense and boundless ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the latter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We need not operously inquire what sort
of persons this direction is given unto. It is
plain, that it's the common duty of all <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God.</hi> But it cannot be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
duty of all. Men that know not God,
and are enemies to him, have somewhat else
to do first. They to whom the Precept is
directly meant, are the regenerate (the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
and the <hi>upright,</hi> as the Psalm it self doth
plainly design them) or <hi>his own people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most profitable way of considering
these words, will be chiefly to insist on the
<hi>direction</hi> given in the former part of the Verse.
And then to shew towards the close, how the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32156:13"/>
event promised in the latter part, will not
only by virtue of the Promise, but even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow thereupon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Direction in the former part, gives us</hi>
a plain signification of Gods good pleasure, that
he himself would be the great object of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
delight. <hi>Or,</hi> it is his will, that they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
delight themselves in him.</p>
               <p>Our discourse upon this Subject will fall
naturally into two parts:</p>
               <p>The

                     <item>Former</item>
                     <item>Latter</item>

                  </list>of the enjoined Delighting in God.</p>
               <p>(Under which latter, what will be said of
the latter part of the Verse will fitly fall in).</p>
               <p>That we may more distinctly open the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and meaning of <hi>Delighting in God;</hi> It will
be necessary that we treat,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the Delectable Object.</item>
                     <item>2. Of the Delight to be taken therein.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As to the former, The general object of
Delight is <hi>some good,</hi> or somewhat so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of; with the addition of being <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
some way present. Here</hi> it is the
<hi>cheif and best good.</hi> The highest and most
perfect excellency. Which goodness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
considered as residing in God, gives
us a twofold notion or view of the object,
whereupon this delight may have it's exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:32156:13"/>
                  <item>Absolute.</item>
                  <item>Relative.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. God may be lookt upon in an <hi>absolute
consideration,</hi> as he is in himself the <hi>best and
most excellent Being;</hi> wherein we behold the
concurrence of all perfections; The most
amiable and beauteous excellencies, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
eye, that it can have any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In a Relative, viz.</hi> As his Goodness
and Excellency are considered, not meerly as
they are in himself, but also as having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
an aspect on his creatures. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
him as in himself the <hi>most excellent
Being;</hi> If here we give our thoughts liberty
of exercising themselves, we shall soon find,
that hereupon he must be considered also as
<hi>the first Being,</hi> the Original and Author of
all other Beings; Otherwise he were not the
most excellent.</p>
               <p>From whence we will see, <hi>Relation</hi> doth
arise between him and his creatures that have
there Being from him.</p>
               <p>And besides the <hi>general relations</hi> which he
beareth to them all, as the common Maker,
Sustainer, and Disposer of them; Observing
that there are some which by their <hi>reasonable
natures,</hi> are capable of <hi>Government by him</hi> (in
the proper sense, <hi>viz.</hi> by a Law) and of <hi>blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these we consider him as standing in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32156:14"/>
a twofold reference, in both which we are
to eye and act towards him, <hi>viz.</hi> As a
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Lord,</hi> to be obey'd.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Portion,</hi> to be enjoy'd.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And have most delectable excellencies to
take notice of in him (that require we should
sutably comport with them), answerable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
to each of these considerations, in
respect whereof we are to look upon him;</p>
               <p>1. As the <hi>most excellent Lord;</hi> most delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
excellent (we take not here that title so
strictly, as to intend by it meer <hi>propriety</hi> or
<hi>dominion;</hi> But as to ordinary apprehension it
is more commonly understood to signify also
<hi>governing Power,</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> founded in the
other) whom we cannot but esteem worthy
of all possible honour and Glory; that every
knee bow to him, and every tongue confess
to him, that universal homage, subjection
and adoration be given him for ever.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>As the most excellent Portion,</hi> in whom
all things that may render him such do concur
and meet together; all desirable and imaginable
riches and fulness, together with large boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
flowing goodness every way correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the wants and cravings of indigent
and thirsty Souls.</p>
               <p>The <hi>former notion</hi> of him intimates to us our
obligation of duty to him: The <hi>latter</hi> prompts
to an expectation of benefit from him.</p>
               <p>But now because by the apostacy we have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32156:14"/>
                  <hi>injur'd</hi> his right in us, <hi>as our Lord; forfeited</hi>
our own right in him, as <hi>our portion;</hi> and lost
our <hi>immediate capacity</hi> or disposition both
to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>injoy</hi> him: This great breach
between him and us was not otherwise
to be made up but by a Mediator. Unto
which office and undertaking, his own Son,
incarnate, the Word made Flesh (being only
fit) was designed. By him, dealing between
both the distanced Parties, satisfying the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God, overcoming the enmity of man,
the difference (so far as the efficacy of his
Mediation doth extend) is composed. And
<hi>to the reconciled,</hi> God becomes again their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
both Lord and Portion. His right
is vindicated, theirs is restored; and both are
established upon new grounds, added to those
upon which they stood before. And so, as that
now our actings towards God, and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from him, must be through the Mediator.</p>
               <p>Whereupon this object of our delight, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
relatively unto us,</hi> is intirely <hi>God in
Christ,—Being reconciled,—We joy in God
through our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10 11.</note> 
                  <hi>by whom &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these several ways that have been thus
briefly mentioned, may God come under our
consideration. Nor are they, any of them, unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
or impertinent to our purpose, when
we would design him the object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
Yea, and surely God considered each of
these ways ought to be lookt on by us, as a most
<hi>delectable object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is pleasant to contemplate him, even
<hi>most absolutely considered,</hi> as the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32156:15"/>
Being, when we behold his glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
in themselves; that is (not with the
denial, but) without the actual present consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of any advantage that may redound
to us from them. As we are apt to find our
selves pleased and gratifi'd in viewing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
object (suppose a stately Edifice, or
beautiful Flower), from which we expect no
other benefit.</p>
               <p>Again, If we consider him <hi>relatively,</hi> 1. In
the former capacity <hi>of a Lord,</hi> it is grateful
<hi>to behold him</hi> deckt with Majesty, array'd in
Glory, cloth'd with Righteosness, arm'd with
Power, shining in Holiness, and guiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with Wisdom and Counsel in all his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.
Yea, and it is delightful to <hi>obey
him;</hi> while we are most fully satisfy'd of his
unexceptionable right to <hi>command us.</hi> For
there is a great pleasure naturally arising to
a well-tempered spirit, from the apprehended
congruity or <hi>fitness of things,</hi> as that <hi>he</hi> should
<hi>command</hi> and that <hi>we</hi> should <hi>obey.</hi> His <hi>right,</hi>
and our <hi>obligation,</hi> being so undoubtedly clear
and great. Especially when we also consider
<hi>what he commands,</hi> and find it is no hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
that they are not grievous commands
which he requires we be subject to; but such,
in the keeping whereof <hi>there is great reward;</hi>
And that <hi>his ways are all pleasantness and peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being considered as a <hi>Portion,</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is plain, That so rich and abounding ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
where also there is so communicative
an inclination, cannot but recommend him
a most satisfying object of delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32156:15"/>
And thus we are more principally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
him, <hi>viz.</hi> rather <hi>relatively</hi> than <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
and that relatedness (which the state of
the case requires) as now anew setled in
Christ. And <hi>so,</hi> though it be very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to look upon him, <hi>as one that may, and
is ready to become related to us,</hi> (as he is to
any that will consent and agree with him
upon the Mediators terms): Yet it adds
unspeakably to the pleasantness of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
when we can reflect upon such chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
in our selves, as from whence we may
regularly conclude, that he is actually thus
related <hi>unto us.</hi> That is, that we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
That our relation to him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arises from the <hi>Covenant of life and peace;</hi>
That he hath entered into Covenant with
us, and so we are become his.</p>
               <p>It is pleasant thus to behold and serve him
as <hi>[our] Lord.</hi> How great is the empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of these words, <hi>I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledg of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
[my Lord!].</hi> To consider not only how
well he deserves the acknowledgments and
subjection of all; But also to find our selves
under the chosen and gentle bonds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
service, and devotedness to him, is
c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtainly matter of very high delight and
pleasure.</p>
               <p>But how infinitely delightful is it, to view
and enjoy him <hi>as [our] Portion!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this seems very pertinent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this Scripture; which aiming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and draw in the hearts of godly Persons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32156:16"/>
from too earnest, and from envious lingerings
after the enjoyments of worldly men (their
enemies and oppressors), propounds what
may be an over-ballance to the (imagined)
felicity of their state; And wherein they
should more than equal them <hi>in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And should we single out this, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be considered, <hi>God as a portion.</hi> That
it might be more distinctly represented, we
should have two things to take notice of, that
would render it most delectable, and such as
wherein holy hearts may acquiesce, and rest
with fullest satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The
<list>
                     <item>Sufficiency</item>
                     <item>Communicableness</item>
                  </list>
of it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Sufficiency of it.</hi> Which cannot but
be every way compleat and full; it being the
<hi>all-comprehensive good,</hi> which is this portion.
<hi>God all-Sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most eminent and known Attributes
of his Being; wherein by any issues of them
they can be communicated, having an ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
and concurrence to the happiness of his
people therein.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Communicableness thereof.</hi> Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from his bounty, more peculiarly, and
his gracious inclination to do good, and
make his boundless fulness overflow to the
replenishing of thirsty longing Souls, whom
first it had allured and caused so to long. But
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32156:16"/>
though the scope and order of the discourse
in this Psalm, did not directly seem to import
more than a design of calling off the persons
here spoken to, from one sort of enjoyment
to another, from a meaner and more empty
to a better: Yet it is to be considered, that <hi>true</hi>
(and the <hi>best) injoyment,</hi> cannot be unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with duty; and that God is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be injoyed, than as he is obeyed, nor
indeed are the notions of him, as a <hi>Lord to be
obeyed,</hi> and as <hi>a good to be injoyed,</hi> intirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;
but are interwoven, and do run into
one another. We obey him, even in injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; It being part of our injoyned duty,
to set our hearts upon him, as our best and
highest good. And we injoy him in obeying
him. The advantage and benefit of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
being a real and most momentous
part of that good which we injoy from him,
and in him. He is our <hi>Benefactor</hi> even as he
is our <hi>Ruler;</hi> and is therein our Ruler, as he
proposes to us benefits, which he thereby
binds us to accept; for even his <hi>invitations</hi>
and <hi>offers,</hi> are also <hi>laws</hi> and formal <hi>bonds</hi> of
<hi>duty</hi> upon us.</p>
               <p>Yea, and even the <hi>act of delight it self</hi>
pitcht upon him, is an <hi>act of homage,</hi> as there
will be occasion hereafter to take notice.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it will be fit to steer a larger
course, than meerly to consider him as a
good commensurate to our <hi>partial appetites.</hi>
Which are apt to prescribe to, and limit our
apprehensions to this or that particular sort
of good, and tincture them with such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32156:17"/>
of delight, as which, if it be not false
and grosly carnal, may yet be much too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and unproportionable to the universal,
all-comprehending good: And though we
shall not here go beyond the compass of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
good; yet as there is no good (tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called) which is not in, or from the
<hi>first goodness;</hi> So indeed, nor is there any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being gathered up into that sum
which is not <hi>delectable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor therefore <hi>can the usual distribution</hi> of
<hi>goodness</hi> into <hi>profitable, honest,</hi> and <hi>pleasant,</hi>
bear a strict test. Only the false relishes of
vitiated appetite in this corrupted <hi>state</hi> of
man, have given ground for it. Otherwise to
a mind and will that is not distempered, the
account would be much otherwise. To a
<hi>prudent mind,</hi> profitable good would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
even as it's profitable. To a <hi>just and
generous mind,</hi> honest comely good would
be pleasant, even as it is honest. Nor would
there need another distinction, but into the
<hi>goodness of the end,</hi> which is <hi>pleasant for it
self,</hi> and the goodness of the means, which
is pleasant as it is <hi>honestly and decently profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
(and otherwise it cannot be) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>That we may here therefore with the
more advantage state the <hi>delectable good,</hi> we
are now to consider, It will be requisite to
promise two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That all delightful injoyment of God, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
some communication from him.</hi> Nothing
can delight us, or be injoy'd by us; whereof
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32156:17"/>
we do not, some way, or by some faculty or
other, <hi>partake somewhat.</hi> Either by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
sense, sensitive appetite, phansie, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
mind, will; and either in an higher, or
lower degree, for a longer or a shorter time,
according as the delight is, for kind, degree,
or continuance which is taken therein. This
is plain in it self. And in the present case
therefore of delighting in God or enjoying
him, some <hi>communication,</hi> or participation
there must be one way or other according as
the injoyment of him is. And as the case
with man now is, it is necessary he do with
clearest and the most penetrative light and
power, come in upon his mind and heart,
scatter darkness, remove prejudice, abolish
former relishes, transfuse his own sweet savor
through the Soul. Proportionably therefore,
to what is to be done, he communicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as the event constantly shews, with all
them that are ever brought to any real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him.</p>
               <p>For we plainly see, that the <hi>same divine
communication which</hi> being received, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and satisfy, doth also procure, that it
may be desired and received; makes its own
way, attempers and frames the Soul to it self;
and gives it the sweet relish and savor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>wherein God is actually injoyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That however <hi>God himself,</hi> is truly said
to be injoyed or delighted in by holy Souls;
yet <hi>this communication</hi> is also a sort of <hi>mediate
object</hi> of this delight or injoyment. These
things being fore-laid, It is now needful to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32156:18"/>
to inquire somewhat more distinctly, what
that <hi>communication</hi> or <hi>communicable good is,</hi>
which is the <hi>immediate matter</hi> of proper spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
injoyment unto holy men in this world.
Because many have that phrase of Speech
<hi>[injoying God]</hi> often in their mouths, that
well understand not what they mean by it;
Yea even divers of them that <hi>have real injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him;</hi> Unto whom, though they possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>taste</hi> the thing which they cannot <hi>express</hi>
or <hi>form</hi> distinct conceptions of; it might
be somewhat their advantage to have it more
cleared up to their apprehension, <hi>what</hi> it is
that they immediately injoy, when they are
said to injoy God; or by what <hi>he</hi> is to be
injoyed?</p>
               <p>It is not a meer fancy (as too many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely
think, and are too apt to speak) that
is the <hi>thing to be injoyed.</hi> There have been
those, who, comparing their own experience
with Gods promises, and precepts (the rule
by which he imports and according where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men are to expect his gracious influence)
were capable of avowing it, rationally, to
be some very substantial thing they have had
the injoyment of. The sobriety of their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the regularity of their workings, their
gracious composure, the meekness, humility,
denial of self, the sensible refreshing, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
strength and vigour which hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
such enjoyments, sufficiently proving
to them that they did not hug an empty cloud,
or embrace a shadow, under the name of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
God. Such expressions as we find in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32156:18"/>
the book of <hi>Psalms</hi> (the 16. and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
with sundry parts of Scripture besides,
leave us not without Instance: That import
nothing like flashy and flaunting bombast, no
appearance of affectation, no pompous shew
of vain-glory, no semblance of swelling words
of vanity, but which discover a most equal
orderly well-poys'd temper of mind, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the highest delight and well-pleasedness
in God. That rich and unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
fulness of living sence, could not but be
from the apprehension of <hi>a real somewhat,</hi> and
that, of <hi>a most excellent nature and kind,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
be the <hi>notion,</hi> that may be most fitly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
put upon it.</p>
               <p>Nor yet is it the <hi>meer essence of God</hi> which
men can be said to <hi>enjoy.</hi> For that is not
communicated nor communicable. <hi>Injoyment</hi>
supposes <hi>possession.</hi> But it would be a strange
Language to say we possess the Essence of
God otherwise than <hi>relatively;</hi> which is not
enough unto actual enjoyment. His meer
<hi>essential presence</hi> is not enough. That renders
him not injoy'd by any, for that is equally
with all and every where; But all cannot be
said to enjoy him.</p>
               <p>As therefore it is a <hi>real,</hi> so there must be
some <hi>special</hi> communication, by which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received, we are truly said to injoy him.</p>
               <p>A <hi>special good</hi> it must be, not such as is
common to all. For there is a communication
from him that is of that extent, in as much as
all live and move and have there Beings in
him and the whole earth is full of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32156:19"/>
This is <hi>a Good</hi> peculiar to them that are
<hi>born of God.</hi> And suted to the apprehension
and sense of that <hi>divine Creature</hi> which is so
born.</p>
               <p>What this <hi>Good</hi> is, how fully sufficient it
is, and how or which way it is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
may be the better understood when we
have considered what are the <hi>wants and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi>
of <hi>this Creature,</hi> or of them in whom it
is formed and wrought. For when we have
pitch'd upon the very thing it self, <hi>which they
most desire,</hi> (and which they can tell <hi>is it,</hi>
when they hear it named, though their
thoughts are not so well formed about it as
to give it the right Name before) we shall then
understand it to be both what will be <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to Satisfie,</hi> and what <hi>may be communicated</hi>
to that purpose.</p>
               <p>But now before that <hi>new birth</hi> take place
in the spirit of man, it <hi>wants</hi> but knows not
what; craves indeterminately <hi>(who will shew
us any good?)</hi> not fixing upon any particular
one that is sufficient and <hi>finite,</hi> and laboring
at once, under an ignorance of the <hi>infinite;</hi>
together with a disaffection thereunto. Its
wants and cravings are beyond the measure,
of all <hi>finite good;</hi> for suppose it to have never
so large a share, nay could it grasp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
the whole of it, an unsatisfiedness and
desire of more would still remain. But <hi>that
more</hi> is somewhat indeterminate, and meerly
imaginary. An infinite nothing. An idol of
fancy. A God of its own making. God it
must have, but what a one he is it misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32156:19"/>
and wherein it rightly apprehends him
likes and loves him not; will by no means
choose, desire, or take complacency in him.
So that an unregenerate soul is, while it is
such, necessarily doom'd to be miserable.
It <hi>cannot</hi> be happy in any <hi>inferior good,</hi> and
in the <hi>Supream,</hi> it <hi>will not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the <hi>real wants and just cravings</hi> of
a mans spirit therefore are, is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by considering it in that state.</p>
               <p>And if the work of the <hi>new creature</hi> were
perfected in it, it would want and crave no
more; But were satisfy'd fully and at perfect
rest. Nor is that state so known to us as
yet.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>they</hi> are best to be discerned in
the state wherein that worke is <hi>begun</hi> and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<hi>unfinished.</hi> In which it therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
rightly, and still continues to desire. A
state of intermingled motion and rest; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>delight</hi> is imperfect, and allay'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
mixture of yet-unsatisfy'd desire.
And yet it may be collected <hi>what</hi> it is that
would be <hi>Sufficient</hi> to satisfy; because their
desire is still determined to <hi>one thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> is not
vagrant, wanders not after things of another
kind, but is intent only upon more of the
same.</p>
               <p>Now let it be enquired of such a one what
that thing is. We are generally told there,
* <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will
I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord all the dayes of my life to behold the beauty
of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And it may be many would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32156:20"/>
more shortly tell you it is <hi>God</hi> they desire,
whence it would only be concluded it is God
they aim to enjoy or delight in. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this brings us but where we were; Let
it be further enquired, what then is your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
with God, or what would you have of
him? It is not, sure, to <hi>be God</hi> that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or seek, or to enjoy God in that sence
wherein he possesses and enjoys himself. No,
not by any means. It is then <hi>some communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from God, diverse from what all men have</hi>
(for <hi>that</hi> they do not find <hi>apt</hi> to satisfy)
which they desire and crave. And what is
that? Tis somewhat, as <hi>possible to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,</hi>
and as <hi>distinguishable</hi> both from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable
Being, and his so generally
communicated Bounty towards all. As if the
enquiry were, <hi>What it is that I desire really to
enjoy when I desire to enjoy a friend? (viz.</hi>
as the notion of <hi>a friend</hi> or <hi>friendship</hi> doth
most properly import). That is neither to
desire the <hi>impossible thing,</hi> of possessing his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as my own; Nor the <hi>unsatisfying thing,</hi>
the meer partaking some part of his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
goods and wealth; whereof it may be he
daily imparts somewhat to every beggar at
at his door. But it is to have his <hi>intimate
acquaintance,</hi> his counsel and advice, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of improving my self by his converse,
and of conforming my self to his example in
his imitable perfections; The assurances of his
faithful constant love and friendship, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to all future emergencies. A friend is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be enjoyed in such things as these.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:32156:20"/>
And in <hi>such-like</hi> is God to be enjoyed also;
But with this difference, that Gods communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are more immediate, more constant,
more powerful and efficacious, more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
infinitely and satisfying, in respect both
of the good communicated, and the way of
communication.</p>
               <p>In short then, the wants and desires of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
soul, the supply and satisfaction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it seeks from God, would be summ'd up
in these things.</p>
               <p>That it may know him more fully, Or have
clearer apprehensions of him.</p>
               <p>That it may become like to him, and framed
more perfectly after his own holy image.</p>
               <p>That it may be ascertain'd of his love and
good will, that he hath those favorable inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
towards it, which shall certainly infer his
doing all that for it which its real necessities <hi>(to
be estimated by his infinite Wisdom)</hi> can
call for.</p>
               <p>These are the things, <hi>in kind,</hi> which
would satisfy it. And answerably to these
we may conceive the <hi>communicable good</hi>
which is the immediate object of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So that, as God himself is the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which</hi> is enjoyed; This is the <hi>object by
which,</hi> or in respect whereof he is injoyable.</p>
               <p>Therefore the divine communication, or
that which is communicated from God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
souls wherein they are to delight
themselves, contains in it,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>An inwardly enlightening revelation of</hi>

than this, or with none so much as this. To
which purpose, he elsewhere professes to
<hi>count all things loss for the excellency of this
knowledg.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> So vehemently did desire work
this way. And proportionably as it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
desirable, must it be esteemed delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32156:21"/>
also. Nor are we here to think that
this desired knowledg was intended finally
to terminate in the Mediator, for that the very
notion of Mediator resists. The name <hi>Christ</hi>
is the proper name of that office, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of knowing him under that name imports
a desire to know him <hi>in his office.</hi> viz. as one
that is to lead us to God, and restore our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, which was not to be
recovered upon other terms. So that it is
<hi>ultimately</hi> the <hi>knowledg of God</hi> that is the
so much desired thing, and of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the
way and our conductor to God. That is,
the knowledg of God not <hi>absolutely</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
alone, (though he is, even so, a very
delectable object (as hath been said); But
as he is <hi>related to us,</hi> and from whom we have
great expectations, <hi>our all</hi> being comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in him. It cannot but be very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
(answerably to a certain sort of delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which we shall have occasion to speak
in its proper place) to have him <hi>before our
eyes</hi> represented and revealed to us, <hi>as the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehending
good,</hi> and that (in the way and
method whereinto things are now cast) <hi>may,</hi>
at least, become our portion. He is some way,
to be enjoyed even in this <hi>view.</hi> 'Tis a thing
apt to infer complacency and delight thus to
look upon him. They who place felicity in
contemplation, especially in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, are not besides the mark; If
they do not circumscribe and confine it there,
so as to make it stand in <hi>meer eontemplation,</hi>
or in an idle, and vainly curious view of so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32156:22"/>
glorious an object, without any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
about it. They will <hi>then</hi> be found to
speak very agreeably to the language of holy
scripture which so frequently expresses the
blessedness of the other state by <hi>seeing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the act of vision be delicious, The
representation of the object must have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
matter of delight in it. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but have so, if we consider the nature of
this representation;</p>
               <p>Which, answerably to the sensible want and
desire of such as shall be delighted there-with,
must have somewhat more in it than the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
appearances</hi> of God which offer themselves
equally to the view of all men. Though it
is their own <hi>as common fault,</hi> that they are
destitute of the more grateful and necessary
additions.</p>
               <p>That it hath <hi>more</hi> in it, is evident from
Gods own way of speaking of it. For we
find that his <hi>revealing himself</hi> in this delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Is attributed to the spirit.</hi>

by the spirit of promise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that the God of our Lord

By which prayer it is supposed a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable

way <hi>a right</hi> to the communication of it, or
that it was a thing proper to their state, fit
to be prayed for, as some way belonging to
them, they being in a more immediate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of such revelation than others.</p>
               <p>But how incongruous had it been with
such solemnity of address to make request
on their behalf for that which they already
<hi>sufficiently</hi> had as a thing common to all men.</p>
               <p>2. It is spoken of as a reward of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
love,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 21</note> loyalty, and obedience. <hi>He that
hath my commandments and keepeth them, he
it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall
be loved of my father, and I will love him, and
will manifest my self to him.</hi> Therefore is
such manifestation no more to be accounted
common, than the love of Christ is and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his commandments.</p>
               <p>It is spoken of as given discriminatingly,
and the grace of God admired upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
In the next words,<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Judas saith unto
him,</hi> (not <hi>Iscariot,</hi> it being well understood

for such manifestations) <hi>Lord how is it, that
thou wilt manifest thy self to us, and not to the
world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What it hath more than common light,
external or internal, answerable to the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resented wants, and the hearts desires of
the regenerate, by which it becomes so highly
pleasant and delectable to them, though it
is rather to be felt than told (as it is hard
to describe the <hi>very things</hi> we have only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
sensible perception of) may yet in
some degree be understood by such charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as these.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It is much more distinct and clear.</hi> They
<hi>are confused and dark glimmerings</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men have of the blessed God, so that
<hi>the light which is in them is darkness.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 'Tis
true that an unregenerate person may possibly
have clearer <hi>acquired</hi> notions of God, and
of the things of God, than those may be <hi>which

So that he may, by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
he may have above some of the other,
in respect of better natural abilities, more

be capable of finding out more, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fuller discoveries, and more evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
and be able to discourse thence,
more rationally and satisfyingly to others,
even concerning God, his nature, attributes

do. But <hi>these</hi> though their candle give a

the others candle. And though they
know not so many things, nor discern the
connexions of things so throughly; yet as
they do know what is most necessary to be
known, so what they do know, they know
better, and with a more excellent sort of
knowledg; proportionably as whatsoever is
originally, and immediately divine, cannot
but much excel that which is meerly human.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those</hi> do but blunder in the dark, <hi>These,

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 26.</note> And his light
puts a brighter hue and aspect upon the same
things, than any other representation can
put upon them. Things are by it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the life, which to others carry with

and are all covered over with nothing else
but dark and dusky shadow, so as that may

to babes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> How bright and glorious
things, are divine wisdom, love, holiness,
to an enlightened mind! which is therefore
supposed to have a clearer discovery of them.</p>
               <p>But it may be said; Is there any thing
apprehensible concerning these or any other
matters which may not be expressed in some
proposition or other. And what proposition is
there which a regenerate person can assent to,
but one who is not regenerate may assent to
it also? what definition, so truly expressive of
the natures of these things, can be thought,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32156:24"/>
of unto which a carnal mind may not give
its approbation? what can be said or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
so fully aud truly tending to describe
and <hi>clear</hi> them up but an unrenewed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
may have the representation of the
fame truth, so as to give entertainment to it?</p>
               <p>'Tis answered there are many things, to
which <hi>somewhat may belong</hi> not capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and whereof we have yet a most
certain perception. As the different relishes
of the things we taste. There are no words
that will express those many peculiarities.
And as to the present matter; There is
somewhat belonging to the things of God
(those for instance that were mentioned, his
wisdom, holiness &amp;c.) besides the Truth of
the conceptions that may be formed about
them; which is more clearly apprehensible to
<hi>a divinely enlightened</hi> understanding than to
one that is not so. As,</p>
               <p>1. The beauty of those Truths; <hi>which it
is most delightful to behold, Their lively
sparkling lustre, by which they appear so
amiable and lovely, to a well-tempered spirit;
as to transport it with pleasure and ravish
it from it self into union with them. There
was somewhat else apprehensible no doubt,
and apprehended by them, the inward
sentiments of whose souls those words so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively
served to express,</hi> Who is like unto
thee, O Lord, among the Gods, who is like thee,
glorious in holiness! &amp;c. <hi>besides</hi> the meer truth
<hi>of any propositions that those words can be
resolved into. And so in those,</hi> O the depth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32156:24"/>
of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledg
of God! <hi>&amp;c. And those,</hi> God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that, <hi>&amp;c.
Or those,</hi> This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, That Jesus Christ came into
the world to save sinners, whereof I am chief.
<hi>Or the strains of that rapturous prayer,</hi>—That
he would grant you according to the riches of
his glory, to be strengthned with might by his
Spirit in the inner man. That Christ may dwell
in your hearts by faith; that ye being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height: And to know the love of
Christ, that passeth knowledg, that ye might be
filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
               <p>There is a certain acceptableness in some
Truths (necessary to their being received in
the love thereof), which is peculiarly so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to some, as that their apprehension
is clear and vivid, beyond that of other men;
who, however they have the representation
of the <hi>same things,</hi> yet have not the <hi>same repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation;</hi>
Though, if they be things of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and common concernment, it is (as was
said) their own fault that they have it not.
And to have yet clearer apprehensions of this
sort, is what the renewed Soul doth most
earnestly crave, and would be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
delighted with.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The tendency of such Truths,</hi> is much
more clearly conceivable to an holy Soul,
than another; what their scope and aim or
aspect is, which way they look, and what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32156:25"/>
they drive at, or lead to. I mean not what other
<hi>truth</hi> they are connected with, and would
aptly tend to infer; But what design God
hath upon us in revealing them, and what
impression they ought to make upon us. To
the ignorance or disregard of which tendency
and design of Gods revelation, it is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
that many have long the same no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things hovering in their minds,
without ever reflecting with any displeasure
upon the so vastly unsutable temper of their
spirits thereto. They know it may be such
things concerning God, the tendency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is to draw their hearts into union with
him, to transform them into his likeness, to
inflame them with his love. But they still
remain notwithstanding at the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
most unsutable, averse, coldly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards him, yea utterly opposite and
disaffected; and fall not out with themselves
upon this account, have no quarrel nor dislike,
take not any distaste at themselves for it. They
take no notice of an incongruity and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the ill temper of their own spirits; but
seem as if they thought all were very well
with them, nothing amiss; and apprehend
not a repugnancy in their habitual dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards God to their notions of him.</p>
               <p>For a vicious prejudice blinds their eyes,
their corrupt inclinations and rotten hearts
send up a malignant dark and clammy fog
and vapour, and cast so black a cloud upon
these bright things, that their tendency and
design is not perceived. That prejudice not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32156:25"/>
being conceived so much against the <hi>abstract
notions</hi> of the things themselves, (whence
<hi>they</hi> are entertained with less reluctancy) but
only against the design and scope of them.
Against which poysonous cloud Gods own
glorious revelation directs its beams, dissolves
its gross consistency, scatters its darkness, as
to them to whom he by special grace affords
it. Whereupon, observing any remainders
of the same distemper in their spirits (though
it be in a considerable degree abated and
lessened) they are ashamed of themselves for
it, fill'd with confusion, yea and indignation;
do loath and abhor, and could even be ready,
if it were possible, to run away from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And what is the reason of this so
great difference? Surely somewhat appears
discernible to these in Gods revelation of
himself, which to the other doth not. They
have then before their eyes a more clear pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the aim and scope of it. Which, so
far as they have it, pleases them (for they
like the design well), only they are displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at themselves, that they comport no more
with it. And as the end therefore aimed
at is desirable to them, and would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
(as will be shewn in its proper
place), so is it to have that representation
immediately offered to the view of their
Souls, which hath so apt and comely an
aspect thereon, not meerly for its own sake,
but for the sake of the end it self.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there is somewhat to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Gods representation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32156:26"/>
to the minds of this regenerate people, at
least <hi>more clearly</hi> than by other men. Whence
the work of regenerating or converting them
it self,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> is expressed <hi>by opening their eyes.</hi> For the
divine communication makes its own way, and
enters at the eye, the Souls <hi>seeing faculty,</hi> which
it doth find (as opening the eyes imports) and
not <hi>now create:</hi> But finding it vitiated, and as
to any right seeing of God, shut and closed up,
it heals, opens, and restores it as it enters. It is
expressed, <hi>By turning them from darkness,</hi> to
light; <hi>And from the power of Satan,</hi> (the Prince
of that Darkness, the God of this World;
who had blinded their eyes—) <hi>unto God.</hi>
Which (because they cannot turn and move
towards God blindfold, and that this open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their eyes is in order to their turning to
God) implies, that their eyes were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered,
blinded, and sealed up, <hi>cheifly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him;</hi> So that, though they could see
other things, <hi>him</hi> they could not see; but he
was <hi>invisible</hi> to their <hi>intellectual,</hi> as well as
their bodily eyes. Hence also is that <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
said <hi>to be given (i.e.</hi> as rectify'd and
renewed) by which we <hi>know God;</hi> which
implies it to be (wherein it is now given)
somewhat superadded to the whole natural
being and powers of the human Soul, as in
its present corrupted state,—<hi>He hath given
us an understanding to know him that is true.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 20.</note>
And that <hi>given rectitude</hi> of understanding is
is by such a communication from God, as
hath that <hi>aptitude</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in it to infer so
happy a change. The same renewing-work
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32156:26"/>
is also said to be <hi>a calling of men out of darkness
into his marvelouslight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> As if they were brought
by it into a new world, wherein they found
themselves beset with wonders, and all things
were surprising to them. To which purpose
is that prayer of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> (out of a just
consciousness, that this work was not perfect
in him, but might yet admit great additional
degrees),<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
wondrous things out of thy law.</hi> He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
many undiscovered wonders, which
<hi>more open eyes</hi> might yet behold in that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
revelation of Gods mind, which was then
afforded (and which was wont in those days to
go under the name of <hi>his Law,</hi> though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Histories, Prophecies, and Promises, as
well as Precepts) although he was no stranger
to those records, nor little insighted into them,
he yet apprehended a need of more light and
better eyes; which he therefore desires. Not
that God would cause a new revelation to be
written, (though that he vouchsafed to do, and
partly by himself, but that he might learn more
out of that already extant; and that the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things <hi>contained in it</hi> might be made
more clear to him. Nor can we suppose him,
herein, to desire to be gratified and delighted by
the communication of an incommunicable thing.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is more powerfully assuring,</hi> and such as is
apt to beget <hi>a more certain operative belief</hi> of
the things revealed. That is, being added
to the means of Faith men may be supposed
to have had before, it adds much to their <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the same things, so as to make it effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32156:27"/>
upon their spirits. And as well cures
the doubtfulness, irresolution, and way-ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their minds and hearts, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and darkness of them.</p>
               <p>It is very possible those things may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
understood, which the more we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
the more we disbeleive them through
their apprehended inconsistency with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or some certain truth. The delectable
things of God, his own discovery procures
at once, by one and the same radiation of
light, both to be <hi>clearly understood,</hi> and <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believed.</hi> Others have the <hi>word of faith</hi>
without the <hi>spirit of faith.</hi> The faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which they have is a carcase; Not <hi>a weak</hi>
only (which imports but diminished power)
but <hi>a dead thing.</hi> And which hath no power
at all to determine the soul and compose it to
that delightful rest which such things, duly
believed, would certainly infer. The most
delectable truths of God and such as most
directly tend (in this apostate lapsed state of
man) to give us the sweet and refreshing
relishes of a just and rational joy and pleasure,
are such as are contained in the Gospel of
Christ. The things that concern our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
friendship and communion with
God in him. And which are therefore wholly
of immediately divine and supernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and to be received by faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>one</hi> Apostle prayes for some they might
be filled with <hi>joy and peace [in believing].</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 3.</note>
And <hi>another</hi> says of others <hi>that [believing]
they rejoyced with joy unspeakable and full of<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:32156:27"/>
glory.</hi> The external Revelation in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is <hi>an apt means,</hi> to beget that Faith (which
it is said <hi>comes by hearing):</hi> But the very notion
of <hi>means</hi> importing what intervenes to the
effect, between <hi>that</hi> and the Principal Agent,
necessarily supposes such an Agent. And that
what is <hi>only means,</hi> cannot work the effect
alone. That Agent, <hi>viz.</hi> (in this case) <hi>God
himself,</hi> or the Spirit, besides the means which
he uses, and makes effectual, must have <hi>his
own influence</hi> whereby he makes them so. If
a pen be a fit means or instrument to write
with, it doth not therefore follow, that it can
write alone, without an hand to move and
guide it, in order whereto a motive and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
influence is imparted. In the present
case, The influence is <hi>the inward enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overpow'ring communication,</hi> whereof we
speak. The efficacy whereof is such, as to
give the Soul that peaceful rest <hi>in believing,</hi>
which is also most <hi>pleasant and delightful,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the things are found to be so,
which are believed. Nor doth it in order
hereto work by way of Enthusiastical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
without any reference to the external
Revelation, that is, rationally and aptly sutable
to the working of the effect. For then, that
should no way have the place <hi>so much as of
means.</hi> But there being sufficient inducement
to perswade that this external Revelation is
divine (so as to procure a rational assent
to the things revealed, with any man, that,
having that revelation, with the account of
its first confirmations, shall but use his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32156:28"/>
in reference thereto, and is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted
to a party of sworn enemies to the
Christian name). This inward revelation then
falling in, captivates his heart to an entire
unitive closure, with the great things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the outward one; and principally
with the Son of God himself, <hi>unto which
union,</hi> that whole revelation is most directly
subservient. Therefore it was, that when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

to overcome the <hi>contrary corrupt inclinations

revelation uses not to do its work without
the outward, (for I suppose we have not
heard of many Christians where the Gospel
hath not been), so nor is the outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
able, alone to beget that which, in the
more eminent sence, goes in Scripture under
the name of <hi>Faith.</hi> It may beget that meerly
<hi>intellectual certainty</hi> which may prevail against
all doubts and objections in a mans mind to
the contrary; but not the contrary incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of his corrupt will. Most mens faith
is but opinionative, and many mens never
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32156:28"/>
reaches so high as to a rational opinion; <hi>that</hi>
proceeds upon having ballanced considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on both sides, and inclines to that part on
which seems to be the most weighty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Faith (as they call it) of too many
is no other thing than a meerly blind and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious
humor, grounded upon nothing but
a willingness to be in the fashion; or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of disgrace with other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
if where that is the common profession
one should profess to be any thing but a
Christian; or a lazy indifferency easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
to that part which is next at
hand to be chosen; or it may be, they never
having heard of another profession (which
precludes any choice at all).</p>
               <p>But admit it did arrive to <hi>a rational cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
(as it easily might with them that have
with the external requisite advantages, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
understanding, patience, diligence, and
impartiality to consider); That is, suppose
it to proceed upon that abundant evidence
which the case will admit, that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrine hath been testified by God;
And that Gods testimony cannot deceive:
There needs more <hi>to win and overcome mens
hearts;</hi> which must be done e're the things
revealed in the Gospel can be apprehended
<hi>delectable.</hi> What can any man have greater
certainty of, <hi>in a meer human way,</hi> than all
men have that they must dye? And yet how
few are there whose spirits are formed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to any seriousness agreeable to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion?
Whatever way a man comes to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32156:29"/>
certain of any thing that hath a contrary
tendency to the bent of his habitually wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heart, he needs more than the evidence
of the thing, to make it efficaciously deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his will against his former vicious
course. If the matter be such as properly
falls under Faith; That Faith grounds upon
the Authority of God apprehended as avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth of that revelation to which
we subscribe our assent. But then it is live<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
or languid, according as the apprehension
is we have of that avouchment. But the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
which is only the product of the
external revelation, even recommended by
the most advantagious and convincing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
is too faint to command the Soul.
Who amongst all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> at
Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> could have any doubt, but
the Authority that avouched the Law there
given them was Divine? And yet how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do they rush into Idolatry, against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
letter of that Law; while the sound of
that dreadful <hi>voice of words</hi> which delivered
it, could hardly, one would think, be well
out of their ears! And though they could
not doubt of Gods Authority, yet for all that,
their frequent rebellions are plainly resolved
into <hi>their infidelity.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>because that Jesus
was not yet glorified.</hi> And how expresly have

interpreted <hi>coming to him</hi> by <hi>believing on him)
No man can come unto me,<note place="margin">v. 35.</note>, except the Father

having said,<note place="margin">v. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth;</hi>
he adds, <hi>But there are some of you, that believe
not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 64.</note> (so that no mans professed assent, though
as forward a professor as <hi>Judas</hi> was, <hi>there
refer'd to,</hi> will in strict account intitle him
a Believer, if it be not produced by the
quickening influence of the Spirit). And
then repeats,<note place="margin">v. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore I said unto you, that
no man can come unto me, except it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

the Father had to with-hold that
quickening Spirit, so generally, from
that people, any one may see that reads
their story. Upon which, by the recess
of that Spirit, they are hardened to as
great a Miracle as formerly their <hi>AEgyptian</hi>
oppressors were many ages before (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed no greater Miracle as was said of
old, than that men should not believe upon
the sight of so many Miracles). And this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32156:30"/>
dreadful dereliction, and consequent obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
we see is refer'd to <hi>primitive Justice</hi>
as a vindictive dispensation. <hi>But though he

                  <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 1.</note> (where
it is obvious to observe, that the <hi>believing of
the Gospel-report</hi> owes it self to the <hi>revelation
of Gods arm;</hi> or requires the exerting of his
power, agreeable to that of the Apostle, <hi>That
ye may know what is the exceeding greatness
of his power to us-ward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>who believe according
to the working of his mighty power, which he
wrought in Christ, when he raised him from
the dead, &amp;c.).</hi> And how the arm of the
Lord came not to be revealed, or that power
not to be put forth, is intimated in what
follows, <hi>Therefore they could not believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
(for which <hi>Isaias</hi> is again quoted),<note place="margin">Isa. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>he
had blinded their eyes, and hardened their
hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Which shews, that as that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and hardening of eyes and hearts, in
some superadded degrees thereof, is the effect
of a penal dereliction or retraction of Gods
arm, for former obstinate opposition to the
external revelation of the Gospel; So that
there is a precedent blindness and hardness,
not otherwise vincible than by the arm of the
Lord; And which, it being penally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
will naturally grow worse and worse.
And certainly <hi>that,</hi> upon the with-holding
whereof, such things certainly ensue as are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32156:30"/>
                  <hi>inconsistent with believing,</hi> must needs it self
<hi>be necessary to it.</hi> All which things considered,
do so plainly speak the <hi>insufficiency of a meer
external revelation,</hi> and the <hi>necessity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
besides,</hi> unto that Faith, <hi>which is the
immediate spring of delight in God;</hi> that it is
not needful to insist upon many plain Texts
of Scripture besides, that fully say the same
thing.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>As that no man can say that Jesus is
the Lord, but by the holy Ghost.</hi> And again,
<hi>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son
of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
And whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ch. 5. 1.</note> Upon which words,
with many more of like import in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Volume, no sense can be put which is
tolerable, and not the same with what we
have above asserted.</p>
               <p>In short, Faith is a part of homage paid to
the Authority of the great God; which is
to be estimated <hi>sincere,</hi> according as it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the end, for which the things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
were revealed. That <hi>end</hi> is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
only the notion of those things, as truths
that are to be lodg'd in the mind, and go no
further; as if they were to be understood true
only that they might be so understood; But
that the person might <hi>accordingly</hi> have his
spirit formed, and might shape the course of
his whole conversation; Therefore is it called
the <hi>obedience of faith:</hi> And the same word
which is wont to be rendered <hi>unbelief</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
disobedience, obstinacy unperswadeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
being from a theam, which (as is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32156:31"/>
known) signifies to perswade. So that this
<hi>homage</hi> is then truly given to the eternal God,
when his revelation is comply'd with and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to, according to the true intent and
purpose of it. Which, that it may be, requires
that <hi>his spirit</hi> urge the soul with <hi>his Authority,</hi>
and overpower it into an awful subjection
thereto. The soul being so disjointed by the
Apostacy that its own faculties keep not (in
reference to the things of God) their <hi>natural
order</hi> to one another, further than as an holy
rectitude is renewed in them by the holy
Ghost. Therefore is it necessary, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening
communication which he transmits
into it, be not only so <hi>clear,</hi> as to scatter the
darkness that beclouded the mind, but so
penetrating, as to strike and pierce the heart,
to dissolve and relaxe its stiff and frozen rigor,
and render it capable of a new mould &amp; frame.
In order whereto, <hi>God that</hi> (at first) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the light to shine out of darkness, is said
to have shined into the hearts</hi> (of them <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note>
whom he renews) <hi>to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they to whom this communication
of God is in some degree afforded, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>apprehend</hi> how necessary it was to them
that it should be afforded; and <hi>be such</hi> as they
<hi>now find it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (which they apprehended not
before), so they perceive it to be <hi>delightful</hi>
also, as well as <hi>necessary.</hi> And finding it yet
given into them but in an imperfect degree,
their continual cravings are still for more.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32156:31"/>
And having <hi>tasted hereby,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>how gracious the
Lord is; as new-born-babes, they desire it, as
sincere milk that they may grow thereby.</hi> They
<hi>hereby,</hi> come to know God and the things of
God <hi>with savor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 10.</note> And <hi>wisdom having entered
into their hearts, knowledg is pleasant to their
soul.</hi> Whereby, as every renewed taste pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
in them <hi>new desire,</hi> all such renewed
desires dispose them unto <hi>further and more
satisfying delight.</hi> They sensibly discern the
difference between their former dry and sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
notions of God, and the lively-spirited ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
which they now have. They can
in some measure understand the reason why
the Apostle should in such a rapture speak of
the <hi>excellency of the knowledg of Christ Jesus
our Lord;</hi> And why he should so triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
give thanks to God for the <hi>manifestation
of the [savor] of his knowledg</hi> in every place.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note>
They can perceive there was good sence in
those words, as they have a more quick and
judicious perception of the fragrancy of that
knowledg. It is to them a refreshing, vital,
quickening perfume,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> (as the word there, and
before imports) most cheeringly odoriferous,
the <hi>savor of life to life,</hi> lively in it self, and to
them. So full of life, as to beget and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it; and replenish their Souls therewith.
So as they might feel life thence working in
all their powers; A revelation <hi>of God,</hi> that is
of such <hi>a nature,</hi> cannot but be highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable.</p>
               <p>1. In respect of the <hi>matter</hi> revealed, <hi>God
himself</hi> especially (if not yet testifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32156:32"/>
to be, yet at least willing in Christ to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come)
<hi>our God;</hi> in such a way, and upon such
terms as is expressed in the Gospel. A more
particular mention of the things (contained
in this revelation) that are more apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
delight and feed it, is purposely defer'd,
till we come to press and inforce the duty it
self.</p>
               <p>2. In respect of the immediate way and
manner of Revelation, with so much facility
continually coming in from time to time,
upon the Soul, according as it is found ready
by a dutiful compliance to admit it, and doth
ly open to it: (For otherwise, a fatherly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
is most fitly expressed in with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at some times).</p>
               <p>3. In respect of the life and vigor which it
carries with it, whereby it is experienced to be
<hi>a vital light;</hi> and that it is indeed (as is said)
<hi>life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1.</note> which is the <hi>light of men.</hi> Dull, sluggish,
ineffectual notions of such things can have
little (comparatively) of delectation in them.</p>
               <p>4. In respect of the design and tendency
of the Revelation, (discernible at the same
time), to draw the Soul into union with
God; And that there may be a continual
intercourse between him and it. Not that it
might have a transient glance of so lovely an
object, and no more. When once it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
God hath made this light shine in upon
me, <hi>not to amuse</hi> me, but here he fixes it as
a lamp <hi>to guide</hi> me, in a stated course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him. How pleasant is it to think
he will be known for this blessed purpose!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:32156:32"/>
Now a communication of God, including
a revelation of him, apt to beget such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
cannot be without much matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>But besides, that (though most naturally
following thereupon) it also includes,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>A transforming impression of his image.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
This yet more fully answers the enquiry
when a person is said <hi>to enjoy God;</hi> what
doth he <hi>immediately</hi> enjoy? or whereby is
he said to <hi>enjoy God?</hi> what doth God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
or transmit, by which he may be said
<hi>to be enjoyed?</hi> He communicates <hi>his own living
likeness,</hi> the very image of himself; not the
<hi>Idaea</hi> or likeness only by which he is known;
Though it must be confessed, the knowledg
of him, if he be known to be what he truly
is, must suppose a true likeness of him, offered
to the mind, and formed there. But this of
which we now speak, is a not meerly <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative</hi>
but <hi>a real image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The product of the former it is, as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to be collected from what hath been
said. For that appears to be not a meer aiery,
spiritless, ineffectual thing, as the notion of
God, and of all divine matters is with the most;
but as hath been said <hi>operative,</hi> penetrating,
efficacious, apt to beget sutable impressions
upon the heart, and wholly transform the
Soul. The effect of it then is, <hi>this transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
impression it self;</hi> By which the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
another thing than it was;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>A new

of it, in its perfect state, though much
have been discoursed elsewhere; It will be
requisite to say somewhat here also, that may
bear a more direct reference to the present
imperfect state of the regenerate in this world.</p>
               <p>That communication of God which must
be supposed afforded them, in order to their
delighting in him, could signify little to that
purpose, if with deformed and diseased Souls
they were only to look upon a very lovely
object; still themselves remaining what they
were. Nor doth it delight them only as it
is apprehended <hi>apt and aiming</hi> to work an
happy change in them; but as it doth it or
hath in part done it. As like an active quick
flame it passes through their Souls, searches,
melts them, burns up their dross, makes them
a new lump or mass, forms them for Gods
own use and converse.</p>
               <p>God is proposed unto our communion and
fellowship under the name of Light.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3. 5.</note> But such
a light (it appears) as whereby <hi>we that were
darkness do also become light in the Lord</hi> (as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
it is exprest.)<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> That, as he is the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of lights,</hi> we may appear the children of
such a father, and walk accordingly <hi>i. e.</hi> as
<hi>children of light.</hi> For we are presently told
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32156:33"/>
                  <hi>that if we say we have fellowship with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and
walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 7.</note>
                  <hi>then we have a mutual fellowship, (i. e.</hi> God
and we). It is needful then, that we have
that apprehension of him. And he therefore
by solemn message makes that declaration of
himself that he is <hi>Light, (This then is the
message which we have heard of him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you, that God is light, and with him
is no darkness at all), i. e.</hi> the most pure, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
excellent, glorious Being.</p>
               <p>But for what purpose are we to have that
apprehension? We are told by the Apostle
for what; He there makes that declaration
with that design, that we might be entered
into the same fellowship in which he was
already: For that end therefore we are to
have this apprehension. But inasmuch as he
immediately adds, That yet while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
in darkness, we lie, if we pretend to
that fellowship: 'Tis manifest, that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of God and our sutable apprehension
are no further serviceable to <hi>their end,</hi> than
<hi>bringing us into fellowship with him,</hi> than as
by his beams he begets us into his own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
herein: And that (so far as our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and present state admit) we be truly in
a degree made pure, bright, shining, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
creatures, resembling our Maker, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a second time formed after the image of
him that created us.</p>
               <p>The Gospel is the formative instrument in
this work, as it was said to be the instrument
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32156:34"/>
or means of our <hi>intellectual illumination.</hi> The

Gods <hi>gracious Nature</hi> and <hi>favourable
inclination</hi> towards us, are an apt means (but
no more than a means) to render us <hi>well-natur'd</hi>
(not cross, thwarting, contrary) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. Faith admits the Gospel-discovery
into the Soul, and of an external word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
makes it become an <hi>ingrafted word; The
word of Christ dwelling richly in us;</hi> And so
gives it the advantage of becoming thus
mightily operative; For unto them only <hi>who
believe</hi> is it the power of God to Salvation.
And being received, not as the word of man,
but as the word of God, it works effectually
<hi>in them that believe.</hi> To them who believe it
not, it signifies nothing, is to them an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sound, or only as a tale that is told.</p>
               <p>And inasmuch as the Gospel-revelation is
the instrument of this impression; by it the
impression must be measured, with it must
it agree. Which revelation being expressive
of the Nature of God, and of his mind and
will in reference to us; the impression can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be agreeable to that revelation; but
it must also carry in it the resemblance and
likeness of God himself; for the Gospel-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
is Gods Seal; the stamp upon it is
a model of his Image. Whence therefore
the Soul sealed therewith, bears on it at once
the signature both of the <hi>Author</hi> and the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32156:34"/>
                  <hi>Instrument.</hi> But because our best and surest
way of forming true and right apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, is to attend and guide our selves
by the representation that is there made of
him (for it were useless and in vain, if let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our thoughts work at random without
reference to it, we might conceive as fitly
of God and his mind concerning us, as by
the direction and guidance of it); There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are we to aim at conformity to God
<hi>as he is there represented.</hi> For that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
likeness to him we are to inquire after
(and which only could be impressed by his
Gospel) <hi>that is</hi> expressed and represented
there.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>We all with open face beholding as in
a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into
the same Image from glory to glory.</hi> It is by
the glory of the Lord shining through <hi>that
glass,</hi> that we are changed. And the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
whereinto we are changed is the
<hi>same image</hi> that is to be seen in that glass.
For there God hath provided such a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of himself and of his mind should
appear, as is most sutable to our case and
state, and which it most concerned us to have
the view and the image of. <hi>That</hi> represents
him in his <hi>imitable excellencies;</hi> and shews what
he is <hi>towards us,</hi> what his counsels, determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and constitutions are concerning us,
and hereupon shews, <hi>what we should be,</hi> or
what temper of Spirit becomes us in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to such a revelation. And <hi>such,</hi> when we
receive this his impressive communication, he
really makes us thereby become. And then
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32156:35"/>
is it that it will be found most highly delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
An heart formed according to the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God in Christ, and cast into the mould of
the Gospel (as is the import of the Apostles
words,—<hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart the
doctrine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17</note> into the type or frame whereof ye
were delivered) hath a spring of pleasure in
it self. Not of perfect unmixed pleasure; for
there is much yet remaining, that cannot
but be very displeasing and offensive to such
as have learned no longer to put bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter, and have senses
exercised to discern betwixt good and evil.
And indeed by the same vital principle the
Soul is made capable of both the sweetest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and the quickest sense of pain; while
it was dead it was sensible of neither.</p>
               <p>Nor is it an original Spring; Whatever it
hath that is good and pleasant comes from an
higher Head, and is communicated. But
the communication remains not in this heart
as in a dead receptacle, but creates the Soul
where it is a living spring it self. <hi>The Lord
shall satisfie thy Soul in drought,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and make fat
thy bones, and thou shalt be like a watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and as a spring of water whose waters fail
not.</hi> After which it follows, <hi>Then shalt thou
delight thy self in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> &amp;c. So though the
waters that are so pleasantly refreshing to holy
Souls are given by Christ; yet he himself tells
us,<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 14.</note> they <hi>shall be in him to whom they are given
a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</hi>
Whence also the <hi>Good man</hi> is said to be <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from himself;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 14. 14.</note> And <hi>the mouth of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ch. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:32156:35"/>
to be <hi>a well of life i. e. to others,</hi> much
more must his <hi>heart</hi> be so <hi>to himself.</hi> Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can there be a vainer or more absurd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and expectation, than to aim immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
at delights and joys, without ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after that transforming, purifying, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<hi>communication</hi> from God, in which he is
to be enjoyed; which is apparently the (most
prejudicial and dangerous) mistake, the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
error (and so much the worse therefore)
of many persons of much pretence to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that dream and boast of nothing less
than raptures and transports, having never
yet known or felt what the work of <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or the <hi>new creature</hi> means. And having
only got some notions of God and Christ,
that tickle their fancies without ever changing
their hearts, these go for divine injoyments.
Others somewhat awakened and convinced
but not renewed, though they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
already to have, yet do (from the same
mistaken apprehension) as vainly seek and
catch at joys and sweetnesses; while their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
hearts do yet ly steept in the gall
of bitterness: And they wonder and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that they feel not in themselves the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
whereof they find Scripture sometimes
make mention, while in the mean time they
expect and snatch at them in that preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
impossible way, as to abstract them from
the things themselves, wherein the pleasure
and delight lies. They would have <hi>delight</hi>
without the <hi>delectable good,</hi> that must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
afford and yield it; or without
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32156:36"/>
foregoing the noysom evils that resist and
hinder it; which therefore makes it necessary
to treat the more largely of the <hi>delightful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
by which only intervening Souls
are capable of delighting in God.</p>
               <p>And as to this Branch of it, <hi>The vital San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
transforming influence,</hi> whereby the
Soul is wrought to a conformity to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
If we take a (somewhat more distinct)
view of it, we shall find, it cannot but have
in it abundant matter of delight. In the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
The thing here to be communicated, is
<hi>an universal rectitude</hi> of temper and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
including The
<list>
                     <item>Removal of such as are sinful and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;</item>
                     <item>Settlement of such as are holy and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Both to be measured and estimated, as to
their good or evil, by the Gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Now surely that must be a blessed
and delighful state (and its that towards
which this divine communication gradually
tends) wherein a wretched Soul, that was
lost in the impurities of sin, shall be stript and
unclothed of all the pravity, perverse inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
corrupt affections which the Gospel of
Christ condemns; and invested with all the
parts of that purity, that gracious and holy-frame
which that Gospel recommends. For
as the former carry in them matter of certain
vexation and anguish, which it is hereby
freed from; So the latter manifestly carry in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32156:36"/>
themselves matter of unspeakable delight and
pleasure, which it hereby partakes. And by
the same degrees by which this divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
infers the latter of these, it expels
the former. By the same degrees by which any
are made <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> they
<hi>escape the corruptions which are in the world
through lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we may be here a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
without descending into the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
particularities which might be severally
spoken of upon this occasion; we shall only
consider this <hi>heart-rectifying communication,</hi> in
reference to some of the more principal things,
towards which the spirit of man may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>perversly,</hi> or <hi>duly and aright</hi> inclin'd; that
we may see what matter of delight it infers
and brings with it.</p>
               <p>In order whereto it must be considered,
that wherein it is <hi>transforming,</hi> it is also <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening;</hi>
And therefore furnishes the Soul,
with the power of <hi>spiritual sensation;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it comes to <hi>apprehend</hi> its former temper,
as very grievous and detestable; not only
being intire and undiminished, but even the
reliques of it which do yet remain; and
proportionably, the holy frame to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't,
as highly covetable and to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired.</p>
               <p>Which being supposed, It must needs be
very delightful to such a Soul, to feel it self
in part rectified, and to expect it further in
its temper and inclinations,</p>
               <p>1. Towards God, towards whom it was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32156:37"/>
most disinclined: That is, both <hi>towards him
as its end,</hi> and <hi>towards Christ as its way to
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to himself it's end. It finds upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
it <hi>was dead towards God,</hi> without
motion towards him, without inclination, all
it's powers bent and set quite another way;
So that to perswade it to begin a course of
holy motion towards God, was a like thing
as to perswade a stone to fly upwards. It
could not trust the <hi>original Truth,</hi> nor love
the <hi>soveraign Good,</hi> nor obey the <hi>supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
Its course was nothing else but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
recession from him, towards whom it
should have been continually pressing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with all its might. It was wont to say
to him, in whom was its life and all its hope,
<hi>Depart from me, I desire not the knowledg of thy
ways;</hi> was utterly <hi>alienated from the life of
God,</hi> and did chuse to <hi>live as without him in
the world.</hi> And although it still remain thus
in too great a degree, yet as it abhors this
as an hateful way of living, and desires it
may be otherwise; so is it sensibly delightful
that it doth in some degree perceive a change;
That now it can find it self returning into its
right and natural state of subordination to
God. Which while it was out of it, laid
that claim to it, that its dislocation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
and it could have no rest; though it
was not aware what the matter was with
it, and could never throughly apprehend,
that it ought (much less could desire or aim)
to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:32156:37"/>
And if in returning, and it's continual
course afterwards (which ought to be but
a continuing return and moving back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God), there be much cause for the
exercise of <hi>Repentance;</hi> the disposition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
is a part of that new nature now commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated;
yet even such <hi>relentings</hi> as are due
and sutable upon this account are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant:
There is pleasure mingled with such
tears, and with those mournings which are
not without hope, and which flow naturally
and without force, from a living principle
within, as waters from their still-freshly spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fountain. When the Soul finds it self
unbound and set at liberty; when it can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pour out it self to God, dissolve kindly
and melt before him; It doth it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
only at what it hath done and been,
not at what it is now doing, except that it
can do it no more; affecting even to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
herein, while it yet sees it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within some bounds. It loves to lye in
the dust and abase it self; and is pleased
with the humiliation, contrition and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart which <hi>repentance towards God</hi>
includes in it. So that as God is delighted
with this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so <hi>it is</hi> with the <hi>offering</hi>
of it up to him. Many men apprehend a
certain sweetness in revenge; such a one
finds it only in this just revenge upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>How unexpressible pleasure accompanies its
devoting it self to God, when bemoaning it self,
and returning with weeping and supplication,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32156:38"/>
It says, <q>Now <hi>Lo I come to thee, thou art the
Lord my God.</hi> I have brought thee back
thine own, what I had sacrilegiously alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and stol'n away, the heart which
was gone astray, that hath been so long a
vagabond and fugitive from thy blessed
presence, service and communion. Take
now the Soul which thou hast made; Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
thy own right; enter upon it, stamp
it with the intire impression of thine own
Seal, and mark it for thine. Other Lords
shall no more have dominion. What have
I to do any more with the Idols where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I was wont to provoke thee to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie?
I will now make mention of thy
name, and of thine only. I bind my self
to thee in everlasting bonds, in a covenant
never to be forgotten.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The self-denial which is included in this
transaction, hath no little pleasure in it. When
the Soul freely quits all pretence to it self,
and by its own consent passes into his (now
acknowleged) right; disclaims it self, and
all its own former interests, inclinations and
ends, and is resolved to be to him and to
no other. When this is done <hi>Vnreservedly,</hi>
without any intention of retaining or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back any thing from him; <hi>Absolutely,</hi> and
without making any conditions of its own,
but only agreeing to and thankfully accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his; <hi>Peremptorily</hi> and without hesitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and without halting between two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<hi>Shall I?</hi> or <hi>shall I not?</hi> (as if it were
ready in the same breath to retract and undo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32156:38"/>
its own act) How doth it now rejoice to feel
it self offer willingly! They that have life
and sense about them, can tell there is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in all this. And the oftner repetition is
made hereof (so it be done with life, not
with trifling formality) they so often renew
the relishes with themselves of the same plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Continued commerce with God, agreeable
to the tenor of that League and Covenant
struck with him, how pleasant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is it! To be a <hi>friend of God,</hi> an associate
of the most High, a domestique, no more a
stranger, a foreigner, but of his own houshold.
To live wholly upon the plentiful provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and under the happy order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his family. To have an heart to
seek all from him, and lay out all for him!
How great is the pleasure of trust, of living
free from care; that is, of any thing, but
how to please and honour him in a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unsolicitous dependance, expecting from
him our daily bread, believing he will not
let our Souls famish. That while they hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst after righteousness they shall
be filled; that they shall be sustained with
the bread and waters of life; that when they
hunger he will feed them with hidden <hi>Manna,</hi>
and with the fruits that grow on the tree of
life in the midst of the Paradise of God;
that when they thirst he will give water, and
add milk and honey without money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
price.</p>
               <p>And for the body not to doubt, but he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32156:39"/>
that feeds Ravens and clothes Lillies will feed
and cloath them. To be so taken up in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kingdom and righteousness, as freely
to leave it to him to add the <hi>other things</hi> as
he sees fit; To take no thought for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
To have an heart framed herein accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to divine precept; Not to be encumbered
or kept in an anxious suspence by the thoughts
and fears of what may fall out, by which
many suffer the same affliction a thousand
times over, which God would have them
suffer but once; A firm repose on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of providence, and its sure and never-erring
wisdom; A steady perswasion, that
our heavenly Father knows what we have
need of, and what it is fittest for us to want,
to suffer or enjoy; How delightful a life do
these make! And how agreeable to one born
of God, his own Son, and heir of all things;
as being joint-heirs with Christ, and claiming
by that large grant, that says <hi>all things are
yours;</hi> only that in minority it is better to
have a wise Fathers allowance, than be our
own carvers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To live in the fear of God,</hi> is not without
its pleasure. It composes the Soul, expels
the vanity which is not without vexation,
represses exorbitant motions, checks unruly
passions, keeps all within in a pleasant peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
calm; Is health to the navel, and marrow
to the bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To live in his love, is delight it self,</hi> or a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards it. The disposition whereto
being communicated from God, and a part
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32156:39"/>
of the holy new creature derived from him;
is also part of the (secondary or subservient)
delectable object. As the light that serves
unto vision is partly (as the mediate object)
somewhat of what I see, and doth partly (as
a principle) actuate and concur with the
faculty in the act of seeing. And as the blessed
God himself is both the first Principle and
ultimate Object of that and other gracious
acts<note n="*" place="margin">And how rationally men may be said at the same time to love, delight in and enjoy the amiable or dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable object, and therewith also love their own love, enjoy their own fruition, or delight in their own delight; enough is said by some School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Nor indeed can it be conceived how the Soul can <hi>continue</hi> to love or delight in any thing but it must be so. For while it <hi>perseveres,</hi> every lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter act justifies the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and takes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency therein, but all as directed towards such an object.</note>: Therefore it cannot but
be pleasant to the Soul, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that powerful influence from
God stirring in it, by which it is
disposed to design and pitch upon
him as the Great Object of its
highest delight, unto whom it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under so vile and wicked
an aversion heretofore. Yea though
it yet have no certain perswasion
of a present interest in him, yet
this disposition of heart towards
him, and that it finds it <hi>could</hi>
satisfyingly rest in him as its <hi>best
good,</hi> upon <hi>supposition</hi> it had such
an interest, the very strivings and
contentions of the Soul towards
him upon this account, are not
without a present pleasure: As
we behold with an intermixed
<hi>desire</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> a grateful object,
which we would enjoy, but do not yet
know whether we can compass or not. To
be in that temper of Soul, as to resolve,
Him I will seek and pursue, him I will study
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32156:40"/>
to please and serve, and spend my strength
and life in serving him (which is to live in
his love) though I yet know not whether
he will accept, or how he will deal with
me! This cannot but have a certain sensible
delectation in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To live in a stated habitual subjection to</hi> him
as the <hi>Lord</hi> of our lives, How pleasant is it!
To have learned to obey; To be accustomed
to the yoke; To taste and prove the goodness
and acceptableness of his will, through an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
transformation in the renewal of our
minds; To be by the law of the spirit of life
made free from the law of sin and death; To
be able to speak it as the undisguised sense of
our hearts, <hi>because thy law is holy, therefore thy
servant loveth it;</hi> To reckon it <hi>a royal law of
liberty,</hi> so as to account our selves so much the
more free, by how much we are the more
thus bound; When we affect to be prescrib'd
to, and are become <hi>patient of Government,</hi> not
apt to chafe at the bridle, or spurn and kick at
the boundaries that hem us in: This is a temper
that hath not more of duty in it than it hath
of delight. There is such a thing as <hi>delighting
in the law of God, according to the inward man,</hi>
when there is yet a difficulty in suppressing
and keeping under inordinate rebellious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of corrupt nature; unto which there
is no desire an indulgence should be given,
by having the law attempered to them, but
severity rather used to reduce them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the law: So will it be, if the law
become an heart impression; when it can once
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32156:40"/>
be truly said, <hi>Thy law is in my heart,</hi> It will
be also with the same sincerity said,<note place="margin">Psal. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>I delight
to do thy will, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The continual exercise of good conscience
towards God,</hi> hath great pleasure in it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our way and course is continually review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and we pass censures upon our selves, and
upon that account survey our own works.
And by how much the more carefully and
often this is done, so much the more delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it will be; that is, the more approvable
we shall find them upon review. For we
shall order our course the more warily, as we
reckon upon undergoing an inquisition and
search; wherein an apprehensive serious heart
well understands it is not it self to be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judg. How blessed an imitation might
there here be of the blessed God himself, who
we find beheld his six days works, and <hi>lo
they were all very good;</hi> whereupon follows
his delightful day of rest; So we shall, in
some degree of conformity to him, finding
our works to be in that sort good, as that he
will by gracious indulgence accept them as such,
have our own Sabbath, a sweet and peaceful
rest in our own spirits. Though we can pretend
no higher than <hi>sincerity only,</hi> yet how sweet
are the reflections of a well-instructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
upon that! when our hearts reproach
us not, and we resolve they shall not as long
as we live; we are conscious to our selves of
no base designs, we propose nothing to our
selves, wherein we apprehend cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
Gods eye; <hi>we walk in the light,</hi> and are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32156:41"/>
seeking no darkness or shadow of death,
where (as workers of iniquity) we may hide
our selves from him; Can implore him as an
assistant, and appeal to him as a Judg in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to our daily affairs and wonted course:
Is this without pleasure! <hi>This is our rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>
saith the Apostle, <hi>the testimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not
with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God we
have had our conversation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus to converse with God, a him
whom we daily design to glorifie and serve,
and whom we expect daily in some measure,
and fully and finally ere it be long, to enjoy,
Is certainly throughout <hi>a way of pleasantness
and peace.</hi> How delectable then is this Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectifying
communication from God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
being before so disaffected, it becomes
now so well inclin'd towards him in all these
respects.</p>
               <p>But because the exigency of the case did
require (by reason of sin that had cut off the
intercourse) that there should be a Mediator
to open the way and renew the former out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn
friendship; Therefore it was also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that so the Soul might duly move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, it should be rightly framed and
disposed also <hi>towards him.</hi> We are therefore
to consider too, how delectable this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
must be, as it aright disposes the heart
<hi>towards Christ,</hi> our way to God.</p>
               <p>For <hi>towards him</hi> we must understand it to
have been most obstinately and inflexibly
averse; and that therefore a mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32156:41"/>
of power was necessary to set it
right here.</p>
               <p>Unto that part of Religion which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
there was so much of an advantage before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
as that there was an old foundation to
build upon. There are some notions of God
left, not only concerning his Existence, but
his Nature and Attributes, many of them.
And from the Apprehension <hi>what he was,</hi> it
was in some measure discernible <hi>what he should
have been,</hi> and ought yet to be towards him;
And from thence many checks and rebukes of
conscience wherein it was found to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
So that here was somewhat <hi>in Nature</hi>
to be wrought upon, as to this part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But as to that part which respects the
Mediator, this was a frame wholly to be rais'd
up from the ground. There were no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>immediately and directly</hi> inclining to take
part with the Gospel; But all to be implanted
anew. The way that God would take to bring
back Souls to him being so infinitely above
all human thought. And therefore, though
to a considering Pagan it would not sound
strangely, that God ought to be trusted, feared,
loved, &amp;c. yet <hi>even to such</hi> the <hi>Gospel of Christ</hi>
was <hi>foolishness.</hi> Besides, that this way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with men was not only unknown and
unimaginable to them, not so much as once
thought of, or to be guest at. But the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
and aspect of it (when it should come
to be made known) was such as that it could
not but find the temper of mens spirits most
strongly opposite, not meerly ignorant, but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32156:42"/>
prejudic't and highly disaffected. For this
course most directly tended to take men quite
off from their old bottom; To stoop and
humble, and even bring them to nothing; To
stain the pride of their Glory, and lay them
down in the dust as abject wretches, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
fit for nothing, but to be trampled on
and crusht by the foot of divine revenge. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man to have admitted a conviction
from the light of his own mind and conscience
<hi>that he was a sinner,</hi> and had offended his
Maker, incur'd his just displeasure, and made
himself liable to his punishing justice; It
would yet have been a hard matter to make
him believe it altogether impossible to him,
to do any thing to remedy the matter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
himself to divine favour and acceptance.
He would naturally be inclin'd to think; why
admit the case be so, he should easily find
out a way to make God amends. He would
recount with himself all his own natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and think himself very capable of
doing some great thing, that should more
than expiate his offence, and make recompence
abundantly for any wrong that he had done.
But when the Gospel shall come, and tell him
he hath deserved eternal wrath, that his sin
is inexpiable, but by everlasting sufferings,
or what is of equal value; That here
is one (the eternal Son of God) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a man like himself, and thereupon
a voluntary Sacrifice, to make atonement
for the transgression of men; That God will
never accept another Sacrifice for the sins of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32156:42"/>
men than his, nor ever any service at their
hands, but for his sake; That <hi>him</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to them they must receive, rely upon,
and trust to wholly, or perish without mercy;
Yea, and that he hath put the Government
over them, into his hands, laid it on his
shoulders, and to him they must subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as their Ruler and Judg, the great Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of life and death to them and all men;</p>
               <p>That they are to be intirely devoted to him
as long as they live, as their Redeemer and
Lord; In him as they are to have righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and strength, so to him they must pay
all possible homage and subjection, to him
their knees must bow, and their tongues
confess; They must receive the Law from
his mouth; Be prescribed to by him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his will, though never so much to
the crossing of their own; And though
notwithstanding, they must know they can
deserve nothing by it; That so vile and
worthless miscreants they are become that
God will never have to do with them upon
other terms.</p>
               <p>When this shall appear the state of the
case, and it comes to be apprehended, <q>Then
must I yeild my self a greater transgressor
than ever I thought, and an undone impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
helpless wretch? I shall thus make
nothing of my self: And what must all
my natural or acquired excellencies go just
for nothing? And a person of such worth
and accomplishments as I, be thus brought
down into the dust? Yea and besides, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32156:43"/>
be brought, under such bonds, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to owe my self so intirely to a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that I must for ever live after his will
and pleasure, and no more at my own;
And can never hope, if I take a liberty to
indulge my self besides the allowance of
his rules, that I can ever make any amends
for such transgression by any thing that I
can do. So that by taking his gift (of
my pardon and life) upon such terms, I
shall sell my liberty, and render my self a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
slave to his will and pleasure for ever.</q>
Here now cannot but be a strong stream to
be striven against, and most vehement coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-strivings
of the <hi>haughty</hi> and licentious
spirit of man. So that it is not strange it
should be said by our Saviour, <hi>No man can
come to me except my father draw him.</hi> And
that the exceeding greatness of power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the workings of the mightiest
power in any case, should be put forth upon
them that believe. Therefore are men <hi>in
Christ</hi> by <hi>creative power</hi> only;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man
be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</hi> He is new
made, if he be in him. And this aversion
being so <hi>deeply natural,</hi> will still in a degree
remain (while any thing of corrupt nature
remains) in the hearts of even the regenerate
themselves.</p>
               <p>Therefore a continual exertion of the same
power will be ever requisite to hold Souls to
Christ, and retain them in their station <hi>in him.</hi>
He that <hi>establisheth us with you in Christ [is
God] &amp;c. q. d.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> It is only <hi>a God</hi> that can do
this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:32156:43"/>
Therefore how is God admired and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
upon this single account. <hi>Now to him
that is of power to stablish you according to my
Gospel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and the preaching of Jesus Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the revelation of the mystery,</hi> which was
kept secret since the world began, (this was
indeed a great Secret to the lapsed world)
—<hi>To God only wise be glory through Jesus
Christ for ever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the heart-rectifying communication
from God, in this matter, is such as carries
<hi>mighty power</hi> with it, so it doth <hi>proportionable
pleasure,</hi> when it hath overcome, and (to
the pitch of sincerity) set the Soul right in
this thing.</p>
               <p>How delectable is it to <hi>receive</hi> the Son of
God! when the heart is made willing in the
day of power! when his cords take hold of
the Soul, and draw it to him! What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is there in the <hi>consenting, self-resigning act
and disposition!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is most highly delightful to receive him,
and give up our selves to him <hi>as our full suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good,</hi> so exactly answering all the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of our distressed case; when sensibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the true state of it, the Soul cries
out, <hi>None but Christ,</hi> and finds him present,
waiting only for consent, readily offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Here I am, take me, thy Jesus, thy help,
thy life!</hi> How overcomingly pleasant is this
to a Soul that feels its distress, and perceives it
self ready to perish; Yea and that daily sees
it self perishing, were it not for him. How
pleasant, <hi>when in the time of love</hi> he finds the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32156:44"/>
poor Soul in its blood, and says to it, <hi>live;</hi>
clothes it, decks it, makes it perfect through
his own comliness, tenders himself to it, <hi>unto
it</hi> taken off the dunghil, cast out in the most
lothsom deplorable plight; And enters the
marriage Covenant with it, (we need not be
squeamish or shy to speak after God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so representing this matter), overcomes
by his own mercy and goodness, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
with a sinful creature to accept him.
How <hi>gladly</hi> doth it throw off every thing
of its own, that it may intirely possess him
and be possessed by him. Here is the Joy of
a Nuptial Solemnity, or the Joy of Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.
<hi>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is
mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While as yet this transaction is not distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reflected on, (as when possibly afterwards it
is, there may great difficulties and doubts arise,
whether all were rightly done, or yet be on
its own part, yea or no) if however it be truly
done, in the very doing it self, and the same
continuing disposition there is a sensible and
inseparable delight. I say in the same dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as often as by any repeated acts of
the same kind, it expresses and shews it self:
That is, as oft as this Covenant is renewed
(whether with solemnity or more occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly),
though the relation arising thence, be
not in the same instant considered or reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, nor the <hi>sincerity</hi> of the act it self,
which is necessary thereto; yet that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it self, if it be sincere, hath a secret joy
accompanying it; and the Soul <hi>feels</hi> the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32156:44"/>
and pleasure of its own act, though
it do not for the present examine and take a
view of it. For it is now from a <hi>principle of
life,</hi> imbracing and drawing into union with
it self an object that is <hi>all life and goodness,
and sweetness;</hi> which therefore sheds its own
delightful savour and fragrancy through the
Soul, while it is in the mean time acting only
upon the object directly, and not reflecting
upon its own act, or considering in that
very instant what will be consequential there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
But if withal it do consider, (as that
consideration cannot be far off, though it
cannot cosider every thing at once), that
it is receiving him that is to bring it to
God, who is <hi>able to do it, (even to save to the
uttermost all that will come to God by him),</hi>
who is <hi>intent upon that design,</hi> and did in
the midst of dying agonies breath forth his
Soul in the prosecution of it, and with whom
God requires it to unite for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
This cannot but add unspeakably to
the delightfulness of this transaction, and of
this effusion of the Holy Ghost, in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof the thing is done, how oft
soever it be (seriously) done; As our case
and state require that it be very often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to receive him as our Lord,</hi> (which is
joined with that other capacity wherein we
receive him,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> of a <hi>Jesus</hi> or <hi>Saviour; As
ye have received Christ Jesus [the Lord], so &amp;c.).</hi>
This also, and the heart-subduing influence
that disposes to it, is most highly delectable.
When the Soul, that was so stoutly averse,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32156:45"/>
and that once said within it self, I will not
have him to reign over me, is brought freely
to yeild; and with sincere loyal resolutions
and affections devotes it self to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to his government, submits its neck
and shoulder to his yoke and burden; says
to him with an ungainsaying heart, as its
full sense, <q>Now thou Lord of my life and
hope, who hast so long striven with me,
so oft and earnestly prest me hereto, so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
dealt with me, to make me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
thy merciful design, and who seekest
to <hi>rule</hi> with no other aim or intent, but
that thou may'st <hi>save;</hi> and who hast found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy dominion in thy blood, and didst
dy and revive and rise again that thou
mightest be Lord of the living and the
dead, and therefore my Lord; Accept now
a self-refigning Soul; I make a free surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of my self, I bow and submit to thy
Sovereign Power, I fall at the footstool
of thy Throne, Thou Prince of the
Kings of the Earth, who hast loved sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and washt them from their sins in thy
blood; Glory in thy conquest, Thou hast
overcome, I will from henceforth be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
mine own, but thine; I am ready to
receive thy commands, to do thy will, to
serve thy interests, to sacrifice <hi>my all</hi> to thy
Name and Honour; my whole life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are for ever thine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I say (as before) there is pleasure in the
<hi>very doing</hi> this it self, as often as it is sincerely
done; And it adds hereto, if it be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32156:45"/>
considered, It is no mean or any way
undeserving person to whom this homage is
paid, and obligation taken on unto future
obedience; He is the brightness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
glory, the express Image of his person,
the Heir of all things, and who sustains all
things by the word of his power: It is he
whose name is <hi>Wonderful, Counsellor,</hi> the <hi>mighty
God,</hi> the <hi>everlasting Father,</hi> the <hi>Prince of peace:</hi>
'Tis he to whom all power is given both in
heaven and earth, and (more especially)
power over all flesh, that he might give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life to as many as were given him; 'Tis he
who spoiled Principalities and Powers, and
made an open shew of them; He whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when he was in the form of God, and
thought it no robbery to be equal with God,
he humbled himself, made himself of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
took on him the form of a servant,
became obedient to death, the Father hath
therefore highly exalted, and given him a
Name above every name, that in his Name,
every knee should bow; And of whom, when
he brought him (his first-born) into the world,
he said, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such a one he is, whose temper is all
goodness and sweetness. <hi>Tell Sion, thy King
cometh meek and lowly.</hi> He came into this
world drawn down only by his own pity and
love, beholding the desolations and ruins that
were wrought in it every where. Sin univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
reigning, and death by sin, and spreading
its dark shadow, and a dreadful cloud over all
the earth. In which darkness the Prince thereof
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32156:46"/>
was ruling and leading men captive at his will;
having drawn them off from the blessed God
their life, and sunk them into a deep oblivion
of their own original; and disaffection to their
true happiness that could only be found there.</p>
               <p>This great Lord and Prince of life and
peace came down on purpose to be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer
of Souls, to repair the desolations and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
of many generations.</hi> He came full of grace
and truth, and hath scattered blessings over
the world wheresoever he came; hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
obliged all that ever knew him; and
is he in whom all the nations of the earth must
be blessed; And who would not with joy
swear fealty to him, and take pleasure to do
him homage? Who would not recount with
delight the unexpressible felicity of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the governing power of such a one?</p>
               <p>And if the tenor and scope of all his Laws
and Constitutions be viewed over, what will
they be found, but obligations upon men
to be happy; How easie his yoke, how light
his burden, what is the frame of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or whereof doth it consist but Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.
And who would not now say, <hi>This Lord
reigneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 96.</note> 
                  <hi>let the earth rejoyce, let the multitude of
the Isles be glad thereof.</hi> Why should it not be
triumphingly said among the Heathen, That
the Lord reigneth, that the world also shall
be established, that it cannot be moved; Let
the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad; let
the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the
fields rejoice and all that is therein, and all the
trees of the wood rejoice!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:32156:46"/>
Its plain, that be the matter of joy here
what it will, be there never so much cause of
exultation and glorying in him, The <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and peace</hi> which his Kingdom promises,
never actually take place, nor the <hi>joy</hi> that is
connexion therewith, till the Holy Ghost dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and form mens spirits thereto.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> For all
this is but meer dream and idle talk to those
who hear only of these things, and feel not
that vital influence insinuating it self, that
may give the living sense and savor of them.
And we may rather expect seas and fields,
beasts and trees, to sing his triumphant Song,
and chant his praises, than those men whose
hearts are not attempered to his Government,
and who are yet under the dominion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lord, not being yet <hi>by the law of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life in Christ Jesus, made free from the law
of sin and death:</hi> But where this is effectually
done, How large matter of most rational
pleasure do they find here; while there is
nothing in that whole System of Laws by
which he governs, that is either vain, unequal,
or unpleasant, or upon any account grievous?
only this is not the estimate of distempered
spirits, or of any other than them in whose
hearts his Law is written, and who because
<hi>they love him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi> Unto
Love his commands are most connatural;
<hi>For this is the love of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that we keep his
commandments; They are not grievous i. e.</hi> (by
the <hi>Meiosis</hi> which some do reasonably enough
apprehend in those words), they are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
delightful, pleasant, but <hi>to them only who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32156:47"/>
being born of God, have overcome the world.</hi>
This holy influence and communication of
God, is therefore grateful, and contributes
not a little to delight in this respect, that
thereby mens spirits are rectified and set right
towards God, <hi>viz.</hi> both towards the Creator
and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>As hereby they are rectified towards men,</hi>
having the universal Law of Love wrought
deep into their hearts; being fill'd with all
goodness, righteous meekness, mercifulness;
apt to do no wrong, to bear any, to pity and
help the distressed, to love enemies, and as
there is opportunity, to do good to all, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to them that are of the houshold of Faith.
We must understand in this, as well as in the
other parts of that stamp which the Spirit
of God puts on the Souls of men, That the
Impression corresponds and answers to the
Seal, (as hath been said), the inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
to the outward Revelation of
Gods will; And so we find the matter is:
For as Divine Precepts require this should be
the temper of mens spirits, so the very things
that compose and make up that blessed temper,
are said to be the fruits of his own Spirit;
<hi>The fruit of the Spirit is peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, meekness,</hi> &amp;c. And again,
<hi>The fruit of the spirit is in all goodness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and truth.</hi> Now hath not that Soul
a spring of pleasure within it self, that is in
these respects as God would have it be? That
is conscious to it self of nothing but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
goodness, benignity, candor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32156:47"/>
any man, and is in all things acted by
a spirit of love,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that suffereth long, and is kind,
that envieth not, that vaunteth not it self, is
not puffed up, doth not behave it self unseemly,
seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in the truth, that beareth all things, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things, and never faileth.</hi> That so equally
poises and acts a mans spirit, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
seemly and sutably towards all men,
<hi>takes pleasure in the best, in the Saints and
excellent ones of the earth hath all his delight;</hi>
and is no worse affected, than to wish them
better, <hi>even towards the very worst;</hi> neither
envies the greatest, nor despises the meanest;
neither is revengeful towards them that injure
him, nor unthankful to them that oblige him;
that is apt to learn of good men, and to
teach the bad, by observing and giving the
most imitable example; That is not unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to superiors, nor morose and unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
towards equals; That lives not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
Is a common good to all within the
sphere through which his activity can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it self; That doth good with inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from the steady propension of his own
will, and an implanted principle of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It is evident, God hath formed such
a mans spirit unto delight of the purest kind,
and the best sort of pleasure; unto which
they who are strangers, banish it from their
own breasts, by the resistance and grief they
give his blessed Spirit, thereby making it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32156:48"/>
a stranger there; And by harbouring in their
own bosoms their own tormentors, the pride,
the wrath, the envy, the malice, the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
the bitterness of spirit, which as they
render them uneasie and intolerable to all
that are about them, so most of all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
And which while they prey wherever
they range abroad, yet still bite most keenly
and tormentingly that heart it self wherein
they are bred; as poysonous Vipers gnawing
the bowels which inclose them.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Towards themselves;</hi> which also may be
considered distinctly; For though all the
good qualifications we can mention or think
of, do <hi>redound to a mans self,</hi> and turn to
his own advantage, repose and delight, (which
it is the design of all this discourse to shew),
yet there are some that <hi>more directly terminate</hi>
on a mans self, wherein the rectitude we now
speak of doth in great part consist: When
we are obliged to love others as our selves,
it supposes not only an allowable, but a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
self-love. <hi>Men shall praise thee when
thou dost well to thy self.</hi> Before this <hi>right
spirit</hi> be renewed in a man, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wound himself, by blows that are reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him, and hurt at the rebound, but by
many a <hi>direct</hi> stroke; or he lets the wounds
fester and corrupt, to the cure whereof he
should with all diligence <hi>directly</hi> apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
How unpropitious and cruel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are all unholy persons! What wastes
and desolations do they commit and make
in their own Souls, by breaking the order
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32156:48"/>
God and Nature did at first set and establish
there? Dethroning their own reason and
judgment, which ought to bear sway and
govern within them. This banishes delight,
and drives it far away from them? They
see what is fittest for them to do and seek,
and run a quite counter-course. What storms
do they hereby raise in their own bosoms!
What a torture is it, when a mans own light
and knowledg bears a standing testimony
against him, and holds him under a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
doom!</p>
               <p>How ill-dispos'd are men towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they wholly neglect themselves
in one kind, when they too much mind and
seek themselves in another; when they too
little understand themselves, so as not to put
a true value on themselves, but do either <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem
themselves,</hi> as to their more noble part,
in respect of that <hi>common excellency</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them with all other men; or do
<hi>over-magnifie themselves,</hi> and are conceited and
too well opinion'd of themselves, in respect
of any <hi>peculiar excellency</hi> wherein they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they out-strip others? How ill do they
treat themselves in their <hi>self-indulgence,</hi> their
gratifying their own sensual inclination, with
the greatest danger and damage to their
Souls? When they care not at what expence
they make provision for the flesh, to fulfil
the lusts thereof? What unkind usage do
they find at their own hands, when they
cherish and countenance desires which they
cannot gratifie, and raise to themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32156:49"/>
of things not within their own
power, which being disappointed turn into
so many furies, and in that shape take a sharp
revenge upon their own hearts? when they
exercise no authority and dominion over
themselves, preserve not the liberty due to
what should both be it self free, and should
command the rest in them; Inslave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to vile and ignominious lusts and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
put out their own eyes, and grind blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to the basest and most tyrannical Lords,
their own sordid humours and base, mean appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites;
when though they serve more rigorous
task-masters than the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> did,
and are more sorely beaten by them when
their tale is not fulfill'd for want of materials,
yet groan not because of their hard bondage,
nor affect liberty?</p>
               <p>This gracious communication from God,
sets all things in a good degree right within;
So that where there was nothing before, but
horrid and hellish darkness, disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
there now shines a mild, pleasant, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
light, that infers regularity, purity, &amp; peace.</p>
               <p>How great is the pleasure that arises from
<hi>self-denial</hi> (wherein we do, <hi>duly</hi> and <hi>as we
ought,</hi> deny our selves); not only as it is an
act of duty towards God (of which before,)
but as it is an act of justice and mercy towards
our own souls! That is, wherein we make a
just and <hi>true estimate</hi> of our selves, do esteem
basely of our selves; wherein we are <hi>really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
base and vile:</hi> And wherein there is any
thing of real value and excellency in our own
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32156:49"/>
beings, we value it only upon that account,
and in that subordination wherein it is truly
valuable!</p>
               <p>How pleasant, when we have learned to
forsake and abandon our selves, when we are
not apt to magnifie and applaud, to trust or
love, to seek &amp; serve our selves <hi>unduly</hi> and are
only inclin'd to own, to cleave and stick to our
selves, wherein and so far as we ought! when
that Idol <hi>Self</hi> is no longer maintained within
us, at the dear expence of our peace, comfort,
safety, and eternal hope; An Idol that ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the whole substance of our Souls, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
and devour'd the strength and vigour
of our spirits, which it doth not maintain, and
cannot repair; which consumes our time,
which keeps all our powers and faculties in a
continual exercise and hurry, to make a costly,
a vain, an unlawful provision for it! How
great is the ease and pleasure which we feel,
in being delivered from that soul-wasting
Monster, that was sed and sustain'd at a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
rate, and with more costly sacrifices and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasts
then can be paralleld by either sacred or
other History; That hath made more desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the <hi>souls</hi> of men, then ever was made in
their Towns &amp; Cities where Idols were served
by only humane sacrifices, or monstrous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
satiated with only such refections; Or
where the lives &amp; safety of the most were to be
bought out by the constant successive tribute
of the blood of not a few! That hath devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more, and preyed more cruelly upon human
lives than <hi>Molech,</hi> or the <hi>Minotaure;</hi> When this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32156:50"/>
monstrous Idol is destroy'd &amp; trodden down,
what a Jubilee doth it make, what songs of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
and praise doth it furnish and supply to
the poor soul, now deliver'd &amp; redeem'd from
death and bondage. How much more easie and
reasonable a service is it (when once the grace
of God and their own experience give men to
understand it,) to study to please him than
themselves? when they feel themselves dead to
their former Lord and service,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and only alive to
God through Jesus Christ!</hi> when <hi>Sin no longer
reigns in their mortal bodies, that they should
obey it in the lusts thereof;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 13.</note> when they <hi>no more
yield their members as instruments of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

When <hi>being made free from sin,</hi>

                  <hi>they are become

                  <hi>The law of the spirit of
life in Christ Jesus having made me free from the
law of sin!</hi> What an ease is it to the spirit of a
man, when he hath not himself to seek &amp; serve
and care for in any unlawful disallowed sense,
when he finds not himself necessitated or
urged by his own imperious fleshly inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so to do; when he perceives himself by a
prevailing better principle counterpoys'd, and
the weight and byass of his own Spirit inclines
him quite another way; when he finds he hath
nothing left him to do, but to serve God, to
know his will and do it; &amp; is disburdened of
all unnecessary care for himself; That which is
necessary being part of his duty, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
done on purpose only for God: and that
which is unnecessary and forbidden (which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32156:50"/>
part only was burdensome) being supplied by
(what hath the greatest ease and pleasure in
it imaginable) <hi>trust</hi> and self-<hi>resignation</hi> to his
pleasure and will whose we wholly are? what
life is pleasant, if this be not! Surely wherein
it is attain'd to, it is most pleasant; and hither
this gracious heart-rectifying communication
is gradually tending.</p>
               <p>How great is the pleasure that arises from
<hi>Self-government!</hi> When that governs in us
which should govern, and that is subject and
obeys which should obey; when a mans mind
is competently furnished with directive
practical principles, and his heart is so fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it is capable of being prescribed to, is
patient of restraints and direction, easily obeys
the reign and follows the ducture of an inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
well-instructed mind; when the order
is maintained between the superior faculties
and the inferior, and there are no contentious
murmurs of ungovernable appetitions and
passions against the law of the mind: Tis
true, that where this holy rectitude doth but
in a degree take place, there will be many
conflicts, but those conflicts are in order to
victory; and how joyful and glorious is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
upon that victory! when the soul enters
upon its <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, its thanksgiving song, <hi>I
thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord!</hi> how
happy a state is that (wherein at some times
it is here attained) when there are now no
tumults within! <hi>The wicked</hi> (which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
import of their name) <hi>are as troubled sea,
that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32156:51"/>
dirt.</hi> Here is no governing principle in any
power; no Scepter, no Trident to check and
allay the rage of those waters. But when his
power goes forth in the soul, whose very
word Winds and Seas obey, how peaceful
and pleasant a calm doth ensue!</p>
               <p>Now is a man <hi>restor'd to himself,</hi> and is again
in his right mind. He is truly now said to
<hi>enjoy himself,</hi> and upon the best terms; that
is, he enjoys himself in and under God. He
is (in a due subordination) master of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
He possesses his own Soul; That one
piece of holy rectitude <hi>[patience]</hi> inables him
to do so.<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>In your patience possess ye your Souls.</hi>
Patience is a part of Fortitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an <hi>ability to
suffer;</hi> He that is in this respect impotent of
himself, not able to suffer, is a perfect slave;
not a slave only to the vicious wills and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of other men, in whose power he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
it is to befriend or hurt him; but
<hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> to his own; he is not master
of his own judgment, reason, and conscience;
but he prostitutes all in the first place, to his
own inordinate self-love, his avarice, his fear,
and consequently to the pleasure of other men,
(which upon no other terms and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is base and vile towards any man,
were the <hi>matter in it self</hi> never so right, and
the obedience as <hi>due to them</hi> as can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed),
whereas <hi>if he could suffer,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his mastery over himself, and were,
under God, within his own power. Upon
this,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 11.</note> with other grounds, is <hi>joyfulness</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of <hi>patience;</hi> How much more is it so
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32156:51"/>
                  <hi>(if to this one part) to the whole frame</hi> of
that holy rectitude whereby a mans spirit is
compos'd to a due order within it self; When
there is an universal sobriety (or soundness
of mind, as the word that uses to express
sobriety signifies), a continency and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ones self; and the Soul is no longer
hurried to and fro, and even outed of it self,
by <hi>undue</hi> desires, fears, angers, sorrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
nor vext by the absence of and its perverse
ineptitude and indisposition to those which it
well knows are <hi>due;</hi> When it finds it self at
liberty from the exactions of an unsubdued
flesh, and for the kindly and genuine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and exercises of the divine life. When
it is in good measure freed from the rackings
and tortures that naturally accompany the
habitual contrariety of an ungovernable
heart to a convinced judgment and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
And is no longer held in pain, by such
continual self-upbraidings; <hi>Thou art, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
to be, what thou knowest thou shouldst not;
and neither art, nor do'st, nor canst desire or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be, or do, what thou very well knowest
thou should'st.</hi> In that case the soul is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disjointed, and continually grating upon
it self. And the ease and pleasure which it
finds by this happy change much resembles
that which a mans body, being in such a case,
feels, when every dislocated bone is brought
back and well-settled in its own proper place
and order again. How resentingly doth the
Psalmist acknowledg divine goodness in this!
<hi>He restoreth my Soul:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 23. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and leadeth me in paths
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32156:52"/>
of righteousness, for his names sake; q. d.</hi> Now
I can walk and act as a sound man, and the
paths of righteousness are become pleasant
and delectable to me, which before I decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or wherein my halt and maimed Soul
was unable to move a step. Now is <hi>heard
the voice of joy and gladness when the bones
which were disordered and broken rejoyce.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>
               </p>
               <p>How great is the joy and pleasure of <hi>self-activity!</hi>
when the Soul is not moved by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
improper motives, but finds it self to
move freely from an implanted principle of
life, that acts it forward in right and plain
paths; when it doth, with its own full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
what it is convinced it ought without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forcibly drag'd or violently impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and is (not a weak, ineffectual, or
only self-judging, but) a powerful governing
vital Law to it self.</p>
               <p>How great pleasure arises from a constant
diligent <hi>self-inspection!</hi> when a mans spirit
dwels within it self, resides at home, seeks not
it self abroad; remains within its own
bounds, is intent upon it self; watches over
its own motions as its proper charge; is formed
to a compliance with that Precept,<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Keep thy
heart with all diligence.</hi> And upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
as seriously weighing that <hi>thence
are the issues of life,</hi> all vital acts and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever will savour of the root and
principle from whence they proceed, and be
as the heart is; good and pure if that be so;
if otherwise, corrupt and naught. To have a
spirit habituated to the business of its own
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32156:52"/>
Province and Territory; Its eyes, not with
the fool's in the ends of the earth, but turned
inward upon it self. Hence his own vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
is best kept; when the sluggard's (that
neglects himself) is wholly over-run with
thorns and briars, that cover the face thereof.
How forlorn and comfortless a spectacle hath
such a man of his own Soul! The horror
whereof is only avoided by (the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
course of) turning off his eye; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
how ill entertainment is there to be
met with. Therefore are such, strangers at
home; and are afraid to converse with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
are better acquainted with the affairs
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> or at least of this and
that and the other neighbour, than those of
their own Souls. And the more things at
home are neglected the worse they grow. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and desolation come upon them as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
man;</hi> that (in this case) wasts and
makes havock without resistance.</p>
               <p>And herein lies much of the heart-rectifying
work and power of grace, in disposing and
setting the heart so far right towards it self, as
that it may first have the <hi>patience</hi> to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and then the <hi>pleasure</hi> which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
arise, most naturally, thence. The
great aversion hereto of misgiving hearts is
not otherwise overcome. But when it is;
How do all things flourish under such a ones
careful, self-reflecting eye! That Soul is as
a watered garden. Thither it can invite his
presence who is altogether made up of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
to come and eat his pleasant fruits.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32156:53"/>
And now, retirement and solitude become
delectable: And a man delightfully associates
with himself; singles out himself to be his own
companion, as finding <hi>another</hi> always stepping
in; so that he is never less alone than when
alone. How unspeakable an happiness is this,
when the great Mediator that undertook to
reconcile God to the Soul, shall thus have also
reconciled it to it self! When it shall be
considered, how dreadful the case is, when a
mans wickedness hath transformed him into
a <hi>Magor-Missabib,</hi> compass'd him with affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
made him a <hi>terror to himself:</hi> It may
then be understood how grateful a change it
is when he is reform'd into a <hi>son of peace,</hi> and
made a delight to himself; when he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
himself, and refresh his tired eye, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with beholding the sad things that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verywhere
come in view from a world lost in
wickedness, by looking into Gods own Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
within himself; and considering it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that notion only, he doth not look upon
<hi>himself</hi> with an eye of <hi>pride;</hi> as he doth
not upon <hi>others</hi> with that of <hi>disdain.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
with a sort of self-complacency what
God hath wrought and done there, not with
self-arrogance; as knowing there is a <hi>self</hi>
too, upon which he hath still reason to look
with abhorrence and self-loathing. And
though there be now incorporated with him
a <hi>better self,</hi> yet that was not of himself. He
well understands who made him differ, not
only from others but from himself; and put
him into that capacity of saying that <hi>I am not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32156:53"/>
I,</hi> I am not who or what I was before. And
the more he is used to such self-reflection, the
more pleasant it becomes to him; That is, if
he confine not his eye too much, to the dark
side of his own Soul; and do look to the
more lightsome side with that remembrance
(as before) that whatsoever he is, that is good
and grateful to behold, he is by grace. He
thus grows familiar with himself, and the
sight mends as it is oftener beheld; and
while it is not observed always to do so. Yea,
though things look many times sadly and
sometimes dubiously; that however, doth
but occasion the accomplishment of a more
diligent search, which engages to more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
labour and strugglings with God and
with himself, which labour is recompenced
with a following fruit and pleasure: Yea,
and God is invocated not only for redress,
but for further search; when such fear lest
they have been too indulgent and partial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
themselves, and lest they have not
made so strict a scrutiny as the case may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
require; then the request is, <hi>Search and
try me, O Lord, see if there be any way of
wickedness in me.</hi> And here the sincerity
which appears in that self-suspicion, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
over their own Souls, is not
without its grateful relishes, and a secret
delight insinuates and mingles with the
appeals which such a Soul makes to Him,
whose eye is a flame of fire, searches hearts
and tries reins. And it is some pleasure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to find that disposition in their own
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32156:54"/>
Souls, that they are throughly willing to know
themselves, and desire not to shun and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the search of that fiery flaming eye.</p>
               <p>Thus then upon all accounts this divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
is delectable, as it tends to rectifie
mens dispositions <hi>towards themselves,</hi> and to set
them right in their inclinations and posture in
reference to <hi>their own Souls.</hi> We may add,</p>
               <p>4. It contributes much to the matter of
delight, <hi>as it sets mens spirits right in their
dispositions towards this and the other world;</hi>
the present and future state of things. How
great a work is necessary to be done in this
respect, wherein things are so monstrously
out of course; and men become thereby
not strangers only to true delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but even uncapable of any such relishes
till the matter be redrest! How vitiated and
unexercised are mens senses as to these things,
and unable to discern between good and
evil! Their <hi>grosser sense</hi> is utterly <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
and a <hi>spiritual more refin'd sense</hi> is <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
Therefore do they judg, and chuse, and
love, and pursue only as that most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
and injudicious principle doth direct,
<hi>That</hi> is appeal'd to in all cases: All their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are taken from thence; and <hi>that</hi> only
is called <hi>good,</hi> which to their sensual imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tinctur'd by the earthliness and carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their hearts, appears so; <hi>that evil,</hi> of
which the same principle doth so pronounce;
according hereto is the whole bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ion
of their Souls. And they are only
in<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>'d and govern'd by the powers of this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32156:54"/>
sensible world; this present evil world, the
fashion whereof (yea it and the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
together) are passing away. And the
things of the world to come have no power
with them; no motives from thence signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any thing. They are only steer'd in their
whole course by the apprehension they have
of advantages or disadvantages in reference
to their present secular concernments. They
love this world, and the things of this world;
mind earthly things, and are not startled when
they are so plainly told, that men of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<hi>have not the love of the Father in them,</hi>
and <hi>are enemies to the cross of Christ,</hi> and that
<hi>their end will be destruction.</hi> 'Tis a death to
them to think of dying; not from the fear
of what may ensue (they have Atheism enough
to stifle such fear), but from the love of their
earthly stations, and that vile earthly body in
which they dwell.</p>
               <p>But how delightful a thing is the change
which this rectifying communication makes!
How pleasant to live in this world as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
and Stranger, seeking still the better, the
heavenly Country! To behold the various
inticements which are here offered to view
at, sometimes without inclination towards
them; the frightful aspect and appearance of
things at other times without commotion; Is
not this delectable? To dwell apart from this
world in the midst of it;<note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> In the secret of the
Almighty, under his pavilion, as one of his
hidden ones,<note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> with-drawn from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of this world to his own communion;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32156:55"/>
so severed and cut off from this world, as
not to partake in the spirit of it, or be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby; but by another, a greater and
more mighty, as well as a purer and more
holy Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Greater is he that is in you, than
he that is in the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> And again, <hi>We have
received not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit which is of God, that we might know the
things which are freely given to us of God.</hi> Which
things the divine Spirit disposes the Soul to,
and unites it with, when it disinclines and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
it from this world and the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and thereby discovers this Soul to be
quite of another <hi>community</hi> from that of this
world, <hi>viz.</hi> of an <hi>heavenly community,</hi> unto
which those better and more excellent things
do ly in common, as their portion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
What matter of Joy and Glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is it,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> when one is crucified to this world,
and this world to him; when the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to him a crucified thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
hateful, detestable thing, (which is one
notion of <hi>crucify'd),</hi> such a thing as he can
despise and hate; which he is as little apt to
be fond of, as one would be of a loathsom
carcase hanging upon an ignominious Cross.
And when he can feel himself crucified towards
it, <hi>i. e.</hi> dead (another notion of it), disinclin'd,
without sense, breath, pulse, motion, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
not so dead as to be without any kind
of life, but without that base, low, sordid
kind of life by which he <hi>lived to it,</hi> and in
its converses and embraces. So much of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation
doth this infer, as even to endear
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32156:55"/>
the very cross it self (that hateful horrid
thing) by which it is effected. But that
carries a farther signification with it, to be
fetcht more expresly from other Scriptures;
The cross is it self render'd amiable, and a
thing to be gloried in, to be lookt on with
delight and pleasure, upon the account of
the design and end of that Tragedy which
was acted thereon; within which design
(being executed and accomplished) this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
effect is included. We elsewhere find the
Apostle expressing his vehement desire <hi>to
know Christ and the power of his resurrection,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note>
                  <hi>and</hi> (in order thereto) <hi>the fellowship of his
sufferings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>being made conformable to his death.</hi>
But what did he lastly aim at in this? The
next words more fully speak out (what he
first mentioned) <hi>the power of his resurrection</hi>
to be the thing chiefly in his eye, and that he
desired (what he adds) <hi>the fellowship of his
sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. as a means unto that end, though
it seem'd a sharp and painful means; <hi>If by
any means I might attain the resurrection of
the dead;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>q. d.</hi> I care not what I undergo,
not the sufferings even of a painful crucifixion
it self, or that my worldly earthly Self do
suffer conformably to the sufferings of my
crucify'd Lord; I matter not by what so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
method the thing be brought about, if
by any means it may be brought about, that
I may know <hi>the power of his resurrection</hi> so
feelingly, as to attain also <hi>the resurrection of
the dead.</hi> And what was that? No doubt to
attain a state (which he confesses he had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32156:56"/>
not yet perfectly attain'd, but was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of) sutable to his relation and union with
a risen Jesus; Union with him supposes a
being risen with him; <hi>If ye then be risen with
Christ—.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 3.</note> It is taken as a granted thing, that
they that are his are risen with him. And
what state and temper of spirit would be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to that supposition? The next words
shew, <hi>Seek those things that are above, where
Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set
your affection</hi> (or mind) <hi>on the things above,
not on the things on the earth.</hi> Then follows
the method in which they were brought to
the capacity of doing so; <hi>For ye are dead.</hi>
Their professed relation to Christ did suppose
them risen, and did therefore first suppose
them dead. Now if they would do sutably
to what their profession imported, this was
it they had to do; To abstract their minds
and hearts from the things of this earth, and
place them upon the things of an higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And (as its afterwards expressed in this
same context which we were considering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<hi>to have our conversation</hi> (or Citizenship)
<hi>in heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>whence we look for the Saviour, &amp;c.</hi>
That is, as our chief interests and priviledges
are above, to have our thoughts and the
powers of our Souls chiefly exercised upon
that blessed and glorious state, which state
is <hi>the prize</hi> (mentioned above) <hi>of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> It being the
scope and import of his Call unto us, and the
very design of his sufferings on the Cross, to
draw up a people from earth to heaven;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32156:56"/>
whence therefore they that under this Call
do still <hi>mind earthly things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 18. 19.</note> are said to be
<hi>enemies to the Cross of Christ;</hi> the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity
whereof the Apostle even resents
with tears as he there testifies. And it was
in this, that he was for his part so willing to
comply with the design of the Cross, that he
made no difficulty to endure all the <hi>hardship
and dolour of it,</hi> that he might attain this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
fruit and gain which he reckoned should
accrew to him from it; even <hi>more of a rais'd
heavenly mind,</hi> which signify'd it to be <hi>strongly</hi>
bent that way already; when no mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were reckoned too severe to be undergone
in order thereto. And here therefore this,
<hi>soul-rectifying influence</hi> must be understood to
have been proportionably strong.</p>
               <p>Hence also it was that we find him groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as one under a pressure or heavy weight
to be cloath'd upon with the heavenly house:
<hi>and to have mortality swallowed up of life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God had <hi>wrought him to this self-same
thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 4.</note> so bent and determined his spirit was
towards the blessedness of the future state
(which seems the most natural contexture of
discourse here,<note place="margin">v. 5.</note> though some others have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it otherwise) as that, though he
could bear patiently the delay, he could not
but desire most earnestly to be there.</p>
               <p>And we see how the temper of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians was, as to this, and the other
world, in those days when the Spirit was
plentifully poured out.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>They took joyfully the
spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32156:57"/>
they had in Heaven a far better and an enduring
substance.</hi> Heaven signified much with them,
and this world very little. <hi>They looked not to
the things that were seen and temporal, but to
the things unseen and eternal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> As those
former Worthies did, whose minds and
hearts, being set right by that faith, which is
<hi>the substance of the things hoped for,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not seen.</hi> They lived as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and strangers on earth, despised the
pleasures, riches and honours of it. Endured
all manner of hardships and tortures in it, not
accepting deliverance, because they were
taken up in the pursuit of the better Country;
had respect to the recompence of reward;
and expected a part in the better Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>And is it not a delightful thing to the spirit
of a man when he is sensibly disintangled, and
at liberty from the cares, desires, griefs and
fears that were wont to enwrap his heart?
when he finds his weights and clogs faln off,
that deprest him, the bonds and snares loosed
which bound him down to this earth; and
feels himself ascending and moving upwards;
out of that darkness, stupidity and death that
possessed his Soul, into that upper region of
light, purity and peace, unto which his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is still gradually more and more connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallized
day by day? When Heaven in respect
of the pure holiness, the calm serenity, the rest
and blessedness of it, is now grown familiar
to him, and his very element?</p>
               <p>We see then, that in all these mentioned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32156:57"/>
respects this gracious communication, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
it is rectifying, and tends to settle the Soul
in that frame <hi>which it ought to be in,</hi> and which
is most proper and natural to it; <hi>therein</hi> it is
also most delightful, and carries highest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of pleasure in it.</p>
               <p>It is upon the whole (that we may sum up
the account, of this divine communication
in the following characters of it);</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Generative,</hi> and begets the Soul to a
new, a divine life; makes it of a sluggish,
stupid dead thing (as it was towards all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and divine matters) living and spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
full of active life and vigour. Life we
say is sweet, it is in it self a pleasant thing.
This mean, bodily life it self is so; if we do but
consider it, and allow our selves to taste and
enjoy the pleasure of it. As for instance,
that this and that limb and member is not
a dead lump, that we feel life freshly sprouting
and springing in every part, is not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsom?
How much more the life of the
Soul! especially this so excellent and sublime
kind of life!</p>
               <p>And it is the radical principle of all other
(consequent) pleasure, that by which we
are capable thereof; every thing is sapless and
without savour to the dead. How pleasant
operations and fruitions doth the divine life
render a person capable of!</p>
               <p>2. It is <hi>Nutritive.</hi> Souls are nourished by
the same thing by which they are begotten,
by the same divine influence. As a generative
vertue is wont to be attributed to the Sun, so it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32156:58"/>
cherishes also its own productions. The beams
of that <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> make them that fear
God grow up as calves in the stall,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> fill them
with marrow and fatness, cause them to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
as the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> And is not that
delightsome to be increased daily with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
of God? fed with heavenly hidden
Manna, Angels food; and thereby (though
we need not here speak distinctly of these)
to receive at once both nourishment and
growth?</p>
               <p>3. It is <hi>Sanative,</hi> and virtually contains
all the fruits in it which are for the healing
of the Nations; when the Soul grows distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
it restores it, and is both sustaining
and remedying to it. How great is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of health and soundness! of ease to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
bones! of relief to a sick and fainting
heart! so it is often (for in the present
state the cure is not perfect and relapses
are frequent) with the Soul in which the
life of God hath begun to settle and diffuse it
self, till his influence repair and renew it;
And when it doth so, how pleasant is it to
find an heart made sound in his statutes!
and to perceive a-new working in it the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of love,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> power and a <hi>sound mind!</hi> So
pleasant that it occasions a triumph (even
when the outward man is perishing) if it be
found that the inward is renewed day by
day.</p>
               <p>4. It is <hi>Corroborative</hi> and strengthening;
confirms resolutions, and establishes the heart.
Hereby they who have felt this quickening,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32156:58"/>
cherishing, healing vertue are also strengthen'd
with might (<hi>viz.</hi> by the Spirit) in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man; so that they hold on their way,
and being of clean hands,<note place="margin">Job 17. 9.</note> grow stronger and
stronger. They go from strength to strength;
and do not so much spend,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> as increase it by
going forward. For the way it self of the
Lord <hi>is strength to the upright.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 10.</note> He provides
that fresh recruits shall still spring up to them
in their way. For all their supplies are of
him, and are acknowledged to be so; In as
much as by <hi>waiting upon the Lord they renew
strength</hi> and mount up with wings as Eagles,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.</note>
run without weariness, and walk without
fainting. And this increasing strength can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without a proportionably increasing
delight. How pleasantly doth the strong
man rejoyce to run his race! and enterprize
even difficult and hazardous things! By <hi>this
strength</hi> doth the regenerate man perform the
ordinary duties belonging to his holy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
by it he encounters difficulties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
and conquers enemies, bears heavy
and afflicting pressures, and none of these
without some intermingled pleasure. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>that exercise</hi> of this strength which is
likely to be least accompanied with pleasure,
<hi>the suffering of sharp and smarting afflictions,</hi>
hath many times much of this grateful mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and can only be expected to have it in
this way of gracious communication, as the
depending sufferers shall be strengthened with
all might according to the glorious power of
God,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 11.</note> unto all patience and long-suffering
<hi>with joyfulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:32156:59"/>
God is therefore to be enjoy'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in by this delectable communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intervening, by which he now frames the
Soul according to his own Image, and gives
an heart after his own heart, that is, <hi>such as
is sutable to him,</hi> and <hi>as he would have it be.</hi>
And this way only is any one in a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to delight in God, <hi>by having a good frame
of Spirit communicated to him,</hi> and in wrought
in him; I mean never without this, and in
a great measure by it. Then is he in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
state, when God hath by his own Spirit
<hi>made him</hi> what by his Word he <hi>requires him</hi>
to be. Now is he compos'd to delights and
blessedness, being by the same workmanship
created in Christ Jesus both to <hi>good works</hi>
and to the <hi>best of enjoyments.</hi> How happy is
that Soul in whom the true matter of delight
is become an <hi>implanted thing!</hi> that is what
it should be, and should be nothing (such is
the constitution of Gospel-Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts)
but what most truly makes for its
own content, delight, and rest! whose own
temper is now in some sort become to it both
a <hi>law</hi> and a <hi>reward!</hi> Surely this is one great
part of what an enlightened apprehensive
Soul would most earnestly desire and crave,
or would be the genuine breathings of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
gracious heart. O that I were more like
God! more perfectly framed according to
his holy will! And must therefore be, in great
part, a thing apt to afford it delight and
rest; as hath been already inculcated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:32156:59"/>
But yet this natural consequence is little
understood. And the common ignorance or
inadvertency of this, hath made it necessary
to insist the more largely (though but little
have been said in respect of what might)
on this part of the delectable communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein God offers himself to his peoples
enjoyment. For from the not-knowing, or
not-considering of this way of enjoying him,
this twofold mistake (the one of very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
the other of uncomfortable importance
and tendency) hath arisen.</p>
               <p>1. That some have thought they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
God when they have not; having only
had their imaginations somewhat gratified,
by certain, either false or ineffectual notions
of him. In which they have rested, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the sum of their Religion and Happiness.
Never aiming, in the mean time, to have their
spirits reformed according to that pure and
holy Image and <hi>Exemplar</hi> which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in the Gospel of his Son; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
whereof, is, <hi>Christ formed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That others have thought they have
not enjoyed God when they have; supposing
there was no enjoyment of him, but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the rapturous transporting appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
and perswasion of his <hi>particular love
to them;</hi> and sleightly overlooking all that
work he hath wrought in their Souls, as if
it were nothing to be accounted of, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
themselves to reflect on any thing in
themselves, but what was still amiss; and
vainly seeking with much anxiety and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32156:60"/>
what they have, while they will not
take notice that they have it, nor apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to improve the already implanted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
that are, <hi>in themselves,</hi> apt to yield fruits
of so pleasant relish.</p>
               <p>It was upon this account requisite to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and labour somewhat to magnifie the
<hi>intrinsecal delightfulness of Religion it self;</hi>
and to put the more of note and remark upon
a <hi>well-tempered spirit,</hi> even in point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectableness
and the matter of pleasure it hath
in it, by how much it is with too many, on
one account or another, a neglect<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d thing.</p>
               <p>There is only somewhat of doubt, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
that may possibly lie in the minds of
some against the scope and drift of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
which it will be needful we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remove before we proceed to what is
further contained in this <hi>gracious communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
As,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>It may be said,</hi> Doth not all this tend
to bring us, instead of delighting in God, to
delight in our selves? To make us become our
own center and rest? And how can the relishable
sweetness of gracious principles and dispositions
signifie Gods being to be enjoyed or delighted in?
<hi>For what, are these things God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I only say: 1. That such <hi>holy
dispositions</hi> as they are not <hi>God,</hi> so nor are
<hi>they,</hi> in strictness of speech, <hi>our selves.</hi> And
how absurd were it, to call every thing <hi>our
selves</hi> that is <hi>in us!</hi> And how self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
then were the very objection! for
that would make <hi>delighting in God</hi> and in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32156:60"/>
                  <hi>our selves</hi> directly all one; and so the fault
which it causlesly pretends to find, it would
really commit. 'Tis true, that improperly
<hi>holy dispositions</hi> are said to make up <hi>another
self</hi> in us, a <hi>new man,</hi> according as <hi>corrupt</hi>
and <hi>sinful principles</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi> do make
also a <hi>self,</hi> the <hi>old man.</hi> But then it is also
to be remembered, that with no greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
they are capable of bearing the
name of <hi>God;</hi> as the image of any thing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
doth the name of the thing which it
represents, or the <hi>work</hi> of its <hi>Author:</hi> And
they are expresly called, <hi>Christ formed in us;</hi>
and is not the God? They are called <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
for when we are caution'd not to <hi>quench
the Spirit,</hi> how can that be understood of
the eternal uncreated <hi>Spirit</hi> himself? And the
very thing produced (not meerly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
influence) in the work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is expresly called by that name (as it
is no such strange thing for the effect to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the name of its cause);<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That which is born
of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> There is Spirit beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and Spirit begotten. And the Spirit
begotten, as it must be distinguished from its
<hi>cause,</hi> the Spirit of God; so it must from
the <hi>subject</hi> wherein the effect is wrought,
<hi>our own Spirits;</hi> For they sure are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
by the regenerating work. Yea, and
when God is said <hi>to dwell in them that dwell
in love,</hi> and that are <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>contrite;</hi>
somewhat else is thereby signify'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
there, than the meer <hi>being</hi> of God;
for otherwise the priviledg of such were no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32156:61"/>
greater than of all other men and things. And
what else is it, but somewhat communicated
and imparted immediately from God to such?
(else how by <hi>dwelling in love,</hi> do they <hi>dwell
in God?)</hi> which because <hi>dwelling</hi> imports <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency,</hi>
cannot be a transient influence only,
but some settled abiding effect, a consistent
frame and temper of Spirit, maintained by
his continually renewed influence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would be very unreasonably said, that
the representing this as delectable is a calling
us off from God to delight in our selves.
For if this communication be not it self, in
strict propriety, <hi>God,</hi> it were as great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
to say it were <hi>our selves.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>2. It hath a great deal more affinity with
God than with us. <hi>We</hi> are, its true, the
<hi>subjects</hi> of it; but it is <hi>his immediate producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and very <hi>likeness,</hi> a Divine nature, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
thing. Therefore if here our delight
were to terminate, it were more proper to
call it delighting in God than in our selves.
But,</p>
               <p>3. It is neither said nor meant, that here
our delight is to terminate; but that <hi>hereby</hi>
we are to delight <hi>in God,</hi> and so that our
delight is to <hi>terminate in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. When we are said to <hi>enjoy God,</hi> I inquire,
<hi>Is any thing communicated to us, or no?</hi> If not,
we have no enjoyment; If any thing be, what
is it? Gods Essence? That's impossible and
horrid to think, as hath been said. And we
need not repeat, that when we can tell what
it is to enjoy a Friend, without partaking his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32156:61"/>
essence, whose communications are so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more remote, mediate, resistible; It
is less difficult to conceive, how God is to
be enjoy'd by his communications.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It may be again said;</hi> But if God be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
thus to be delighted in, how can delighting in
him be upon such terms our duty? For is it our
duty that he communicate himself in this way
to us?</p>
               <p>Let any that object thus, only study the
meaning of those Precepts; <hi>Keep your selves
in the love of God. Continue in his goodness. Be
ye fill'd with the Spirit. Walk in the Spirit.</hi>
And if they can think them to signifie any
thing, they will not be to seek for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But to this more hereafter; when
from the delightful object, we come to treat
of actual delighting in it.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>But some may say,</hi> It were indeed to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
acknowledged, that such a temper of spirit once
communicated, were indeed very delightful;
But where is it to be found? And to state the
matter of delight so much in what is to be sought
in our selves, is to reduce the whole business of
delighting in God, to an impossibility, or to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
So little appearing of this temper, and
so much of the contrary, as gives much cause of
doubt, whether there be any thing to be rejoiced
in or no. And what then? Are we to suspend
the exercise of this duty till we have gotten the
difficult case resolved? <hi>(which may be all
our time).</hi> [Is there a real thorough work of
God upon my Soul or no?] For how can I
rejoice in that whereof I have yet a doubt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32156:62"/>
whether it be what it seems or no?</p>
               <p>I answer, 1. It is plain, they that really
have nothing of this communication from
God, cannot take delight in it (otherwise
than as hoped for). But,</p>
               <p>2. Would we therefore have such to please
themselves and be satisfied without it; and
delight in their distance and estrangement
from God; and while there is no intercourse
between him and them? And shall this be
called too <hi>delighting in God?</hi> Surely somewhat
else than <hi>delight</hi> belongs to their states.</p>
               <p>3. But for such as <hi>really have it,</hi> That which
hath been designed to be evinced, is, that it is
<hi>delectable in it self;</hi> and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without any taste or relish of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
therein; while yet some doubt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sincerity and truth thereof doth yet
remain: Though such doubt (but more
their imperfect reception of this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and neglect to look after further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it) cannot but render their delight
comparatively little.</p>
               <p>Nor hath it been designed to speak hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
of what delight the regenerate in this
way <hi>actually have,</hi> but what they <hi>may have;</hi>
and what <hi>matter of delight</hi> Gods heart-recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
communication doth <hi>in the nature of
it</hi> contain; that is, <hi>supposing</hi> it were impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and received, so as actually to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Soul according to the Gospel-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if it were so in a more eminent
measure and degree, it were then <hi>in it self</hi>
so delectable, as without the assurance of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32156:62"/>
our future safe and happy state (though <hi>that,</hi>
in that case, is not likely to be in a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
degree wanting), that is, not <hi>by it only,</hi>
but <hi>by it self,</hi> without the present constant
necessary concurrence thereof, to afford un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
pleasure to that Soul in which it
hath place. So that the getting of assurance
is not the <hi>only thing</hi> to be done in order to
a persons <hi>delighting in God;</hi> (of which more
hereafter is intended to be said in the directive
Part).</p>
               <p>But though that be not the <hi>only thing,</hi> yet
it is a very <hi>great thing;</hi> and being super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added,
makes a great addition to the matter
of delight: Therefore we further say,</p>
               <p>This divine communication is delectable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
as it includes in it, <hi>the manifestation of Gods
love to the Soul in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do we hereby intend an <hi>Enthusiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
assurance;</hi> or such a testification of the
love of God to the Soul, as excludes any
reference to his external revelation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of our own enlightened reason and
judgment thereupon; or wherein these are
of no use, nor have subservience thereto: But
as in the other parts of the divine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
his external revelation hath the
place of an instrument, whereby he effects the
work inwardly done upon the mind and
heart, and of a rule or measure whereby we
are to judg of it; so we are to account it is,
as to this part of it also; that is, he inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testifies and manifests the same thing which
is virtually contained in his Gospel-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32156:63"/>
considered in that reference and aspect
which it hath on the present state of the Soul.
For that outward Revelation must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to signifie diversly to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as their state may be divers; As when it
says,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The things that eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, nor have entred into the heart of man,
God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> To
a person that doth indeed truly love God, it
virtually says, <hi>all these things are prepared for
thee:</hi> To one that doth not love God, it can
only be understood to say, all these things
<hi>may be thine, i. e.</hi> if thou shalt love him; If
thou do not, thou hast no part in them; but
in as much as a conditional promise, when
the condition is performed, is equivalent
to an absolute; These words do as truly
import this sense to one that loves God <hi>[these
things are thine],</hi> as if they were directed to it in
particular: As <hi>truly,</hi> I say, supposing the person
do truly love God, but not so <hi>clearly</hi> or
with that evidence. For this Truth, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it a Truth), <hi>I do sincerely love God,</hi>
is not so evident as this, <hi>That such preparation
is made for them that do:</hi> For this is expresly
contained in the Word of God; The other is
not so, but to be collected only by self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
and observation of the bent and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of my spirit and way Godward; yet
however the evidence of truth admits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
Truth it self doth not. All things that
are true, are equally true. And therefore,
when it is said, so great things are prepared
for <hi>them that love God;</hi> It is as <hi>truly</hi> said, they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32156:63"/>
are prepared for <hi>this man who loves God,</hi> as
this or that particular <hi>lover of God</hi> is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the general notion of a <hi>lover of him.</hi>
And then, as that publick declaration says
not to any, <hi>these things are prepared for you,</hi>
whether you love God or no, or otherwise
than as they come under that common notion
of <hi>lovers of God;</hi> This inward manifestation
is also so accommodate to that, as that it
says not <hi>another thing,</hi> but <hi>the same;</hi> that is,
nothing that contradicts (and indeed no
more than is virtually contained in) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or it applies what is generally said of
the lovers of God to this particular lover of
him <hi>as such;</hi> that is, enabling him to discern
himself a <hi>lover of him,</hi> impresses this Truth
powerfully upon the heart, <hi>these great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
belong to thee, as thou art such a one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We speak not here of what God <hi>can do,</hi> but
<hi>what he doth.</hi> Who can doubt but as God
can, if he please, imprint <hi>on the mind</hi> the
whole System of necessary <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>on the
heart</hi> the entire frame of <hi>holiness,</hi> without
the help of an external revelation; so he can
imprint this particular perswasion also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any outward means?</p>
               <p>Nor do we speak of what <hi>he more rarely
doth,</hi> but of what he doth ordinarily; or
what his more usual course and way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
is, in dealing with the spirits of men.
The supream Power binds not its own hands.
We may be sure, <hi>the inward testimony of the
Spirit never is opposite to the outward testimony
of his Gospel</hi> (which is the Spirits testimony
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32156:64"/>
also); and therefore it never says to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
man, an enemy to God, <hi>thou art in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
and pardoned state.</hi> But we cannot
be sure he never speaks or suggests things to
the spirits of men but <hi>by the external testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
so as to make use of that as the means
of informing them with what He hath to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
Nay, we know he sometime hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
things (as to Prophets and the Sacred
Pen-men) without any external means, and
(no doubt) excited sutable affections in
them, to the import of the things imparted
and made known.</p>
               <p>Nor do I believe it can ever be proved, That
he <hi>never</hi> doth immediately testifie his own
special love to holy Souls without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of some part of his external Word,
made use of as a <hi>present</hi> instrument to that
purpose, or that he <hi>always</hi> doth it, in the way
of methodical reasoning therefrom.</p>
               <p>Nor do I think that the experience of
Christians can signifie much to the deciding
of the matter. For besides that this, or that, or a
third persons experience cannot conclude any
thing against a fourth's; and the way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were very infirm, what one or two or a
thousand, or even the greater part of serious
Christians (even such as have attain'd to
some satisfying evidence of their own good
estate) have not found, that no-where is to
be found: Besides that I say, it's likely few
can distinctly tell how it hath been with them
in this matter; that is, what way or method
hath been taken with them in begetting a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:32156:64"/>
perswasion at this or that time of Gods
peculiar love <hi>to them.</hi> His dealings with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(even the same persons at divers times)
may be so various; his illapses and coming in
upon them at some times may have been so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and surprizing; the motions of thoughts
are so quick; the observation or animadversion
persons usually have of what is transacted in
their own spirits is so indistinct; and they
may be so much taken up with the <hi>thing it
self,</hi> as less to mind the way and order of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, that we may suppose little is to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<hi>thence</hi> towards the settling of a stated
rule in this case. Nor is the matter of such
moment, that we need either be curious in
enquiring or positive in determining about it;
that Principle being once supposed and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stuck to;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he never says any thing in this matter
by his Spirit to the hearts of men, repugnant to
what the same Spirit hath said in his Word;</hi>
Or, That he doth not say a new or a diverse
thing from what he hath said there for their
assurance: that is, That he never testifies to
any person by his Spirit that he is accepted
and beloved of him, who may at the same
time be concluded by his publiquely-extant
constitutions in his Word to be in a state of
non-acceptance and disfavour; or concerning
whom the same thing <hi>(viz.</hi> his acceptance)
might not be concluded by his Word, if it
were duly applied to his case. Hereby the
most momentous danger in this matter is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided;
For if that Principle be forelaid, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32156:65"/>
is done to preclude the vain boasts of
such as may be apt to pretend highly to great
manifestations of divine love, while they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with them manifest proofs of an unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
heart, and are under the power of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified
reigning sin. That Principle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
will convince that their boasted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations,
do only manifest their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
pride and vanity; or proceed only
from their heated imagination, or (the worse
cause) Satanical illusion, designed to lull them
asleep in sin, and the more easily to lead
them blind-fold to perdition. And this is the
main concernment about which we need to be
solicitous in this matter: which being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for; as it is difficult, so it is not necessary
to determine, whether the Spirit do always
not only testifie <hi>according to</hi> the external reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but <hi>by it</hi> also; and so only as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in the usual way of reasoning from it.</p>
               <p>No doubt but the same Truth may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to upon divers grounds; sometimes
upon rational evidence; sometimes upon te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony:
And some Truths may be seen by
immediate mental intuition (as being self-evident)
which also may be capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
And though this Truth of
Gods particular love to such a man, be none
of those that have self-evidence: Yet Gods
Spirit, as it may by assisting the discursive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
help us to discern the connexions of some
things which otherwise we should not perceive;
so it may by assisting the intuitive, make
things evident to us that of themselves are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32156:65"/>
not. Nor yet, also, <hi>that it actually doth so,</hi>
can any I believe certainly tell; For admit
that at some times some have very transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehensions of the love of God towards
themselves, suggested to their hearts by the
holy Spirit; they having this habitual
knowledg before that <hi>love to him</hi> (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
or <hi>faith in him,</hi> or the like, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive
characters of the persons whom he
accepts and (delightfully) loves; How sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
may the divine light irradiate, or shine
upon those preconceived notions (which
were begotten in them by the interveniency
of the external revelation before) and excite
those before-implanted principles of Faith,
Love, &amp;c. so as to give them the lively sense
of them now stirring and acting in their
hearts? And thence also inable them unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly
to conclude (and with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
joy and pleasure) their own interest
in his special love, in this way shedding it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in their hearts by the Holy Ghost gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them?<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> This may be so suddenly done
that they may apprehend the testimony to be
immediate when indeed it is not.</p>
               <p>Nor are they able to prove from Scripture
the immediateness of it; For as to what it
doth to them in particular, Scripture says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
they not being so much as mentioned
there: What it doth or hath done to this or
that person there mentioned signifies nothing
to their case; if any thing were said that must
have that import (which will be hard to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince),
and that it is any where in Scripture
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32156:66"/>
signified to be its <hi>usual way,</hi> in common, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them on whose hearts it impresses this
perswasion, to do it immediately; is much less
to be evinced. For what Scripture saith so?
and that famous Text that speaks so directly
to this matter; <hi>The Spirit of God beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with our spirit, that we are the children of
God,</hi> seemeth rather to imply the contrary: In
as much as the Spirit of God is there expresly
said to co-witness with our spirit (as the
word there used signifies) by which it should
seem to take the same course in testifying
which our spirit or conscience doth, that is,
of considering the general characters of his
children laid down in his Word, reflecting
upon the same in our selves, and thereupon
concluding we are his children: Which if it
were suppos'd the only thing the Spirit of God
ordinarily doth in this matter, we may with
much confidence assert;</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That it doth herein no small thing;</hi> for
is it a small thing to be ascertain'd of Gods
<hi>fatherly</hi> love to us as his own children?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That it doth not a less thing</hi> than if it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify'd
the same matter in a way altogether
immediate. For wherein is it less? Is the
matter less <hi>important?</hi> that cannot be said;
for the <hi>thing</hi> we are assured of is the <hi>same,</hi>
howsoever we be certify'd thereof. Is it less
evident? That can with as little pretence be
said; For doth any one account a thing <hi>not
evident in it self,</hi> and that needs to be proved
to him, some way or other, the less evident
for being proved to him in a discursive way:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32156:66"/>
What pretence can any one have to say or
think so? Is it that reasoning is more liable
to error and mistake? But I hope the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods Spirit is not so, when <hi>it</hi> enables
us to apprehend the general Truth we should
reason from; to assume to it; to collect
and conclude from it, guiding us <hi>by its own
light:</hi> In each of these surely we have as much
reason to rely upon the certainty and infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Spirits reasonings as of its most
assertory dictates; Otherwise, we would
(most unreasonably) think the authority of
those conclusions laid down in the Epistle to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other parts of Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validated
by the Holy Ghost's vouchsafing to
reason them out to us, as we know it most
nervously and strongly doth.</p>
               <p>Or, is it less <hi>consolatory?</hi> That cannot be,
for that depends on the two former, the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi>
and <hi>evidence</hi> of the thing declared:
The former whereof is the same, the latter
not less.</p>
               <p>3. Yea and supposing that the Holy Ghost
do manifestly concur with our spirits in the
several steps of that discursive way, so that
we can observe it to do so, (and there is
little doubt but it may do so as observably
to us, by affording a more than ordinary
light to assist and guide us in each part of
that procedure, as if it did only suggest a
sudden dictate to us and no more), we may
upon that supposition add, <hi>That it doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
more advantageously propose the same thing
to us,</hi> than if it only did it the other way.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32156:67"/>
It doth it in a way <hi>more sutable to our natures,</hi>
which is not nothing; and it doth it in a
way <hi>less liable to after-suspicion and doubt;</hi> for
it is not supposed to be always dictating the
same thing. And when it ceases to do so,
howsoever consolatory and satisfying the
dictate was at that instant when it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the matter is liable to question after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon what grounds was such a thing
said? And though it cannot be distrusted,
that what the Holy Spirit testifieth is true;
yet I may doubt whether it was indeed the
Holy Spirit that testify'd it or no. Whereas
if it proceeded with me upon grounds, <hi>they</hi>
remain, and I have no reason to suspect that
which was argued out to me, upon grounds
which I still find in me, was either from
an ill suggestor, or with an ill design; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there may be some plausible pretence of
doubt in the matter, if there was only a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
dictate given in to me, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or appeal to that rule by which God
hath not only directed me to try my self, but
also to try spirits whether they be of him
or no.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any imaginable necessity of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
quite another method to the Spirits
work as it is a Spirit of Adoption, from that
which it holds as it is a Spirit of Bondage:
For, as to this latter, when it convinces a
person and binds down the condemning sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon him; this surely is the course it
follows, to let a person see (for instance)
<hi>they that live after the flesh shall die;</hi> But thou
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32156:67"/>
livest after the flesh, therefore thou shalt dye:
Or, <hi>all that believe not, the wrath of God abides
on them;</hi> But thou believest not (as it is we
know the Spirits work, to convince of not-believing),
<hi>therefore the wrath of God abides
on thee.</hi> And what need is there of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
its <hi>method</hi> to be quite another in its
<hi>comforting-work?</hi> Nor is it surely a matter of
less difficulty to perswade <hi>some</hi> that they are
<hi>unbelievers,</hi> and make them apprehend and
feel the <hi>terror</hi> sutable to their states; than
<hi>others,</hi> that they are <hi>believers,</hi> and make them
apprehend the <hi>comfort</hi> which is proper to
<hi>theirs.</hi> Yea, and is not its course the same
in its whole sanctifying-work, to bring home
the particular Truth, whose Impression it
would leave on the Soul, with application
thereof to it <hi>in particular;</hi> which (as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
propounded in Scripture) men are so
apt to wave and neglect; for what is every
ones concern, is commonly thought no ones:
And what need that its method here should
be wholly diverse?</p>
               <p>But in whichsoever of these ways the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God doth manifest his love, it is not
to be doubted, but that</p>
               <p>There is such a thing in it self very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and to be attained and sought
after:</p>
               <p>And that it is highly delectable when he
doth vouchsafe it,</p>
               <p>That there is such a thing to be sought
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32156:68"/>
after, as a communicable priviledg and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to holy Souls, is evident enough from
multitudes of Scriptures. Those that have
been occasionally mentioned in speaking (what
was thought fit to be said) of the way of
his doing it, need not be repeated, unto which
we may add, what we find is added to those
above-recited words,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Eye hath not seen, &amp;c.
the things which God hath prepared for them
that love him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> viz. <hi>But God hath revealed
them to us by his Spirit.</hi> And that Spirit not
only gives those <hi>lovers of God</hi> above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a clearer view of the <hi>things</hi> prepared for
them, so as that the <hi>nature</hi> of them might be
the more distinctly understood, (as is argued
in the latter part of this, and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verse); but also of their own <hi>propriety</hi> and
<hi>interest</hi> in them;<note place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Now we have received not
the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is
from God, [that we may know the things that
are freely given us of God].</hi> Whence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are revealed by the Spirit, not as
<hi>pleasing objects</hi> in themselves only, but as
<hi>gifts,</hi> the evidences and issues of Divine Love;
<hi>their own</hi> proper portion, by the bequest of
that Love to whom they are shew'n. Nor is
this the work of the Spirit only, as inditing
the Scriptures, but it is such a work as helps
to the <hi>spiritual discerning</hi> of these things;
such as whereto the <hi>natural man</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,
who yet is capable of reading the
Scriptures as well as other men. And what
will we make of those words of our Saviour,
when having told his Disciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>he would

pray the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and he should give them another
comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, that he

of Truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He adds, <hi>I will not leave
you comfortless, I will come to you;</hi> that is,
(as is plain) <hi>by that Spirit].</hi> And then short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after subjoins,<note place="margin">v. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and will manifest
my self to him.</hi> Here is an express promise
of this <hi>love-manifestation,</hi> whereof we speak,
<hi>by the Spirit,</hi> (the Comforter mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove);
not to those particular persons only,
unto whom he was then directing his speech,
or to those only of that time and age, but to
them indefinitely that should <hi>love Christ, and
keep his commandments.</hi> Which is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in other words of the same import;
after <hi>Judas</hi> (not Iscariot) his wondering
expostulation touching that peculiarly of this
<hi>loving manifestation;</hi> Jesus answered and said
unto him,<note place="margin">v. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my
words; and my Father will love him, and we
will come unto him, and make our abode with
him.</hi> So that such a manifestation as is most
aptly <hi>expressive</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> such converse and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
as imports most of kindness and
endearedness, they have encouragement to
expect that do love Christ and keep his words;
The same thing no doubt with that <hi>shedding
abroad of the love of God in their hearts, by the
Holy Ghost given to them,</hi> mentioned before.
And whereas we have so plain and repeated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32156:69"/>
mention of the seal, the earnest, the first-fruits
of the Spirit, what can these expressions be
understood to import (and they do not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing) other than confirmation of the
love of God, or assuring and satisfying evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and pledges thereof.</p>
               <p>And that there should be such an inward
manifestation of divine love superadded to the
publique and external declaration of it (which
is only made indefinitely to persons so and so
characteriz'd) the exigency of the case did
require; That is, <hi>wherein it was necessary his
love should be distinctly understood and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
it was <hi>so far necessary this course should be
taken to make it be so.</hi> A meer external revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not sufficent <hi>to that end;</hi> Our own
(unassisted) reasonings therefrom were not
sufficient. As other Truths have not their
due and proper impression, <hi>meerly</hi> by our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
reception be they never so plain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that holy sanctifying influence before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on; so this Truth also of <hi>Gods love to
this person in particular</hi> hath not its force and
weitht, its efficacy and fruit answerable to
the design of its discovery, unless it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied
and urged home on the Soul by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
influence of the Spirit to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
Many times not so far as to overcome
and silence tormenting doubts, fears and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of spirit in reference hereto, and, where
that is done, not sufficient to work off dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
drowziness, indisposition to the doing of
God chearful service, not sufficient to excite
and stir up, love, gratitude, admiration and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32156:69"/>
praise. How many (who have learned not
to make light of the love of God as the most
do) who reckon <hi>in his favour is life,</hi> to whom
it is not an indifferent thing whether they be
accepted or no; who cannot be overly in
their enquiry, nor trifle with matters of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
consequence, who are not enough A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
and Scepticks to permit all to a mad
hazard, nor easie to be satisfy'd, walk mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
from day to day with sunk, dejected
spirits, full of anxiety, even unto agonies
under the clear (external) discovery of Gods
love, to persons of that character, whereof
they <hi>really are?</hi> such as observe them judg
their case plain, and every one thinks well of
them, but themselves; yea their mouths are
sometimes stopt, by such as discourse the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them, but their hearts are not quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
or, if they sometime are, in a degree,
yet the same doubts and fears return with the
former importunity, the same work is still to
be done, and 'tis but rolling the returning
stone: And all humane endeavours to apply
and bring home the comforts proper and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to their case prove fruitless and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
nothing can be fastened upon them; they
refuse to be comforted, while God himself
doth not create (that which is the fruit of
his own lips) peace, peace; while, as yet,
they are not fill'd with joy and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,<note place="margin">Rom. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note>
and made to abound in hope <hi>through
the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi> It is plain there
needs a more <hi>learned tongue</hi> than any <hi>humane
one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 50.</note> to speak a <hi>word in season to such weary ones.</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:32156:70"/>
How many, again, have spirits overcome
with deadness and sloth under a settled (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not altogether mistaken but more notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
apprehension of the same love! They
have only that assurance which arises it may
be not from a false but the single testimony
of their own spirits; at least unaccompanied
with other than the ordinary help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not very distinguishable from the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their own; Have reasoned themselves
(perhaps regularly, by observing the rule
and the habitual bent of their own spirits)
into an opinion of their own good estate, so
that they are not vext with doubts and fears
as some others are. But they do not <hi>discover
to others,</hi> nor can <hi>discern in themselves</hi> any
degree of life and vigour, of heavenliness and
spirituality, of love to God or zeal for him,
proportionable to their high expectations
from him, or the great import of this thing
<hi>to be beloved of God:</hi> There is no discernible
growth or spiritual improvement to be found
with them; How remote is their temper from
that of the Primitive Christians!<note place="margin">Acts 9. 31.</note> It is apparent
what is yet wanting, they are not <hi>edify'd</hi> (as
those were) <hi>walking in the fear of the Lord,
and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore the matter is plain,</hi> There is such
a thing, as an effectual over-powering communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Holy Ghost for the manifesting of the
love of God, of great necessity and importance to
Christians; that may be had and ought to be
diligently sought after.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. And if it be afforded (which was the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32156:70"/>
other thing proposed); How infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
is that manifestation! the thing it
self carries its own reason and evidence with
it.</p>
               <p>1. If we consider the matter represented
to us thereby; <hi>The love of a God!</hi> How trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
would the thought of it be to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
apprehensive mind! no one whose
nature is not over-run with barbarism would
entertain the discovery of the harmless <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
love (though it were not profitable to
us) even of a creature like our selves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than with complacency; Yea, though it
were a much inferiour (even a brute) crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Men are <hi>pleased</hi> to behold love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it self towards them in a child, in a
poor neighbour, in an impotent servant;
yea, in their horse or their dog. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Prince observes with delight the affection
of the meanest peasants among his Subjects:
Much more would <hi>they</hi> please themselves if
they have occasion to take notice of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
expression of his favourable respect
to them! But how unspeakably more, if he
vouchsafe to express it by gracious intimacies,
and by condescending familiarities! How
doth that person hug and bless himself! How
doth his Spirit triumph, and his imagination
luxuriate in delightful thoughts and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who is in his own heart assured he hath
the favour of his Prince! Yea, with what
complacency are inward friends wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the mutual expressions of each others
love! And can it be thought the love of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32156:71"/>
great and blessed God should signifie less?</p>
               <p>How great things are comprehended in this,
<hi>The Lord of Heaven and Earth hath a kindness
towards me and bears me good will!</hi> How
grateful is the relish of this apprehension, both
in respect of what it, in it self, imports, and
what it is the root and cause of?</p>
               <p>True ingenuity values love for it self. <hi>If
such a one will think of me, if I shall have a place
in his remembrance, If he will count me among
his friends;</hi> this we are apt to be pleased with.
And tokens are sent and interchanged among
friends, not only to express love, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and cherish it, and keep up a mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
among them. And as there is a
great pleasure conceived, in receiving such
expressions or pledges of love from a friend,
not so much for the value of the thing sent, as
of what it signifies, and is the token of <hi>his
love,</hi> his kind remembrance; so is there no
less pleasure in giving and sending, than in
receiving: Because that hereby, as we gratifie
our own love, by giving it a kind of vent
this way; so we foresee how we shall thereby
excite theirs; which therefore, we put a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon, even abstracting from any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
we expect therefrom. And this hath a
manifest reason in our very natures; because
we reckon there is an honour put upon us,
and somewhat is attributed to us, when we are
well thought of, and a kindness is placed
upon us; especially by such as have themselves
any reputation for wisdom and judgment.

                     </gap>w dignifying is the love of God!</hi> How honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32156:71"/>
a thing to be his favourite! To Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
seems to put a mighty stress on this, when
he utters those so emphatical words,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>wherefore
we labour</hi> (so defectively we read it, <hi>we covet, or
are ambitious of it as our honour,</hi> as that word
signifies), <hi>that whether present or absent we
may be accepted of him; q. d.</hi> neither life or
death, neither being in the body or out of
it, signifie any thing to me, or they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things in comparison of this honour,
that <hi>he may accept me,</hi> that I may be pleasing
to him, and gracious in his eyes, that I may
stand well in his thoughts, and he bear a
kind and favourable regard to me.</p>
               <p>Yea and this is a thing in it self delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
not only as it's <hi>honourable,</hi> but as it is
<hi>strange</hi> and <hi>wonderful.</hi> Things that are in
<hi>themselves grateful,</hi> are so much the more so,
for their being somewhat surprising, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all our expectation. I say, supposing they
have an antecedent gratefulness in them, (for
otherwise we know there are also very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
wonders, and which are so much
the more dreadful, because they are surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
and unexpected), it is greatly heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their being out of the road quite of
all our thoughts,—<hi>great things that we looked
not for.</hi> And who would have look't for
such a thing as this, That the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should place his Love on such a Worm as
I! Which is set off with the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
because the same light that represents to
a Soul Gods love, doth also discover to it,
at the same time, its own deformity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveliness.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32156:72"/>
And then how taking and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
is the thought, <hi>I impure wretch!
loathsome miscreant! that lost apostate creature,
that made one with a race and crew of rebels,
was confederate with rebellious men against Him,
yea in a combination with those revolted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the Devils, and now taken</hi> (I know not
why) <hi>into a state of acceptance and favour
with him! And his love is declared to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me! And why towards me? in my self
so vile! And such love! the love of an holy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
God, towards one in whose very nature was
such an horror and hell of wickedness! Why
towards me rather than others, not naturally more
vile than I?</hi> How can this be thought on
without crying out, O wonderful! O the
depths, breadths, lengths and heights of this
love, that so infinitely passeth knowledg!
And here the greater the wonder, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is also the delight.</p>
               <p>And now also are the <hi>effects</hi> of this <hi>love</hi>
great in the eyes of the Soul, according to
the apprehended greatness of their <hi>cause.</hi> If
we indeed were to form conceptions of these
things our selves, by our own light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
our way were to follow the ascending
order, and go up from the <hi>effects</hi> till we
reach the <hi>cause;</hi> But he can, if he please, in the
<hi>cause</hi> present to us the <hi>effects,</hi> and maginfie them
in our eyes, by giving us to see unto how great
and magnificent a <hi>cause</hi> they owe themselves.
Now shall we know whence all hath proceeded
that he hath done for us. Wherefore again must
the transported Soul admiringly cry out, <hi>I now
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32156:72"/>
see whence it was that he gave his Son, because
he so loved the world!</hi> Why he came and bled
and died, <hi>who hath loved us, and washed us
from our sins in his blood!</hi> What a lustre doth
that love cast upon those sufferings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances!
<hi>I see why he sent his Gospel to me,
why so convincing awakening words were often
spoken in my ear, (I see much in what once
I saw but little), why he so earnestly strove with
me by his spirit, why he gave not over till he
had overcome my heart, why he humbled, melted,
broke me, why he drew so strongly, bound me so
fast to himself, in safe and happy bonds; why
he shone into my mind with that mild and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
light, transformed my whole Soul, stampt
it with his holy Image, and markt me out for
his own. These are now great things, when I
behold their glorious mighty cause!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now also in this same <hi>cause</hi> are all
the great <hi>effects</hi> to be seen which are yet to
be <hi>brought about by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are seen as very great.</hi> His continued
presence and conduct, which he affords to
his own through this world; That constant
fellowship which they expect him to keep
with them; The guidance and support they
look for; <hi>In his love</hi> these appear great things.
And now doth Heaven sound no more as an
empty name, it looks not like a languid faint
shadow; somewhat can be apprehended of
it that imports substance, when it's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be a state of rest and blessedness in
the communion of the God of Love; and
intended as the last product and expression
of his love!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:32156:73"/>
They are seen <hi>as most sure and certain.</hi> Such
Love, now manifested and apprehended, leaves
no place for doubtful thoughts and suspicious
misgivings. There is no fear that this Love
intends to impose upon us, or mock us with
the representation of an <hi>imaginary heaven;</hi> or
that it will fail to do what can be expected
from it to bring us to the <hi>real one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How pleasant is it now to behold the great
and sure products of this mighty Love! its
admirable designs and projects, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Gospel-revelation (now illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and shone upon by divine light) to lie
ready formed in the pregnant womb of this
great productive cause. It cannot but be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
pleasure which such a discovery will
carry with it; when we thus behold the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it self that is discovered and offered to our
view, unto which it must be a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
additional pleasure that will arise.</p>
               <p>2. From the nature and kind of this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation.
As being</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the general made by himself.</hi> 'Tis a too
plain and sad Truth that men have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
learn'd to diminish God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and make every thing of him seem
little. But when he represents his Love <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
(as who but God can represent the Love
of God? He only can tell the story of his
own Love) that evil is provided against:
He will manifest it so as it <hi>shall</hi> be understood;
and set it off to the best advantage. He will
make it known how great a thing it is
to be beloved of him. And when he gives
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32156:73"/>
that blessed salutation; <hi>Hail thou that art
highly favoured! O thou that art greatly beloved!</hi>
He will withal bespeak and procure a sutable
entertainment of it. And hence</p>
               <p>Particularly it will be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most incomparably bright and lightsom</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any representation we have had of the
Love of God any other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most immediate,</hi> that is, (at least) so as
not to be <hi>only made</hi> by some external testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
given out many an age ago, out of which
we are left to pick what we can; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
or misconstrue it as our own judgment
serves us; but so, as that <hi>if He use such an
instrument,</hi> he animates it, puts a soul into it,
leaves it not as a dead spiritless letter: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
it himself, to the purpose he intends by
it, and immediately himself reaches and
touches the heart by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most facile</hi> and easily sliding in upon us;
so that we are put to no more pains, than to
behold the light which the Sun casts about us
and upon us. Whatever labour it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for us to use before, in our searches and
enquiries into the state of our case, there is
no more now, than in moving being carried;
or in using our own weak hand when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is sufficiently strong lifts and guides
it for us</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most efficacious</hi> and overcoming: That
makes its own way, scatters clouds, drives
away darkness, admits no disputes, makes
doubts and misgiving thoughts vanish, pierces
with a quick and sudden energy like lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:32156:75"/>
and strikes through the mind into the
heart; there sheds abroad this love, diffuses
the sweet refreshing savour of it; actuates
spiritual sense, makes the soul <hi>taste</hi> how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the Lord is; and relish the sweetness of
his love, puts all its powers into a sutable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and excites answerable affection, so as
to make the Soul capable of interchanging love
with love.</p>
               <p>In all these respects, this manifestation of
love cannot but be very delectable; and they
who have not found it to be so, will yet
apprehend that it must be so, if they have
found and experienced the cravings of their
own hearts directed this way, and can upon
enquiry find this among the things they
would fain have from God; <hi>O that I might
be satisfied of his love!</hi> that <hi>I might know his
good will towards me!</hi> For to such cravings
must this delight at least be commensurate (as
was formerly said). But to them that are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in this matter &amp; unconcerned, to whom
the love of God is a fancy or a trifle, no real
or an inconsiderable thing, all this will be as
tastless as the white of an egg.</p>
               <p>Concerning which yet (before we pass
from this head) 'tis needful to add these few
things by way of caution.</p>
               <p>1. That when we say this is of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
we mean not that it is <hi>simply necessary;</hi>
we think it not so necessary that a <hi>Christian
cannot be without it;</hi> i. e <hi>as a Christian.</hi> But
it is necessary to his well-and more-comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-being,
and his more lively, fruitful
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32156:75"/>
                  <hi>walking</hi> and acting in his Christian course.</p>
               <p>2. That therefore the way of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herein is with great latitude and variety;
he having reserved to himself by the tenour of
his Covenant a liberty, to afford or suspend
it, to give it in a greater or less degree as in
absolute sovereignty, and infinite wisdom he
pleases and sees fit to determine.</p>
               <p>3. It may not therefore with so absolute
and peremptory an expectation be sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as those things may that are necessary to
the <hi>holding of souls in life;</hi> but with much
resignation, submission, and deference of the
matter to the divine good pleasure; such as
shall neither import <hi>disesteem</hi> of it, nor <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
in the want of it.</p>
               <p>4. That it ought to be less-esteemed than the
<hi>heart-rectifying-communication, that is impressive
of Gods Image,</hi> and whereby we are made
partakers of his holiness. <hi>This</hi> proceeds more
entirely from pure love to God for himself, <hi>that</hi>
from self-love; <hi>this</hi> tends more directly to the
pleasing of us, than to the pleasing of God. <hi>This</hi>
is necessary (as was said) but to our well or
better being, <hi>That</hi> simply to our very being <hi>in
Christ;</hi> this hath its greatest <hi>real</hi> value from
its subserviency to the other. And what hath
its value from its reference to another must be
of less value than that.</p>
               <p>5. That its a great mistake to think God is
not otherwise <hi>to be enjoyed</hi> than in this way
of more express testification of his love; as
if you could have no enjoyment of a friend, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by his often repeating to you;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32156:76"/>
                  <hi>I love you, I love you, indeed I love you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That it's a much greater, to place the sum
of Religion here; and that any should make
it the whole of their business, to seek this, or
to talk of it; or should think God doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for them worth their acknowledgment,
and solemn thanksgiving while he doth not
this.</p>
               <p>7. Most of all, that any should reckon it the
first thing they have to do when they begin
to mind Religion, to believe Gods particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
love to them, and that he hath elected
them, pardoned them, and will certainly save
them. So too many, most dangerously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon themselves; and accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any true humiliation, renovation of
heart, or transaction and stipulation with the
Redeemer, do set themselves thus to believe,
and it may be seek help from God more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to believe it, when-as the Devil is too
ready to help them to this Faith: And when
he hath done it, they cry to themselves <hi>peace,
peace,</hi> and think all is well; take their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and humour themselves, live as they list,
and say that for so long a time they have
had assurance of their salvation. The Father
of Lies must needs be the Author (or the
Fautor, or both) of this Faith; for it is a
lie which they believe; that is, that they
are pardoned and accepted of God is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
lie, repugnant to his Word and the
tenour of his Covenant. And for any thing
else that may import their state to be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
safe, is <hi>to them</hi> no <hi>credible</hi> truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:32156:76"/>
8. That for the most part, if Christians,
upon whom the renewing-work of the Holy
Ghost in that former communication hath in
some degree taken place, do yet want that
degree of <hi>this</hi> also, which is necessary to free
them from very afflicting doubts and fears,
and enable them to a cheerful and lively walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God; it is to be reckoned their
own fault; either that they put too much
upon it (too little minding his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
in his Word), or do unduly seek
it, or unseasonably expect it; or that they
put too little upon it, and expect or seek it
not; or that by their indulged carnality, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
vanity of spirit, they render themselves
uncapable of it; or by their careless and too
licentious walking, or their either resisting or
neglecting holy motions, they grieve that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that would comfort them. For though the
restraint of such more pleasant communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may proceed, sometimes, from an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Soveraignty, that owes no reason
to us of it's arbitrary way of giving or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
favours; yet withal, we are to know
and consider, that there is such a thing as <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
and <hi>domestick Justice</hi> proper to Gods
own Family, and which as the Head and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it, he exerciseth therein; whereby
(though he do not exercise it alike at all
times) it seems meet to his infinite Wisdom
to awaken and rouze the sloth, or rebuke the
folly, or check the vanity, or chastise the
wantonness of his offending-children; and
that even <hi>in this way,</hi> by retiring himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32156:77"/>
more reserved, withdrawing the more
discernible tokens of his presence, and leaving
them to the torture (sometimes) of their
own conjectures, what worse thing may
ensue. And herein he may design, not only
<hi>ref<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rmation</hi> to the delinquents, but <hi>instruction</hi>
to others, and even <hi>vindication</hi> to Himself.
For however these his dealings with mens
spirits are <hi>in themselves</hi> (as they must needs
be) secret, and such as come not under the
immediate notice of other men; yet <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
consequential thereto,</hi> doth more openly
appear, and becomes obvious to the common
observation of serious Christians with whom
such persons converse; that is, not only such
as languish under the more remarkable terrors
of their spirits, and are <hi>visibly,</hi> as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
in their own flame, (of which sort
there occur very monitory and instructive
examples, at some times); but even such
also as are deprived of his quickning influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and have only somewhat remaining in
them that is ready to dye, that are <hi>pining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in their iniquities,</hi> and sunk deep into
deadness and carnality (for his comforting
communication is also quickning, and he
doth not use to withhold it as it is quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and continue it as it is comforting, but
if such have comfort, such as it is, they are
their own comforters), do carry very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible
tokens of divine pleasure upon them;
and the evils and distempers under which
their spirits lye wasting, are both their sin
and punishment. Their own wickedness cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32156:77"/>
them, and their backsliding reproves
them. And that reproof being observable,
doth the same time warn others, yea and do
that right to God, as to let it be seen he makes
a difference, and refuses the intimacies with
more negligent, loose, idle, wanton professors
of his Name, which he vouchsafes to have
with some others, that make it more their
business and study to carry acceptably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and are more manifestly serious,
humble, diligent, obedient observers of his
will. If therefore we find not what we have
found in this kind, however the matter may
possibly be resolvable into the Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
(as it is more likely to be in the case
of such desertions as are accompanied with
terror, when no notorious apostacy or scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
wickedness hath gone before), it is
both safe and modest, yea and obvious to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
such delinquencies as were before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
are designed to be animadverted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that the Love hath been injured,
which is now not manifested as heretofore.</p>
               <p>9. That yet such a degree of it, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to a comfortable serving of God in
our stations being afforded; such superadded
degrees, as whereby the Soul is in frequent
raptures and transports, are not to be thought
withheld penally, in any peculiar or remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
respect, (or otherwise than it may be
understood some way a penalty, <hi>not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
perfectly blessed).</hi> For it is certain, that
such rapturous sensations, and the want of
them, are not the distinguishing characters
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32156:78"/>
of the more grown, strong, and excellent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and of them that are more infirm,
and of a meaner and lower pitch and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Yea those extatical emotions, although
they have much of a <hi>sensible delectation</hi> in
them (as more hereafter may be said to that
purpose); and though they may, in part,
proceed from the <hi>best and most excellent Cause,</hi>
do yet, if they be frequent (which would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
an aptitude thereto), import somewhat
of <hi>diminution in their subject,</hi> and imply what
is some way a lessening of it; that is, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the persons that are more disposed this
way, to be of a temper not so well fixed and
compos'd, but more volatile and airy; which
yet doth not intimate, that the <hi>chief Cause</hi>
and <hi>Author</hi> of those <hi>motions</hi> is therefore <hi>mean</hi>
and <hi>ignoble;</hi> nay, it argues nothing to the
contrary, but that the Holy Spirit it self may
be the <hi>supream Cause</hi> of them. For admitting
it to be so, it doth not alter mens natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and complexions; but so <hi>acts</hi> them, as
that they retain (and express upon occasion)
what was peculiar to their temper notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
The work and office of the Holy
Ghost, in its special communications, is to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and new-mold men in respect of their
<hi>moral dispositions,</hi> not those which are strictly
and purely <hi>natural;</hi> the <hi>subject</hi> is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the same it was; and whatsoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
is received according to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of that; and it gives a tincture to what
supervenes and is implanted thereinto; whence
the same degree of such communicated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32156:78"/>
will not so discernibly move some
tempers, as it doth others; as the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of fire will not so soon put solid wood
into a flame, as it will light straw. That
some men therefore are less sensibly and
passionately mov'd with the great things of
God (and even with the discovery of his
love) than some others, doth not argue
them to have less of the Spirit, but more of
that temper which better comports with
deeper judgment, and a calm and sober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of things. The unaptness of some
mens affections unto strong and fervent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth indeed arise from a <hi>stupid incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderateness;</hi>
of some others, from a more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
consideration,</hi> by which the deeper things
sink, and the more they pierce even into the
inmost center of the Soul, the less they move
the surface of it. And though I do not think
the saying of that Heathen applicable to this
case, <hi>It is a wise mans part to admire nothing;</hi>
for here is matter enough in this Theam,
<hi>the Love of God,</hi> to justifie the highest won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment
possible; and not to admire in such a
case, is most stupidly irrational; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the admiration (as well as other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
of more considering persons, is more
inward, calm, sedate, and dispassionate, and
is not the less for being so, but is the more
solid and rational; and the pleasure that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it, is the more deep and lasting: And
the fervour that ensues upon the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Love of God, prompting them to such
service as is sutable to a state of devotedness
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32156:79"/>
to his interest, is more intense and durable;
of the others, more flashy and inconstant.
As, though Flax set on fire, will <hi>flame</hi> more
than Iron; yet withal it will <hi>smoak</hi> more, and
will not <hi>glow</hi> so much, nor keep heat so
long.</p>
               <p>10. But to shut up this Discourse: They
that have more transporting apprehensions of
the love of God, should take heed of despising
them who have them not in just the same
kind, or do not express them in the same se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick
strains. They that have them not,
should take heed of censuring those that with
humble modesty, upon just occasion, discover
and own what they do experience in this
kind; much less should they conclude, that
because they find them not, there is therefore
no such thing to be found; which <hi>Cynical</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is too habitual to such tempers. If they
do fancy such to be a weaker sort of persons
they may be sincere for all that. And it
ought to be considered of whom it was said,
<hi>That he would not quench the smoaking flax,</hi>
The Grace and Spirit of Christ ought to be
reverenc'd in the various appearances thereof:
<hi>Whether we be sober or besides our selves—The
love of Christ constraineth us—</hi> So diversly may
the apprehensions of that Love work in the
same person,<note place="margin">3 Cor. 5. 13, 14.</note> much more in divers. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should be shie of making themselves stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards
to one another; which they that do,
discover more pride and self-conceit, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God, and more admiration
of <hi>themselves</hi> than <hi>of his love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:32156:79"/>
Thus far we have given some account of
<hi>the object to be delighted in;</hi> wherein, if any
think strange that we have spoken so much of
the <hi>delectable Divine communication as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the object</hi> (which how it doth hath been
sufficiently shew'n); let them call it, if they
please, a preparing or disposing of the <hi>Subject</hi>
(which it also, making its own way into the
Soul, as hath been said, effectually doth);
and if the necessity of it be acknowledg'd
upon that account, it equally answers the
main purpose aimed at in all this; and had it
been only so considered, would but have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
some alteration in the frame and method
of this Discourse, but not at all of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or design of it.</p>
               <p>We art next to say somewhat briefly of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
the <hi>Delight it self to be taken therein.</hi> Nor
shall we be herein so curious as to distinguish
(which some do) <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> The
distinction wont to be assigned, cannot, 'tis
plain, hold here, so as to make the former of
these signifie a brutish affection only; and the
latter proper to rational nature. Nor is there
any such propriety belonging to the words,
but they may be rendered (as indeed they
are used in Scripture) promiscuously, either in
reference to the matter of intellectual or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
complacency, and either of a <hi>reasonable
being,</hi> or an <hi>unreasonable.</hi> We take these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to signifie <hi>substantially</hi> the same thing,
and here delight to be intirely all one with
joy: That is, there is not any the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32156:80"/>
of <hi>joy</hi> which may not fitly enough be
comprehended under the name of <hi>Delight,</hi>
when it is placed (as here it is requir'd to be)
upon the blessed God; Whereof, that we may
speak the more fully, it will be necessary to
preface somewhat concerning its <hi>general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and more principally as it is found in
man, within which compass our principal
business lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delight, in the general,</hi> is most intimately
essential to Love; which imports a <hi>well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness</hi>
arising from the apprehended good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or congruity of the thing loved; and it
seems to be meerly by accident, that there is
any thing else in <hi>Love</hi> besides that compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of Delight: That is, what there is else
belonging to the nature of Love arises from
the mixture and variety which is to be found
in the present state of things; which, if it
were at present universally and perfectly
good, and as most rationally it might be
wish'd; Love could have no exercise but in
Delight. Not being so; <hi>Desire that it might
be so,</hi> in reference <hi>to our selves and others</hi> whom
we love, comes duly to have place; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with other acts or exercises of Love,
which it belongs not so much to our present
purpose to mention.</p>
               <p>For instance, Whatsoever we can love, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Persons;</hi> whatsoever <hi>things</hi> we
love, is for the sake of <hi>Persons,</hi> either our selves
or others; whom also we love either supreamly,
or subordinately. And whomsoever we love
supreamly, as it is certainly either God or our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32156:80"/>
selves, we love whatsoever else, Person or
Thing, either for Gods sake, or our own. Be
it now the one or other, or wheresoever we
can place our love, we find things in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to any object of it, not yet as we
would have them, and as they shall be in that
setled state which shall be permanent and last
always; whereunto this is but preparatory
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and introductive. The Creation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent,
every creature wants somewhat even
whereof it is capable; and our own wants in
many respects, we cannot but feel. Nothing
is perfect in its own Kind, in respect of all
possible accessories thereto; even the state of
glorify'd Spirits above, is not yet every way
perfect; much is wanting to their full and
compleat felicity; the Body and Community
whereto they belong, the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> is
not yet entire and full; <hi>Their common Ruler</hi>
and <hi>Lord</hi> is not acknowledg'd and had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as he shall be. In the mean while, their
consummate blessedness (which much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on these things), and the solemn Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee
to be held at the close and finishing of all
Gods work, is defer'd. Yea, and if we go
higher; The blessed God himself, the Author
and Original of all things, although no-thing
be wanting to the <hi>real</hi> perfection of his Being
and Blessedness, hath yet much of his <hi>Right</hi>
with-held from him by his lapsed and apostate
Creatures; so that, which way soever we turn
our selves, there remains <hi>to us</hi> much matter of
rational (yea, and holy) desire; and most
just cause that <hi>our love</hi> (place we it as well
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32156:81"/>
and duly as we can) have its exercise that
way; we have before us many <hi>desiderata,</hi>
according as things yet are. <hi>Desire</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Love suted to an imperfect state of things</hi>
wherein it is yet imperfect.</p>
               <p>And because it's <hi>suted</hi> to such a state of
things, it cannot therefore but be <hi>imperfect
love,</hi> or <hi>love tending to perfection. Pure and
simple delight</hi> is <hi>love</hi> suted to a state of things
every way perfect, and whereto there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lacking. Wherefore Delight appears
to be the <hi>perfection of Love,</hi> or <hi>Desire satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now because this present state is mixed,
and not simply evil, or such wherein we find
no present good; therefore the love which is
suted thereto, ought consequently to be mixed
of these two especially (unto which two the
present discourse is both extended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
because these two affections only are
mentioned in the Text) <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far as things are otherwise than we
<hi>(practically)</hi> apprehend, 'tis fit they should
be with our selves or others whom we love;
our Love is exercised <hi>in desire,</hi> wherein they
are as we would have them, <hi>in delight;</hi> for
then our desire is so far satisfied; and <hi>desire
satisfied</hi> ceases, though <hi>love</hi> do not cease. Or,
it ceases not by vanishing into nothing, but
by being satisfy'd; that is, by being perfected
in the Delight which now takes place.</p>
               <p>The one of these is therefore truly said to be
Love exercised upon a <hi>good</hi> which we behold
at a distance, and are reaching at. The other,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32156:81"/>
Love solacing it self in a present good. They
are as the wings and arms of love; Those for
pursuits, these for embraces. Or the former
is love in motion; the latter is love in rest.
And as in bodily motion and rest, <hi>that</hi>
is in order to <hi>this,</hi> and is perfected in it;
Things move not, that they may move, but
that they may rest (whence perpetual progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
motion is not to be found); so it is also in
the motion and rest of the mind or spirit; it
moves towards any object with a design and
expectation to rest in it, and (according
to the course and order which God hath
stated and set) can never move forward
endlesly towards a good in which it shall not
at length rest; though yet <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi>
have a continual vicissitude, and do (as it
were circularly) beget one another.</p>
               <p>And thus hath God himself been pleased
to express his <hi>own Delight,</hi> or the <hi>Joy</hi> which he
takes in his people,<note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 17. 18</note> even by the name of <hi>Rest,</hi>
viz. <hi>that of Love. He will rejoice over thee with
joy, he will rest in his love.</hi> Wherefore delight
hath not been unfitly defined, <hi>The repose
or rest of the desiring faculty of the thing
desired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that Love, as such, hath ever
somewhat of delectation in it; for we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the first view of any thing we apprehend
as Good, with some pleasedness therein (so
far as it is loved), it is grateful to us, and
we are gratified some way by it; yea, there
is somewhat of this before any emotion by
desire towards it; For we would not <hi>desire</hi> it,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32156:82"/>
if it were not <hi>pleasing</hi> to us; which <hi>desire</hi> is
then continued (as far as love is in exercise)
till it be attained for our selves or others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the object of our love <hi>(i. e.</hi> the
object <hi>for whom</hi> as we may call it) is.</p>
               <p>Nor is that a difficulty, how yet there may
be somewhat of <hi>delectation,</hi> and even of <hi>rest</hi>
in this love of <hi>desire;</hi> For the Soul doth in
that case, while it is thus desiring, rest from
the <hi>indetermination of desire:</hi> that is, if it have
placed Love upon any one (it self or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
upon whom therefore it doth with a
sort of pleasedness stay and rest; it doth first
in the general desire <hi>it may be well with such
a one;</hi> and then, if any thing occur to its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that it apprehends would be an advantage
to the person loved; though it cease not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
it, yet it ceases from those its former
hoverings of <hi>desire;</hi> being pitch'd upon this
<hi>one thing,</hi> as satisfied that this <hi>would be a
good</hi> to him it loves. The appetite stays and
insists upon this thing; As the Psalmist, <hi>One
thing have I desired.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> It hath here, as it were,
a sort <hi>of hypothetical rest; q. d.</hi> How well-pleased
should I be if this were compast and
brought about! Or it hath an anticipated and
pre-apprehended rest, <hi>a rest in hope</hi> (by which
the object is some way made present), as it
is said, <hi>We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</hi> For
there is no rational desire which is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani'd
with hope. <hi>Despair</hi> stifles <hi>Desire.</hi>
That which appears simply impossible, passes
for nothing; and goodness goes not beyond
the compass of being. But whatsoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:32156:82"/>
to us <hi>a good</hi> (whether for our selves or
another), <hi>that is</hi> sutable and possible; <hi>That</hi>
if love stir in reference to it, becomes the
object of <hi>complacential desire;</hi> that is, it pleases
us first upon sight, or upon such an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of it; the appetite pitches, centers and
rests upon it; and then we pursue it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
But then our delectation therein grows,
as our hope doth it will be attained; and still
more (if we find it to answer its first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
as by degrees it is attained actually;
till <hi>being fully attain'd,</hi> our desire (as to that
thing) ends in all the <hi>delight</hi> and satisfaction
which it can afford us; so that the delight
and rest which follows desire in the actual frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a full and satisfying-good, is much
more intense and pure, than that which either
goes before, or doth accompany it; and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the same thing with fruition or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self; only that this term hath been,
by some, more appropriated to signifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation
which is taken in the last End, unto
which yet it hath no more native designation
than divers other words.</p>
               <p>We have then thus far some general notion
of <hi>Delight</hi> (and also of <hi>Desire</hi> which is taken
in here only on the by, and as tending some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to illustrate the other, whereof yet
what we now say may be of some use here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after).</p>
               <p>We are next to speak of <hi>this Delight</hi> in
special, which is here to be placed <hi>upon God.</hi>
About which we are are to consider, both
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:32156:83"/>
                  <hi>What</hi> it is we are called to.</p>
               <p>And <hi>how</hi> we are to reckon our selves
called to it.</p>
               <p>And 1, That we may shew, <hi>What</hi> we are
called to. Having in this general account spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
only of <hi>humane delight,</hi> or of delight as
it is to be found among men; It will now
be necessary to distinguish this unto
<list>
                     <item>Meerly Natural,</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>And</hi> Holy.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And when we thus distinguish, it is to be
understood, that by <hi>natural</hi> we mean what is
within the sphere of <hi>Nature</hi> in its present
corrupted state; otherwise, what was <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
to man did (taken in a large sense)
include <hi>holiness</hi> in it; and so the addition of
<hi>holiness</hi> doth but make up <hi>purely natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
as it was at first: But as the case now
is, the distinction is necessary.</p>
               <p>And the latter of these only will be the
subject of our following discourse; as being
only sutable to the blessed Object whereon it
must terminate, and only capable of being
apply'd thereto.</p>
               <p>When therefore our delight is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and set on God, this must be understood
as presupposed, that it be purify'd, drain'd
from the pollution and impure tinctures
which it hath derived from our vitiated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32156:83"/>
and further contracted by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with impure, mean, and vile things.
For only that delight is to be placed on God
which <hi>can</hi> be so placed; and <hi>delighting in
God</hi> being duly designed, that is, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
designed which is necessary thereto:
And thereto is necessary, not meerly the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of one such particular <hi>act</hi> towards
God, but an <hi>holy principle,</hi> as prerequisite
to the right doing even of that also.</p>
               <p>Unholy love declines God; and indeed it
is unholy, in as much as it doth so. Whence
therefore it is as impossible it should be set
on God, remaining unholy, as that it should
be another thing from it self, and yet be still
wholly what it was.</p>
               <p>Although it cannot be <hi>another thing</hi> in its
general nature (as it is not necessary it should),
it must be a much altered thing, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>holiness</hi> thereto. And this coming
upon the whole Soul, even upon all its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and powers, doth therein spread it
self unto its delight also. <hi>Delight in God</hi> is
not the work of an unholy heart.</p>
               <p>And (as may be collected from what hath
been said) <hi>Holiness</hi> consisting in a right dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of heart towards God, a divine
Nature, participated from him, conform to
him, and which works and tends towards
him, and in it self so delightful a thing; It
may thence be seen what holy <hi>delight</hi> is, or
wherein the <hi>holiness</hi> of it stands.</p>
               <p>It must to this purpose be considered, that
this <hi>holy delight</hi> is twofold, according to a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32156:84"/>
two-fold consideration of the <hi>delectable object;</hi>
into which, what was formerly said about it
may be reduced.</p>
               <p>All delight in God supposes, as hath been
said, some communication from him.</p>
               <p>That communication is either of <hi>light,</hi>
whereby his Nature and Attributes are in
some measure known; or of <hi>operative influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
whereby his Image is imprest, and the
Soul is fram'd according to his will. And
so 'tis partly <hi>mental</hi> or <hi>notional</hi> (I mean not
meerly notional, but that hath with it also
an aptitude to beget a correspondent-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on the Soul, and not engage it in
some speculations concerning him only), and
partly <hi>real,</hi> that actually begets such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
it self. It is partly such as may be
<hi>understood,</hi> and partly such as may be <hi>felt;</hi>
the manifestation of his Love partly belongs
to the one of these, and partly to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Answerably hereto, the delight that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in him, is either more
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>explicite,</hi> and wherein a person
reflects upon, and takes notice of his
own act, and whereupon it is exercised.</item>
                     <item>Or, <hi>more latent, implicite</hi> and unobserv'd,
when his delight lies folded up in other
acts and dispositions which have another
more principal design, though that also
is involved in them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The former way, the Soul delights in God
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32156:84"/>
more <hi>directly,</hi> applying it self thereto on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and bending the mind and heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
thereto; its present views of him
having that very design and aim.</p>
               <p>The latter way, it delights in him rather
<hi>collaterally,</hi> when its present action (as well as
the disposition leading to it) hath another
more direct scope and aim. And the delight
only adheres to the act, as being in it self
delightful; as for instance, the acts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Trust, Self-denial, &amp;c. which have <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
end</hi> than delight, though that insinuates
into them.</p>
               <p>The former of these may be called <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
delight.</hi> The Soul solacing it self in
a pleasant meditation of God, whereby its
delight in him is excited and stirred up.</p>
               <p>The latter (understanding <hi>sense</hi> spiritually,
as it belongs to the <hi>new creature,</hi> and is taken
<hi>Phil. 1. 9. Heb. 5. ult.)</hi> may be called <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
delight;</hi> whereby the Soul, as it were,
<hi>tastes how gracious the Lord is.</hi> Which though
it doth by the other also, yet the distinction
holds in respect of the <hi>way</hi> wherein the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
is <hi>begotten</hi> and <hi>begun,</hi> if not in respect
of the <hi>thing it self, begotten,</hi> or wherein the
matter <hi>ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former way, the Soul more expresly
reflects upon its own present exercise, which
it directly intends.</p>
               <p>In the latter, it may not reflect expresly
either upon its actual delight which it hath,
nor actually consider God as the <hi>object</hi> that
yeilds it that pleasure; as I may be delighted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32156:85"/>
by the pleasant taste of this or that food, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering what the things is I am feeding
on; nor have distinct reflection on the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
I take therein, having another and more
principal design in eating, the recruiting of
my strength, and that delight being only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
and accruing on the by.</p>
               <p>The former is less durable, and sooner apt
to vanish upon the cessation of the present
act, like the delight of the eye.</p>
               <p>The latter is more permanent, as that of
the taste, and habitual; such as is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of any thing whereof one hath a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
possession, as of a confirm'd state and
habit of health, or of the riches, dignities,
pleasant accommodations which belong to
any ones setled condition; of which he hath
that continual enjoyment that insensibly forms
his spirit, raises and keeps it up to a pitch su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his condition, though he have not
every day or hour distinct formed thoughts
of them, nor is often in that contemplative
transport with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,—Is not this
great Babylon which I have built? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these are <hi>holy delight,</hi> or <hi>delight in
God.</hi> In both whereof may be seen, added
to the general nature of <hi>delight,</hi> an <hi>holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as the <hi>Principle,</hi> inferring a powerful
steady <hi>determination of the heart towards God,</hi>
as the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> which it ultimately tends
to, and terminates upon. Though in the
former way of <hi>delighting in God,</hi> the Soul
tends towards him more directly: In the
latter (according as the acts may be to which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32156:85"/>
the <hi>delight</hi> adheres), more obliquely, and
through several things that may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
unto that final and ultimate <hi>object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And both these may fitly be understood
to be within the meaning of this Text; which
therefore we shall now consider <hi>apart</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally;</hi>
though both of them very <hi>briefly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we begin with the latter of them.
For though the former have, in some respect,
an excellency in it above the latter; yet as
the progress of Nature in other Creatures is
by way of ascent, from what is more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to what is perfecter and more excellent:
So is it with the communicated Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the <hi>new creature,</hi> which puts it
self forth, first in more imperfect operations,
the buddings, as it were, of that tree of
life which hath its more florid blossoms, and
at length its ripe and fragrant fruit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Or (to come nearer the case), inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the latter sort of <hi>delight</hi> (according
to the order wherein we before mentioned
them) hath more in it of the exercise of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
sense;</hi> the other more of <hi>spiritual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
Since humane Creatures, that have Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
capable of both sorts of functions, do
first exercise <hi>sense,</hi> and by a slower and more
gradual process, come on to acts of <hi>ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
afterwards. So it is here, The Soul in
which the Divine life hath taken place, doth
first exercise it self in <hi>spiritual sensations:</hi> So
that though, in the matter of <hi>delight,</hi> it is
not destitute of the grateful relishes of things
truly and spiritually delectable; yet the more
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32156:86"/>
formed and designed acts of <hi>holy delectation,</hi>
in the highest <hi>object</hi> thereof, distinctly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
and pitcht upon for that purpose,
do follow in their season; and these are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
and the essays of the <hi>new creature,</hi>
gradually and more indistinctly putting forth
it self in order thereto; The <hi>Embryo's</hi> of the
other.</p>
               <p>If therefore it be inquired, Wherein the
<hi>delight</hi> of this more <hi>imperfect sort</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist?</p>
               <p>I answer, In the <hi>Souls sensation</hi> and <hi>relish</hi>
of <hi>sweetness</hi> in the holy quickening commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of God unto it, by which he first
forms it for himself, and in the operations
which it is hereby enabled to put forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, while it is in the infancy or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of its Christian state.</p>
               <p>Nor, while we say the <hi>delight</hi> of this kind
doth more properly belong to the younger
and more immature state of Christianity, do
we thereby intend wholly to appropriate or
confine it to that state: For as when a Child
is grown up to the capacity of exercising <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
it doth not then give over to use <hi>sense,</hi>
but continues the exercise of it also in its
adult state, even as long as the person lives;
only, in its infancy and childhood its life is
<hi>more intirely a life of sense,</hi> though there are
early buddings of <hi>reason,</hi> that soon come to
be intermingled therein; notwithstanding
which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>principle</hi> that rules and is more in
exercise, more fitly gives the denomination:
So it is in this case also; that is, though there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32156:86"/>
are <hi>sensations</hi> of <hi>Delight</hi> and pleasure in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(yea, and those more quick, confirm'd
and strong in more grown Christians), yet
these <hi>sensations</hi> are more single and unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
(though not altogether) with the
exercise of <hi>spiritual reason and judgment,</hi> and
do <hi>less come in</hi> that way with Christians in
their minority, than with others or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
afterwards.</p>
               <p>Therefore that which we are to understand
our selves <hi>called</hi> to under the name of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in God (thus taken) is,</p>
               <p>The keeping of our Souls open to Divine
Influences and Communications:</p>
               <p>Thirsting after them, praying and waiting
for them:</p>
               <p>Endeavouring to improve them and co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
with them, and to stir up our selves
unto such exercises of Religion as they lead to,
and are most sutable to our present state.</p>
               <p>Together with an allowing, yea, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
our selves to <hi>stay,</hi> and <hi>taste</hi> in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and course, the sweetness and delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those communications and operations
whereof we have any present experience. For
instance;</p>
               <p>When we find God at work with us, and
graciously dealing with our spirits, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them, break and melt them under a sense
of sin, incline and turn them towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
draw them to a closure with his Son
the Redeemer, to a resignation and surrender
of our selves to him, upon the terms of his
Covenant and Law of Grace; Yea, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32156:87"/>
when afterwards we find him framing our
hearts to a course of holy walking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
to the denyal of ungodliness and
worldly lusts; to a sober, righteous and godly
life in this present world; to the exercises of
Piety, Sobriety, Righteousness, Charity,
Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now this or the like hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Dictate occurs to us, <hi>Delight thy self
in the Lord;</hi> what doth it import? what
must we understand it to say or signifie to us?
Though this that hath been mentioned, and
which we are now saying <hi>is not all</hi> that it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
(as will be shown hereafter); yet
thus much we must understand it doth signifie
and say to us:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thy only true <hi>Delights</hi> are to be found
in a course of Religion, they are not to be
expected from this world, or thy former
sinful course; but in exercising thy self unto
godliness, in receiving and complying with
the Divine discoveries, recommended to
thee in the Gospel, and (through them)
the influences of Life and Grace, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
flow in upon any Soul that hungers
and thirsts after righteousness; and by which
thou mayst be fram'd in all things after the
good and holy and acceptable will of God.
Herein thou shalt find such pleasures and
Delights entertaining thy Soul, as that thou
wilt have no cause to envy wicked men their
sensual Delights which they find in their
sinful way; if thou wilt but observe what
thou findest, and exercise thy sense, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
between good and evil; and set thy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32156:87"/>
self to consider whether there be not as well
more satisfying, as purer relishes of pleasure, in
mortifying the flesh with the affections and
lusts thereof, in denying thy self, in dying
to this world, in living to God, in minding
the things of another world, in giving up
thy self to the several exercises of an holy
Life, watching, praying, meditating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
trusting in the Lord with all thy heart, and in
doing all the good thou canst in thy place and
station, letting so thy <hi>Light shine before men,
that they seeing thy good works, may glorifie
thy Father which is in Heaven;</hi> In content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with what thou enjoyest, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
under what thou sufferest in this world,
in <hi>doing justice, loving righteousness, and
walking humbly with thy God,</hi> Than ever
the vanishing pleasures of sin did or can
afford.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus into these two Things may all be
summ'd up, which Delighting in God imports
according to this notion of it.</p>
               <p>1. The applying our selves to those things
by the help of Gods own communicated Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(which in that case will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held)
<hi>wherein the matter of Delight lies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The reflecting upon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that are so Delightful, and setting our
selves to discern, and tasting actually the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectableness
of them.</p>
               <p>And surely, if such words, <hi>Delight thy self
in the Lord,</hi> do say to us all this, they do not
say nothing; nor say any thing impertinent,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:32156:88"/>
either to their ow<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> native import, or our state
and condition in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But here it may be Objected; If we so
interpret <hi>Delighting in God,</hi> we shall by this
means bring the whole of Religion, and all sorts
of actions that are governed and directed by it,
within the compass of <hi>this one thing;</hi> and make
Delighting in God, swallow up all that belongs to
a Christian, and be the same thing with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Faith, Self-denial, Humility, Meekness,
Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would sure seem too much
to be comprehended under the name of one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
holy action or affection; Especially that
they should be called <hi>Delighting in God,</hi> when
in the exercise of divers of these God may possibly
not be in that instant actually so much as thought
on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To this it may be sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:</p>
               <p>1. That these things cannot be hence said
with any pretence to be made the same thing
with <hi>Delighting in God;</hi> but only that there
is a <hi>delight adhering</hi> to all these; no more than
it can be said, when, at some splendid Treat
or entertainment, there is a great variety
of delicious Meats and Wine, which do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all agree <hi>in this,</hi> That they are <hi>delectable;</hi>
that all these Dishes and Liquors are therefore
one and the same. Or, if the Master of the
Feast call upon his Guests to <hi>delight themselves
with him, their Friend</hi> (as here the Particle
in the Text, which we read <hi>Delight</hi> thy self
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:32156:88"/>
                  <hi>[in]</hi> the Lord, may be read <hi>Delight</hi> thy
self <hi>[with]</hi> him); and he explains himself,
That he means <hi>by tasting this and that and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort of his Provisions, and eating and
drinking chearfully thereof,</hi> surely his words
could not with more Reason, than civility be
capable of that snarling reply; <hi>That,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it seems, <hi>he thought the things themselves
or their tasts and relishes were all one.</hi> For
though they all afford <hi>Delight,</hi> yet each of a
different kind.</p>
               <p>2. But are not all these truly Delectable?
Is there not a real <hi>Delight</hi> to be had in them?
Let any man, that hath tried, consult his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
yea, let any one that hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted
his Soul, and infatuated his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but seriously consider the very <hi>Idaea's</hi> of
these things, and revolve the notions of them
in his mind, and then soberly judg, whether
they be not <hi>delightful?</hi> And, if so, when there
is an actual sense of pleasure and sweetness in
the <hi>communicated power,</hi> and in the practice
of them, Why is not this <hi>delighting</hi> in God?
Admit that he is not actually thought on in
some of these exercises; As when I freely
forgive a wrong, or relieve a distressed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or right a wronged one: If yet I do
these things, from the radical Principle of the
<hi>Love of God</hi> deeply setled in my Soul, and
with a sensible <hi>delight</hi> accompanying my act,
and the disposition I find in mine heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
Here is not, 'tis true, the very act of
<hi>delighting</hi> in God, formally terminated upon
him as the Object; But it's he that gives me
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32156:89"/>
this <hi>Delight,</hi> and is the material Object (as
well as Author) of it. The communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is from him, <hi>whereby I am delighted,</hi> and
inabled to do the things that are <hi>further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi>
As if I converse with an excellent
person, my intimate friend, who is at this
time <hi>incognito,</hi> and by a disguise conceals
himself from me, or I through my forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or inadvertency have no present thoughts
of this person; but I hear his pleasant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and am much taken with it, and the
person on the account of it: It is my Friend
that I Delighted in all this while though I
knew it not.</p>
               <p>3. And what fault can I find in the matter
that Divine <hi>delight</hi> thus runs and spreads it
self through the whole business of Religion,
&amp; all the affairs whereon it hath any influence?
Is this the worse or the better? Have I any
cause to quarrel at this? Sure I have not. But
if I have not such actual thoughts of God,
as may give me the advantage of terminating
my <hi>Delight</hi> more directly on him, that may
be, very much, <hi>my own fault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And what is that an absurdity that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Delighting in God,</hi> the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
acts and exercises of Religion besides
should be comprehended? How often in
Scripture are other (no-more-eminent)
parts of Religion put for the whole. <hi>The
knowledg of God, calling upon God, The fear
of God,</hi> &amp;c. How commonly are these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be Paraphrases of Religion?
And shall I not add <hi>[The Love of God?]</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:32156:89"/>
That most authentick and owned summary
of all <hi>practical Religion,</hi> and which ought to
influence all our actions. And then how far
are we from our mark? What is the difference
between <hi>loving God,</hi> and <hi>delighting in him?</hi>
But I moreover add, that <hi>delight it self in him,</hi>
cannot but be so taken in that sharp passage,
(though misapply'd to the person of whom
it was meant),<note place="margin">Job 34. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>For Job hath said, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is it that a man should delight himself with
God, (i. e.</hi> or be <hi>religious)?</hi> It fitly enough
signifies <hi>Religion,</hi> as <hi>thus modify'd</hi> or <hi>qualified,
viz.</hi> as having this <hi>quality</hi> belonging to it,
that it is <hi>delightful,</hi> or is tinctur'd with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this (so large) is not the only sense,
as we have said, wherein we are to take <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in God.</hi> And when any part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
casts it's name upon the whole, it would
be very unreasonable to <hi>exclude</hi> the part from
which the denomination is taken, or not to
make that the principal thing there meant.</p>
               <p>We therefore proceed to speak,</p>
               <p>2. Of the more <hi>explicite delight in God:</hi>
And shall therein consider, The
<list>
                     <item>Nature</item>
                     <item>Modification</item>
                  </list>
of it.</p>
               <p>1. Its <hi>Nature;</hi> Which from what hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
been said of <hi>delight</hi> in the general, with the
addition of <hi>holiness</hi> thereto, (which is the
work of Gods Spirit, determining the act
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:32156:90"/>
or faculty to which it adheres towards God),
may be conceived thus, <hi>That it is the acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
or rest of the Soul in God, by a satisfied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of will in him, as the best and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it be the <hi>rest of the Soul,</hi> belongs to
its general nature.</p>
               <p>And so doth the mentioned kind of <hi>rest,</hi>
more distinguishingly, <hi>by the wills satisfiedness
in him:</hi> Because the Soul may be also said
to <hi>rest satisfied</hi> (in respect of another facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
by the meer knowledg of Truth; But
<hi>this</hi> supposes so much of <hi>that</hi> also as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
And because the acts of the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
are subservient and in order to those
of the <hi>will,</hi> in the Souls pursuit of a <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
good;</hi> which is so far attained as it <hi>actually
delights</hi> therein; Therefore this may more
simply be called the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>whole Soul,</hi>
whereas that other is its <hi>rest</hi> but <hi>in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
only:</hi> Especially when we add,</p>
               <p>As in the <hi>best and most excellent good;</hi> for
this signifies the <hi>good</hi> wherein it <hi>rests</hi> to be
<hi>ultimate,</hi> and its <hi>last end,</hi> the very period of
its pursuits, beyond which it neither needs nor
desires to go further, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the <hi>kind</hi> and
<hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>good</hi> which it is now intent
upon; though it still desire <hi>more of the same,</hi>
till there be no place left for further <hi>desire,</hi> but
it wholly cease and end in <hi>full satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we may speak somewhat more
particularly of this <hi>rest in God;</hi> it supposes,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Knowledg of him.</hi> That the Soul be
well furnished with such conceptions of his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:32156:90"/>
Nature and Attributes, as that it may be
truly said to be <hi>himself it delights in,</hi> and not
<hi>another thing;</hi> not an Idol of its own fancy,
and which its imagination hath created and
set up to it instead of God. Therefore his
own <hi>representation of himself</hi> must be our <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi>
which being forsaken, or not so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
attended to, He is either by <hi>some, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented,</hi>
(according as their own corrupt
hearts do suggest impure thoughts), and
made altogether such a one as themselves, and
such as cannot be the <hi>object</hi> of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
delight;</hi> or by <hi>others</hi> (as their guilt and
fear do suggest to them black and direful
thoughts of him) render'd such as that he
cannot be the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>any delight at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>It supposes</hi> actual thoughts of him; My
soul shall be satisfi'd as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Psal. 63. 5, 6.</note>
when I remember thee upon my bed, and
meditate on thee in the night watches.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A pleasedness with even the first view or
apprehension of him;</hi> which is most essential to
any love to him, and which gives rise to any
motion of</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>Desire</hi> directed towards him, upon
the apprehension that somewhat is absent,
either of what is <hi>due to him,</hi> or <hi>lacking to
our selves from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. It includes the <hi>satisfaction</hi> or <hi>repose it
self</hi> which the Soul hath, so far as it finds
its <hi>desire</hi> answered in the one kind or the
other.</p>
               <p>Where we must more distinctly know, that
the <hi>delight</hi> taken in him, is according as the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:32156:91"/>
                  <hi>desire</hi> is which works towards him, and <hi>that</hi>
as our <hi>love</hi> to him is:</p>
               <p>Now we love him either
<list>
                     <item>for himself, or</item>
                     <item>for our own selves.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For himself, ultimately, so as that our
Love periods in him, and stays there, <hi>viz.
on him, as good in himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>our selves;</hi> as when our <hi>love to him</hi>
returns upon <hi>our selves;</hi> apprehending a
<hi>goodness in him</hi> which is sutable for <hi>our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loving him in the former way, we desire all
may be ascribed and given to him, that possibly
may or can.</hi> And because we know him to be
every way perfect and full, and that nothing
can be added to him of real perfection, and
therefore nothing can be given him besides
external honour and acknowledgments: We
therefore <hi>desire</hi> these may be universally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him to the very uttermost. And as far
as we find him worthily glorify'd, admired,
and had in honour, so far we have <hi>delight in</hi>
(or in reference to) <hi>him;</hi> consisting in the
gratification of that <hi>desire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loving him in the other way,</hi> (which also we
are not only allow'd, but obliged to do, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction
to all creature-good), <hi>we desire
his nearer presence and converse, more full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of his light, grace, and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And are <hi>delighted</hi> according as we find
such desire is answered unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:32156:91"/>
6. The form of expression used in the
Text, implies also <hi>a stirring up our selves,</hi> and
the use of endeavours with our own hearts,
to foment, heighten, and raise our own <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
The Conjugation (as it is thought fit
to be called) into which the word is put, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
(by a peculiarity of expressiveness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the sacred Language) <hi>action upon
ones self;</hi> which must also be understood to
have the same force, in reference to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense of <hi>delighting in God;</hi> That is, that
we put our selves upon those acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
whereunto such <hi>delight</hi> is adjoined.</p>
               <p>(These things are now more cursorily
mentioned, because there will be occasion
more at large to insist on them in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>The Practice of this Duty,</hi> reserved
to the Second Part).</p>
               <p>2. We now proceed to the <hi>Modification</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
this <hi>Delight</hi> in God; or the right manner or
measure of it.</p>
               <p>Concerning which it is apparent in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
it can be no further right than as it is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to its Object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our <hi>Delight</hi> should ever be adequate,
or of a measure equal to it, is plainly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But it must be some-way <hi>sutable,</hi> or
must bear proportion to it. I shall here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but two (and those very eminent) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi>
wherein it must do so; <hi>viz.</hi> in respect
of</p>
               <p>

The
<list>
                     <item>Excellency</item>
                     <item>Permanency</item>
                  </list>
Of the Good
to be <hi>delighted</hi>
in.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The excellency of it.</hi> Inasmuch as it is
the best and highest Good; it plainly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
<hi>our highest Delight:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, <hi>The highest Delight simply,</hi> which
our natures are capable of, is most apparently
due to the blessed God, even by the <hi>Law of
nature it self,</hi> resulting from <hi>our natures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
unto his.</hi> And as the Case stands under
the Gospel;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The highest Delight comparatively,</hi> i. e. <hi>higher
than we take in any thing else;</hi> nothing must
be so much <hi>delighted</hi> in as he. We do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<hi>delight</hi> in him <hi>as God,</hi> which is one
way of glorifying him. And its part of the
Apostles charge upon the Pagan world, that
knowing him to be God, they did not glorifie
him <hi>as God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we make the comparison between him and
all the good things of this world, <hi>the matter is
out of question. It is the sense of holy Souls,</hi>
Whom have I in Heaven but thee?<note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> and whom
can I desire on earth besides thee? <hi>When others
say,</hi> Who will shew us any Good? <hi>They say,</hi>
Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> Lift thou up the light of thy countenance—.
<hi>And thereby</hi> he puts gladness into their hearts,
more than when Corn and Wine increase.
And whosoever love not Christ more than Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 47</note>
Mother,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26.</note> Wife, Child; yea, and their own lives,
cannot be his Disciples. <hi>Their present worldly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:32156:92"/>
life it self, it put in the balance, he must out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if we put the comparison between our
spiritual eternal Life and him;</hi> though <hi>he</hi> and
<hi>that</hi> can never be in opposition (as there may
be often an opposition between him and this
present life, so that the one is often quitted
for the other); yet neither is there a <hi>co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
but the <hi>less worthy</hi> must be <hi>subordinate</hi>
to the <hi>more worthy:</hi> We are to desire the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him</hi> for his <hi>own glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet here is a strange and admirable
complication of these with one another. For
if we enjoy him, <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>rest</hi> in him as
our best and most satisfying Good, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>glorifie him as God.</hi> We give him practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
highest acknowledgments, we confess
him the most excellent one. 'Tis his glory
to be the last term of all desires, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which no reasonable desire can go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And if we seek and <hi>desire</hi> his glory su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamly,
sincerely and really beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things; when he is so glorified to
the uttermost, or we are assured he will be;
our highest <hi>desire</hi> is so far satisfied, and that
turns to, or is, <hi>our own contentment:</hi> So that
by how much more simply and sincerely we
pass from, and go out of our selves, so much
the more certainly we find our own satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rest, and full blessedness in him. As it is
impossible the Soul that loves him above it
self, can be <hi>fully happy,</hi> while <hi>he hath not</hi> his
<hi>full glory;</hi> so it is for the same reason equally
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:32156:93"/>
impossible, but it must be so when <hi>he
hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Our <hi>delight</hi> must be sutable to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>(the Good to be delighted in).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In respect of the permanency of it, This</hi> is
the most durable and lasting Good. In this
blessed Object therefore we are to <hi>rejoice ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 16.</note>
As in the matter of <hi>Trust</hi> we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to <hi>Trust in the Lord for ever, because in
the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 4.</note> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
strength gives sufficient ground for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Trust. So it is in the matter of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:</hi>
A permanent everlasting excellency is
not answered, but by a continual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>delight;</hi> Therefore, is it most justly
said,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Rejoice in the Lord alway; and again I
say to you rejoice;</hi> alway, and still on. If
through a long tract of time you have been
<hi>constantly alway</hi> rejoicing in the Lord, begin
again, I, <hi>again,</hi> say to you rejoice; or rather
never give over. The Object will warrant
and justifie the act, let it be drawn forth to
never so vast a length of time. You will still
find a continual spring, unexhausted fulness,
a fountain never to be drawn dry.</p>
               <p>There will never be cause of diversion with
this pretence, that now this Object will yield
no more: It is drained to the uttermost, and
is now become an empty and gustless thing.</p>
               <p>With other things it may be so; and
therefore our <hi>delight</hi> doth not answer the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of such things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 30.</note> but <hi>when we rejoice in
them as if we rejoiced not.</hi> They are as if they
were not. All the things of this world are so.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:32156:93"/>
For even the <hi>fashion of this world passeth away;</hi>
as it is afterwards added.<note place="margin">v. 31.</note> Therefore no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
can fitly be taken in them, but what is
volatil and unfixed as they are; lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it over-reach, and run beyond its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
And how absurd and vain is it to have
<hi>our hearts set upon that which is not?</hi> That
takes wing, and leaves us in the dirt.</p>
               <p>This Object of <hi>delight</hi> is the <hi>I am, yesterday
and to day the same, and for ever; without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableness
and shadow of change.</hi> Therefore
the nature of it cannot allow us a reason;
wherefore, if we be <hi>delighted</hi> therein yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
we should not to day; or if to day,
why not to morrow, and so on to <hi>for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whence then we may see no one can say he
hath answered the</hi> import <hi>of this Exhortation,</hi>
Delight thy self in the Lord, <hi>by having</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<hi>in him at</hi> sometime. It is continual,
as well as highest delight we are here called to.</p>
               <p>We see then thus far what we are called to
when we are here directed to <hi>delight</hi> our
selves in the Lord.</p>
               <p>2. We are next to shew <hi>How we are called</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>to it.</hi> And the matter it self will answer the
enquiry, we are called to it, according to
what, <hi>in it self,</hi> it is. Now it is</p>
               <p>Both a
<list>
                     <item>Priviledg,
<hi>And</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Duty.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>We are therefore called to it (and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
are to understand the words).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:32156:94"/>
1. <hi>By way of gracious invitation</hi> to partake
of a <hi>priviledg,</hi> which our Blessed Lord would
have us share and be happy in; no longer to
spend our selves in anxious pursuits and vain
expectations of Rest where it is not to be
found; but that we retire our selves to him
in whom we shall be sure to find it. Pity
and Mercy invite us <hi>here</hi> to place our <hi>delight,</hi>
and take up our Rest. And concerning this,
there is no question or imaginable doubt.</p>
               <p>2. By way of <hi>authoritative Command.</hi> For
we must know,</p>
               <p>That <hi>delight</hi> in God is to be considered not
only under the notion of a <hi>priviledg</hi> unto
which we may esteem our selves entitled;
but also of a <hi>duty</hi> whereto we are most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly
obliged. This is a thing (not so
much not understood, as) not considered
and seriously thought on, by very many;
and the not-considering it proves no small
disadvantage to the life of Religion. It oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to very many, more familiarly, under
the notion of a high favour, and a great
vouchsafement (as indeed it is), that God
will allow any of the Sons of men to place
their <hi>delights</hi> in himself; but they (at least
seem to) think it's only the priviledg of some
special favourites; of whom, because they
perhaps, are conscious they have no cause to
reckon themselves, they are therefore very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in the neglect of it. And thus is the
pretence of modesty and humility very often
made an umbrage and shelter to the vile car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of many an heart; and a want of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32156:94"/>
is <hi>pretended</hi> and <hi>cherished</hi> at the same time,
as an excuse; That whereas they <hi>do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
in God, they <hi>never may:</hi> For he that is
unfit to day, and never therewithal applies
himself with seriousness, to the endeavour
of becoming fit, is likely to be more unfit to
morrow, and so be as much excused always as
now; and by the same means at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself from being happy; but never
from having been the Author of his own
misery: But what? is it indeed no <hi>duty to
Love God?</hi> Is that become no Duty which is
the very sum and comprehension of all duties?
or can they be said to Love him, that take no
pleasure in him, that is, to Love him
without loving him. It is, indeed, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
grace that there should be such a contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our happiness and duty; that, by the
same thing, wherein we are obedient, we also
become immediately, in the same degree, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And that the Law of God in this case
hath this very import <hi>an obligation upon us to
Blessedness.</hi> But in the mean time we should
not forget that Gods Authority and Honour
are concerned herein, as it is our duty; as well
as our own happiness, as it is our priviledg;
And that we cannot injure our selves in this
matter without also robbing God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delight</hi> in God is a great piece of homage
to him, a practical acknowledgment of his
sovereign excellency, and perfect all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
goodness; when we retire from all
the world to him, we confess him better than
all things besides: That <hi>we have none in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32156:95"/>
or Earth that we esteem worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with him.</hi> But when our hearts are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to him, and will not be brought to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
in him, since there is somewhat in the
mean while wherein we do <hi>delight;</hi> we do as
much as say (yea, we more significantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it than by <hi>saying) that whatever that
is, 'tis better than he;</hi> Yea, that such a thing
is good, and he is not. For as <hi>not-believing
him</hi> is a denial of his Truth, the making him
a liar; <hi>not delighting in him</hi> is, equally, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of his Goodness, and consequently even
of his Godhead it self.</p>
               <p>And since we find the words are here laid
down plainly in a preceptive form; <hi>Delight
thy self in the Lord:</hi> Can any think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
after this at liberty, to do so or not?
'Tis true, that they who are in no disposition
hereto have somewhat else to do in order to
that (of which hereafter); but, in the mean
time, how forlorn is their case, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to excuse their sin by, but sin; and
who, instead of extenuating their guilt, do
double it!</p>
               <p>Yea, and we are further to consider, that
it is not only commanded, by a <hi>meer simple
precept,</hi> but that this Precept hath its <hi>solemn
sanction;</hi> and that not only by <hi>promise,</hi> here
expresly annexed (of which hereafter); but
also of imply'd threatning; That <hi>we shall not
else have the desires of our hearts,</hi> but be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
unsatisfied, and miserable; which is also
in many other places expressed plainly enough.
Great penalty is due upon not <hi>delighting</hi> in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32156:95"/>
God, even by the Gospel-constitution it self;
which is not so <hi>unreasonably form</hi>'d as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more in this matter, than is sutable to
the object it self; and is <hi>framed so indulgently,</hi>
as to accept much less than is proportionable
thereto; and yet within the capacity also of a
reasonable Soul: so that, though the very <hi>nature
of the thing</hi> doth plainly dictate a <hi>rule,</hi> by which
this matter is to be estimated and judged;
yet <hi>this other rule</hi> gives considerable abatement
and allowance; That is, it being considered
what the Object claims and challenges, as by
its own proper excellency due to it; and what
the <hi>Subject</hi> is, by its own nature, capable of:
Not only doth it hence appear, that <hi>delight</hi> in
God is a <hi>duty,</hi> but that the Soul ought to rise
to <hi>that highest pitch</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> unto
the highest the Soul is naturally capable of.
The very <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> resulting from the
reference and comparison of <hi>our nature</hi> unto
<hi>Gods own,</hi> requires so much; That we Love
(or <hi>delight)</hi> in him with all our heart, with
all our mind, with all our might, and with
all our strength; He deserves from us <hi>our very
uttermost.</hi> Yet this is by the Gospel-constitution
required <hi>with indulgence</hi> and abatement, not as
to the <hi>matter required, but as to the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
it.</hi> The <hi>matter required,</hi> is still the same,
so as that the <hi>purest &amp; highest delight in God doth
not cease to be a duty,</hi> or any <hi>gradual defect</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>cease to be a sin.</hi> The Gospel doth make no
change of the <hi>natures of things;</hi> makes nothing
cease to be <hi>due to God</hi> from us, which the Law
of Nature made <hi>due;</hi> nor renders any defect
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32156:96"/>
innocent, which is in its <hi>own nature</hi> cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and faulty; Therefore the same pitch of
<hi>delight in God</hi> is still due and required that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was: But that perfection is not <hi>(finally</hi>
and <hi>without relief)</hi> required in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and on the same terms it was; that is,
it is not, by the Gospel required <hi>under remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
penalty,</hi> as it was; For the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(though it made not a remedy simply
impossible yet it) provided none, but the
Gospel provides one.</p>
               <p>Yet not so but the same penalty also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<hi>in it self due</hi> and <hi>deserved,</hi> which was
before. For as the Gospel takes not away
the <hi>dueness</hi> of any part or degree of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which we did owe to God <hi>naturally,</hi>
so nor doth it take away the <hi>natural dueness</hi>
of <hi>punishment,</hi> for disobedience in any kind
or degree of it. Only it provides that (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very valuable consideration which it
makes known) it becomes <hi>to us</hi> a <hi>remissible
debt,</hi> and actually remitted to them who come
up to the terms of it. Not that it should be
<hi>in it self no debt,</hi> for then nothing were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
Nor yet, when it so provides for
the <hi>remission</hi> of <hi>defects</hi> in this part of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
doth it remit the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>duty it
self,</hi> or pardon any <hi>defects</hi> of it to any but
such who are found <hi>sincere</hi> in this, as well as
the other parts of that obedience which we
owe. Others, who after so gracious over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
remain at their former distance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their aversion, enmity, and disaffection
to God, it more grievously (and most justly)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32156:96"/>
threatens and punishes as implacable; and who
will upon no terms return into a state of
friendship and amity with their Maker, whom
they hated without cause,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29</note> and do now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
strangers and enemies to him without
excuse; so that the very blood of the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
Sacrifice cries against them.</p>
               <p>And surely since (as was formerly said)
it is <hi>God in Christ</hi> that is the <hi>intire Object</hi> of
this <hi>Delight</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> 'Tis a fearful penalty
that is determined upon them that do not so
place it;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 22.</note> when it is said, <hi>If any man love not
the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema,
Maran-atha.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 24.</note> And when also it is said, <hi>Grace
be upon all them that do,</hi> it is plainly imply'd,
that the penalty belongs to all them that do
not <hi>love him in sincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which <hi>sincerity</hi> therefore of <hi>delight in
God,</hi> (to keep within the compass of our
present Theam), it is necessary we be well
informed; as we may be from what hath
been said before; that is,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That we delight in him supreamly,</hi> and
above all things else, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>our highest</hi>
and <hi>deepest complacency of will.</hi> For it is not
necessary (nor ordinarily possible), that our
<hi>delight in him</hi> should be <hi>ever</hi> accompany'd
with such sensible agitation of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Spirits, as we find in reference to <hi>meerly
sensible objects.</hi> Which is not essential to such
<hi>delight,</hi> but an accident that follows <hi>union
with the body;</hi> and more frequently, and to
a greater degree in some tempers of body
than others. But it is necessary there be that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:32156:97"/>
                  <hi>practical estimation of him, and propension to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, as the best and most excellent good;</hi>
as that we be in a preparation of mind and
heart to forego whatever can come into any
competition with him for his sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That though we do not thus</hi> delight in
him so much as we should, <hi>yet we do</hi> more than
in any thing else.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That we continue herein:</hi> That this be
the constant habitual temper of our Spirits
towards him: That we cleave to him with
purpose of heart, as not only the most <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
but the most <hi>permanent object</hi> of our
<hi>delight:</hi> Having setled the resolution with our
selves,<note place="margin">Psal. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>This God shall be our God for ever and
ever; He shall be our God and guide even to the
death.</hi> And that there be frequent actual
workings of heart towards him, agreeable to
such a temper, though they are not so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
as they ought.</p>
               <p>Which account we give of this <hi>sincerity</hi> of
<hi>delight in God,</hi> not to encourage any to take
up with the <hi>lowest degree</hi> of that <hi>sincerity;</hi>
but that none may be encouraged, upon their
own mistake in this matter, to take up with
any thing short of it; and that we may see
whence to take our rise in aiming at the
highest pitch thereof.</p>
               <p>And that we may (understanding the
highest intenseness and most constant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of <hi>delight in God</hi> that our Natures are
capable of, to be our duty) understand also,
that in reference to our <hi>gradual defects</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions</hi>
herein, we ought to be <hi>deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:32156:97"/>
as being faulty; <hi>not unconcern'd,</hi> as though
we were innocent in this regard, That we
need continual pardon upon these accounts;
That we owe it to the Blood of the Redeemer,
that such things can be pardoned: That we
are not to reckon, or ever to expect that
Blood should stand us in stead, to obtain our
pardon for <hi>never delighting in God sincerely at
all;</hi> but only (supposing we do it <hi>sincerely)</hi>
that we do it not <hi>perfectly.</hi> For most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they whose hearts are never turned to
him as their <hi>best</hi> and most <hi>sovereign Good</hi> or
<hi>Portion,</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Lord;</hi> but do still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
alienated in their minds, and enemies
through wicked works, will perish notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And that we might the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
together with the apprehension of
<hi>what we are called to in this matter,</hi> understand
also <hi>how we are called to, i. e.</hi> not by an <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
only, that leaves us at liberty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we will or will not, as we think fit:
But by express <hi>command,</hi> and that also back't
with the <hi>severe determination</hi> of most <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
penalty</hi> in case of <hi>omission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have in some measure shew'n
the <hi>Import</hi> of the <hi>Direction</hi> in the Text, <hi>That
we Delight our selves in the Lord.</hi>

Delighting in GOD:

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Practice of Delight in
GOD.</head>
               <p>WE have in the former Part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the meaning of the
words, <hi>Delight thy self in the
Lord,</hi> beyond what they seem
at first sight literally to signifie: So as not to
understand them meerly as requiring that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
single act of <hi>Delight</hi> to be immediately
and directly terminated on God himself;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:32156:99"/>
But to take them as comprehending also the
sum of all <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>religious converse with
God, i. e. as it is delightful,</hi> or as it is <hi>seasoned</hi>
(intermingled, and as it were besprinkled)
<hi>with delight;</hi> and upon the same account,
of all our other converse, so far as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc't
by Religion.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not, to such as shall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
have considered what hath been said,
it will be thought very reasonable to take
them in that latitude; whereof the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Text (as may be alledg'd for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
justification hereof) is most fitly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For (as was noted upon another Text
where we have the same phrase) the particle
which we read <hi>[in] the Lord,</hi> hath not
that signification alone, but signifies also
[with] or [by] or [besides] or [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore]
or [in presence of], as if it had been
said, <hi>Come and sit down with God, retire thy
self to him, and solace thy self in the delights
which are to be found in his presence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
in walking with him, and transacting
thy course as before him, and in his sight.</hi> As
a man may be said to <hi>delight</hi> himself with
a friend that puts himself under his roof;
and besides personal converse with himself,
freely enjoys the pleasure of all the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
accommodations, and provisions which
he is freely willing to communicate with him,
and hath the satisfaction which a sober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would take in observing the rules and
order of a well-governed house.</p>
               <p>According to this (divers) <hi>Import</hi> of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32156:99"/>
Precept enjoining this Duty, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to speak diversly of the <hi>Practice</hi> of
the Duty it self:</p>
               <p>That is, That we treat of the <hi>practice</hi> and
<hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Delight;</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. As a thing adherent to the other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Religion.</item>
                     <item>2. As it is a distinct Duty of it self.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As to the former, our business will be,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
To treat of the <hi>exercise</hi> of Religion <hi>as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
Now Religion is <hi>delightful naturally</hi> and <hi>in
it self;</hi> and makes a mans other actions, even
that are not in themselves acts of Religion,
<hi>delightful</hi> also, so far as they are governed
and influenc't by it; <hi>If that Religion be true,
i. e.</hi> if it be <hi>living,</hi> such as proceeds from a
principle of Divine life.</p>
               <p>Being therefore now to treat of the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
of this Duty (whereof the <hi>account</hi> hath
been already given), our Discourse must
aim at and endeavour these two things, (the
former as leading and subservient to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter),
<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That we may not take up, and rest, or
let our <hi>practice</hi> terminate in a Religion
which is not <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>in it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. That we seek after and improve in that

               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:32156:100"/>
1. That which is not so, we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
not to acquiesce in, or be contented with,
for it is plainly such as will not defray it self,
or bear its own charges, as having only cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and burden in it, no use or end; I mean
the <hi>dead formality</hi> of Religion only. We find
it natural and pleasant to carry about with
us our own living body; but who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
(how wearisom and loathsom a task
were it?) to lug to and fro a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case?</p>
               <p>It will be upon this account needful to
<list>
                     <item>Insist in shewing more distinctly, What
sort of Religion it is, that is <hi>in it self
wholly undelightful.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Propound some things to consideration
concerning it, that may tend to <hi>beget a
dislike of it,</hi> and so <hi>incline us to look further.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. That we may know what we are not to
take up with; because our present Subject
confines us to this one measure of Religion,
<hi>that it be delightful,</hi> it will be proper to limit
our Discourse to this Character only of the
Religion we are to pass from, as vain and
worthless, <hi>viz. That which is without delight;</hi>
which it also will be sufficient to insist on to
our present purpose. For since (as hath been
largely shewn) the <hi>delightfulness</hi> of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is true, and living is <hi>intrinsecal,</hi> and
<hi>most natural</hi> to it, 'twill therefore be certainly
consequent, that which is not <hi>delightful</hi> is
dead, and can serve for nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:32156:100"/>
And yet here it will be necessary, for Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to insert,</p>
               <p>1. That even such Religion as is true and
living, and consequently in it self <hi>delightful,</hi>
yet may <hi>by accident</hi> sometimes, not appear or
be thought so; because either variety of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
may divert from minding, or some
imbittering distemper of spirit may hinder the
present relishing of that pleasure which is
truly in it. As a man may eat and feed on
that, which is very savoury and good; and
yet, though his taste be not vitiated, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he reflects not, may not every moment
have that present apprehension that it is so;
much more if the Organs of taste be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a present distemper. But, if they be not
so, any one's asking him how he likes that dish,
(because that occasions a more express ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion),
will also draw from him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
that it is pleasant and savoury.</p>
               <p>2. That a dead Religion may be thought
<hi>delightful;</hi> and through the ill temper of the
subject, a pleasure may be apprehended in
it, which doth not naturally arise from it;
that is, The meer external part of Religion
may be flexible, and be accidentally pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a subserviency to some purposes which
Religion of it self intends not, in respect
whereof a <hi>delight</hi> may injuriously (and as
by a rape) be taken in it, as is said by the
Prophet of an hypocritical people,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet they
seek me daily, and delight to know my ways,
as a Nation that did righteousness; they take
delight in approaching to God.</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:32156:101"/>
Therefore, that which is here intended, is
not, that the Religion should be rejected, in
some present exercises whereof we have not the
actual relish of a present pleasure (as that should
not be embraced, wherein upon any whatsoever
terms we find it); but that which can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and upon just terms afford us none; and
which upon our utmost enquiry and search,
<hi>cannot</hi> in reason (as it is not unfit that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
reason should be imployed in making a
judgment what <hi>may)</hi> be thought spiritually
<hi>delectable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We shall therefore in some particular heads,
give a short account of such Religion, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
cannot but be judged undelightful, or
which hath not that in it which can yield
pleasure to a sound and well-complexioned
spirit; but that if any be taken therein, that
very pleasure is so <hi>unnatural</hi> and out of kind,
as to be the argument rather of a disease in
the Subject, than of any real goodness in the
thing it self.</p>
               <p>Whereunto we only premise this two-sold
general Rule, whereby an undue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
delight may be estimated and judg'd
of.</p>
               <p>1. That such <hi>delight</hi> may be justly deem'd
unnatural which is taken in any thing besides,
and with the neglect of the proper use and
end which it most fitly serves for.</p>
               <p>2. Such as is accompanied with a <hi>real hurt,</hi>
greater than the <hi>delight</hi> can countervail, or as
is so far from taking in <hi>profit</hi> and benefit in
conjunction with it, as that the damage and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:32156:101"/>
prejudice which it cannot recompence, is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from it; which <hi>rules</hi> will be the
more fitly applicable to the present case; for
that (as hath been formerly observed) the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
which accompanies the acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Religion, or that flow from it, though
it be natural thereto, yet is not the only or
chief end of those acts; but they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more important end, unto the prosecution
whereof by such acts <hi>delight</hi> is only adherent:
Whence the <hi>delight</hi> cannot but be most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
and perverse, which is taken in such
things as do either not serve the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
design of Religion; or much more that
are repugnant and destructive of it.</p>
               <p>By these <hi>Rules</hi> we may plainly see what
<hi>delight</hi> in the general is to be accounted
<hi>undue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As by <hi>the former Rule</hi> we would justly
reckon that an undue <hi>delight</hi> which a man
should take in his food, if he only please
himself with the looking on the handsom gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of the dishes, which he loaths in the
mean time and refuses to taste; or which a
covetous <hi>miser</hi> takes in having wealth <hi>hoarded
up,</hi> which he is pleased often to view and
cannot endure to use.</p>
               <p>And <hi>by the latter,</hi> That were most irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>delight,</hi> which in a Fever one should take
in gratifying his distempered appetite, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth not so much relieve nature as feed
his disease.</p>
               <p>And so we may say, <hi>that</hi> Religion is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
<hi>i. e.</hi> not duly <hi>delightful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:32156:102"/>
1. <hi>Which consists wholly in revolving in ones
own mind the notions that belong to Religion,
without either the experience, or the design and
expectation of having the heart and conversation
formed according to them.</hi> So the case is with such
as content themselves to yield the principles
of <hi>Religion</hi> true, and behold with a notional as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and approbation the connexion &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one thing with another: But do never
consider the tendency and aim of the whole;
or that the Truth of the Gospel is the <hi>Doctrine
that is according to godliness;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3</note> or such as is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant
to the design of making men godly; of
transforming them into the Image of God, and
framing them to an entire subjection to his
holy and acceptable will; that bethink not
themselves the Truth is never learned <hi>as it is
in Jesus,</hi> except it be to the <hi>renewing the Spirit
of the mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> the <hi>putting off the old man,</hi> and
<hi>the putting on of the new.</hi> When this is never
considered, but men do only know, that they
may know; and are never concerned further
about the great things of God, than only to
take notice that such things there are offered
to their view which carry with them the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Truth, but mind them no more
than the affairs of <hi>Eutopia,</hi> or the world in
the Moon; what <hi>delight</hi> is taken in this
knowledg, is surely most perverse. There is
a pleasure indeed in knowing things, and in
apprehending the coherence of one Truth
with another; but he that shall allow himself
to speculate only about things wherein his life
is concerned, and shall entertain himself with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:32156:102"/>
                  <hi>delight</hi> in agitating in his mind certain curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
general notions concerning a <hi>disease</hi> or
a <hi>crime</hi> that threatens him with present
death, or what might be a <hi>remedy</hi> or <hi>defence</hi>
in such a case, without any thought of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things to his own case, or that the
case is his own, one may say of such pleasure
<hi>it is mad;</hi> or of this <hi>delight, What doth it?</hi> or
he that only surfeits his eye with beholding
the food he is to live by, and who in the mean
time languishes in the want of appetite, and
a sickly loathing of his proper nutriment;
surely such a one hath a pleasure that no sober
man would think worth the having.</p>
               <p>And the more any one doth <hi>only notionally</hi>
know in the matters of Religion, so as that
the temper of his spirit remains altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable
and opposite to the design and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the things known; the more he hath
lying ready to come in judgment against him;
and if therefore he count the things excellent
which he knows, and only please himself with
his own knowledg of them, 'tis but alike case
as if a man should be much <hi>delighted</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his own condemnation written in a fair
and beautiful hand: Or, as if one should be
pleased with the glittering of that sword
which is directed against his own heart, and
must be the present instrument of death to
him: And so little pleasant is the case of such
a person in it self, who thus satisfies his own
curiosity with the concernments of eternal life
and death, that any serious person would
tremble on his behalf, at that wherein he takes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:32156:103"/>
pleasure, and apprehend just horrour in that
state of the case whence he draws matter of
<hi>delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. 'Tis yet a more insipid and gustless Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which too many place <hi>in some peculiar
opinions, that are either false, and contrary to
Religion, or doubtful and cumbersome to it, or
little and inconsiderable, and therefore certainly
alien to it, and impertinent.</hi> For if that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
only be truly <hi>delightful</hi> which hath a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
influence on the heart and practice, as that
must needs be indelectable, which is only so
notionally conversant about the greatest <hi>truths,</hi>
as that it <hi>hath no such influence;</hi> much more is
<hi>that</hi> so, which is so wholly coversant about
matters either opposite or irrelative hereto, as
that it <hi>can have none.</hi> It must here be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
that some Doctrines not only not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Word of God, but which are
contrary thereto, may (being thought true)
occasion the excitation of some inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and have an indirect influence to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
of practice also, so as to repress some
grosser enormities. As the false notions of
Pagans concerning the Deity, which have led
them to Idolatry, have struck their minds
with a certain kind of reverence of <hi>invisible
powers</hi> and perhaps rendered some more sober
and less vicious than had they been destitute
of all Religious sentiments.</p>
               <p>And yet the good which hath hence ensued,
is not to be refer'd <hi>to the particular principles of
Idolatry,</hi> which were false; but to the more
<hi>general principles of Religion,</hi> which were
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:32156:103"/>
true. Yea, and though such false principles
viewed alone, and by themselves, may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
infer somwhat of good; yet that is <hi>by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
only,</hi> and through the short-sighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ignorance of them with whom they
obtain; who, if they did consider their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence
with other common notions and
principles most certainly true, would receive
by them (if thought the only Principles of
Religion) so much the greater hurt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so much the more hopelesly and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wicked: As most manifestly the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which (lookt upon by themselves)
<hi>while they are reckon'd true,</hi> do lead to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and consequently, by that mistake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to some Religion; do yet, <hi>being really
false,</hi> lead to Atheism, and <hi>of themselves</hi> tend
to subvert and destroy all Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Doctrines as cohere not with the
general frame of Truth, whatever their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
aspect may be, considered apart and
by themselves, are yet <hi>in their natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
opposite and destructive to the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Religion, and the pleasure which they
can any way afford, is only stol'n and vain;
such as a person takes in swallowing a poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is pleasant, but which, if it perform
what belongs to it, he must with many a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualm refund and disgorge back again.</p>
               <p>We also acknowledg some Truths of <hi>less
importance,</hi> may be said to concern <hi>practice,</hi>
though not so <hi>immediately.</hi> Nor is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the design of this Discourse to derogate
from any such, that are of apparently Divine
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:32156:104"/>
Revelation or Institution; which, however
they justly be reckoned <hi>less than some other
things,</hi> yet for that very reason <hi>as they are
reveal'd by God for such an end,</hi> are by <hi>no
means to be esteemed little,</hi> or inconsiderable;
be their subserviency to the great design of
Religion never so remote. <hi>Vpon the account
of which subserviency,</hi> they are also to be
esteem'd <hi>delectable,</hi> that is, <hi>in proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi>
but when they are so esteem'd <hi>beyond that
proportion,</hi> and are exalted into an undue
preference to their very end it self; so as
that, in comparison of them, the great things
of Religion are reckoned low, frigid, sapless
things; when men set their hearts upon them
<hi>abstractly, and without consideration of their
reference and usefulness to the greater things
of Religion;</hi> The delight that is so taken in
them, argues but the disease of the mind that
takes it, and so great a degree of dotage,
that a serious person would wonder how men
can please themselves with such matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering, and with the neglect of so
great things they have relation to.</p>
               <p>3. And hither is to be refer'd the much
less rational pleasure which is taken by some
in the meer dress wherewith such notions
and opinions may be artificially clothed by
themselves or others; Rhetorical flourishes,
a set of fine words, handsom cadencies and
periods, fanciful representations, little tricks
and pieces of wit, and (which cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so high) pitiful quibbles and gingles,
inversions of sentences, the pedantick rhyming
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32156:104"/>
of words, yea and an affected tone, or even
a great noise, things that are neither capable
of gratifying the <hi>Christian</hi> nor the <hi>man;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which even the most important weighty
matters do to so squeamish stomachs seem
gustless and unsavoury, and are reckon'd dull
and flat things. And most plain it is, (though
it is not strange, that so trifling minds should
impose upon themselves by so thin a sophism),
that such are in a great mistake, whose <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
being wholly taken up in these trifles,
do hereupon think they taste the <hi>delights</hi> of
Religion; for these are nothing of it, are
found about it only accidentally; and by a
most unhappy accident too, as ill <hi>(for the
most of these things)</hi> agreeing to it, and no
more becoming it than a Fool's Coat doth a
prudent grave person; and <hi>the best of them</hi>
agreeing to it but in common with any thing
else, about which such arts may be used; so
that they are no way <hi>any thing of it,</hi> or more
peculiarly belonging to it, than to any theam
or subject besides, unto which such orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as they are thought) can be added.
How miserably therefore do they cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who, because they hear with pleasure
a discourse upon some head of Religion thus
garnished, according to their idle trifling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and because they are taken with the
contrivance of some sentences, or affected
with the loudness of the voice, or have their
imagination tickled with some phantastical
illustrations, presently conclude themselves to
be in a <hi>Religious transport,</hi> when the things
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:32156:105"/>
that have pleased them have no affinity or
alliance with Religion, befal to it but by
chance, and are in themselves things quite
of another Country!</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Of the like strain is the Religion</hi> that is
made up all of talk. And such like are that sort
of persons, who love to discourse of those great
things of God wherewith it was never their design
or aim to have their hearts stamped, or their lives
commanded and governed. <hi>Who invert that
which was the ancient glory of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church,</hi> We do not speak great things, but
live them. <hi>And are pleased with only the
noise of their own (most commonly insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
sensless) words; unto whom how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
a relish would that Precept have,</hi> Be
swift to bear, slow to speak!</p>
               <p>And how much to be regretted a thing is
it, That the <hi>delights</hi> of <hi>practical living Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
should be so lost, and vanish into a meer
lip-labour! Things of this nature are to be
estimated by their <hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
which accompanies them; Which unto
a serious and prudent observer, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very discernible and easie to be distinguisht.
It's an amiable lovely thing to behold those
that are intent upon the great business of
Religion <hi>themselves,</hi> provoking others also
<hi>with serious gravity</hi> unto <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good works.</hi>
And it will ever stand as a monumental cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of them <hi>that feared the Lord,</hi> that <hi>they
spake often one to another</hi> upon this account.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note>
But the <hi>pretence of this</hi> is odious, when the
<hi>thing designed</hi> is nothing but <hi>self-recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:32156:105"/>
and the spirit of the pretenders is
visibly vain and empty; and when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
they take <hi>delight,</hi> not in <hi>the things they
speak of,</hi> but only in <hi>this thing</hi> it self, <hi>speaking
much.</hi> No breath is then more fulsom; And
the better the things are, the worse it is to
have no more savour of them.</p>
               <p>5. Again, <hi>The Religion is a-kin to this, which
stands all in hearing.</hi> 'Tis as remote (at least)
from the heart, when it is wholly placed in
the <hi>ear,</hi> as when it's all in the <hi>tongue.</hi> As it
is with them that are <hi>hearers only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>not doers of
the word, deceiving their own souls.</hi> When
the Preacher is to them <hi>as a very lovely song,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.</note>
                  <hi>of one that can play well on an instrument, and
they hear his words, but do them not.</hi> And it
is natural to the same sort of persons to be
pleased indifferently with either of these, as
the <hi>Athenians</hi> were in <hi>hearing</hi> or <hi>telling</hi> some
new thing. Only that this difference most
commonly appears with the persons we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that when <hi>the things they delight to
hear,</hi> must be ever <hi>new,</hi> or at least <hi>new drest;</hi>
the <hi>things they speak,</hi> shall be everlastingly
<hi>the same.</hi> How perverse a <hi>delight</hi> is that?
Whereas 'tis the glory of substantial Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the principal things of it can never
grow old, or be dry: Their ears still itch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
novelties; a plain argument that it is not
<hi>Religion it self</hi> that pleases them (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
change), but the variable accessory modes
of representing it.</p>
               <p>However, there is certainly very often a
distemper appearing among those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:32156:106"/>
Religion, <hi>in coveting to hear unto excess,</hi>
and beyond what is either <hi>sutable</hi> or <hi>design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
unto use and profit. When the pleasure
of a delightful revolving of the ever-fresh
and fragrant Truths of the Gospel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to answerable practice, is lost
and stifled, by heaping on of more than can
be digested. And many an hopeful birth of
pious and holy dispositions, affections, and
good works, is suppressed or enfeebled by
an untimely superfetation.</p>
               <p>6. Lastly, <hi>'Tis a most undelightful Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which consists intirely in the external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments
and forms of Worship, which this or
that party have chosen to affix to it.</hi> Yea, though
those forms be never so certainly of Divine
Prescription; which, however God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them, were never appointed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by him to be <hi>our Religion,</hi> but to be
subservient helps and means to it. Being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened
by it, they are comly and delightful;
but sever'd and cut off from it, or the course
of vital spirit that should flow into them
being obstructed and represt, they have no
more pleasure in them than a dead arm or
finger. Such Divine appointments themselves,
severed from the things wherein substantial
Religion consists, have been <hi>an abomination
to the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>(Your new Moons and Sabbaths, &amp;c.
my Soul hates),</hi> and then sure there is little
reason <hi>they should be a delight to us.</hi> If they
be, it is as fond and trifling a <hi>delight,</hi> as
when one hath the opportunity of conversing
with some excellent person, to neglect all
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:32156:106"/>
his wise sayings, and pleasant instructive dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and only to please ones self in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his handsom apparel; yea, though I
should know at the same time, that I thereby
greatly displease him whom (as is also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posable)
I were greatly concern'd to please.
Thus it is with them that mind only the
<hi>solemnity</hi> of Gods worship, not the <hi>design.</hi>
And more gross the matter is, with such as
be their observance of the external modes
of Religion, think to expiate the badness of
their most vicious conversation; <hi>That will
steal, and murder, and commit adultery, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the stranger, the fatherless and the widow;
and yet presume to stand before the Lord in his
house,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and cry, the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
This is the Pharisaical Religion, that is scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
in tything <hi>Mint, Annise,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi>
and neglects the weighty things of the Law,
<hi>Justice, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These men <hi>delight</hi> in what not only is
<hi>dead in it self,</hi> but will be <hi>mortal unto them.</hi>
And if the <hi>Divine</hi> Institution of the things
wherewith they so vainly please themselves,
will not bear them out, much less <hi>their own;</hi>
be their discriminating denomination or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
what it will.</p>
               <p>And now all these things (whether seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
or together) and whatever else of like
kind do at the best make but a <hi>dead,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
an <hi>undelightful Religion,</hi> such as hath
no <hi>pleasure</hi> in it, because it hath no <hi>life:</hi> It
remains therefore,</p>
               <p>2. To shew, <hi>how unfit such a Religion is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32156:107"/>
to be chosen or rested in.</hi> And surely since (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from what was formerly said) the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
of men to become <hi>religious or godly,</hi>
is but an inviting them to a state and course
wherein they may <hi>delight themselves with God;</hi>
or to a life of pure and heavenly pleasure;
That is only the <hi>vain shew of Religion,</hi> which
affords <hi>nothing of that pleasure.</hi> And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and foolish is it when Religion it
self is the thing we pretend, to let our selves
be mock'd (as we mock others, and vainly
attempt to mock Him also, who is not to be
mocked) with the meer empty shew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it!</p>
               <p>That we may be here somewhat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
let it be considered,</p>
               <p>1. That the Religion which is <hi>in it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delightful,
is,</hi> for the same reason for which
it is so, <hi>uncapable of growth;</hi> that is, because
it is a <hi>dead thing.</hi> For that reason it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>delight;</hi> and for the same reason admits
not of improvement: It wants the self-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
Principle. <hi>He that drinks of that
water</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>which I shall give
him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>it shall be in him as a well of water spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in him unto life eternal.</hi> That only
Principle of all true Religion and Godliness,
<hi>The Divine Nature,</hi> the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> is of that
heavenly tendency, it aims and aspires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and will never cease shooting up till
it reach Heaven; and the pleasure and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulness</hi>
of it stands much <hi>in its continual
springing up towards a perfect state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> from a grain
of Mustard-seed to the talness of a Cedar.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32156:107"/>
'Tis pleasant to behold its constant undecay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greenness and verdure; such as renders
its Subject <hi>like a tree planted by the rivers of
water that brings forth fruit in season, whose
leaf also doth not wither, and whatsoever he
doth prospers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psas. 1.</note> Or as plants <hi>set in the House of
the Lord, that flourish in the Courts of their God.
That shall still bring forth fruit even in old age,<note place="margin">Psal. 92.</note>
and be fat and flourishing.</hi> The dead dry
forms, or other appendages of Religion, that
have no communion with a living root, or
the Religion that is only made up of these,
gives no such hope of improvement. A great
and most considerable prejudice against any
thing that pretends to the name of Religion;
which being at first an imperfect thing (as
that especially which it self is but pretence
and shadow cannot but be) if it shall never
be expected to be better, can have little claim
or title to any excellency. The value even of
true Religion, though it be of an excellent
nature and kind, stands much in the hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and improveableness of it; and is not so
much to be considered in respect of <hi>what it
is,</hi> as what it <hi>shall come to.</hi> This lank spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Religion assoon as you assume and take it
up, you know the best of it. 'Tis not of a
growing thriving kind; Never expect better
of it. 'Tis true, the <hi>notional knowledg, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionativeness,</hi>
and <hi>external observances,</hi> which
we have spoken of, may be so increased, <hi>as an
heap of sand may be;</hi> but the Religion of such
<hi>grows not</hi> as a thing that hath <hi>life in it,</hi> by <hi>vital
self-improvement.</hi>
               </p>

2. <hi>Nor</hi> for the same reason <hi>can it be a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thing.</hi> For it wants what should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. It will, as a vesture, wear and grow
old; or, being as a cloak put on to serve a

easily thrown off, <hi>i. e.</hi> being found to be
more <hi>cumbersom</hi> than <hi>useful.</hi> What hath living
Union with a mans own self, it's neither his
ease nor convenience; he neither affects, nor

               <p>It is given as a character of an <hi>hypocrite</hi>
(one who therefore must be understood to
carry with him some shew and face of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

That is, doth not only say that he <hi>will
not</hi> at all times call upon God, but that 'tis
<hi>absurd</hi> to say or think <hi>that he will.</hi> For it is
an appeal to common reason in the case; as
if it had been said, Can any man think that
such a ones Religion will be lasting? It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a disdain it should be thought so. What?
<hi>he</hi> call upon God at all times; a likely thing!
no; the matter is plain, his Religion is measured
by his secular interest, and he will only be so
long Religious as will serve that purpose. And
the reason is plainly assigned in the foregoing
words, <hi>Will he delight himself in the Almighty?</hi>
His Religion hath no <hi>delight</hi> with it; 'tis a
languid faint spiritless thing, a dead form.
If it had life, it would have pleasure in it;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:32156:108"/>
and then the same vital principle that would
make it pleasant, would make it lasting and
permanent also.</p>
               <p>3. While it doth last, <hi>it wants the fruit
and profit, which should be designed and sought
by Religion;</hi> even for the same reason for
which it is without <hi>delight,</hi> it is also fruitless
and vain, <hi>i. e. because it hath no life in it:</hi> So
that all that is done in this way of Religion
is only <hi>labour and toil</hi> to no purpose. And
what <hi>do</hi> or <hi>can</hi> we propose to our selves from
Religion, as the proper design of it, but <hi>to
have our spirits fitted to the honouring and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of God, unto service to him, and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in him;</hi> and that we may hereupon, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
both serve and enjoy him? Both these
chiefly depend upon his favourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of us. He will neither reckon himself
served by us, nor allow himself to be enjoyed,
if he be not pleased with us. And how shall
we expect to please him with <hi>that,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
the more our minds come to be rectified
and made conformable to the rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and life, the more impossible it is that we
can be pleased our selves? Can we please him
by a Religion that is in it self unsavoury, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritless
and dead; and that affords not <hi>to our
selves</hi> the least relish of true pleasure? And
partly the success of our Religion in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
respects, depends upon the due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
our spirits receive by it; But what
good impression can that light chaffie empty
Religion, that hath been described, ever be
hoped to make there? Is it a likely means of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:32156:109"/>
refining and bettering our spirits? Even as
it is void of spiritual <hi>delight</hi> it's also of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
benefit; for certainly our spirits are like
to embrace and retain nothing in which they
can take no pleasure. How vain then is that
Religion by which we can neither please God
nor profit our selves?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It ought to be considered how foolish a thing
it is, and unworthy of a reasonable creature to do
that in a continued course and</hi> series <hi>of actions
wherein we can have no design, and do aim at
nothing;</hi> Even they that place their Religion
in things so remote and alien to the Spirit
and power of it, do yet spend a considerable
part of their lifes-time in those things. And
how becoming is it of a man to have spent
so much of his time in doing nothing? And
that from week to week, or from day to day,
the seasons should return, of which he hath
constantly this to say, Now comes the time
of doing that whereof I can give no account
why I do it!</p>
               <p>That there should be so constant a defalca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such portions of time for that which
a man can neither call business nor recreation,
which tends to no advantage in any kind.
For it tends not to promote his secular interest
but in so indirect and by-a-way, and with so
sinister and basely-oblique respects, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man would abhor, and an ingenious
man be ashamed to profess; And his spiritual
and eternal interest much less. This were
therefore the same thing as to proclaim ones
self a fool or a vain trifler. The things that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32156:109"/>
have been instanc't in (considered so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly
from the substance of Religion, as
we have considered them) being such, <hi>some of
them,</hi> as carry not with them so much as
that very <hi>shew of wisdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note> of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks: And <hi>others of them,</hi> so faint a
shew, as it ill becomes a wise man to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, while they do his better part no
good, and carry not <hi>that shew</hi> in any <hi>provision</hi>
(as that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sometimes signifies) <hi>for
the satisfying of the flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet it is to be withal remembred that
this <hi>(waste and lost)</hi> time of their life, is all
that such persons allot to their everlasting
concernments; and that the things which have
been mentioned (some or other of them; for
all do not always concur with the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
are not made <hi>subservient to;</hi> but are
<hi>substituted in the room and stead of</hi> the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by which those concernments should be
provided for. And is this a wise provision
for Eternity? What, man? A few empty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved
notions! a by-opinion or two!
the flourishes of a little pedantique art tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thy toyish fancy! the motion of thy
<hi>(only)</hi> busie and labouring tongue! or
the thirst and satisfaction of thy vain ear!
the bowing of thy hypocritical knee! Are
these all that thou designest, or will mind to
do for thy Soul? Are these like well to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of <hi>living Religion?</hi> to serve thee
instead of inward acquaintance with God?
of being really and habitually good and holy?
of doing good and walking in the path of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32156:110"/>
life? What a Soul hast thou that can live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
chaff and air, and be sustained by the
wind? Hast thou no need of quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
from God? no hunger after the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
hidden Manna? and the fruits of the
Tree of Life? What use makest thou of
thy Understanding, or of the Reason of a
man, when thou thinkest such empty vanities
as thou trustest in can do the office, or attain
the ends of true Religion? How much more
rational were it to pretend to nothing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
at all, than to think such a one will
serve the turn!</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Consider, what reflections are likely to be
made upon this matter hereafter, when thy short
course in this world is run out.</hi> Will it be a
grateful remembrance to thee that thou wast
so long hovering about the borders of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
and wast at the very door and wouldst
not enter in? That thou didst so often think
and speak, and hear of the things wherein
Religion stood, but wouldst never allow thy
self to taste the pleasant relishes thereof? To
have been so nigh to the Kingdom of God,
and yet an alien to it, to <hi>the righteousness and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost</hi> wherein it
consists! That thou didst only please thy self
with the painted Casket (made fine, as thou
thought'st, but only with thine own Pencil)
wherein so rich a Jewel was; and retaining
<hi>that,</hi> threw'st away <hi>this</hi> as a thing of nought!
will not these be wounding thoughts?</p>
               <p>6. Let it be seriously pondered how offensive
it must be to the jealous God that any should thus
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:32156:110"/>
trifle with him and his holy things, under a
shew and pretence of Religion and Devotion to
him. <hi>Not to</hi> please <hi>him by the</hi> sincerity and
truth of our Religion, <hi>loses the</hi> end <hi>and</hi> reward
<hi>we would expect. But that is not all. To</hi>
provoke <hi>him by the</hi> hypocritical pretence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of it, <hi>cannot but infer a sharp</hi> revenge
<hi>which it may be we expected not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let us bethink our selves how high the
provocation is: Either we design to <hi>please,
honour</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> him by that irrational and
undelightful course of Religion, or we do
not; If we do not, This signifies nothing
but highest contempt and defiance of him;
and that we care not for his favour, nor fear
his displeasure: Yea, inasmuch as such Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is <hi>pretended</hi> as an homage to him, it <hi>is</hi>
nothing really but most profane and insolent
mockery; as if we would join in the same
breath and in the same act, <hi>Hail Jesus and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him;</hi> and at once invest him with the
purple Robe, and spit in his Face: But if we
have such a Design, and do really think to
please him by such trifling with him; and
that these vain fancies and formalities shall
make amends for all our neglects of him
through the whole course of our lives besides;
Then how vile thoughts have we of him!
what do we make of the God we serve? How
justly may that be applied to us, <hi>Ye worship
ye know not what!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> Who gave us our <hi>Idaea</hi> of
that ever blessed Being? It is not God, but a
despicable Idol of our own creating we are
thinking to please. We may see how well he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:32156:111"/>
is pleased with the external shew and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages
of Religion (which being his own
appointments would in conjunction and in
subserviency thereto have signified somewhat,
but disjoined from it, and accompanied with
the neglect and abandoning of real piety, and
righteousness signified nothing but an affront
to him) in that remonstrance by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
<hi>He that killeth an oxe is as if he slew
a man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he
cut off a dogs neck; He that offereth an Oblation
as if he offered swines blood; He that burneth
Incense as if he blessed an Idol.</hi> He is pleased
with their <hi>Religion</hi> as he would be with
<hi>murder, profaneness</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And is it
strange this should be his estimate, when he is
hereby practically represented as such a one
that will not be <hi>displeased</hi> with real wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that will be <hi>pleased</hi> with the
thinnest and most superficial shew of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?</p>
               <p>They therefore make a fair hand of their
Religion, who are so far from pleasing God
by it and advantaging themselves, that they
wound their own Souls (as they are most
like to do that handle so awkardly such
an edg'd tool) and render God their most
avowed enemy. The Religion then which
hath no <hi>delight</hi> in it hath so much of folly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity
and mischief, that measuring it
by the Rules which were premised, we may
see sufficient reason why such a Religion
should not be chosen or rested in. And that
we are concerned to look further.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:32156:111"/>
Wherefore we proceed next,</p>
               <p>2. To the other Head we proposed, The
positive judgment we are to make, <hi>What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is fit to be chosen,</hi> and wherein we may
safely acquiesce; whereof we shall only give
the account which the subject we have in
hand allows to be here given, <hi>i. e. That it
be such as is in it self rationally and justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable.</hi>
And though Religion is not to be
chosen only, or chiefly, for the <hi>delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it;</hi> yet since, as we have seen, only
that Religion is <hi>true</hi> which is <hi>delightful;</hi> that
only which is <hi>delightful</hi> is fit to be <hi>chosen.</hi> So
that this is a <hi>certain character</hi> (though not
the <hi>chief cause)</hi> of the eligibleness of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And when it is so expresly enjoyn'd
us as a duty, <hi>To delight our selves in the Lord;</hi>
If, as hath been shew'n, this be within the
meaning of the Precept, That, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
we delight our selves in a way and course
of Religion; It is plain, such Religion only
can be meant or intended, as can afford us
<hi>matter of delight,</hi> or as is in it self truly and
really <hi>delectable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we shall not need to repeat what
hath been so largely discoursed in the <hi>former
part,</hi> tending to shew the rich matter of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
which the several exercises of <hi>true living
Religion,</hi> and all the actions influenced and
directed by it, do carry in them. It will only
be requisite, to offer somewhat partly <hi>to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,</hi>
partly <hi>to excite</hi> unto that <hi>de<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="7 letters">
                        <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>l plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:32156:112"/>
1. For <hi>Direction,</hi> Let such Rules be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
as these which follow.</p>
               <p>1. Endeavour to have a mind well-instructed
in the knowledg of such things as more directly
concern the common practice of a Religious man,
as such. <hi>That is, to be throughly insight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into</hi> practical Truths, <hi>or into that</hi> Truth
which is after Godliness.</p>
               <p>It hath been the merciful vouchsafement
of the Divine Goodness, so to order it, that
those things are plain and but few, which
are of more absolute necessity in Religion;
as may be seen by the summary accounts which
we find sometimes given thereof, <hi>Repentance
towards God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and Faith towards our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ;</hi> which two things (intimated to
comprehend the whole Counsel of God) do
manifestly <hi>suppose</hi> the state of <hi>apostacy,</hi> and
<hi>express</hi> the way of <hi>remedy;</hi> whereinto, when
we are brought, How succinct and clear a
recapitulation of our Duty have we in that
of our Saviour, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind: And thou shalt love thy
Neighbbour as thy self!</hi> To a well-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion'd
spirit, how comprehensive and
full, how savoury and acceptable will these
things appear! Nor would such a one part
with the substantial fulness of these few words
for all the treasures of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> How
truly is it called,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2</note> 
                  <hi>That good, that acceptable and
perfect will of God!</hi> And how fitly to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before thousands of Gold and Silver!</p>
               <p>Things of highest value are not bulky;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:32156:112"/>
their excellency is the greater by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted;
and that, being in themselves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
they are so conveniently portable. How
easily are these dictates carried about with us
through our whole course! And how uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
useful are they for the well-guiding
of it, to such as have a greater mind to do
their duty than move questions about it!</p>
               <p>Two things are both opposite to this
Rule, and not a little prejudicial to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
of Religious conversation, (by which
it will appear, how conducible to it the
matter here directed is), <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Excessive curiosity</hi> in the speculation of <hi>Truths</hi>
belonging to Religion; without designing to
refer them to <hi>practice;</hi> which hath been ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted
on before. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An equally-excessive scrupulosity about matters
of practice.</hi> It were indeed an argument of
a desperate mind, and destitute of any fear
of God, To be careless what we do, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
whether the way we take, in this
or that case, be right or wrong. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there may be an excess in this matter,
and too often is; that is, there may be a
scrupulosity which is both causless and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
There is surely some <hi>medium</hi> in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
between a careless wandering we mind
not whether, and a perpetual anxiety whether
we be in our way or no, with often going
back to enquire. This would quite destroy
both the pleasure of the journey, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of it. Some difficulties may occur, which
should justly occasion one to make a stand and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32156:113"/>
consider: But probably, very many cases that
some do agitate with much disquiet to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, would soonest be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>sincerity,</hi> and reducing them to the
<hi>Law of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would however make much for our
pleasant delightful walking on in the way of
God, To have a mind (informed once and
establisht throughly in the belief of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Doctrines of Christian Religion) well
furnisht also with the most useful practical
Precepts, which might at every turn be ready
at hand to be apply'd upon emergencies;
which they whom predominant self-interest
or corrupt inclination render not difficult to
the apprehending of their duty, (our way
is not usually otherwise so very intricate), may
cheerfully and innocently guide themselves
by. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely.</hi>
Though some mens way may, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of their conditions, be much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
than others, who are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to be the more wary. But the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
toil and tug that some have with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
is, how by contrived explications they
may make their Rule bend and yeild to their
self-byast humours and ends; which because
they find it not easie to do, with full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to their consciences, (that see more
than they would have them, and are yet not
of authority enough with them to govern
and command their practice), it is not
strange, they intangle and even lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
amongst thorns and briars, and meet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:32156:113"/>
with little <hi>delight</hi> in their way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Be principally intent to have your Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
habitually good and holy, by its own setled
temper and complexion inclin'd and made su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the way of righteousness and life.</hi> It
was, no doubt, with a very sweet gust and
relish of pleasure, that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> utters that
gratulatory acknowledgment of the Divine
goodness in this,<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>He restoreth my Soul; he
leadeth me in paths of righteousness, for his
names sake.</hi> The paths of righteousness are
very agreeable and pleasant to a restored, a
sound and healthy Soul; to one that is now
got into a good habit, and a setled state of
spiritual strength. You may therefore take
the meaning and substance of this <hi>Precept,</hi>
in the Apostles (more-authoritative) words,
<hi>Be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2</note>
                  <hi>that ye may prove what is that good, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and perfect will of God.</hi> You can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>(q. d.)</hi> have a proof it (the very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of your Soul will be vicious and still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
till then, that is,) till that transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and renewing change have past upon
you. Then it will be pleasant to you <hi>to know
the will of God;</hi> your <hi>delight</hi> will be <hi>in the
Law of the Lord, and in his Law you will me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
both day and night.</hi> And it will be more
pleasant <hi>to do it.</hi> You will esteem <hi>the words
of his mouth as your appointed food, and it will
be as your meat and drink to do his will.</hi> You
can easily apprehend how toilsom and painful
any thing of business and labour is to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:32156:114"/>
that languishes under some enfeebling la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
disease: A like case it is, when you would
put one upon doing of any thing spiritually
good, that is listless, indispos'd, <hi>to every good
work reprobate.</hi> How will the heart recoil and
give back! with how vehement a reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will it resist the proposal, as if you were
urging it upon flames or the Swords point!
<hi>The carnal mind is enmity against God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and is

as care about an Infant ceases not as soon as it
is born. Let it be therefore your constant
business, to tend your inward man; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all things will soon be out of course:
God hath coupled <hi>delight</hi> with the <hi>labour</hi> of
a Christian, not with the <hi>sloth</hi> and neglect of
himself;<note place="margin">Prov. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The heart must then be kept with all
diligence,</hi> or above all keeping, in as much as
out of it are the <hi>issues of life:</hi> All vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are lodg'd there; and only the genuine
issues of such as are good and holy, will
yeild you pleasure. The exercises of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will be <hi>pleasant</hi> when they are <hi>natural,</hi>
and flow easily from their own fountain;
but great care must be taken that the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:32156:115"/>
be kept pure. There are other springs
besides, which will be apt to intermingle
therewith their bitter waters, or a root of
bitterness, whose fruit is deadly, <hi>even that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
thing, and bitter forsaking the Lord.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not, if they taste little of the <hi>delights</hi> of
Religion that take no heed to their spirits.
Such a curse is upon the nature of man, as is
upon the ground which was cursed for his
sake, (till the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> through
Jesus Christ do take place,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 14.</note> even the Promise
of the Spirit), that it brings forth naturally
thorns and thistles, and mingles sorrows with
his bread. But that promised blessing, that
will enable a man <hi>to eat with pleasure,</hi> comes
not all at once; nor do the encreases of it
come on, or the pleasant fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
spring up, but in them that <hi>give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Pet. 1.</note>
                  <hi>to add to their faith, vertue; and to
vertue, knowledg; and to knowledg, temperance;
and to temperance, patience; and to patience,
godliness; and to godliness, brotherly-kindness;
and to brotherly-kindness, charity:</hi> Which would
make <hi>that we be not barren nor unfruitful in
the knowledg of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
look in upon thy Soul when thou wilt,
and thou wilt have no other than the dismal
prospect of miserable wastes and desolation.
Consider it seriously, wretched man! who
tillest thy Field, but not thy Soul; and lovest
to see thy Garden neat and flourishing, but
lettest thy Spirit lye as a neglected thing, and
as if it were not thine.</p>
               <p>We are directed for the moderating of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32156:115"/>
our care in our earthly concernments, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Lillies how they grow without their own
toil,</hi> and are beautifully array'd without their
spinning; But we are taught by no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to divert or remit our care of our
inward man. To these concernments, let us
then apply and bend our selves; That is,
carefully to observe the first stirrings of our
thoughts and desires; to animadvert upon our
inclinations assoon as they can come in view,
upon our designs in their very formation; and
enquire concerning each, whence is it? from a
good Principle or a bad? whither tends it? to
good or hurt? will not this design, if prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
prove an unjustifiable self-indulgence?
Does it not tend to an unlawful gratifying of
the flesh, and fulfilling some lusts thereof? If
so, let it be lop't off our of hand, and the
axe be laid even to the root: strike at it, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it not: Think with thy self, this, if spared,
will breed me sorrow; so much as I give to
it, I take away from the comfort of my life;
and spend of the stock of my spiritual <hi>delight
in God;</hi> Shall I let sin, the tormentor of my
Soul, live and be mantain'd at so costly a
rate? If any good inclination discover it self,
cherish it, confirm and strengthen it. <hi>Look
up,</hi> and pray down a further quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence;
Say with thy self, now that heavenly
Spirit of Life and Grace begins to breath,
More of this pleasant vital breath thou bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and holy Spirit! Account this a Seed-time,
Now the <hi>light and gladness</hi> are a sowing
in thy soul (which are wont to be for the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:32156:116"/>
righteous and upright in heart), and do
promise ere long, a joyful Harvest.</p>
               <p>But if thou wilt not observe how things go
with thy Soul, despair that they will ever
go well.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Be frequent and impartial in the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of gracious Principles; or in practising and
doing as they direct:</hi> Your <hi>actual delight</hi> arises
from and accompanies your <hi>holy actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
and is to be perceived and tasted in
them; not in the meer inclination to them
which is not strong enough to go forth into
act. And as these Principles are <hi>more frequently
exercised,</hi> they grow more lively and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and will thence act more strongly and
pleasantly; so that your <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>doing good,</hi>
will grow with the Principles it proceeds
from.</p>
               <p>But then you must be impartial and <hi>even-handed</hi>
herein, as well as <hi>frequent;</hi> and run
the whole compass of that Duty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to you as a Christian.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Exercise your
self</hi> (as we find the direction is) <hi>unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and in such acts and parts of godliness
chiefly and in the first place, as may be the
exercise of the mind and spirit, in opposition
to the <hi>bodily exercise</hi> (whether severities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon, or performances that require the
Ministery of that grosser part) to which this
nobler kind of exercise is justly prefer'd. Turn
the powers of your soul upon God; Act
<hi>seasonably</hi> the several graces of the Spirit that
terminate directly upon him. Let none grow
out of use. At some times <hi>Repentance,</hi> at
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:32156:116"/>
others <hi>Faith,</hi> now your <hi>Love,</hi> then your
<hi>Fear;</hi> none of these are placed in you, or
are sanctified in vain. Retire much with
God; learn and habituate your selves unto
secret converse with him; contemplate his
Nature, Attributes and Works for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
to holy <hi>Adoration, Reverence</hi> and
<hi>Praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And be much exercised in the <hi>open Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
of his Worship; there endeavouring
that though your inward man bear not the
<hi>only,</hi> it may the <hi>principal</hi> part. How delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a thing is it, to be paying actual avow'd
homage to the great Lord of Heaven and
Earth before Angels and Men!</p>
               <p>And never think your Religious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional
Exercises can acquit you, or supply
the want and excuse the absence of <hi>Sobriety</hi>
and <hi>Righteousness.</hi> Exercise a just authority
over your selves. Keep your imagination,
passions, sensitive appetite under a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
so as to be moderate in your desires
and enjoyments, patient as to your wants and
sufferings: Do to others as you would be
done unto: Study common good: Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
so far as your capacity can extend, all
about you may be the better for you: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
and forgive the injurious, relieve the
necessitous, delight in good men, pity the
bad, be grateful towards friends, mild and
unrevengeful towards enemies, just towards
all: Abhor to do not only a dishonest, but
even a mean and unworthy act, for any self-advantage:
And all this out of an awful and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:32156:117"/>
dutiful respect to God; by which the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
actions of your life may become as so
many acts of Religion, or be directed and
influenc't thereby, tinctured as it were with
the savour of godliness. Pass thus, in your
continual practice, through the whole circle
of Christian Duties and Graces, with an
equal <hi>respect to all Gods Commandments,</hi> not
so partially addicting your selves to one sort
of exercise, as to disuse and neglect the rest;
which kind of partiality is that which starves
Religion, and stifles the delight of it.</p>
               <p>There are those that affect the reputation
of being sober, just, kind, charitable persons,
and do appear such, who yet are great stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to God, and to the more noble exercises
of the Divine Life, know not what belongs to
communion with God, live not in his love
and converse, savour not heaven; have not
so much as the taste of the great vital powers
of the world to come. Others, that pretend
to much acquaintance with God, and are
much taken up in discoursing of his love, and
of intimacies with him, that count Justice
and Charity mean things, and much beneath
them; can allow themselves to be covetous,
oppressive, fraudulent, wrathful, malicious,
peevish, fretful, discontented, proud, censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
merciless; and so glory in a Religion
which no one is the better for, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
least of all; and which is quite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
stamp from the <hi>pure Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note>
which the Apostle describes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends.
And certainly, their Religion hath
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:32156:117"/>
as little of pleasure in it to themselves, as it
hath of beauty and ornament in the sight of
others. So maim'd a Religion can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with little delight. Would it not
detract much from the natural pleasure of a
mans life, if he should lose an arm or a leg?
or have them useless and unserviceable? Or
if he should be deprived of some of his senses,
or natural faculties, so as to be uncapable of
some of the more principal functions of life?
And if we should suppose the <hi>new creature</hi>
alike maimed and defective, will there not be
a proportionable diminution of its delight?
But the Spirit of God is the Author of no
such imperfect productions; and therefore
the total absence of any holy disposition will
not argue the <hi>true delight</hi> of such a one to
be <hi>little,</hi> but <hi>none at all.</hi> However, let all the
integral parts of the <hi>new man</hi> be supposed
formed at first, and existing together; when
this creature is thus entirely framed, it is our
business to see to the due exercise, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to the improvement and growth of the
several parts, wherein if one be neglected, it
infers a general enfeeblement of the whole.
<hi>Let patience have its perfect work</hi> (saith that
Apostle),<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye may be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That not only the absence of that one
grace, but its not being throughly exercised,
would render us very defective Christians.
We may say of the several members of this
Divine Creature, as is said of the complex
body of Christians, <hi>If one suffer, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
suffer with it; if one be honoured, all rejoice
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:32156:118"/>
with it.</hi> Therefore that you may experience
the <hi>delightfulness</hi> of Religion, see that in the
exercise and practice of it you be <hi>entire, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Be confirmed in the apprehension, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is in it self a delightful thing, even uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
and in the whole nature of it. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a double practical mistake and error will
be avoided, that greatly obstructs and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the actual relish and sensation of that</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>1. That either Religion is in the whole
nature of it such a thing to which <hi>delight</hi> must
be alien, and banisht from it: As if nothing
did belong to, or could consist with it, but
sowre severities, pensiveness and sad thoughts.
Or else,</p>
               <p>2. That if any <hi>delight</hi> did belong to it at
all, it must be found only in peculiar extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
assurances and perswasions of Gods
love; and be the attainment consequently of
none but more eminent Christians.</p>
               <p>That apprehension being throughly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
both these misapprehensions fall and
vanish. And it will take place, if it be duly
considered, <hi>That there is a delight that will
naturally arise from the congruity and fitness of
actions in themselves, and the facility of them,
that they flow easily from their proper principles.</hi>
Whereupon there can be no true vital act of
Religion but will be <hi>delightful.</hi> And we may
appeal herein to the judgments of such as
shall allow themselves to consider, whether
the matter do not evidently appear to be so
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:32156:118"/>
upon a serious review and revolving with
themselves of the several gracious operations
that proceed from the holy rectitude men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the former part; as the acts of
even <hi>Repentance, self-abasement, self-denial,
self-devoting,</hi> (appearing to be in themselves
most fit and becoming things), and readily
without force proceeding (as they cannot
but do) from a rectified and well-disposed
heart, how can they but be pleasant? And it is
much in our way to the experiencing of such
<hi>delight,</hi> to be at a point with our selves, and
well-resolved wherein it is to be sought and
found.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>However all the acts and operations of
true, and living Religion be in themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
yet apply your selves to the doing of
them for an higher reason, and with a greater
design than your own delight.</hi> Otherwise you
destroy your own work therein, and dispoil
your acts of their <hi>substantial moral goodness,</hi>
and consequently of their <hi>delightfulness</hi> also.
That is not a morally good act, which is
not <hi>refer'd to God,</hi> and done out of (at least)
an <hi>habitual devotedness</hi> to him, so as that he
be the supream end thereof. You would
therefore, by with-drawing and separating
their reference to God, ravish from them their
very life and soul; yea and perfectly nullifie
those of them that should be <hi>in themselves</hi>
acts of Religion. So as that <hi>in respect of all
your actions,</hi> that <hi>separation</hi> were <hi>unjust;</hi> and
<hi>as to these</hi> that should be direct acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>impossible.</hi> Since therefore they are
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:32156:119"/>
only <hi>delightful</hi> as they are <hi>vital acts, proceeding
from a principle of Divine Life;</hi> and that an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
devotedness to God,</hi> is that very (compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
and most radical) <hi>principle;</hi> you should,
by designing your own <hi>delight</hi> in them su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamly,
counter-act your self, and cross your
own end; you should make them acts of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
not Religion; and set up your <hi>own
self</hi> as the Idol of Jealousie, that receives the
homage of them, instead of God: Whereby
the unlawful pleasure which you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
to your selves, will turn all to gall
and wormwood, and be bitterness in the
end.</p>
               <p>That therefore you may taste the sweetness
and pleasure which belongs to a religious
godly life, your way must be, <hi>to act on direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forward in the simplicity of your heart, doing
all that you do to and for God.</hi> And thus that
pleasure, because it is natural to such acts,
will of its own accord result and arise to you;
and so much the more, by how much less
you design for your self in what you do.
From that uprightness and sincerity of heart
towards God it can never be separated. But
to be a Religious <hi>Epicure,</hi> to pray, hear, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
do acts of justice and charity, only to
please and humour your selves, and that you
may derive a kind of solace and satisfaction
from your own work, is to undo your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi>
and blast the <hi>Delight</hi> which you co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.
It follows while you seek it not; It
flies from you while you so inordinately seek
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:32156:119"/>
7. <hi>Yet disallow not your self to taste and enjoy
the pleasure of well-doing: Yea, and (seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and in due subordination) to design and
endeavour that you may do so.</hi> It is in it self, a
<hi>covetable and a lawful pleasure;</hi> so that it be
not sought and entertain'd out of its own
place.<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 14.</note> It is a <hi>promised pleasure, The good
man</hi> (it is said) <hi>shall be satisfied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
And it is by particular direction to be
testified to the <hi>righteous, they shall eat the fruit
of their own doings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 3. 10.</note> It's Gods gracious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
to them, which it is a part of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and dutifulness to esteem and accept;
yea, and with great admiration of the Divine
Goodness, that hath made and setled such a
conjunction between their Duty and their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi>
that hath laid such Laws upon them,
as in the keeping whereof there is such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;<note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note>
when-as they might have been enjoined
a meaner servitude, and by the <hi>condition</hi> and
<hi>kind</hi> of their work, have been kept strangers
to any thing of <hi>delight</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>That thankful acknowledgment of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and goodness of God to them in the very
constitution of his Laws and Government, is
become a <hi>part of their duty,</hi> which cannot be
done without previous relishes of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and goodness of their <hi>other duty.</hi> They
are required <hi>in every thing to give thanks:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.</note> And
it is said,<note place="margin">Isa. 51.</note> they shall go on in their way as the
<hi>redeemed of the Lord, with everlasting joy upon
their heads;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 138.</note> That they shall <hi>sing in the ways of
the Lord;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3.</note> which cannot be, if they take not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<hi>that the ways of the Lord are pleasantness, &amp;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:32156:120"/>
all his paths peace.</hi> Therefore you should
designedly set your self to taste the goodness
and <hi>delightfulness</hi> of <hi>holy walking.</hi> And to
that end, when you find the blessed cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warmth and vigour of Gods gracious
communication let in upon you, inlarging
your hearts, making your way and work easie
to you, and helping you to do with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toilsom
facility, what he requires and calls
for, and to <hi>run the way of his Commandments;</hi>
so that you can do acts of piety, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and mercy <hi>as natural acts,</hi> born up by the
power of a steady living Principle acting in
you,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.</note> (as it's said, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew strength and mount up with wings as
Eagles, run without weariness, and walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fainting);</hi> You should now reflect and
take notice how good and pleasant is this!
Make your pauses and deliberate; have your
seasons of respiration and drawing breath;
and then bethink your self, commune thus
with your own heart; How do I now like the
way and service of the Lord? and a life of
pure devotedness to him? a course of regular
walking in through subjection to his Laws
and Government? and that the course of my
actions be as a continual sacrificing; <hi>doing all
to him and for him?</hi> what do you not now
<hi>rejoice that you find your selves to offer willingly?</hi>
Can you forbear with gratitude and joy to
acknowledg and own it to him, that it is <hi>of
his own hand</hi> that you do this? You should
now compare your present with your former
state and temper, and consider how much
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:32156:120"/>
better is it to me to live in his <hi>fear, love</hi> and
<hi>communion,</hi> than to be, as once I was, <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the life of God,</hi> and as <hi>without him
in the world! Now</hi> I can <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>obey, once</hi> I
could not: <hi>Now,</hi> when the opportunity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
I am in some readiness to serve him, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to good works, a vessel fitted to my Masters
use; Some time</hi> I was to every good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.
Surely it is most becoming to take
a free complacency in this blessed change;
That is not with a proud Pharisaical glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
to say, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as
other men;</hi> or, <hi>trusting in your self that you
are righteous, to despise others;</hi> but with a
mean estimation of your self, and all you
can do; and with that deep and constant
sense, that <hi>when you have done all you can, you
are an unprofitable servant, you do but your duty.</hi>
Yet blessing God that since he hath made such
things your duty, he also doth in some measure
enable you to do it; That he hath reconciled
and attemper'd your heart to your way and
work, and made it pleasant to you: Not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically
arrogating all to your self, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the formal and false shew of thanksgiving
to him; or aiming only more colourably to
introduce a vain boast and ostentation of your
self, in the form of gratulation to God; but
as having an heart inwardly possest with the
humble sense who it is that hath <hi>made you
differ,</hi> not only from other men, but from
your self also.</p>
               <p>8. And because that disposedness of heart
unto such a course of holy practice, may not be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:32156:121"/>
constantly actual, and equally sensible at all
times <hi>(That all</hi> delight <hi>in the ways of God
may not hereupon cease, and be broken off,
which in those sadder intervals cannot but
suffer a great diminution);</hi> You must take heed,
that as to the distempers and indispositions you
now discern in your own spirit, you do neither
indulge your self nor despair; But take the proper
course of redress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To indulge your self in them were mortal.</hi>
Then down you go as a dead weight into the
mire and dirt, into the depths of the earth, and
your swift and pleasant flight ends in an heavy
lumpish fall. You should therefore bethink your
self, That if you yield to a slothful sluggish
temper of spirit, which you now feel coming on
upon you, shortly you shall have nothing (sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly)
remaining to you of your Religion, but
the dead and empty form; How waste and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
a thing will that be! A like thing as if
you come into a deserted house where you
were wont pleasantly to converse with most
<hi>delectable</hi> friends, and you now find nothing
but cold bare walls. How dismal will it be
when only the same duties, the same external
frame and acts of worship remain, but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life and power which was wont to breath
in them, is retired and gone! And what, will
you take up with that delusive unconversible
shadow, or be content to embrace the stiff and
breathless carcase that remains? You find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
your spirit sinking into carnality, an
earthly temper of mind gradually seizing on
you; worldly thoughts, cares, desires, fears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:32156:121"/>
your heart, by the same degrees that
these come on, life retires; you grow listless
toward God; your heart is not in your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as heretofore: You keep up your fashion
of praying, and doing other duties which
were your former wont; but you languish in
them: Can you here be content to lie still
and die? And rather chuse to suffer the pains
of <hi>death</hi> than of <hi>labour,</hi> by which your Soul
might yet live? Is this a time to roll your self
upon your slothful bed, and say, <hi>Soul, take
thine ease,</hi> even upon the pits brink? Do not
agree the matter so. Think not of making a
covenant with Death; It is not so gentle a
thing as your slothful temper makes you think;
Account the state intolerable wherein you are
so manifestly tending towards it. Think not
well of your self and your present case: What
reason soever any have to be pleased and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi>
with a course of lively converse with
God, and of walking in the Spirit; so much
reason you have to be displeased with your
self as your case now is; To dislike and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the present temper of your own Soul. If
the life of Religion, and its vigorous exercises
be <hi>delightful,</hi> by that very reason it appears
its faint and sickly languishings are not so.</p>
               <p>Therefore know, that self-indulgence is
now most unsutable and dangerous. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to awaken in your selves some sense of
your condition. Think whither am I going?
Represent to your own Soul the terrors of
Death. Admit the impression thereof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
its frightful visage, and be startled at it.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:32156:122"/>
Recount with your self what you shall be if
God who is your life quite depart; If this
shall never be, yet know that your fear lest it
should is the means of your preservation. And
let the apprehension of the tendency of
your distemper excite in you that just and
seasonable fear. How sure soever you are of
<hi>the principle</hi> that <hi>God will never utterly forsake
those that are his</hi> (as most certainly he never
will); yet you cannot be so sure of your
application of it to your self, as your case
stands, but that there will now be room for
this fear; Therefore let it be entertained.</p>
               <p>But though you admit a just and very soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
<hi>Fear,</hi> be sure that you exclude not
<hi>Hope:</hi> Though you apprehend your case dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
look not upon it as desperate. Your
hope must not be in your self, but in him that
raises the dead, and calleth things that are
not, as though they were; yea, makes them
exist and be. But if you cast away all hope,
you yield your self to perish. This stops your
breath; so that even all strugglings for life,
and the very gaspings of your fainting heart
must immediately cease, and end in perfect
death. The <hi>danger</hi> of your case, as bad as it
is, calls not for this; nor will the <hi>exigency</hi> of
it comport with it, when once the Soul says
<hi>there is no hope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 25.</note> it immediately procceeds to
say, <hi>I have loved strangers and after them will I
go.</hi> Your Hope is as necessary to your safety
as your Fear;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>we are saved by Hope,</hi> i. e. <hi>of
the end it self,</hi> which therefore animates to all
the encounters and difficulties of our way,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:32156:122"/>
as well from within as from without. Great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
appear in you and often return; yea,
such as are of a threatning aspect and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
You should yet consider you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cure: The prescribed means and method
whereof are before you. There is Balm in
<hi>Gilead,</hi> and a Physician there. One in whose
hands none that trusted him ever miscarried.
'Tis well if you find your self sick. The whole
need him not, and will not therefore commit
themselves to his care. He hath relieved many
such as you, that <hi>apprehending their case</hi> have
been restored to him; let them despair that
know no such way of help. Say within your
self, though I am faln and low, I shall rise and
stand, <hi>renewed by thee, O my God.</hi> Was there
never such a time with you before, when in
the like case you cried to the Lord and he
answered you,<note place="margin">Psal. 138.</note> and <hi>strengthened you with
strength in your soul?</hi> Say within your self,
<hi>Why art thou cast down,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>O my soul, hope thou
in God; for I shall yet praise him, who is the health
of my countenance</hi> (where health shews it
self in lively, sprightly, pleasant looks) <hi>and
my God.</hi> And this very hope as it preserves
life, so it doth the <hi>delight</hi> and pleasure of life
from being quite extinct. The joy of hope
is not to go for nothing, when it can only be
said; not, <hi>it is well, but, it shall be.</hi> It is
pleasant to consider that the state wherein
Saints on earth are, is a <hi>state of recovery;</hi> That
though it be not a state of <hi>perfect health,</hi> yet
it is not (also) a state of death; but wherein
they are tending to life in the perfection of it.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:32156:123"/>
And their frequent (and very faulty) relapses
shall be found but to magnifie the more the
skill and patience of their great Physician.
Therefore however you are not hence to be
secure, or imposing upon him; yet let not
your hearts sink into an abject despair and
sullen discontent, that you find a distempered
frame sometimes returning. Let there be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
relentings after God. Your heart ought
often to smite you, that you have been no
more careful and watchful; but not admit a
thought, that you will therefore cast off all;
that it's in vain ever to strive more, or seek to
recover that good frame that you have often
found is so soon gone.</p>
               <p>Instead of that apply your self with so
much the more earnestness to the proper
course of remedy; and therein you must
know your own labour and diligence; your
contentions with your self must have a great
place: Otherwise it would never have been
said,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Be watchful and strengthen the things that
remain that are ready to die. And give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to add to your faith vertue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> &amp;c. Such
things would never have been charg'd as duty
upon you if you had nothing to do. You
must expect to be dealt with as a sort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
capable of understanding your own
concernments; not to be hewed and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered
as senseless stones that are ignorant of
the artists intent, but as living ones to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
and fitted to the spiritual building, by
an hand that reasonably expects your own
compliance and co-operation to its <hi>known</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:32156:123"/>
Unto which design though you must
know you are to be <hi>subservient</hi> and must do
something; yet you must withal consider you
can be <hi>but subservient,</hi> and of your selves alone
can do just nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, if ever you would know what a</hi>
life of spiritual delight <hi>means,</hi> you must constantly
strive against all your spiritual distempers that
obstruct it [in the power of the Holy Ghost].</p>
               <p>And do not think that is enjoining you a
course wholly out of <hi>your power;</hi> for though
it be true, that the power of the Holy Ghost
is not <hi>naturally yours,</hi> or at your dispose; yet
by <hi>gracious vouchsafement</hi> and <hi>ordination it is:</hi>
If it were not so,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 10.</note> what means that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power
of his might;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> and that, <hi>If we live in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
let us also walk in the Spirit;</hi> with the
foregoing prescription of <hi>Walking in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 16.</note>
                  <hi>that we might not fulfil the lusts of the
flesh.</hi> Doth the Holy Ghost himself prescribe
to us impertinently, in order to our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own imparted influences? Doth
not He know the method and way wherein
they are to be conveyed? Or would he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us by misrepresenting it? In short,
<hi>Walking in the Spirit</hi> must signifie something;
and what can it signifie less than <hi>dependence</hi> on
its power, and <hi>subjection</hi> thereto, with the
<hi>continuance</hi> of both these? These therefore
are necessary to the making of that <hi>power</hi>
our own:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Dependence</hi> and <hi>trust;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 71. 16</note> as that like phrase
imports, <hi>I will go in the strength of the Lord
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:32156:124"/>
God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zech. 10. 12,</note> And that, <hi>I will strengthen them in
the Lord, and they shall walk up and down in
his name,</hi> at once shews us both the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the Divine Power <hi>[I will strengthen
them in the Lord],</hi> and the way wherein it
is communicated, <hi>[their walking up and down
in his name], viz.</hi> in actual and continued
dependence thereon. The blessed God hath
setled this connexion between our Faith
and his own exerted Power. As the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
works of the Spirit were not done,
but upon the exercise of the extraordinary
Faith, which by the Divine constitution
was requisite thereunto: So that the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which stood in the privation of this Faith,
did sometimes (so inviolable had that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
made that connexion) in a sort bind
up the Power of God,<note place="margin">Mark 6. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>(And he could do no
might works there,—And he marvelled because
of their unbelief.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 19 20.</note>—<hi>Why could not we cast him
out?—Because of your unbelief).</hi> Nor also
are the works of the Holy Ghost, that are
common upon all sincere Christians, done,
but upon the intervening exercise of that
<hi>more-common Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> Therefore is this <hi>Shield</hi>
to be taken <hi>above all</hi> the other parts of the
Divine Armature, as sufficient to quench all
the fiery darts of the wicked; therefore are
we said to be kept <hi>by the Power of God through
Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note>—And more expresly <hi>in terms</hi> to our
present purpose;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>We are to receive the promise of
the Spirit (i. e.</hi> the Spirit promised) <hi>through
Faith.</hi> Hereby we draw the Power of that
Almighty Spirit into a consent and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:32156:124"/>
with our spirit. So the great God
suffers Himself, his own Arm and Power to
be taken hold of by us. He is ingaged when
he is trusted; that <hi>trust</hi> being now in this
case, not a rash and unwarrantable presuming
upon him, but such whereto he hath given
the invitation and encouragement himself.<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 23.</note>
So that when we reflect upon the Promises
wherein the gift of the Spirit is conveyed,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36: 27.</note> or
wherein the express grant there of is folded
up,<note place="margin">With many the like.</note> we may say,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember thy word to thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
wherein thou hast caused me to hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then surely he will not frustrate the
expectation which he hath himself been the
Author of. He would never have induced
those to trust in him, whom he intended to
disappoint. That free Spirit which (as the
Wind blows where it listeth) now permits
it self to be brought under bonds, even the
bonds of Gods own Covenant, whereof we
now take hold by our faith; so that he will
not fail to give forth his influence, so far as
shall be necessary for the maintaining a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in us of stedfast adherence to God and
his service, and retaining a dominion over
undue inclinations and affections.</p>
               <p>How express and peremptory are those
words, <hi>This I say,</hi> (q.d.) (I know what I
say, I have well weigh'd the matter, and speak
not at random) <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye
shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh!</hi> And so
much as this affords great matter of rational
<hi>delight,</hi> though more sensible transports
(which are not so needful to us, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:32156:125"/>
whereto the Spirit therefore retains
its liberty) be not so frequent. Therefore
if we aim at the having our spirits placed and
setled in the secret of the Divine Presence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with the <hi>delights</hi> of it; If we would
<hi>know</hi> and have the sensible proof of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which is all life and power, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>sweetness and pleasure;</hi> our direct
way is believing on the Spirit: That very
<hi>Trust</hi> is his <hi>delight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 147. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He taketh pleasure in them
that hope in his mercy.</hi> It is that whereby we
give him Divine Honour, the homage and
acknowledgment proper to a Deity; confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our selves impotent and <hi>insufficient to think
any thing as of our selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> we rely upon his sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hand, and own our <hi>sufficiency to be of him.</hi>
It is his <hi>delight</hi> to be depended on as a Father
by his children. He is pleased that Title
should be given him <hi>The Father of Spirits.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> To
have the Spirits which are his off-spring ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
about him (especially those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
revolted from him and become sensible of
their misery by their revolt, do now <hi>upon his
invitation</hi> apply themselves, and say, <hi>Lo, now
we come to thee, thou art the Lord our God),</hi> cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his renewed communications, drawing
vital influences from him, and the breath of
life, adoring his boundless fulness that filleth
all in all. And when we thus give him his
<hi>delight,</hi> we shall not long want ours. But
then we must also add,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Subjection</hi> to our <hi>dependence;</hi> a willing
obedient surrender and resignation of our
selves to the conduct and guidance of that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:32156:125"/>
blessed Spirit. A dutiful yielding to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
so as that they have actually with us
the governing binding force and power of a
Law <hi>(The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ
as it is called</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 2</note>) Great care must be taken
of <hi>grieving</hi> and <hi>quenching</hi> the Spirit,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
and <hi>vexing it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of resisting it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 63.</note> and <hi>of stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
against it</hi> (which appears to have been
the horrid crime of the old world:<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it is intimated had striven when it is said
it should <hi>no longer strive;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> And that it had stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
implies a counter-striving that was
now, by his penal retirement permitted to be
victorious, but to their own sudden ruine)
<hi>of despiting the Spirit of grace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29</note> A wickedness
aggravated by the very style and title there
given it, the <hi>Spirit of Grace;</hi> and unto which
only such a vengeance (as it is intimated in
what follows) which it peculiarly belong'd
to God himself to inflict could be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
When we permit our selves entirely
to the government of the Holy Ghost, thereby
to have our spirits and ways framed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
according to his own Rules, His
quickening influence, and the pleasure and
sweet relishes thereof will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
               <p>And if the experience of some Christians
seem not constantly to answer this, who
complain they pray often for the Spirit, and
desire earnestly its gracious communications,
but find little of them, They are concerned
seriously to reflect, and bethink themselves
whether their <hi>distrust</hi> or <hi>disobedience,</hi> or both,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:32156:126"/>
have not made them desolate. Surely we are
altogether faulty in this matter, his promise
and faithfulness do not fail, his Spirit is not
straitned; But we either do not entirely <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
and <hi>entrust</hi> our selves to his guidance, or
we obediently comply not with it; but either
<hi>indulge our sluggishness</hi> and <hi>neglect,</hi> or <hi>our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
inclinations,</hi> and <hi>resist</hi> his dictates, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable
and wayward, not apt <hi>to be led by
the Spirit,</hi> and hence provoke him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from us. Hereto we are in justice to
impute it that we find so little of that power
moving in us, all the motions whereof are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with so much <hi>delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For <hi>Excitation.</hi> Little one would
think should be needful to be said more than
only that we would bethink our selves what
all this while we have been directed to and
are by this Text. If that be once understood,
Hath it not <hi>in it self</hi> invitation enough? Do
we need further to be invited to a <hi>Life of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</hi>
Do we need to be prest with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to chuse <hi>delightful</hi> and wholesom food,
rather than gall and wormwood, or even
very poyson? It is a sad argument of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorate
state of man that he should need argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in such a case! But because (moreover)
much is to be said hereafter, to perswade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>delighting in God</hi> considered in the <hi>stricter
notion of it,</hi> and that will also be applicable to
this purpose; therefore little is intended to be
said here.</p>
               <p>Only it is to be considered, Do you intend
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:32156:126"/>
to proceed in any course of Religion, or no?
If not, you are to be remitted to such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
as prove to you the reasonableness
and necessity of it: Which if you think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
you meet with sufficiently proves, Think
with your self how well you can prove, that
there is no God, and that you are no Man,
but a perishing Beast. For these things they
are concerned <hi>not fondly to presume and wish,</hi>
but most clearly and surely to demonstrate,
who will be of no Religion.</p>
               <p>But if you think that horrid, and resolve
to own something or other of Religion;
Will you here use your understanding, and
consider? Is it indeed so horrid a thing to
disavow all Religion? And what is it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to pretend to it to no purpose? You find
the Religion is all but shew and shadow, meer
empty vanity and mockery, which is not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi>
If you will not chuse a better, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is delightful,</hi> (as you are not advised
to do for <hi>that</hi> as your <hi>chief reason),</hi> yet at
least chuse <hi>that which is so,</hi> because it is in
other more considerable respects eligible, as
being most honourable and pleasing to Him
that made you, and only safe and profitable
to your self. And what shall your Religion
serve for, that will not answer these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses?</p>
               <p>And if you be not <hi>ashamed</hi> to spend so
considerable a part of the time of your life, as
the exercises of your Religion will take up,
in doing that (as was said before) whereof
you can give no account: Yet me-thinks you
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:32156:127"/>
should be <hi>afraid</hi> to make such things the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of your vanity, as do relate to God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>really</hi> or in <hi>your opinion.</hi> Can you find
nothing wherein vainly to trifle, but the
sacred things of the Great God of Heaven,
and the eternal concernments of your own
Soul? And shall the time spent about these
matters be peculiarly <hi>markt out</hi> as your idle
time, wherein you shall be doing that only
which shall wholly go for loss and signifie
nothing? The Religion which is not <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
can turn to no better account.</p>
               <p>If therefore you will have a Religion, and
you have <hi>any reason</hi> for that resolution, by
the <hi>same reason</hi> you would have <hi>any,</hi> you
must have the <hi>pleasant delightful Religion</hi> we
speak of. You have no other choice. There
is no other will serve your turn. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what hath been said to divert you from
the other, ought to perswade you to the choice
of this.</p>
               <p>And besides, since there is so much of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
delight</hi> in true substantial Religion, that
ought not to signifie nothing with you; If
we did consider the <hi>delightfulness</hi> of it <hi>alone,</hi>
upon that <hi>single account,</hi> it surely challenges
the preference, before that which is neither
<hi>profitable</hi> nor <hi>delightful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is in it self so <hi>delightful,</hi> if
you had nothing to inform you but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of such as profess to have tried and
found it so, methinks that at least should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to <hi>try</hi> also. How sluggish a temper
doth it argue, not to be desirous to know the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:32156:127"/>
utmost that is in it! It were even a laudable
curiosity to resolve upon making trial; to
get into the inmost center of it; to pierce and
press onward till you reach the seat of life,
till you have got the secret, and the very
heart of Religion and your heart do meet and
join in one. Did you never try experiments
for your pleasure? Try this one. See what
you will find in withdrawing your self from
all things else, and becoming entirely devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God through the Redeemer, to live
<hi>after his will,</hi> and <hi>in his presence.</hi> Try the
difference between viewing Truths to please
your <hi>genius,</hi> or using Divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to keep up the custom, to conform
your self to those you live among, and help
to make a solemn shew; And doing these
things with a serious design to get into an
acquaintance with God, to have your Soul
transformed into his Image, that you may
have present and eternal fellowship with him.
Try how much better it is, to have your
lives governed by an awful and dutiful respect
to God, than to follow your own wild and
enormous inclinations: And whether it be
not better, what good things soever you do,
to do it for the Lords sake, than from base
and sordid motives.</p>
               <p>And why should you be of so <hi>mean</hi> and
<hi>object</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as to content your self to be
held at the door and in the outer Courts of
Religion; when others enter in and taste the
rich provisions of Gods house? Why will
you <hi>distinguish</hi> your selves by so <hi>debasing</hi> a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:32156:128"/>
character? 'Tis a just and commendable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
to be as forward here as the best.
Why will you suffer <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> and the
<hi>other man</hi> to enter into the Kingdom of God
before you; even that Kingdom <hi>which consists
in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think not so meanly of your self; impose
not on your self that needless unwarrantable
modesty, as to account you are of a lower
rank than all that ever became intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the hidden <hi>delights</hi> of a godly
life; At least you are as capable of being
<hi>thought worthy</hi> as any, for <hi>his sake</hi> upon whose
account all must be accepted: Therefore think
with your selves, <hi>Why should I not labour to
attain as far in the matter of Religion, as this
or that Neighbour of mine? What should hinder?
Who restrains or forbids me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you cannot, if you consider, but have
somewhat more to assure you of the <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
of it, than the meer report of others;
For your own Reason and Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but so pronounce, if you go to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
that have been instanc't in. If you
acknowledg a God, and consider your self as
a reasonable Creature made by him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on him; you cannot but see, it is
congruous and fit your spirit should be so
framed and affected towards Him, towards
your fellow-creatures of your own order,
and all things else that do and shall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate
your present and future state, as
hath been in some measure (though very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively)
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:32156:128"/>
represented; And that it must
needs be very pleasant, if it were so. You
can frame in your mind an <hi>Idea</hi> of a life
transacted according to such rectified incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
And when you have done so, do
but solemnly appeal to your own judgment,
whether that were not a very delectable life?
And thereupon bethink your self, what your
case is, if you cannot actually relish a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in what your own judgment tells you is
so highly pleasurable. Methinks you should
reflect thus, <hi>What a monstrous creature am I,
that confess that delightful wherein yet I can
take no delight! How perverse a nature have
I! Surely things are much out of order with
me; I am not what I should be!</hi> And one
would think, it should be uneasie to you to
be as <hi>you are;</hi> and that your spirit should be
restless till you find your temper rectified, and
that you are in this respect become what you
<hi>should be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And will you dream and slumber all your
days? How much time have you lost, that
might have been pleasantly spent in a course
of godliness! Do you not aim at a life of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>delights</hi> with God? If you now begin not
to <hi>live to God,</hi> when will you? That life which
you reckon shall never end with you, must
yet have a beginning. Will you defer till you
dye your beginning to live? Have you any
hope God will deal in a peculiar way with
you from all men, and make the other world
the place of your first heart-change? How
dismal should it be to you, to look in and still
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:32156:129"/>
find your heart dead towards God, and the
things of God; so that you have no <hi>delight</hi>
in them. Think what the beginnings of the
Divine life, and the present <hi>delights</hi> of it,
must be the earnest of to you, and make
sure the ground <hi>(betime)</hi> of so great an
hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> BUT I forbear here to insist further;
and pass on to the Discourse of <hi>Delighting
in God,</hi> under the other more strict notion of
it, <hi>viz. As the very act of delight hath its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
exercise upon himself.</hi> So we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this <hi>delight,</hi> not as a thing some way
adherent to all other duties of Religion; but
as a distinct Duty of it self, that requires a
<hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> application of our selves
thereunto. For though it seems little to be
doubted, but there is in this Precept a <hi>part</hi> of
Religion put for the <hi>whole</hi> (as having a real
influence, and conferring with its name a
grateful savour and tincture upon the whole);
it would yet be very unreasonable, not to
take <hi>special</hi> notice of <hi>that part</hi> from whence
the <hi>intire frame</hi> of Religion hath its name.</p>
               <p>And having shewn the <hi>nature</hi> of this Duty
already in the <hi>former part,</hi> what is now to be
said, must more directly concern the <hi>practice</hi>
of it; And will (as the case requires) fall
into two kinds of Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:32156:129"/>
                  <hi>Expostulation</hi> concerning the omission
and disuse of such Practice, And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Invitation</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>And in both these kinds it is requisite we
apply our selves to two sorts of Persons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such whose spirits are wholly averse and
alien to it. And</p>
               <p>Such as, though not altogether unpractis'd,
are very defective in it, and neglect it
too much.</p>
               <p>1. Both sorts are to be <hi>expostulated</hi> with;
and no doubt, the great God hath a just quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with mankind (whom these two sorts do
comprehend) upon the one or the other of
these accounts; wherein it is fit we should
plead with men for his sake and their own.
And,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>With the former sort;</hi> Them who are
altogether disaffected to God, <hi>alienated and
enemies in their minds through wicked works,</hi>
and (excepting such as deny his being, with
whom we shall not here concern our selves)
at the utmost distance from <hi>delighting in him.</hi>
And as to such, our Expostulation should
aim at their conviction, both of</p>
               <p>The matter of <hi>fact,</hi> That thus the case is
with them. And of</p>
               <p>The great <hi>iniquity</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:32156:130"/>
First, It is needful we endeavour to fasten
upon such a conviction, That this is the
state of their case. For while his being is not
flatly deny'd, men think it generally credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
to be <hi>professed Lovers of God;</hi> and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it so odious a thing <hi>not to be so,</hi> that they
who are even most deeply guilty, are not easily
brought to confess <hi>enmity</hi> to him; but <hi>flatter
themselves in their own eyes, till their iniquity be
found to be hateful.</hi> The difficulty of making
such apprehend themselves diseased, that their
minds are under the power of this dreadful
distemper, that it is not well with spirits in
this respect, is the great obstruction to their
cure.</p>
               <p>But I suppose you to whom I now apply
my self, to acknowledg the Bible to be Gods
Word, and that you profess reverence to the
Truth and Authority of that Word, and will
yeild to be tried by it.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore <hi>first,</hi> you must be supposed
such as believe the account true, which that
book gives of the common state of man; That
it is a state of Apostacy from God; That <hi>the
Lord looking down from heaven upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>to see if any did understand and
seek God, finds they are all gone aside, i. e.</hi>
(that the return may answer to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the inquiry), <hi>gone off from him. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them is gone back,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 53.</note> (or <hi>revolted,</hi> as
it is expressed in the parallel Psalm), <hi>There
is none that doth good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>no not one;</hi> which is
quoted by the Apostle to the intent, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mouth may be stopped,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and the whole world
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:32156:130"/>
may become guilty before God.</hi> This is then a
common case; And as the same Apostle charges
it upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 30:</note> that they were <hi>haters of
God;</hi> so doth our Saviour as expresly on the
<hi>Jews,</hi> (who no doubt thought themselves
as innocent of this crime as you), <hi>That they
had both seen and hated both Him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And when it is said of men, that <hi>they
were by nature the children of wrath,</hi> (they to
whom he writes <hi>even as others),</hi> do you think
that is spoken of any <hi>lovers of God,</hi> as their
present state? Or that when all <hi>by nature are
children of wrath,</hi> any are <hi>by nature lovers of
him,</hi> so as to <hi>love</hi> him and be under his <hi>wrath</hi>
both at once? It is likely then, that against
so plain evidence, while you confess your
selves men, you will not deny you were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>haters of God.</hi> Well then, is the case
altered with you? It is a conviction against
you, <hi>that you are of humane race,</hi> till it can
be evidenc't you are <hi>born from above,</hi> and are
become <hi>new creatures?</hi> And what, do you
find this? It is not expected, you should be
able to tell the very moment when you ceas'd
from your enmity against God, and became
his friends; or give a punctual account of
every turn or motion of thoughts in such a
change: But it is to be supposed, the work
was not done upon you in your sleep, so as
that you could have no animadversion of
what was doing. However, comparing what
you sometime were with what you are, what
difference do you observe? What were you,
sometimes <hi>haters of God,</hi> and are you now
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:32156:131"/>
come to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight in him,</hi> without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
in your selves any difference? Bethink
your selves, is not the temper of your spirits
just such Godward as it was always wont to
be, without any remarkable turn or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
That is a shrewd presumption against
you, that your case is most deplorable.
But,</p>
               <p>2. What is your present temper, in it self
considered? You do <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>delight in
him,</hi> How do you make it appear? wherein
doth that friendly and dutiful affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him evidence it self? Sure <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>hatred</hi> are not all one with you. Whereby
would you discern your <hi>hatred</hi> towards one
you did most flatly and peremptorily disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
You would <hi>dislike the thoughts of him,</hi>
hate his memory, cast him out of your
thoughts: Do you not the same way shew
your disaffection to God? Do you not find,
that so a wicked man (his enemy) is brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and distinguisht,<note place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God is not in all his thoughts?</hi>
Are not they who shall be turned into Hell
described thus,<note place="margin">Psal. 9. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The people that forget God;</hi>
that is, who <hi>willingly</hi> and <hi>of choice</hi> forget
him, or from the habitual inclination of their
hearts? And is not that your case? What
could hinder you to remember him, if you
were so disposed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, But you often forget your friends, or those
at least to whom you are sure you bear no ill will;
and what friend would expect to be always in your
thoughts?</hi> It's answered, But you <hi>disrelish</hi>
not the remembrance of a Friend; Do you
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:32156:131"/>
not the thoughts of God? You do not think
on your absent Friends while no present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
occurs, to bring them to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
But is God absent? Is he far from
any one of us? Or have you not daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes, things enough to bring him
to mind; while his glorious works surround
you, and you live, move, and have your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, and your breath is in his hand?
Have you that dependence on any Friend?
Are you under so much obligation to any?
You often do not think on Friends with
whom you have no opportunity to converse;
Have you no opportunity to converse with
Him? Your Friends can lay no such Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, to have them much in your thoughts.
It argues a <hi>depraved inclination,</hi> not to do
herein what you <hi>ought</hi> and are <hi>bound</hi> to do.
You cannot by the exercise of your thoughts
obtain the presence of a Friend; you might
a most comfortable Divine presence.</p>
               <p>And what though you think not of many
to whom you bear no ill will, nor have any
converse with many such; Is it enough to
bear no ill will to God? Will that suffice you
to <hi>delighting</hi> in him? Are you no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to mind God and converse with him,
than with the man you never knew, or had
to do with? Your unconversableness with
God, and unmindfulness of him, can proceed
from nothing but ill will, who daily offers
himself to your converse, who seeks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
your acquaintaince, would have you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
know him, and lead your lives with him,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:32156:132"/>
Why is it that you do not so, but that you <hi>like
not to retain him in your knowledg?</hi> And that
this is the sense and language of your hearts
towards him, <hi>Depart from us, we desire not
the knowledg of thy ways;</hi> It can proceed
from nothing but <hi>ill will</hi> and a <hi>disagreeable
temper,</hi> that you shun the converse of one
that seeks yours; that you will take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of one that often offers himself to your
view, one that meets you at every turn, and
aims to draw your eye, and cannot gain a
look. When this is your deportment towards
God, that he passes by you and you perceive
him not; he compasses you about behind
and before and is acquainted with all your
ways, and with him and his ways you will
have no acquaintance, remain <hi>alienated from
the life of God, and as without him in the world;</hi>
Is not this downright enmity? Or can this
deportment agree with <hi>habitual</hi> and the
frequent <hi>actual delight in God</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd?</p>
               <p>Again, Would you not be justly taken to
disaffect one whose <hi>temper</hi> is ungrateful,
whose <hi>disposition</hi> and <hi>way</hi> is unpleasing to
you? Is it not thus with you Godward?
When you hear of the purity and holiness of
his Nature, his abhorrency of all wickedness,
and how detestable to him every thing is
that is impure, and that he will not endure
it; Do not your hearts regret this quality
(as we must conceive of it) in the Nature
of God? Which yet, because it is his very
Nature, doth so much the more certainly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:32156:132"/>
infer, that a <hi>dislike</hi> of it cannot but include
<hi>disaffection</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> habitual and
constant, since his whole way of dealing with
men, and the course of his government over
the world, do (and shall more discernibly)
savour of it; Do they not wish him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>not to be,</hi> in this respect, <hi>what he is;</hi>
which is in effect, to wish him <hi>not to be at all?</hi>
The same thing which the heart of the Fool
says, <hi>No God; i.e.</hi> This would please such a
one <hi>to the very heart.</hi> And doth this import
no enmity? Can this stand with <hi>delight in
him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you not disaffected to <hi>him,</hi> whom
not being able to accuse of falshood, whom
having the greatest imaginable assurances of
the impossibility he should <hi>deceive,</hi> you will
yet by no means be induced to <hi>trust?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
What doth your <hi>trust in God</hi> signifie,
more than the sound of the Name? Doth it
<hi>quiet</hi> your heart, in reference to any affairs
you pretend to commit to him? Doth it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
it, and check your ill inclinations, in any
thing wherein they should be countermanded
upon the credit of his Word? What doth
his Testimony concerning the future things
you have not seen, weigh with you, to the
altering of your course, and rendering it such
as may comport and square with the belief
of such things? Would not the word of an
ordinary man, premonishing you of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
or danger which you have no other
knowledg of, be of more value with you?
Constant suspicion of any one, without cause
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:32156:133"/>
or pretence, most certainly argues radicated
enmity. You <hi>love</hi> him not whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you <hi>love</hi> him whom upon all occasions
you most causlesly displease; whose offence
you reckon nothing of? Is that ingenuous
towards a Friend, or dutiful towards a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or a Lord? How do you, in <hi>this,</hi> carry
towards the blessed God? Are you wont to
displease your selves to please him, or cross
your own will to do his? Do you take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in him whom you make no difficulty
to vex; whose known declared pleasure,
though you confess him greater, wiser, and
more righteous than your self, you have no
more regard to, wherein it crosses your own
inclination, than you would have to that of
your Child, your Slave, or a Fool?</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to except against that
measure and character of loyal affection to
your Redeemer and Lord, <hi>If ye love me, keep
my commandments; Ye are my friends, if ye
do whatsoever I command you; This is the love
of God, that we keep his commandments?</hi> Do
you not disobey the known will of God in
your ordinary practice without regret? Do
not you know it to be his will, That you
<hi>strive to enter in at the strait gate;</hi> That you
<hi>seek first the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> That you
<hi>keep your heart with all diligence;</hi> That you
<hi>deny your self, crucifie the flesh,</hi> be temperate,
just, merciful, patient? Do you aim at obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in these things? Can you say, Lord,
for thy sake I refrain the things to which my
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:32156:133"/>
heart inclines? Hath his prohibition any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
force upon your hearts? Do you
not allow your self to be licentious, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
vain, proud, wrathful, revengeful, though
you know it will offend him? And is this
your <hi>love</hi> to him, or <hi>delight</hi> in him?</p>
               <p>Do you bear goodwill to him whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and dishonour you are not concern'd
for, yea, whom you stick not to dishonour
and reproach? <hi>whose interest among men</hi> hath
no place in your thoughts, whose friends are
none of yours, whose enemies are your friends,
whose favour you care not for, nor regret
his frowns, whose Worship is a burthen to
you, (that you had rather do any thing than
pray to him), and his fellowship an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
thing? Make an estimate by these things
of the temper of your hearts towards God;
and consider whether it bespeak <hi>delight</hi> in
him, or not rather habitual aversion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>It may be you will admit these things
seem to carry somewhat of conviction with
them: But they concern many that are taken
for godly persons and lovers of God, as well
as they do you. And it may be many such
may take themselves for godly persons and
lovers of God, and be mistaken as well as
you; And what will that mend your cause?
If these things will prove a person one that
hath no delight in God, they equally prove
it as to you and others, which will make
nothing to your advantage.</p>
               <p>But if they who have <hi>sincere love</hi> to God,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32156:134"/>
are in a degree peccant against the Laws of
such love (as that they are, they will hear in
due time), They are more ready to accuse
themselves than other men; They <hi>abhor</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they do not more entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God, and repent in dust and ashes:
It better becomes you, to imitate their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
than glory in their sinful weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which while they patronize not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
you should not think it can afford a
valuable patronage unto you. When did you
check and contend with your own hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these accounts, as <hi>they</hi> are wont to do? And
if these things, in a degree found with them,
prove their <hi>delight in God imperfect,</hi> their
prevailing contraries will prove it (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
<hi>sincere.</hi> And if you will not now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the difference, God grant you may
not hereafter at a more costly rate, between
the <hi>imperfection</hi> and the <hi>total want</hi> of his
love; between having your heart and Soul
<hi>imperfectly</hi> alive towards God and <hi>perfectly</hi>
dead.</p>
               <p>You may further say, God is out of your
sight, and therefore how can it be expected
you should find a sensible delight in him?</p>
               <p>But is he out of the sight of your minds?
If he be, what would you infer, That then
you cannot delight in him at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that you do not; the thing that you are
charg'd with all this while. But he is out
of sight <hi>by the high excellency of his Being;</hi>
for which <hi>reason</hi> he should be delighted in the
more, <hi>i.e.</hi> with a <hi>deeper delight,</hi> though not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32156:134"/>
like that you take in the things of sense:
And he hath been so beyond all things, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his abode in that light which
is inaccessible. This therefore is confession
without excuse; and would never be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as an excuse by any, but those that are
lost in flesh and sense, have forgot they have
reasonable Souls, and had rather be numbred
with Brutes than Men; As if there were
not many things you have not seen with the
eyes of flesh, more excellent than those you
have! Or as if you had no other faculty than
eyes of flesh to see with! Which since you have,
and the depravation thereof is vicious and
sinful, as your <hi>not-delighting in God</hi> (the
matter of fact) seems to be yeilded, and so
you quit your first Post; It will <hi>thence</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that it cannot but be <hi>sinful</hi> too. And
since at <hi>that</hi> you seem to make a stand (as at
your next Post), either thinking to deny or
extenuate the <hi>evil</hi> of it, our Expostulation
must follow you thither, and be aimed,</p>
               <p>2. To evince to you the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridness</hi>
of that sin. Suffer your selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be reasoned with to this purpose, and
consider,</p>
               <p>First, That you have somewhat of <hi>delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in your Natures, <hi>i.e.</hi> you have the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
naturally inherent in you, of <hi>taking delight</hi>
in one thing or other. You have such a thing
as <hi>love</hi> about you. Are not some things grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and agreeable to you, in which you can
and do take complacency? Therefore herein
an act is not enjoined you which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32156:135"/>
to your Natures, or simply impossible
to you.</p>
               <p>Next then, Do you not know, your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
or <hi>love</hi> ought to be placed on some <hi>good</hi>
or other that is known to you; and among
things that you know to be good, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the goodness which you find in
them, and supreamly on the best?</p>
               <p>Further, Do you not acknowledg the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to be the best and most excellent
Good? as being the first and fountain-Good,
the fullest and most comprehensive, the purest
and altogether unmixed, the most immutable
and permanent Good? How plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is this? How manifestly impossible is it, if
there were not such a Good, that otherwise
any thing else should ever have been <hi>good,</hi>
or been at all? Is not this as sure and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as any thing your senses could inform
you of? Whence is the glorious excellency
of this great Creation, the beauty, loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
pleasantness of any Creature? Must not
all that, and infinitely more, be originally in
the great Creator of all. This, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
you cannot but see and own.</p>
               <p>While then your own hearts tell you, you
<hi>delight</hi> not in God, Do not your Consciences
begin to accuse and judg you, that you deal
not righteously in this matter? And ought it
not to fill your Souls with horror, when you
consider, you take no <hi>delight</hi> in the best and
sovereign Good? Yea, when you look into
your disaffected hearts and find, that you
not only <hi>do not delight in God,</hi> but you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:32156:135"/>
and not for the want of the natural
power, but a right inclination? Should you
not with astonishment bethink your selves,
every one for himself, what is this that's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal'n
me; I am convinced, this is the best
Good, every way most worthy of my highest
<hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and yet my heart savours it
not! You can have no pretence to say, <hi>That
because your heart is disinclin'd, therefore you
are excused, for you only do not what through
an invincible disinclination you apprehend you
cannot do.</hi> But you should bethink your self,
<hi>What a wretch am I, that am so ill-inclin'd?</hi>
For is not any one more wicked according
as he is more strongly inclin'd to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and averse to what is good? But how
vincible or invincible your disinclination is,
you do not yet know, not having yet made
due trial. That you cannot of your selves
overcome, it is out of question: But have
you tried what help might be got from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the use of Gods own prescribed means?
If that course bring you in no help, then may
you understand how much you have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Lord. For though he have promised,
that for such as turn at his reproof, he will
<hi>pour out his Spirit to them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> yet they <hi>who when
he calls refuse,</hi> and <hi>when he stretches out his
hand regard not, but set at naught all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
&amp;c.</hi> may <hi>call and not be answered,</hi> may <hi>seek
him early and not find him.</hi> And <hi>that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
may somewhat be estimated by <hi>this effect,</hi>
that thus it makes the Spirit of Grace retire,
that free, benign, merciful Spirit, the Author
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32156:136"/>
of all love, sweetness and goodness, become
to a forlorn soul a resolved stranger. If you
are so given up, you have first given up your
selves; You have wilfully cast him out of
your thoughts, and hardened your own hearts
against him, who was the Spring of your
Life and Being, and in whom is all your Hope:
And whether this malignity of your hearts
shall ever finally be overcome or no (as you
have no cause to despair but it may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
if apprehending your life to lie upon
it, you wait and strive, and pray and cry, as
your case requires); Yet do you not see it to
be a fearful pitch of malignity? and so much
the worse and more vicious by how much it is
more hardly overcome?</p>
               <p>That we may here be a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Consider,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>How tumultuous and disorderly a thing
this your disaffection is?</hi> You are here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
its <hi>direct tendency,</hi> its natural aptitude or
what it doth of it self, and in its own nature
lead and tend to. If <hi>you</hi> may withdraw your
<hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love</hi> from God, then so may all <hi>other
men</hi> as well: Therefore now view the <hi>thing
it self</hi> in the common nature of it; And so, Is
not aversion to <hi>delight in God</hi> a manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
to the <hi>order of things?</hi> A turning all
upside down? A shattering and breaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
the bond between <hi>rational appetite</hi> and
the <hi>First Good?</hi> A disjointing and unhinging
of the best and noblest part of Gods Creation
from its station and rest, its proper <hi>basis</hi> and
center? How fearful a rupture doth it make!
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32156:136"/>
How violent and destructive a dislocation!
If you could break in pieces the orderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of the whole universe within it self, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the frame of nature to utmost confusion,
rout all the ranks and orders of creatures, tear
asunder the Heavens, and dissolve the compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
body of the earth, mingle Heaven and Earth
together, and resolve the World into a meer
heap; you had not done so great a spoil, as
in breaking the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>supream tie</hi> and
bond between the <hi>Creature</hi> and his <hi>Maker;</hi>
Yea, between the Creator of all things and
his more noble and excellent Creature. All
the relations, aptitudes and inclinations of the
Creatures to one another, are but <hi>inferior</hi> and
<hi>subordinate</hi> to those between the Creatures and
their common Author and Lord: And here
the corruption of the best cannot but be worst
of all. Again,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>What an unnatural wickedness is it!</hi>
To hate thy own original! To disaffect the
most bountiful Author of thy Life and Being!
What wouldst thou say to it if thy own Son
did hate the very sight of thee, and abhor
thy presence and converse? especially if thou
never gave him the least cause? If thou hast
been always kind and indulgent, full of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
affection towards him, Wouldst thou not
think him a vile miscreant? and reckon the
Earth too good to bear him? But how little,
and in how low a capacity, didst thou contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to his being in comparison of what the
great God did to thine? How little of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
excellency hast thou above him (it may
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:32156:137"/>
be in many things besides this unhappy temper
he much excels thee) when thou knowest,
in thy Maker is infinite excellency beyond
what thou canst pretend unto? And what
cause canst thou pretend of disaffection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him? Many good works hath he done
for thee; For which of these dost thou hate
him? Whereby hath he ever disoblig'd thee?
With how sweet and gentle allurements hath
he sought to win thy heart? And is it not
most vilely unnatural that thy spirit should be
so sullenly averse to him, who is pleased to be
stiled the <hi>Father of Spirits?</hi> And in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it may fitly be said to thee, Dost thou
thus requite the Lord, O foolish Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note>
and unwise? <hi>Is not he thy Father—?</hi> If
thou didst hate thy own self (in a sense <hi>besides
that</hi> wherein it is thy duty, and in which kind
thou hast, as thy case is, a just and dreadful
cause of self-abhorrence); If thou didst hate
thy very life and being, and wer't laying daily
plots of self-destruction, thou wer't not so
wickedly unnatural. He is more intimate to
thee than thou art to thy self. That natural
love which thou owest to thy self, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from whence it springs, is <hi>of him,</hi> and
ought to be <hi>subordinate to him;</hi> And by a <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Law of Nature,</hi> thy very life if he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
require it, ought to be sacrific'd and laid
down for his sake: Thy hatred towards him,
therefore is more prodigiously unnatural, than
if it were most directly and implacably bent
against thy self.</p>
               <p>And yet also in hating him thou dost most
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:32156:137"/>
mischievously hate thy self too; and all that
thou dost, by the instinct of that vile tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of heart towards him thou dost it against
thy own life and soul. Thou cuttest thy self
off from him who is thy life; and art laying a
train for the blowing up of thy eternal Hope.
<hi>All that hate him love death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> Further,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It is the most comprehensive wickedness, and
which entirely contains all other in it.</hi> For as
the <hi>Law of Love</hi> is the universal and summary
Law, comprehending all Duty, and even <hi>as it
enjoins love to God</hi> (for love to men ought to
be resolved into that, and must be for his sake);
so must <hi>disaffection to God</hi> be comprehensive
<hi>of all sin,</hi> whereinto every thing of it resolves
it self. Dost thou not see then how thou
cancellest and nullifiest the obligation of all
Laws, while thou hast no <hi>delight in God?</hi>
offerest violence to the very knot and juncture,
wherein they all meet and are infolded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
Not to <hi>delight in God</hi> therefore,
What can it be but the very top of Rebellion?
What will thy sobriety, thy justice, thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
signifie, if thou hadst these to glory in,
while thou art habitually disaffected to thy
God? Let <hi>men</hi> value thee for these, to whom
thereby thou shewest some respect; But shall
<hi>he,</hi> who in the mean time knows thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
none to <hi>him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>It is a most reproachful contemptuous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness!</hi>
To <hi>him,</hi> I mean, whom it most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
offends against! Carries it not in it most
horrid contumely and indignity to the most
high God? It is a practical denial of all those
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:32156:138"/>
excellencies in him, that render and recommend
him the most worthy object of <hi>our delight;</hi>
it is <hi>more than saying,</hi> He is <hi>not good, holy, wise,
just</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> Things may on the sudden be
<hi>said</hi> that are not <hi>deliberately thought,</hi> and
may be retracted the next breath; but a
mans <hi>stated, constant course</hi> and <hi>way</hi> signifies
the apprehension it proceeds from to be <hi>fixed,</hi>
and that it is the <hi>setled habitual sense of his
Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and since, as hath been said, Thou
<hi>delightest</hi> in other things whilst thou <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not in him;</hi> It plainly imports it to be
the <hi>constant sense</hi> of thy very heart, that <hi>those
things</hi> are better than <hi>He.</hi> What is it then
that hath thy <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love?</hi> Whereon is
thy heart set? Commune with thy self. Dost
thou not tremble, when thou findest this to
be thy very case, that thou may'st truly say,
<hi>I can delight in creatures, but not in God; can
take pleasure in my friend, but none in him; I
must confess it to be the temper of my heart, that I
love my Father, Mother, Son or Daughter more
than Christ:</hi> Is it not then to be concluded
from his own express word,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 13</note> that thou art
not worthy of him,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26</note> and canst be none of
his Disciple? Nay, may'st thou not moreover
truly say, that thou lovest this base impure
earth more than God? That thou takest more
<hi>delight</hi> in thy companions in wickedness;
canst more solace thy self with a drunkard
on the Ale-bench, with a lascivious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
with a prophane scoffer at godliness, than
with the blessed God? That thou canst allow
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:32156:138"/>
thy self to riot with the luxurious, and eat
and drink with the drunken, and not only
do such things, but <hi>take pleasure</hi> in them
that do them, yea and thy self <hi>take pleasure</hi>
to commit iniquity; but in the glorious holy
God thou canst <hi>take no pleasure!</hi> Then wouldst
thou be content to carry the plain sense of
thy heart written on thy forehead, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
it to all the world, <hi>as thy resolved practical
judgment,</hi> That thou accountest <hi>thy Friends,
thy Relations, this vile and vanishing World, thy
wicked Associates, thine own impure lusts, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than God?</hi> And dost thou not yet see
the horrid vileness of thy own heart in all
this? Art thou yet an harmless innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
an honest well-meaning man for all
this?</p>
               <p>Yea, wil't thou not see, that thine heart
goes against thy Conscience all this while?
That thou disaffectest him in whom thou
knowest thou shouldst <hi>delight?</hi> That the
temper of thy Spirit is a continual affront
to thy profession, through the perfidious
falshood and vanity whereof, thou dost but
cover hatred with lying lips? Is not that
an odious thing which thou so <hi>seekest to hide;</hi>
and which, though thou art not loath to be
guilty of it, thou art so very unwilling should
be known?</p>
               <p>And since thou art so very loath it should
be known, How canst thou hold up thy
head before that eye that is as a flame of
fire, that searches thy heart and tries thy
reins, that observes thy wayward spirit, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:32156:139"/>
sees with how obstinate an aversion thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinest
his acquaintance and converse? Wilt
thou stand before the glorious Majesty of
Heaven and Earth, who knows thy disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
heart, and say, it is but a small trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
thou hast been guilty of, in not <hi>loving
him</hi> and making <hi>him</hi> thy <hi>delight?</hi> Dost thou
think this will pass for a little offence in the
solemn judgment of the great day that is
drawing on? Or will thy heart indure, or
thy hands be strong, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be laid open, thou shalt stand
convicted before his Tribunal in the sight
of Angels and Men, of having born all thy
days a false disloyal heart, full of malignity
and ill-will to thy Soveraign Lord, whom
thou wast so many ways obliged to serve
and cleave to with <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the difference shall be visibly put
between those that <hi>delighted in God</hi> and them
that <hi>never did,</hi> and thou shalt be markt out
for one of them that didst in heart depart
from him all thy days, and be thereupon
abandon'd to the society of that horrid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
crew, in whom only thou didst <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:</hi>
Surely thou wilt not then say, thy
transgression was small.</p>
               <p>2. But we are also to <hi>expostulate</hi> with <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sort;</hi> who, though they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unacquainted with this heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of <hi>delighting in God,</hi> yet too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it, and apply not themselves to it (as
who do?) with that constancy and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Soul as the matter requires. And
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:32156:139"/>
                  <hi>these</hi> we are to put upon the consideration
of such evils, as either <hi>are included</hi> in this
neglect, or are ally'd unto it (and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accompany and aggravate the natural
evil of it), as either causing it, or being
caused by it. And,</p>
               <p>1. Those whom we now intend are to
bethink themselves, <hi>what evil is included</hi> in
their neglect of this part of <hi>holy Practice.</hi> And
you are to judg of the evil of it by its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
with such known and usual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
as whereto our practice should be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and which in reason and justice it is to
be estimated and censured by; as for instance,
<hi>The Divine Law, Conscience, Experience, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
by kindness, Stipulation, Relation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
Tendency of the new Nature, Dictates of
Gods Spirit, The course and drift of his design;</hi>
with all which it will be found to have very
ill accord.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>How directly opposite is it to the Law of
God!</hi> Not only to his express <hi>written Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi>
but to that immutable eternal Law which
arises from our very Natures refer'd unto
his! The obligingness or binding force where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
doth not so much stand in this, <hi>That the
thing to be done is such as whereto our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were originally inclin'd,</hi> (which yet is
of great weight, they having been thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
and determin'd by our Maker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so that <hi>our inclination</hi> was in this case
expressive of <hi>his Will);</hi> but (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the very reason of <hi>that,</hi> for we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> in the blessed God to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:32156:140"/>
conduct all the determinations of <hi>His Will),
the natural unchangeable congruity of the thing
it self.</hi> And therefore as to the things whose
<hi>constant fitness</hi> would render them matter of
Duty to us <hi>at all times,</hi> it was provided, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi>
sutable to them should be planted in
our Natures from the beginning: But things
that were to be matter of Duty but <hi>for a
time,</hi> having only a <hi>present fitness</hi> unto some
present juncture or state of affairs, it was
sufficient that the Divine Pleasure should be
signified about them in some way more suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their <hi>occasional</hi> and <hi>temporary use,</hi> and
that might not so certainly extend to all men
and times.</p>
               <p>That great Law of <hi>Love to God</hi> (which
comprehends this of <hi>delighting in him)</hi> is
you may be sure of that former sort, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible there should be a reasonable
Creature in being, but it will <hi>immediately</hi>
and <hi>always</hi> be his Duty to <hi>love God</hi> supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and above all things; yea, <hi>that</hi> you must
know is the most fundamental of all such
Laws. And therefore, when because original
impressions were become so obscure and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legible
in our Natures, it became necessary
there should be a new and more express Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in Gods written Word:</p>
               <p>This is placed in the very front of them,
<hi>Thou shalt have no other gods before me;</hi> Which
signifies only the having of a God in Name
and no more, if it doth not signifie <hi>loving
him before all other.</hi> Wherefore when our
Saviour was to tell which was the <hi>first</hi> and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:32156:140"/>
                  <hi>great Commandment,</hi> he gives it thus, <hi>Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</hi>
The thing enjoined by this Law is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial,
the life and soul of all other Duty,
and without which all that we can do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
is but meer shadow; for whatsoever we
are enjoined to do else, we must understand
enjoined to be done <hi>out of love to God,</hi> as the
<hi>principle</hi> whence it must proceed; and not
proceeding thence, the moral goodness of it
vanishes as a beam cut off from the Sun. <hi>For
on this</hi> (with the other which is like unto
it, and which also hangs upon this) <hi>hang all
the Law and the Prophets.</hi> And what durst
thou who knowest God, or rather art known
of him, neglect so great and substantial a
Duty? This is not like the command of
<hi>wearing fringe on the borders of the garment,</hi> or
of <hi>not wearing a garment of linnen and woollen;</hi>
wherein sure they whom it concerned should
have been very undutiful to have disobeyed:
But it is the very greatest among the great
things of the Law; A Duty upon which all
Duty depends, even for life and breath! Should
not <hi>this</hi> have obtain'd in thy practice, that
ought to run through and animate all the
rest? Or was it fit it should ly dead and
bound up in the <hi>habitual principle,</hi> and not
go forth (or very rarely) into <hi>act</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise?</hi>
Or didst thou do thy duty herein, by
being only <hi>inclin'd</hi> to do it? Or would not the
<hi>inclination,</hi> if it were right, infer (or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is it like to last long without) sutable
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:32156:141"/>
                  <hi>exercise?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3.</note> Why was so <hi>express a Law</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so often enjoined (or the practice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
with approbation,<note place="margin">Psa. 44. 19.</note> or the neglect of
it animadverted upon with abhorrence,<note place="margin">Job 27. 10. ch. 34. 9.</note> in
the very terms, or in terms evidently enough
of the same import) in the Sacred Volume?<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 14.</note>
How could you turn over the leaves of that
Book and not often meet with such words,
<hi>Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 1. 97. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Rejoice in
the Lord, and again I say to you rejoice, &amp;c.</hi>
Should not so <hi>frequent inculcations</hi> of the
same thing have been answered by the <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi>
and <hi>continuedness</hi> of your <hi>practice</hi> of it?<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 1. 4. 4.</note>
Or was it enough now and then, as it were
<hi>casually</hi> and by chance, to <hi>hit</hi> upon the doing
of what is so momentous a part of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and ought to be the business of your
life? Ought it not to cut your heart to find
your self convicted herein of a disobedient
omission? And when the great God exacts
that stated homage from you, <hi>A frequent,
practical, explicite, recognition and owning of
him as the supream delight, the great solace,
repose and rest of your Souls,</hi> that you have been
so little aw'd with the apprehension of his <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
and <hi>right</hi> in this case? When he hath
mercifully chosen, to make <hi>that</hi> the matter
of his command and claim, wherein your
own advantage, satisfaction and content doth
so entirely consist? That your <hi>practice</hi> is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>disagreeable to a Law,</hi> speaks it <hi>sinful;</hi> that
it transgresses <hi>so great a Law,</hi> highly <hi>aggravates</hi>
your sin: A Law so important, upon which
so much depends, so express and plain, legible
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:32156:141"/>
in the very nature of things, and in reference
whereto, the very <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>object</hi> would
suffice to be a <hi>Law</hi> to you, and dictate your
duty, if no command had been otherwise gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the case. Surely the neglect of <hi>such
a Law</hi> cannot have been without <hi>great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Your own Conscience you will acknowledg
ought to be a Rule to you, when it manifestly
agrees with that former Rule, The supream and
Royal Law.</hi> Do you not find your selves
herein to have offended against that? It may
be your sleeping Conscience did not find your
self to offend: But do you not find your
self to have offended it, now beginning to
awake? This is not a doubtful and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
matter, (perhaps your minding such
matters too much, hath hindered you in
this), surely you will not make a scruple of
it, a difficult case of Conscience, <hi>Whether you
should take the Lord of Heaven and Earth for
your God?</hi> Whether you should chuse him
for your portion, seek rest in him, and place
upon him your <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love?</hi> And if in
so plain a case your Conscience hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
it self offended, you have offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, in letting it sleep so securely, and
not stirring it up to its proper office and
work. And know, that <hi>sinning against the
light of ones own Conscience,</hi> doth not stand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>in going against the actual deliberated thoughts
which we have had,</hi> but also in walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our <hi>habitual knowledg,</hi> and the <hi>thoughts</hi>
and <hi>apprehensions</hi> which thence we <hi>might and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:32156:142"/>
should actually have had;</hi> Inadvertency and
disregard of known duty, is the most usual
way of <hi>sinning against Conscience.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Have you not in this often gone against
the repeated checks of your own Consciences!
Bethink your selves, Have you not in your
prayers intermingled frequent confessions of
your cold love to God, and that you have
taken so little <hi>delight</hi> in him? And were
those only <hi>customary forms</hi> with you, and
words of course? Surely (though it might
not be urgently enough) your Consciences
did at such times accuse you. And let that
be a dreadful thing in your eyes, to continue
a course which, if you <hi>consider,</hi> you cannot
but <hi>condemn.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Ought not your Experience to have been
instructive to you;</hi> as it commonly is to men
in other matters? Have you not in this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
run counter to such instruction? By
this means you are suppos'd to have known
the <hi>sweetness,</hi> as by that last mentioned, the
<hi>equity</hi> and <hi>fitness</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> in God. Have
not those been your best hours, wherein you
could freely solace your selves in him? was
not one of them better than a thousand other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
spent! Did you never find it <hi>good for
you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> in this way, <hi>to draw nigh to God?</hi> and
hereupon <hi>pronounce them blessed whom he did
chuse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>and cause to approach unto him?</hi> And
where is that <hi>blessedness</hi> of which ye spake?
Have ye forgotten, that ye ever thus tasted
how gracious the Lord was? And 'tis like,
you have <hi>by your taste</hi> found it also an <hi>evil
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:32156:142"/>
thing and bitter to depart from him.</hi> Methinks
you should reckon it a great increase of your
sin to have gone against your own sense, when
especially, your superior rule might give you
assurance it did not deceive you. And doth
it not expresly <hi>oblige</hi> you to follow its gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,<note place="margin">Heb 5. 14.</note>
while it puts the character of <hi>perfect,</hi> or
of <hi>being come to full age,</hi> upon them, who <hi>by
reason of use</hi> (or accustomedness) have
<hi>senses exercised</hi> to discern between Good and
Evil?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>And what will you say to the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the love and kindness of God have
laid upon you?</hi> Will you not esteem your selves
to have been thereby bound to place your <hi>love</hi>
and <hi>delight</hi> on him? Could you decline doing
so without putting a slight upon his <hi>love,</hi> who
is infinite in what he is, and <hi>who is love?</hi> was
not his <hi>love</hi> enough to deserve yours? The
<hi>love</hi> of a God, that of a silly worm! Were
you not oblig'd to <hi>love</hi> him back again, who
was so much before-hand with you in the
matter of <hi>love?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.</note> 
                  <hi>To love him who had loved you
first?</hi> The first <hi>love</hi> is <hi>Therefore</hi> perfectly free;
the latter is thereby certainly obliged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bounden duty. How variously and
with how mighty demonstration hath that
<hi>love</hi> exprest and evidence't it self? It hath not
glanc't at you, but rested on you, and setled
<hi>in delight.</hi> He hath so stood affected towards
the people of his choice, and put a name on
them on purpose to signifie his <hi>delight</hi> in them.<note place="margin">Isa. 62. 4.</note>
                  <hi>He rejoices over them with joy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and rests in his
love to them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 149.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord taketh pleasure in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:32156:143"/>
His delights have</hi> from of old <hi>been with
the Sons of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> Could He <hi>delight</hi> in such
as you, and cannot you in him? Be amazed
at this! How mean an Object had he for his
<hi>delight!</hi> How glorious and enamouring a one
have you! <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in conjunction!
whereas in you were met <hi>Deformity</hi> and <hi>ill-will!</hi>
He hath loved you so as to remit to you
much. To give to you and for you a great
deal more, Himself and the Son of his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
He then (thou shouldst recount) did
invite thee <hi>to delight in him</hi> who hath always
sought thy good, done strange things to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it, takes pleasure in thy prosperity and
exercises loving kindness towards thee with
<hi>delight?</hi> Who contrived thy Happiness;
wrought out thy Peace at the expence of
Blood, even <hi>his own;</hi> Taught thee the way of
Life, cared for thee all thy days, hath sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
thy wants, born thy burdens, eas'd thy
griefs, wip't thy tears. And if now he say
to thee; <hi>After all this couldst thou take no pleasure
in me?</hi> Will not that confound and shame thee?
He hath exprest his <hi>love</hi> by his so earnest (and
at last successful) endeavours to gain thine.
By <hi>this,</hi> that he hath seemed to put a value on
it; and that he desisted not till in some degree
he had won it: Whereupon there hath been
an acquaintance, a friendship, some intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
between him and thee, according as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Majesty hath vouchsafed to descend,
and advance sinful dust. And how disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
unbecoming and unsutable to all this
is thy strangeness and distance afterwards! It
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:32156:143"/>
it is more unworthy to cast out of your hearts
than not to have admitted such a guest.</p>
               <p>5. How contrary is this omission to what
by solemn <hi>vow and astipulation</hi> you have bound
your selves to? It hath graciously pleased the
blessed God in his transactions with men to
contrive his Laws into the <hi>form of a Covenant,</hi>
wherein upon terms, he binds himself to
them, expecting (what he obtains from such
as become his own) <hi>their restipulation.</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
grace! that he should article with his
Creatures, and capitulate with the work of
his own hands! And whereas his first and
great <hi>Law</hi> (and which virtually being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to comprehends our obedience to all
the rest) is as hath been noted, <hi>Thou shalt
have no other Gods before me;</hi> This also he
gives forth often, as the sum and abridgment
of his <hi>Covenant, That he will be our God, and we
shall be his people.</hi> Now this you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to; and therein bound your selves,
(as you have heard our Saviour expounds
the first and great Commandment) <hi>To love
him with all your soul,</hi> &amp;c. And how well
doth your neglect to <hi>delight</hi> in him agree and
consist with this? What, love him with all
your soul in whom you can rarely find your
selves to take any pleasure? Surely your
hearts will now misgive and admit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
you have not dealt <hi>truly</hi> (as well as
not <hi>kindly)</hi> in this. What, not to keep
Faith with the righteous God! To deceive a
Deceiver some would think not intolerable.
But what pretence can there be for such deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:32156:144"/>
with the God of Truth? You have vow'd
to him, What think you of this drawing
back? Such trifling with <hi>him;</hi> the great and
terrible God who keeps Covenant and Mercy
for ever! How unbecoming is it! to dally with
him as you would with an <hi>uncertain whiffling
man?</hi> To be off and on, to say and unsay, that
he shall be your God, and that he shall not, (for
how is he your God if you <hi>delight</hi> not in him?)
imports little of that solemn gravity and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
which becomes a transaction with the
most High God. He takes no pleasure in fools;
<hi>Wherefore pay that which you have vowed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Nor doth it better agree with your Relation
to him, which arises from your Covenant.</hi> Thence
he becomes yours and you his: <hi>I entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with thee, and thou becamest mine;</hi> and the
Covenant binding on both parts, the relation is
<hi>mutual;</hi> so that thereby also he becomes yours:
It is a most <hi>near,</hi> represented therefore by the
nearest among men, even the conjugal, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Therefore how full is that <hi>Song of Songs</hi>
of expressions importing mutual <hi>delights</hi> suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereto! And what a bondage (as well
as incongruity) were <hi>that</hi> relation without
<hi>delight?</hi> Have you repented your Choice? If
not, Why take you not pleasure? Why do
you not rejoice and glory in it, even as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to do over you? If he should repent,
In what case were you? Not to take pleasure,
in <hi>God!</hi> Your <hi>own God!</hi> How strangely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
is it? You are not to consider him as a
stranger, an unrelated one. If he were such
to you his own excellencies challenge to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:32156:144"/>
beheld with <hi>delight;</hi> But you are to reckon
and say of him, <hi>This is my Beloved, and this is
my Friend,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am his and he is mine.</hi> And
how ill do such words become the mouth that
utters them not <hi>from the abundance of the heart!</hi>
even from an heart abounding and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Love and Joy!</p>
               <p>7. <hi>And how doth the temper of your heart
and your practice, while you take not actual, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
delight in God, clash and jar with
your profession?</hi> For admit you do not then
make an express verbal profession of <hi>actual
delight in God</hi> at such times when you find
it not, yet you still avow your selves, and
would be accounted and lookt upon as <hi>related
to him:</hi> And the just challenges of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are not any way answered, but by a
course of ordinary actual <hi>delight.</hi> So much
your Profession manifestly imports. Whilst
you profess the Lord to be your God, you
profess him to be your <hi>supream delight.</hi> And
how is he so, when you seldom have a <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
thought of him, or look to him with any
pleasure? and the temper of your Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him is usually strange and shie? And
bethink your selves, What would you then
be esteemed? such as care not for him, as
value him not? Would you willingly be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for such in all those long intervals
wherein your actual <hi>delight</hi> in him is wholly
discontinued? Would you not be ashamed the
disposition of your heart towards him at such
times should be known? Do you not desire to
be better thought of? What is there then at the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:32156:145"/>
bottom, and under the covert of your yet
continued profession at such times, but false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
A correspondent affection there is not.
Is not your very profession then meer dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and a lie? A concealment and disguise of
an heart inwardly bad and naught? but
which only comforts it self that it is not
known; that is all day long full of earth
and vanity, and wholly taken up with either
the contentments, <hi>delights</hi> and hopes, or the
cares, fears, and discontents that do naturally
arise from these vile mean Objects, and so are
of a kind as mean and vile as they; Only makes
a shift to lie hid all the while, and lurk under
the appearance such a one hath put on of a
<hi>Lover of God,</hi> and one that above all things
<hi>delights</hi> in him. But is this honest dealing?
or was this indeed all that was <hi>this while</hi> to be
got of God, <hi>the credit of being thought his?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet it may be you will somewhat relieve
your selves, by saying you suppose for all this
your profession was not altogether false. For
you hope there was still a Principle in you by
which your heart was habitually directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and whereby his Interest did still
live and was maintained in you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
your many and long diversions from
him. And while your Profession did signifie
that, it signified <hi>some real thing,</hi> and so was
not a false and lying Profession.</p>
               <p>But to this I say, Was this all that your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
was in it self <hi>apt,</hi> and <hi>by you designed</hi> to
signifie? Surely it was apt and intended to
signifie more than <hi>habitual inclination.</hi> It car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:32156:145"/>
the appearance of such actings Godward
as were sutable to your having him for your
God; And you would it's likely have been
loth it should have been otherwise understood.
And surely whatsoever it said or imported
<hi>more than the Truth</hi> was false.</p>
               <p>And again, Can you be confident that so
much as you suppose, was true? Are you sure
of this, that because you have sometimes
found some motions of heart towards God, it
is therefore <hi>habitually</hi> inclin'd to him, when
it very rarely puts forth it self in any sutable
acts, and for the most part works quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way? Whereby are Habits to be known
but by the frequency of their acts? Do not
you know there are many half-inclinations and
workings of heart with some complacency
God-ward that prove abortive and come to
nothing, as that of the <hi>stony ground,</hi> and that
of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. do more than intimate. Surely
your hope and safety more depend upon your
repentance, your return and closer adherence
to God thereupon, than the supposition your
heart is in the main sound and right amidst
those more notable declinings from him.</p>
               <p>But we will admit your supposition true
(which the consideration of the persons we are
now dealing with and the Design of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Piece of our Discourse requires) and take
it for granted, that amidst this your great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
you have notwithstanding, a Principle, a
new and holy nature in you, whose tendency
is Godward: Whereupon we further say
then,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:32156:146"/>
8. <hi>And doth not your unaccustomedness to this
blessed exercise resist the Tendency of that new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
And so your <hi>practice</hi> while your hearts run
a quite contrary course (for they are not doing
nothing while they are not in this <hi>delightful</hi>
way working towards God) doth not only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
against your <hi>profession</hi> which it <hi>in great part</hi>
belies; but against that vital Principle also,
which is in you; and so your very excuse ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
your sin. Is there indeed such a
Principle in you? And whither tends it? Is
it not from God? And doth it not then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
aim at him and tend towards him? Being
upon both those accounts (as well as that it
resembles him, and is his living Image) called
a <hi>participation of the Divine Nature?</hi> Yea, doth
it not tend to <hi>delight in him?</hi> For it tends to
him <hi>as the Souls last end and rest.</hi> What good
Principle can you have in you God ward if you
have not <hi>Love to him?</hi> And the property of
that is to work towards him by desire, that it
may rest in him by <hi>delight.</hi> Have you Faith
in God? That works by this <hi>Love. Faith</hi> is
that <hi>great power</hi> in the Holy Soul by which it
<hi>acts from God</hi> as a <hi>Principle;</hi> Love is that by
which it acts towards him as an <hi>End;</hi> By <hi>that</hi>
it <hi>draws from him,</hi> by <hi>this</hi> it <hi>moves to him,</hi> and
<hi>rests in him.</hi> The same holy gracious nature
(dependently on its great Author and Cause)
inclining it both to this <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>rest;</hi> and
to the former, in order to the latter: So by the
work of the new Creature is the Soul formed
purposely for blessedness in God and devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to him; its aspirations, its motions, its
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:32156:146"/>
very pulse, breath, tend and beat this way.
But you apply not your Souls to <hi>delight in
God.</hi> You bend your minds and hearts another
way; What are you doing then? You are
striving against your own life; you are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
all good inclinations towards God,
stifling and stopping the breath that your
panting heart would send forth to him; you
are busily <hi>crucifying the new creature,</hi> instead
of the <hi>body of sin.</hi> There is somewhat in you
that would work towards God, and you
suffer it not; And is that well? That <hi>Divine
thing, born of God,</hi> of heavenly descent, that
hath so much in it of sacredness by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and parentage, you fear not to do
violence to!</p>
               <p>If indeed such a thing (as you seem to
hope) be in you; at sometime or other you
may perceive which way it beats and tends.
The Soul in which it hath place is byass'd by
it Godward; and though often it is not
discernible, it sometimes shews its inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Other men, and meaner creatures, sleep
sometimes, and then their most rooted dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
appear not; when they are awake they
bewray them, and let them be seen in their
actions, motions and pursuits. The renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Soul hath its sleeping intervals too, and
what propensions it hath towards God is little
discernible, (and yet even then it sometimes
dreams of him, at least between sleeping and
waking;<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I sleep, but my heart waketh, it is
the voice of my beloved):</hi> But if you seriously
commune with your selves in your more wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:32156:147"/>
seasons, you may perceive what your
hearts seek and crave; some such sense as this
may be read in them,<note place="margin">Isa. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>The desire of our Souls
is unto thy Name, O Lord, and to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of thee. One thing have I desired, that
will I seek after,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>to behold the beauty (the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
as the word signifies) <hi>of the Lord.</hi> And
when you observe this discovered inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you may see what it is that in your too
wonted course you repress and strive against.
That Divine Birth calls for sutable nutriment,
<hi>more tastes</hi> how gracious the Lord is. You
will have it <hi>feed upon ashes,</hi> upon wind and
vanity; or (although it had the best Parent,
it hath so ill a Nurse) when it asks bread,
you give it a stone, and let it be stung by a
Scorpion: And the injury strikes higher than
at <hi>it alone,</hi> even (as is obvious) at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Author of this Divine Production; Which
therefore we add as a further aggravation of
this evil, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. That it's an offence against the <hi>Spirit of
Grace,</hi> whose dictates are herein slighted and
opposed; for surely with the tendencies of the
new creature he concurs: It is maintained by
him as well as produced, continually depends
on him as to its being, properties, and all its
operations. Nothing therefore can be cross
to the inclination of a renewed Soul, <hi>as such,</hi>
which is not more principally <hi>so</hi> to the Holy
Ghost himself. And particularly the <hi>disposing</hi>
of the Soul unto <hi>delight</hi> is most expresly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to him;<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> that very <hi>disposition</hi> being it
self <hi>joy in the Holy Ghost:</hi> And we find it num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32156:147"/>
among the <hi>fruits of the Spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> You
may possibly be less apprehensive of your
sin in this, because you find him not dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to you with that discernible Majesty,
Authority and Glory that you may think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to so great an Agent. But you must
know, he applies himself to us in a way
much imitating that of nature. And as in
reference to the conservation of our natural
beings, we are assured the First Cause co-operates
with Inferiour Causes (for we live,
move,<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> and have our being in him), though
the Divine influence is not communicated to
this purpose with any <hi>sensible glory,</hi> or so
distinguishably, that we can <hi>discern</hi> what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
is from the superiour Cause and what
from subordinate; our <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
assure us of what our <hi>sense</hi> cannot reach
in this matter: So it is here also, The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit</hi> accommodates himself very much
to the same way of working with our <hi>own,</hi>
and acts us sutably to our own Natures. And
though by very sensible tokens we cannot
always tell which be the motions that proceed
from him; yet Faith teaches us from his Word,
to ascribe to him whatever spiritual good we
find in our selves; inasmuch as <hi>we are not
of our selves sufficient to think a good thought.</hi>
And if by that Word we judg of the various
motions that stir in us, we may discern
which are <hi>good</hi> and which not; and so may
know what to ascribe to the Spirit, and what
not. Whereas therefore that Word commands
us to <hi>delight in God,</hi> if we find any motion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32156:148"/>
in our hearts tending that way, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to own the finger of God, and the
touch of his Holy Spirit therein. And what
have you found no such motions excited,
no thoughts cast in that have had this aspect
and tendency, which your indulged carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and aversion have represt and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought?
Herein you have <hi>grieved and quencht
the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it have not over-born you into what
you should have understood to have been your
duty, but have upon your untractableness
retired and withdrawn from you; Do not
therefore make the <hi>less reckoning</hi> of the matter,
but the <hi>more</hi> rather; this carries more in it of
awful consideration to you, and smarter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<hi>that He desisted.</hi> You must consider him
as a free Agent, and who works to will and to
do <hi>of his good pleasure.</hi> His influence is retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,
and when it is retracted, you ought in
this case to reckon it signifies a resentment of
your undutiful and regardless carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. And ought you not to smite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the thigh then, and say, <hi>What have I done?</hi>
You have striven against the Spirit of the most
High God; You have resisted him <hi>in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eution
of his Office,</hi> when you were committed
to his Conduct and Government; you have
fal'n out and quarrelled with your merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Guide, and slighted at once both his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
and <hi>Love.</hi> This could be no small of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And you are also to consider, that
when such a Province was assigned him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to you, and such as you; and the great
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:32156:148"/>
God set his Spirit on work about you. It was
with a special end and design, being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of most wise Counsel.</p>
               <p>And how highly doth this increase the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?
That,</p>
               <p>10. You have herein directly obstructed
the course and progress of that Design; <hi>That</hi>
could be no other than <hi>the magnifying of his
grace in your conduct to blessedness.</hi> This
is that whereon he hath been intent; and he
hath made his Design herein so visible, that
they that run might read what it was. The
very overture to you of placing your <hi>delights</hi>
on him speaks its end; 'Tis that whereby he
should be most highly acknowledg'd and you
blessed both at once. His <hi>known design</hi> you
ought to have reckoned did <hi>prescribe to you,</hi> and
give you <hi>a Law;</hi> 'Tis a part of civility <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
even an ordinary man,</hi> not to cross his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which I know him earnestly to intend,
when it tends no way to my prejudice, or any
mans; Yea, to do so would in common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
besides <hi>rudeness,</hi> argue <hi>ill nature</hi>
and a mischievous disposition. Much more
would <hi>duty</hi> and just observance <hi>towards a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi>
challenge so much, as not to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
him, and <hi>awe</hi> a well-temper'd spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into subjection and compliance; but a stiff
reluctancy to the great and known Design of
the blessed God, meant so directly to our own
advantage, speaks so very bad a temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath
in it such a complication of peevish wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of undutifulness and ingratitude to him,
of negligence and disregard of our selves,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:32156:149"/>
that it must want a name to express it.</p>
               <p>And now do you see what evil the neglect
<hi>of delighting in God</hi> (accompanied as it cannot
but be with the having your hearts other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ingaged and vainly busie) doth include
and carry in it? Will you pause a while and
deliberate upon it? Do but make your just
and sober estimate by the things that have
been mentioned.</p>
               <p>Measure it by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and it imports
manifest <hi>disobedience</hi> in a matter of highest
consequence; by the judgment of <hi>your own
conscience,</hi> and it imports <hi>much boldness against
light</hi> in a very plain case; by <hi>your experience,</hi>
and it speaks an <hi>uninstructible stupidity,</hi> or a
very heedless forgetful spirit; by the <hi>obligation</hi>
laid upon you, by the kindness of this very
counsel and offer (besides many other ways),
and it hath in it <hi>great ingratitude</hi> and <hi>insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi>
of the greatest love; by your <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and it imports <hi>treachery;</hi> by your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
much <hi>incongruity</hi> and <hi>undecency;</hi> by
your Profession, <hi>falshood</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie;</hi> by
the <hi>tendency of the new nature</hi> in you, <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
violence;</hi> by the <hi>Dictates of Gods Spirit,</hi>
great <hi>untractableness;</hi> by his <hi>known declared
Design</hi> in this matter, a most <hi>undutiful disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
to him, with a most wretched careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your selves, as to your nearest and most
important concern.</p>
               <p>One would think it needless to say more;
But why should we balk any thing that so
obviously occurs, tending to set forth the
exceeding great sinfulness of this sin? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

know, that besides its great faultiness in it
self,</p>
               <p>Much also cannot but be derived into it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
from its very faulty causes. It supposes and
argues great evils that flow into it, and from
which it hath its rise.</p>
               <p>1. Great <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> of God;
For is it possible any should have <hi>known</hi> and
not have <hi>loved</hi> him? or have <hi>beheld</hi> his glory
and not have been <hi>delighted</hi> therewith? and
that with such <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love</hi> as should have
held a setled seat and residence in them.</p>
               <p>And can <hi>your ignorance</hi> of God be excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or innocent?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> The Apostles words are too

at least it would be thought, <hi>In Judah
is God known, and that his Name were great in

wherein all his Attributes have visibly
comply'd to the reconciling design; His bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fulness of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>love</hi> not obstructed by
any of them, from flowing out in rich and
liberal communications. If you had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that glorious pleasant light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is so to be beheld, you would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
what had won your hearts fully, and
bound them to him in everlasting <hi>delight</hi>
and <hi>love.</hi> And have you not reason to be
ashamed you have not known him better,
and to better purpose? <hi>Alienation from the
life of God</hi> proceeds from <hi>blindness of heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> a chosen affected voluntary blindness. Or
if your knowledg of him be not little.</p>
               <p>2. Your <hi>little delight in him</hi> argues <hi>much
unmindfulness of him;</hi> At least that you have
not minded him <hi>duly,</hi> and according to what
you have known. It might here be seasonable
to suggest to you, how likely it is, that <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

therefore,</p>
               <p>1. Have not your <hi>thoughts</hi> of him been
<hi>slight</hi> and <hi>transient?</hi> Have they not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
superficial thoughts? <hi>casual</hi> only, and such

what is said of the wicked man,<note place="margin">Psal. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>God

<hi>amidst them.</hi> Your thoughts have not <hi>united</hi>
upon him, he hath not been <hi>situated</hi> and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:32156:150"/>
                  <hi>centred</hi> in them. Was not this the case? You
bestowed upon him it may be now and then
an hasty passant glance, the careless cast of
a wandering eye; and was this likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an abiding permanent <hi>delight?</hi> Have you
been wont to compose your selves designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and on purpose to think of him, so as
your thoughts might be said to have been
<hi>directed</hi> towards him by the <hi>desire</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
bent of your heart; according to
that,<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The desire of our Soul is towards thy

it is that 'tis represented as the <hi>usual posture</hi> of
them whom he reckons among his Jewels,
and for whom the book of <hi>remembrance</hi> was
written,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> that <hi>they thought on his name.</hi> A thing
that they might be <hi>known by,</hi> and distinguisht
from other men; (wherefore it is observable,
that their <hi>remembrance</hi> of him, was thought
worth the <hi>remembring,</hi> and to be transmitted
into records, never to be forgotten). The
evil of your <hi>not-delighting in God,</hi> hath a
great accession from your negligent thinking
of him.</p>
               <p>2. Have not your thoughts of Him been
<hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> such as have imported <hi>light
esteem?</hi> Compare them with those admiring
thoughts,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among

                  <hi>how excellent is thy name in

such thoughts? Bethink your selves, how
deeply culpable you have made your neglect
to <hi>delight in God,</hi> by your unworthy thoughts,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:32156:151"/>
by which you have detracted so unspeakably
from the Divine excellency! Hence you have
more to account for than meerly <hi>not-delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in God,</hi> a rendering him such to your
selves, as if he were <hi>not worthy to be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in.</hi> How ought this to shake your hearts!</p>
               <p>3. Have they not been <hi>hard thoughts;</hi> full
of censure, and misjudging of his Nature,
Counsels, Ways and Works? Have there not
been perverse reasonings, with dislike of his
Methods of Government over men <hi>in this
present state?</hi> As if he had <hi>too little</hi> kindness
for such as you would have him favour, and
<hi>too much</hi> for others; Judging his <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>hatred</hi> by false measures? This seems to be
much the evil unto which the Injunction of
<hi>delight in God</hi> is <hi>here</hi> opposed in this Psalm;
and whence it may be estimated, how direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>that</hi> militates against <hi>this,</hi> and prevailing,
excludes it. Perhaps you have <hi>delighted</hi> so
little in God, because ye have thought (the
thing that is so wearisom to him), <hi>Every
one that doth evil is good in the sight of the
Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and he delighteth in them;</hi> and have said
in your hearts, <hi>Where is the God of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or have you not been more peccant in
your apprehensions of his <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for the disposing of men <hi>as to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
states?</hi> Have you not disbelieved the <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
he hath given of his Nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
declarations of his mind and purpose
touching these matters? Was it not enough
for you to have known his gracious propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:32156:151"/>
towards returning sinners, that desire
him <hi>again</hi> for their God, and willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the grace, and submit themselves to the
conduct and government of his Son? Should
not this have allured and won your hearts to
him, and made you, with humble thankful
admiration of his grace, resign and yeild your
selves to be his for ever? Have you not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
your apprehensions of him by the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
and misgivings of your guilty jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
hearts; or by your experienc'd animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and the implacableness of your own
spirits towards such as have offended <hi>you;</hi>
as if he could forgive no more than you are
dispos'd to do? Have you not oppos'd your
own imaginations of him to his express testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of himself, that <hi>He is Love; Slow to
anger, and of great mercy, &amp;c. And that as the
heavens are high above the earth, so are his
ways above your ways, and his thoughts above
your thoughts?</hi> Have you not (against his
plain word) thought him irreconcilable, and
averse to the accepting of any atonement for
you? prescribed and set bounds to him, and
thought your sin <hi>greater than could be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given?</hi>
And if hereupon you have not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi>
in him, and have found all ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
affection towards him stifled within you,
as your <hi>not-delighting in him,</hi> was a foul evil;
<hi>the more-sinful injurious cause</hi> (denying the
infinite goodness of his Nature, and giving
the lye to his Word) hath made it beyond all
expression worse. And further at least consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:32156:152"/>
4. Have not your thoughts of God been
<hi>few?</hi> Is not the meditation of him with you
an unwonted thing? The <hi>Psalmist, resolving
to mind him much,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>To praise and sing to him
as long as he lived, and while he had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Doth as it were prophesie to himself,
that <hi>his meditation of him should be sweet.</hi>
Frequent (right) thoughts of God, will
surely be pleasant delightful thoughts: But
your <hi>little delight in God</hi> too plainly argues,
you have minded him but seldom. And how
full of guilt is your <hi>not-delighting in God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account? How cheap is the expence
of a thought? What, that so much should
not be done in order to the <hi>delightful rest</hi> of
your Soul in God!</p>
               <p>3. It supposes much <hi>carnality,</hi> a prone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and addictedness to this earth and
the things of it; And thereupon argues in
you a very mean abject spirit. While you can
take no pleasure (or do take so little) in
God, is there nothing else wherein you take
pleasure? And what is it? God hath in this
matter no other rival than <hi>this world.</hi> 'Tis
its <hi>friendship</hi> that is <hi>enmity</hi> to him; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other of it,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eye,</hi> or <hi>the pride of life prevails far,</hi>
while <hi>the love of the Father hath so little place
in you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Whither are you sunk? into how
low and vile a temper of spirit, when you
can take pleasure in so base things, rather than
in the blessed God; and quit so high and
pure <hi>delights</hi> for mire and dirt? What hath
thus carnalized your minds, that you favour
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:32156:152"/>
only the things of the flesh, and Divine things
are tasteless and without relish?</p>
               <p>Nor are you to think more favourably of
your case, if you take <hi>little actual compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
in the world also; probably it is because
you have little of it to <hi>delight</hi> in; it may be
you are more acquainted with the <hi>cares</hi> of it
than the <hi>delights;</hi> or your <hi>desire</hi> after it is
much larger than your <hi>possession.</hi> 'Tis all one
for that. But what are your hearts <hi>most apt</hi>
to <hi>delight in?</hi> or, what is most agreeable to
your temper? 'Tis the same thing, what
earthly affection predominates in you, while
the <hi>temper of your spirit is earthly;</hi> and it is
thereby held off from God. Your not-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
actual earthly delights to put in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
against heavenly, is only by accident.
But all your cares, desires and hopes of that
vile kind, would turn into as vile delights,
if you had your wills. In the mean time,
you are the more excuseless, and your sin is the
grosser, That even the <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> of
<hi>this world</hi> are of more value with you than
<hi>delight in God.</hi> How far are you from that
temper,<note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and
whom do I desire on earth besides thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And how sad an argument is it, <hi>of
downright aversion and disaffectedness to God,
in a great degree at least yet remaining!</hi> Whence
can your <hi>not-delighting in him</hi> proceed, but
from this, <hi>as its most immediate cause?</hi> What
could hinder you, if your heart were inclin'd?
Are you not astonisht, to behold this as the
state of your case, That you <hi>delight not in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:32156:153"/>
him, because your heart is against it;</hi> that is,
<hi>from flat enmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what doth more naturally import en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to any thing, than to turn off from it,
as not being able to take pleasure in it. So
God expresses his detestation of Apostates,
<hi>If any man draw back,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>my Soul shall have no
pleasure in him.</hi> And his contempt of <hi>Jecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah</hi>
is signified by the like manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Do you not tremble to think that this
should be the temper of your spirit towards
God, and that your estimate of him, as if
he were a <hi>despised broken Idol,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 22.</note> and as mean
a thing, as a <hi>vessel wherein is no pleasure?</hi> Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
then thus with your self; As your case
stands, and things do lye between God and
you, your <hi>little delight in God</hi> can have no
more favourable account given of it, nor be
resolved into any gentler or milder cause than
<hi>enmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this seem to you not to be a <hi>cause,</hi>
but to be <hi>coincident,</hi> and fall in with it, so
much the worse. By how much less this <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
hath of <hi>antecedency</hi> to your <hi>neglect,</hi> or
the more it seems <hi>the same</hi> with it, so much
the more it discovers the <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>thing it
self.</hi> For by what worse name can we call
any thing than <hi>enmity to God?</hi> But we speak
of your <hi>habitual temper,</hi> as that which is the
cause of your <hi>actual neglect.</hi> And since you
have a discovery of God as the most delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object, cannot pretend there is a better,
have leave and free permission to place your
<hi>delight</hi> on him, yea are earnestly invited and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:32156:153"/>
prest to it, 'Tis plain, nothing else is in your
way to hinder you; Therefore you <hi>delight
not in him,</hi> because your <hi>heart only is averse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We also might insist further to shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                  <hi>the evils that ensue and follow upon this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:</hi>
Such I mean, as do not follow <hi>casually</hi>
and by <hi>accident,</hi> but which have a very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
connexion</hi> with it, and are its most <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
consequents;</hi> being some way <hi>caused by it,</hi>
or which it doth very <hi>directly tend</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</p>
               <p>And yet these we need not be solicitously
curious to distinguish, as things of a <hi>kind</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
diverse from those last mentioned
under the foregoing head.</p>
               <p>For it is very apparent, the same things
may both <hi>cause little delight in God,</hi> and <hi>be
caused thereby;</hi> As a person may therefore
<hi>not delight in God</hi> because he <hi>knows him not,</hi>
and may therefore be the less apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>knowledg of him,</hi> because he hath <hi>no
delight in him.</hi> And the case is the same as
to the other things spoken of as <hi>causes</hi> of
this omission, <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>it</hi> and <hi>they</hi> may be
mutual causes of one another. But it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
equally serves the design of aggravating
the evil of not taking frequent actual <hi>delight
in God,</hi> that hereby <hi>sin grows,</hi> whether in
the <hi>same</hi> or in <hi>different kinds;</hi> There is still
an increase of sin, though but of the same
sort that was in being before.</p>
               <p>You ought to consider then, As you take
so little <hi>delight in God</hi> from that very bad
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:32156:154"/>
cause, that you have not entertained the right
knowledg of him, when you had so great
opportunity to get much of it, which makes
your matter very ill; Do you not also find
that by your withholding your selves from
<hi>delighting in him,</hi> you have still less disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to seek his more inward acquaintance?
And doth not that make your matter much
worse? If you already know somewhat of
him, you yet know but in part; your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is infinite, and this knowledg so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that you cannot fully attain to it, there
is still more to be known.</p>
               <p>Now therefore if you did <hi>delight much in
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 63.</note> would you not be <hi>pressing hard after him?</hi>
would you not be <hi>following on to know him?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 6.</note>
And then would his goings forth be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before you as the morning, and he would
be still visiting you with fresh and increasing
light; whereupon your pleasure would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and increased by every fresh view, and
consequently your progress would be from
sight to sight, and from pleasure to pleasure;
whereas now this wheel stands still, or you
are going back into darkness and desolation.
Have you not much the more to answer for
upon this account?</p>
               <p>The like may be said as to the rest. The ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectitude
and great faultiness of your thoughts
of God, though that contribute not a little
to your <hi>not-delighting in him,</hi> yet also, if you
did <hi>delight in him more,</hi> would not your
thoughts of him be more deeply serious, more
highly raised? Would you not be very unapt
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:32156:154"/>
to take up injurious hard thoughts of him?
Would not his thoughts (once become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to you) be also numerous, or innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
rather,<note place="margin">Psal. 139.</note> as the sands of the Sea-shore?
Would not your earthly temper, your strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and aversness to him, vanish and wear off,
if you were more exercised in actual delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
converses with him? Therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency
and increase of those mentioned evils,
and that they have got such setled rooting in
you, is all to be charged upon your not-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
your selves to more frequent <hi>actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides what may further follow hereupon,
<hi>The languishment and decays of your inward man;
The difficulty you find to trust in God,</hi> when
you are reduc'd to straits, (as who would
commit his concernments to one he doth not
love?); <hi>Your impatience of adverse and cross
emergencies,</hi> that may often befal to you; <hi>Your
aptness to vexation or despondency; The easie
victory a temptation hath over you,</hi> as surely he
is sooner drawn away from God, or into sin
against him, who delights not in him); <hi>Your
less-usefulness in your place and station; Your
want of courage, resolution, zeal for God,</hi> (which
are best maintained by <hi>delight</hi> and the relishes
of a sweet complacency taken in him); <hi>Your
sluggishness in a course of well-doing; The sense
of a toilsom heavy labour in Religion,</hi> that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
you weariness without rest, (whence
you rather affect a rest <hi>from it,</hi> than <hi>in it</hi>
and <hi>by it);</hi> and lastly, <hi>Your continual bondage
by the fear of death,</hi> (which one would not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:32156:155"/>
dread, apprehending it only a removal into
his presence in whom I delight). All these
things (which might have been distinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, and more expresly accommodated
to the present purpose, but that I would not
be over-tedious, and that somewhere else some
or other of them may fall again in our way)
do bring in <hi>great and weighty additions</hi> to the
evil and guiltiness of this sin, and much tend
to lay load upon it, to fill up its measure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto pressing down and running over.
For how just is it, to impute to it what it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
causes, and lay its own impure and
viperous births at its own door?</p>
               <p>And though this Discourse have been
drawn out to a greater length than was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it will not be lost labour, if by all
that hath been said, any that fear God shall
be brought to apprehend more of the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this sin; and the <hi>self-indulgent thought</hi>
be banisht far from them, that <hi>this is either
an indifferent matter,</hi> or at least (if it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a careless) 'tis <hi>one of their more harmless
inadvertencies and omissions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which good effect, if through the blessing
of God it may accomplish, there will be the
less need unto such to read on, but take their
nearer way to the immediate present <hi>practice</hi>
of this great Duty. And because also it is
to be hoped, that the evil of this neglect
once apprehended, will prompt and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
serious and considering persons to set
upon the enjoined Duty; It will be the
less necessary to enlarge much in that other
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:32156:155"/>
kind of Discourse, which we now come to,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Invitation thereunto.</hi> Wherein yet we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
have reason to fear it may be too needful to
place some part of our present labour. For
though in matters of an infinitely inferior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and concernment, any practice is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertaken that is once represented reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and gainful; In such a business as this, an
hundred difficulties are imagined; we stand
as persons that cannot find their hands; and
all the question is, (even if there be some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to it, or conviction at least it should
be done), <hi>But how shall we go about it?</hi> We are
apt to grope as in the dark, even at noon-day,
and cannot find the door or way that
leads into a <hi>practice</hi> wherein there is so much
both of <hi>pleasantness</hi> and <hi>duty.</hi> Therefore as
the case is, the <hi>Invitation</hi> to this exercise ought,
if it were possible, to be a kind of <hi>manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and it is needful we be not only <hi>called</hi> and
<hi>prest,</hi> but even led into it. This then we are
to endeavour, the giving of some <hi>plain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,</hi>
that may put us into an easie and
direct way of falling expeditely upon this
delightful work.</p>
               <p>And here it must be considered, that all
(as hath been said) are not in an equal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to it; Some are more averse, others
less, but all too much; Therefore are we to
begin as <hi>low</hi> as their case may require, who
are <hi>less dispos'd;</hi> and so proceeding on in our
course, somewhat may fall in more sutable
to them who are in some disposition to it,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:32156:156"/>
but do yet need (as who do not?) some
help and furtherance in order thereto.</p>
               <p>First therefore, <hi>It is necessary, that you do
deliberately and resolvedly design the thing it
self.</hi> Propose to your selves <hi>delighting in God</hi>
as a <hi>business</hi> unto which you will designedly
and with stedfast purpose apply your whole
Soul. Content not your selves with light
roving thoughts about it, which many have
about divers matters which they never think fit
to engage themselves in. Determine the matter
fully in your own heart, and say, <hi>Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
I have tried in my time, sundry things I
have turn'd my mind unto, to little purpose, I
will now, see what there is of delight to be found
in God.</hi> The sloth and aversion of a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heart must be overcome by <hi>resolution;</hi>
and that <hi>resolution</hi> be well-weighed, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
taken up, deeply fixed, that it may
last and overcome. And why should you
not be resolved in this point? Is this a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
always to be waved? Know you another
way to be happy? Are you yet to learn, that
a reasonable Soul needs the fulness of God
to make it happy, and that there is no other
God but one? Can there be any dispute or
doubt in the case, when there is but <hi>one
thing</hi> to be done, besides yeilding ones self to
be miserable for ever? And what need of that,
while yet there is <hi>one way</hi> to avoid it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>that there is but one,</hi> is better than if
there were a thousand. You need not now
be lnog in chusing; nor do you need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate,
<hi>becauseof any doubt</hi> in the case, but
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:32156:156"/>
                  <hi>that you may more fully comprehend in your own
thoughts that there is none,</hi> and that your <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
may hereupon grow the more <hi>peremptory,</hi>
and secure from the danger of any change.</p>
               <p>To talk of any difficulty in the matter, is
a strange impertinency; for who would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>difficulty</hi> to <hi>necessity?</hi> or alledg, <hi>the thing
is hard</hi> which <hi>must be done?</hi> Or must it be
done, and never be attempted? or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not be resolved upon? You have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do to read further, who will not
digest this <hi>first counsel,</hi> and here settle your
resolution, <hi>I will apply my self to a course of
delight in God.</hi> If this appear not reasonable
to you, despair that any thing will that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
'Tis foolish trifling, to look upon such
writings that profess their design, and have
it in their fronts, that they are meant for
<hi>helps unto Christian practice,</hi> only with an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of <hi>seeing what a man can say.</hi> And if
ever you will be in earnest, you must return
to this point; And will but waste time to
no purpose, if you will not now set down
your resolution; that is, <hi>That you will seek an
happiness for your Soul,</hi> (too long already neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected!);
an happiness that may <hi>satisfie</hi> and
<hi>last;</hi> And (where only it is to be found)
in the <hi>blessed God;</hi> and <hi>in him</hi> by <hi>setting your
selves to delight in him;</hi> since nothing can
make you happy wherein you delight not. And
that you will make use of what you further
read, according as you find it conducing,
and apt to serve your purpose herein. Then
next,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:32156:157"/>
2. Consider your <hi>present state Godward.
Must you,</hi> do you see <hi>you must</hi> come to this
point, of <hi>having your delight in God?</hi> In
what posture then are your affairs towards
him? How do things stand between him and
you? You do well know, you were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him, and his enemy; and that his
Justice and holy Nature obliged him to hold
you as such, (though he never gave you
ground to think him implacable). Can you
delight in an enemy? who (as matters in
that case stand) must be apprehended ready
to avenge himself on you, and as having whet
his glittering Sword, and made the Arrow
ready upon the string, directed against your
very heart? Apprehend this to <hi>have been</hi>
your case, and most deservedly, That you
were an impure hateful wretch, deformed
and loathsom, one that could yeild the holy
God no matter of <hi>delight,</hi> full of enmity and
contrariety to him, and in whom he could
not but find much cause of most just hatred.
Remember you were one of his revolted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
under his most deserved wrath and
curse. Know at how vast a distance you were
from <hi>delighting in him,</hi> or a state that could
admit of it. Consider, Is this still your case?
And do not rashly think it altered; or that
you have nothing to do, but out of hand
to rush upon the business of <hi>delighting in
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yet <hi>do not think it unalterable.</hi> Do
not conclude it as a determined and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thing, that matters can never be taken
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:32156:157"/>
up between God and you, or you become
sutable and acceptable to him. Look not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your vile wicked heart as unalterably
wicked; nor upon him therefore as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
enemy. Account he waits for your
turning to him, as being inclin'd to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with you; Otherwise would vengeance
have suffered you so long to live? Have you
not been long at his mercy? Hath he not
spared you, when it was in his power to
crush you at pleasure? Do not think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(what you have no pretence for) that
he hath a destructive design upon you, and
will accept of no atonement.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Acquaint your self with the way and
terms upon which his Gospel declares him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable;</hi>
that is, that he will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to you <hi>while you remain wicked,</hi> nor
for <hi>your own sake,</hi> become you <hi>never so good.</hi>
That a more costly sacrifice than you can
either <hi>procure</hi> or <hi>be,</hi> must expiate your guilt,
and make your peace. If this matter could
have been effected in a less expensive way,
the <hi>Son of God</hi> had not (as you know he
was) been <hi>designed</hi> himself, and <hi>made</hi> that
sacrifice; nor a work have been undertaken
by him that might as well have been done
by common hands. And since he submitted
and undertook as he did, reckon with your
self, how highly just it is, that the entire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of so merciful condescension, and so
great a performance, be wholly ascribed to
him. But withal know, he shed his blood,
not in kindness <hi>to your sin,</hi> but <hi>to you:</hi> And
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:32156:158"/>
that his design was at once to procure the
death of that, and your life; That you need
his Spirit as well as his Blood; <hi>that</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
and reconcile you to his Holiness,
as well as <hi>this</hi> to his vindictive Justice; That
as you expect ever to experience and taste
the <hi>delights</hi> of that communion, whereinto
he calls you, you must not only <hi>have the blood
of Christ to cleanse you from all sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 17.</note> but must also
<hi>walk in the light, as he is in the light;</hi> That
an entire resignation, a betrusting and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of your self to the mercy and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
power of the Redeemer, is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the setting of things right between
God and you; In whom only you may both
accept God and be accepted of him; That
he must be the center of union between God
and you; and that union the ground of all
delightful intercourse.</p>
               <p>5. Make request to him, that he would draw
you into that union with his Son; unto whom
none can come,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.</note> but who are drawn by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>Do not dream and slumber in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but know your <hi>All</hi> depends on it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the exigency of your case. Do you
find your heart sluggish and indispos'd to
any such transaction with God and Christ?
Doth it decline and draw back? Know, it
herein doth but act its own nature, and do
as it is, or like it self; Therefore stir up your
self,<note place="margin">Isa. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>to take hold of his strength;</hi> in which way,
if you have mind to be at peace, <hi>you shall
make peace.</hi> Cry to him earnestly, <q>Draw a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:32156:158"/>
poor wretch out of darkness and death,
that must otherwise be at eternal distance
from thee, and be miserable for ever. Join
me to him who will bring me to thee, and
make me one for ever with thee.</q> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Accepting Jesus Christ as thy Saviour and thy
Lord; accept in him, with all humble reverence,
thankfulness and admiration of divine mercy
and goodness, the blessed God to be thy God;
surrendring and yeilding up thy self entirely
and fully to be his for ever.</hi> Do this unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and with great solemnity; And let it be
to thee for an everlasting memorial! Record
it as a memorable day, wherein thou didst
go out of thy self, and all finite, narrow, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
good, and pass into union with the
eternal, immense, incomprehensible and all-comprehending
good, and enter upon it as
thine own! And what, wilt thou <hi>delight</hi> in a
God that is not thine? Canst thou be content
to look wistly on him, as one unrelated and a
stranger? Apprehend (and bless God that
this is the state of the case), that in this way
he offers himself most <hi>freely</hi> to thee. It were
astonishing to think of purchasing so great a
good! the matter were not to be offered at.
But how transporting is it, that nothing but
<hi>acceptance</hi> and <hi>resignation</hi> should be needful
to make thee one with the great God, and
make his fulness thine! Therefore make haste
to do this, and be not hasty in doing it.
Defer not, but do it with great seriousness,
deliberation, and fulness of consent; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:32156:159"/>
you are about to enter into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant not to to be forgotten;
and doing a thing never to be again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>Now if herein your heart be sincere, and
there be a real and vital exercise of <hi>your very
Soul</hi> in this transaction with God in Christ,
so as that you truly take him for your God,
preferring him in your estimation and choice
above all things, and giving up your self
absolutely and without reservation to him
as his, to be governed and disposed of by
him in all things at his pleasure; You are
hereby brought into that state that doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of <hi>delighting in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what remains to be said, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
you as persons in a nearer capacity, and
who have a kind of fundamental aptitude and
disposedness of heart unto this spiritual work;
And will therefore be directed to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
according to that supposition.</p>
               <p>Only it is withal to be considered, in the
case of many such, that they were arrived
hither long ago, and been (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
supposed) hereupon somewhat exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and vers'd in this piece of holy practice,
have had many pleasant turns with God, and
tasted often the <hi>delights</hi> of his converse: But
have discontinued their course, and are grown
strange to him who was their <hi>delight;</hi> have
suffered themselves by insensible degrees to
be drawn and tempted away from him; or
there hath been some grosser and more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
rupture, by which they have broken
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:32156:159"/>
themselves off. It will be requisite to say
somewhat more peculiar to these, (for the
reducing of them again even to this unitive
point); After which, what shall ensue, may
in common concern them, and all that are
arrived so far, together.</p>
               <p>For such therefore whose case this is, it
will surely both become and concern you
to take this course:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Make a stand, and bethink your selves;</hi>
Can you justifie your carriage towards him
whom you have taken to be your God? Can
you approve your own way? Was this all
that you oblig'd your selves unto in the day
of your solemn Treaty with him; Only to
take on you the Name of a Relation to him,
and so (excepting that you would now and
then complement him in some piece of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heartless homage) take leave till you
meet again with him in another world? And
that in the mean time this present world, or
your carnal self (to be gratified and served
out of it) should really be your God, and
He only bear the name? Was this indeed
your meaning? Or if it was, did you deal
sincerely in that Treaty? Or can you think
it was his meaning, and that he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no more from you? Can you allow your
selves so to interpret his Covenant, and give
this as the summary account of the tenor of
it? How would you then expound it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!
And make a meer trifle of it! And
make your Religion a fitter service for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
sensless Idol, than the living and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:32156:160"/>
true God; Do you not yet know what the
Name of God imports? Can he be a God to
you that is not acknowledg'd by you as your
very best, the universal, and absolutely all-comprehending
good? But if you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
there was really more in the matter; and
that you have been altogether faulty in this
thing. Then,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Represent to your selves as fully as you can
the greatness of the fault.</hi> What have you
made God an unnecessary thing to you,
while the Creature, your very Idols, lying
vanities, were thought necessary? And these
were the things upon which you thought
fit to set your hearts! <hi>Which you have loved,
which you have served, after which you have
walked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which you have sought, and whom you
have worshipt!</hi> (The heap of expressions
wherewith it seem'd meet to the Spirit of God
to set out the profuse lavishness of Idolatrous
affection). Think how monstrous this is!
Revolve in your own minds the several ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
of your sinful neglect before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and labour to feel the weight of them
upon your own spirits; Think what time
you have lost from pleasant <hi>delightful walking
with God!</hi> What damage you have done your
selves! How far you might have attained!
How much you are cast behind in your
preparations for a blessed Eternity! What
wrong you have done him, whom you
took for the <hi>God of your life,</hi> to whom
you vowed your hearts and souls! How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
kindly and truly you have dealt with
him!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:32156:160"/>
3. <hi>Return to him with weeping and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Open your selves freely to him. Let
him hear you <hi>bemoaning your selves,</hi> pour out
your Souls to him, in large acknowledgments
and confessions of your guiltiness; which, while
you keep silence, will consume your bones and
waste you to nothing. <hi>Remember whence you are
fal'n,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and repent and do your first works.</hi> Till
then, <hi>He hath this against you, that you have left
your first love.</hi> And consider, Is it not a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
thing to you? Doth it not pain your
hearts, that your Lord and Redeemer should
have <hi>somewhat against you</hi> (as it were laid up,
noted, and put on record, kept in store, and
(as himself remarkably expresses it,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>(sealed up
among his treasures);</hi> somewhat that sticks
with him, and which he bears in mind, and
hath lying in his heart against you? Is this a
small thing with you? when that must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be his <hi>sense</hi> (and suppose him
saying to you) <hi>I remember the kindness of thy
youth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the love of thine espousals</hi>—And now
since those former days, <hi>What iniquity hast
thou found in me, that thou art gone far from me,
and hast walked after vanity, and art become
vain?</hi> How confounding a thing were it, if
he should say, as sometime to others in a case
resembling yours (and why should you not
take it as equally belonging to you)? <hi>O my
people,</hi>

                  <hi>What have I done unto thee? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have I wearied thee? testifie against me:</hi> And
while the <hi>case admits</hi> such sharp and cutting
rebuke, and that it is the <hi>matter of rebuke</hi> (not
rebuke it self abstracted from the matter, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:32156:161"/>
if it were causless) that should smart or
wound; How becoming is it! and sutable to
the case, to cast down a wounded bleeding
heart before the Lord, and be abased in the
dust at the footstool of his Mercy-seat! And
though your sin be great and hainous;</p>
               <p>4. Yet apprehend you are before a <hi>Mercy-Seat;</hi>
That <hi>there is forgiveness with him that
he may be feared.</hi> How would this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
promote the humiliation which the case
requires! A sullen despondency that excludes
hope of mercy hardens the heart; continues
the sinful comfortless distance: Therefore
apply your selves to him; seek his Pardon in
the Blood of the Redeemer; know you need
it, and that it is only upon such terms to be
obtained.</p>
               <p>Yet also take heed lest any diminishing
thoughts of the evil of your sin return, and
make you neglect the <hi>thing,</hi> or wave the
known stated <hi>way</hi> of remission. We are apt
to look upon crimes whereby <hi>men are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
offended,</hi> (and which therefore are of
worse reputation <hi>among men),</hi> as robbery,
murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as very horrid. This is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that lies immediately between <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Spirit;</hi> the God of the Spirits of all flesh and
your Spirit. You have had a solemn trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
with him, and have dealt falsly: And
though the matter were secret between God
and you, Is it the less evil <hi>in it self</hi> for that?
If you had dealt unworthily, and used base
treachery towards a friend, in a matter only
known to him and your self, Would you not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:32156:161"/>
when you have reflected, blush to see his face,
till matters be composed betwixt you? And
is there another way of having them compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and of restoring <hi>delightful</hi> friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
than by your seeking his Pardon, and
his granting it? Could you have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to put your self upon conversing with
him as at former times, without such a preface?
Or were it not great immodesty and impudence
to offer at it? But that when this hath been
the case between the blessed God and you, and
you now come with deep resentments, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
unfeigned acknowledgments of your
most offensive neglects of him, to seek for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
at his hand, he should be easie and
facile to forgive; How should this melt you
down before him! And this is what his own
word obliges you to apprehend and believe of
him.<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>These words</hi> He hath required to <hi>be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed</hi>
to you; <hi>Return you back-sliding ones,
and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you;
for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will
not keep anger for ever.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Only acknowledg your
iniquity, that you have transgressed against the
Lord your God, and have scattered your ways to
the strangers under every green tree</hi> (your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
hath been Idolatry as well as theirs);
<hi>Turn, O backsliding Children, saith the Lord;
for I am married unto you—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What heart would not break and bleed at
this overture! You can be recovered to no
capacity of <hi>delighting in God,</hi> as heretofore,
till you sensibly feel the need of great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
and have a disposition of heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:32156:162"/>
to relish the sweetness and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; Till those words do agree with
the sense of your hearts, and you can (as in
a transport) cry out, <hi>O the blessedness of the
man</hi> (as the expression imports) <hi>whose ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
is forgiven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and whose sin is covered!</hi> &amp;c.
And now when you are come thus far, if the
temper of your Spirit be right even in this,
there will be in conjunction with the desire,
hope and value of forgiveness, at least an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
dread of such future strangenesses and
breaches between God and you: And that
will be very natural to you, which I next
add as further advice;</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Most earnestly seek and crave a better and
more fixed temper of spirit;</hi> More fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and bent Godward; That <hi>your heart
may be directed into the love of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 5.</note> That <hi>the
spirit of love, power, and a sound mind may bear
rule in you.</hi> Be intent upon the recovery of
that healthy soundness, which wheresoever it
hath place, will with a certain steady power,
and a strong inclining bent of love, carry
your heart toward God. And take heed lest
you be satisfied in the expectation and hope
of forgiveness, as to your former neglects of
God, without this.</p>
               <p>There is a manifest prejudice daily accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Christian name and profession, by
the unequal estimation which that part of
the Doctrine of Christ hath, that concerns
the <hi>work of his Spirit upon us, regeneration,</hi>
the <hi>new creature, repentance,</hi> and an <hi>holy life;</hi>
in comparison of that which concerns <hi>his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:32156:162"/>
and <hi>acquisitions for us, expiation of
sin, satisfaction of Divine Justice, forgiveness</hi>
and <hi>acceptance with God.</hi> How sweet ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
transporting Doctrines, and how <hi>pure
Gospel</hi> are these <hi>latter</hi> accounted by many, who
esteem the former cold, sapless, unpleasant
notions! Thence comes Christian Religion
to look with so distorted a face and aspect,
as if it suffered a convulsion, that hath altered
and disguised it unto that degree, that it is
hardly to be known; being made to seem as if
it imported only a <hi>design to rescue some persons
from Divine Wrath and Justice, without ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them that disposition of heart which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
both to their serving of God and their blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in him.</hi> This is not to be imputed so much
to the misrepresentation made of it by them,
whose business it hath been to instruct others,
(though of them <hi>too many</hi> may have been
very faulty in almost suppressing or insisting
less, or very little, upon Doctrines of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
strain, while the stream of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
hath mostly run upon the other); for
it must be acknowledged, that by very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in our age, the absolute necessity of the
great heart-change hath been both most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represented, and as urgently prest as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in most that have gone before. But the
matter is plainly to be most attributed to that
depravedness of mans nature, whence there
is a most unequal and partial reception of
the Truth of God; and that which seems
(taken apart by it self) to import more of
<hi>indulgence to sinners</hi> is readily catcht at, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:32156:163"/>
which more directly <hi>strikes at the very root of
sin,</hi> is let pass as if it had never been spoken.
And so men <hi>make up to themselves</hi> a Gospel of
this tenor and import, <hi>That let the temper of
their spirits towards God be what it will, if they
rely and rest upon the righteousness of Christ,
God will be reconciled to them.</hi> And they think
they need take no further care. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is said in the Gospel <hi>of Christ</hi> besides,
of the necessity of <hi>being born of God,</hi> of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
a Divine nature,</hi> of <hi>putting off the old
man,</hi> and <hi>putting on the new,</hi> &amp;c. is lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as if it had been thrown in by chance,
and did signifie nothing. And the other,
without this, is thought to be <hi>pure Gospel;</hi>
As if <hi>these</hi> were impertinent additions and
falsifications. But will not such men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the detracting of any thing from
the Instrument or Testament of a man, as
well as adding thereto, makes it <hi>another
thing,</hi> and none of his <hi>act</hi> or <hi>deed?</hi> And so
that their <hi>pure Gospel,</hi> as they call it, is <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel,</hi> nay (because there cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other)
<hi>no Gospel?</hi> Or will they not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
how <hi>simply impossible it is,</hi> in the very
<hi>nature of the thing,</hi> that the end should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
of bringing men to blessedness, <hi>(i. e.</hi>
to a <hi>delightful rest in God</hi>), without their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>new nature,</hi> an heart inclined and bent
toward God, wrought to a conformity and
agreement with Gods own holy Nature and
Will, unto which the offer and hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
by the Blood of Christ is designed
to win and form them? For can men be happy
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:32156:163"/>
in him in whom they take no delight? or
delight in him to whom the very temper
of their spirits is habitually unsutable and
repugnant? How plain are things to them
that are not resolved <hi>not to see!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore beware of contenting your selves
with the meer hope, that upon your having
admitted a conviction, and felt some regret
in your spirits for former strangeness to God,
you shall be pardoned; so as thereupon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to design a redress, but run on the same
course as before: And when you have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
contracted a new score, and the load of
your guilt begins to be sensibly heavy upon
you, then betake your selves to God for a
new pardon. What presumptuous trifling is
this with the Lord of Heaven and Earth!
And what do you mean by it, or seem to
expect? Is it not, that God should instead of
remitting your sin to you remit your duty;
cancel the obligation of that very supream
universal fundamental Law of Nature it self,
and excuse you quite from ever loving, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in him, or setting your heart upon
him at all? Think not forgiveness alone then
will serve your turn; it will signifie as much
as a pardon will do to a Malefactor just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to dye of a mortal disease; he, poor man!
as much needs a <hi>skilful Physician,</hi> as a <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince;</hi> And so do you. And your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is nothing the worse (sure), that the
person of each is sustained by the same Jesus,
and that both parts can be performed by the
same hand. And know, that a <hi>restored recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:32156:164"/>
of Spirit Godward, a <hi>renewed healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and soundness of heart, with your <hi>actual
delighting in God</hi> thereupon in your future
course, stands in <hi>nearer</hi> and more immediate
connexion with your final perfect delightful
rest and blessedness in him, than your being
perpetually forgiven the not-doing of it; if
<hi>this</hi> were supposed possible without <hi>that;</hi> But
it is not indeed supposable, for if God would
not therefore hereafter banish you his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
(as now he does not), you would for
ever banish your selves, as now you do.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Let there be a solemn recognition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
of your engagement and devoting of your
self to God.</hi> Again take hold of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and see that it take faster hold of you.
Do it as if you had never done it, as if you
were now to begin with him; only that
<hi>your own sin</hi> and <hi>his grace</hi> ought now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
greater in your eyes; <hi>that</hi> more odious,
that you have added <hi>treachery</hi> to <hi>disaffection;
this</hi> more glorious and admirable, that yet
he hath left open to you a door of hope, and
that there is <hi>place for repentance,</hi> and that he
is ready to treat with you again on a new
score. With what humility, shame, fear and
trembling, distrust of your self, resolution of
future more diligent circumspection and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of your own spirit, trust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on <hi>his,</hi> ought this transaction now
to be managed with the holy God!</p>
               <p>And when you are thus returned into the
way and course of your duty; Then may what
follows concern you in common with all other,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:32156:164"/>
that (being entered) desire direction how to
proceed and improve in this holy Exercise of
Delighting in God.</p>
               <p>Because therefore such as have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
practised in this course, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't
of the equity and excellency of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make progress therein, do yet find a
difficulty in it; it goes not easily with them,
they are easily diverted and can hardly hold
on in it; some what is intended to be said, that
possibly may, through the Lords blessing be
of some use as to that (too-common) case.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>First then, Let it be your great study and
endeavour to get a temper of mind actually, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
and more entirely spiritual.</hi> We suppose
the implantation of some holy and spiritual
Principles in you already; But that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
For as a mind <hi>wholly carnal,</hi> only
savours the things of the flesh, will perpetually
withdraw and recoil, if you offer it any thing
tending God-ward; so, <hi>in whatsoever degree
it is carnal,</hi> it will do thus in a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
degree. If you say, <hi>let me now apply my
self to some delightful intercourse with God,</hi>
while an earthly tincture is fresh with you, and
it was some carnal thing that made the last im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon your spirit, many excuses will
be found out, there will be manifold diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
It will never be thought seasonable.
Many other things will be judged necessary to
be minded first.</p>
               <p>Wherefore fence against the addictedness of
your hearts to those <hi>other things.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
through the great advantages that sensible
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:32156:165"/>
things have upon your senses and imagination,
you are in continual danger to be over-born
and held off from God; This you must ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
intend to watch and fortifie those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi>
and not to give away your souls to sense
and the things of sense. Trust not your senses
and their objects to parly, but under strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.
Never suffer that they should let
in upon you what is sutable and grateful to
them at their own pleasure.</p>
               <p>You need to have somewhat else than sense,
even a <hi>spirit of might and power,</hi> that may
counter-mand and over-rule in every of those
ports, and <hi>turn the battle in the gate.</hi> Those
use to be the places of most strength; and
surely here there needs most. Your case and
present state cannot admit that you securely
give up your selves to unmixed unsolicitous
<hi>delight</hi> even in the best Object. If you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit
<hi>care</hi> and <hi>vigilancy,</hi> you will soon have
such things come in upon you, as will make a
<hi>worse mixture</hi> in your <hi>delight</hi> than <hi>they</hi> can do,
and corrupt and spoil all. Your <hi>delight</hi> were
better to be mixed with <hi>holy care,</hi> than with
<hi>sinful vanity; that</hi> tends to preserve, <hi>this</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to destroy it. Your state is that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
and warfare: You must be content with
such spiritual <hi>delight,</hi> as will consist with this
state. In a time of War and Danger, when a
City is beset with a surrounding Enemy, and
all the Inhabitants are to be intent upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Safety, their case will not admit, that they
should <hi>entirely</hi> indulge themselves to ease and
pleasure: And surely it is better to bear the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:32156:165"/>
inconvenience of Watching and Guarding
themselves, and enjoy the comforts which a
rational probability of Safety by such means
will allow them, than meerly with the mad
hope of procuring themselves an opportunity
and vacancy for freer <hi>delights,</hi> to throw open
their Gates, and permit themselves and all their
<hi>delectable</hi> things to the rapine &amp; spoil of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
Enemy: Understand this to be your case.
Therefore strictly guard all the avenues of
your inward man. It is better resist <hi>there</hi> and
combate your Enemy, than within your Walls;
who is more easily <hi>kept</hi> than <hi>driven</hi> out. <hi>There</hi>
cause every occasion and object (even that
<hi>importunes</hi> and <hi>pretends business</hi> to you) to
make a stand, and diligently examine the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.
Let also for this purpose <hi>a spirit of
Wisdom and Judgment</hi> reside here, <hi>(The Gate</hi>
was wont to be the place of <hi>counsel</hi> and
<hi>judgment,</hi> as well as <hi>strength),</hi> that may
prudently consider what is to be entertained
and what not; and determine and do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 28.</note>
But if <hi>you will have no rule over your
own spirit, but let it be as a City broken down
and without walls;</hi> If you will live careless
and at ease, and think in this way to have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God,</hi> your <hi>delight</hi> will soon find o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objects, and grow like that of the Swine
wallowing in the mire, become sensual, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
and at length turn all to Gall and
Wormwood.</p>
               <p>It may be you have known some of much
pretence to Piety, that would allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the liberty of being otherwise very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:32156:166"/>
in their usual conversation; by which
you may imagine <hi>delight in God</hi> (which you
cannot suppose such persons unacquainted
with) may fairly consist with <hi>another sort of
delight.</hi> Nor indeed is it to be doubted but
it may; For the Rules and Measures which
the Holy God hath set us import <hi>no such rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
severity,</hi> nor do confine us to so very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
bounds, but that there is scope and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
enough left unto the satisfaction of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
desires and inclinations that are of a meaner
kind. He that hath adjoined the inferior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we find in our selves to our natures, and at
first created a terrestrial Paradise for innocent
man, never intended to forbid the gratification
of those faculties, nor hath given us any reason
to doubt but that the lower <hi>delights</hi> that are
sutable to them <hi>might be</hi> innocently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
Nay, and the very Rules themselves
of Temperance and Sobriety which he hath
given us, for the guiding and governing of
sensitive desires, do plainly imply, that they
are permitted. For that which ought not <hi>to
be,</hi> is not to be <hi>regulated,</hi> but destroyed: But
then, whereas such <hi>rules</hi> do so limit the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and functions of the low <hi>animal</hi> life,
as that they may be <hi>consistent</hi> with our end,
and <hi>subservient</hi> to it; How perverse and
wicked an indulgence to them were it, to
oppose them at once both to the Authority of
him that set us those Rules, and (therein) to
our very end it self! That <hi>delectation</hi> in the
things of this lower world, which is not by
the Divine Law forbidden and declared <hi>evil,</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:32156:166"/>
either in it self, or <hi>by the undue measure,</hi> sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or other circumstances thereof, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
sufficient for our entertainment, and the
gratification of this grosser part, while we are
in this our earthly pilgrimage; and <hi>so much</hi>
can never hurt us, nor hinder our higher <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
God hath fenc'd and hedg'd them in
for us (as a Garden inclosed) by his own
Rules and Laws set about them; so that we
cannot prejudice or empair them, but by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thorough his inclosure. Our great care
and study therefore must be, to repress and
mortifie all earthly and sensual inclinations,
unto that degree as till they be reduc't to a
conformity and agreement with his Rules and
Measures; unto which they who have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and do yet pretend highly to spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and <hi>delight in God,</hi> 'Tis apparently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but meer hollow pretence; they
only put on a good face, and make a fair shew;
look big, and speak great swelling words of
vanity, as they must be called, while their
hearts taste nothing of what their tongues
utter. Spiritual <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> is a severe
thing, separated from vain and unbecoming
levities, as well as from all earthly impurities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and only grows and flourishes in a Soul that is
dead to this world, and alive to God through
Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>See then to the usual temper of your spirit;
and do not think it enough, that you hope the
great renewing change did somtime pass upon
it; and that therefore your case is good and
safe, and you may now take your ease and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:32156:167"/>
But be intent upon this, to get into a
<hi>confirmed growing spirituality,</hi> and that you
may find you are in your ordinary course <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Spirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> then will you <hi>savour the things
of the Spirit;</hi> And then especially will the
blessed God himself become your <hi>great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>

                  </note>
and your <hi>exceeding joy.</hi> Retire yourself
from this world, draw off your mind and heart.
This is Gods great rival. The friendship of
this world <hi>is enmity to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 4.</note> which is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>mind that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly

to have made themselves, in that undue
sense, <hi>friends of this world,</hi> are bespoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the names of Adulterers and Adulteresses.
You must cast off all other Lovers, if you
intend <hi>delighting in God.</hi> Get up then into
the higher region where you may be out of
the danger of having your spirit ingulpht,
and as it were, suck't up of the spirit of this
world; or of being subject to its debasing,
stupifying influence. Bear your self as the
inhabitant of another country. Make this
your mark and scope, that the temper of your
spirit may be such, that the secret of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Presence may become to you as your
very element, wherein you can most freely
breath and live, and be most at ease; and
out of which you may perceive you cannot
enjoy your self; and that what-ever tends to
withdraw you from him, any extravagant
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:32156:167"/>
motion, the beginnings of the excursion, or
the least departing step, may be sensibly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and grievous to you. And do not look
upon it as an hopeless thing you should ever
come to this;<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> some have come to it; <hi>One
thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
after, that I may dwell in the House of the Lord,
all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the
Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was this a transient fit only with the
Psalmist, but we find him frequently speaking
the same sense,<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Surely goodness and mercy shall

that here was an heart so naturaliz'd to this

he might <hi>lead his life with God,</hi> and dwell with

with giving a visit now and then.</p>
               <p>And why should this temper of spirit in the
clearer light of the Gospel be look't upon as
an unattainable thing? A lazy despondency,
and the <hi>mean</hi> conceit, that it is modest not to
aim so high, starves Religion, and stifles all
truly noble and generous desires. Let this
then be the thing designed with you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
pursue and drive the design, that you
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:32156:168"/>
may get into this disposition of spirit towards
God. His Spirit will not be restrained, if it
be duly sought, and dutifully comply'd with
and obeyed; if you carefully reserve your
self for him,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> as one <hi>whom be hath set apart
for himself.</hi> If you will be entirely his, and
keep your distance, using an holy chast reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness
as to other things; that is, such
things as any way tend to indispose your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
towards him, or render it less sutable to
his converse, He will be no stranger to you.</p>
               <p>And that it may be more sutable and fit
for him, you should habituate and accustom
your self to converse <hi>in the general</hi> with <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things.</hi> You will be as the things are
you converse most with; they will leave their
stamp and impress on you; <hi>wandring after
vanity,</hi> you will <hi>become vain; minding earthly
things,</hi> you will <hi>become earthly;</hi> Accordingly,
being much taken up with <hi>spiritual things,</hi>
you will bear their image, and become spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>Think how unworthy it is, since you have
faculties (and those now refined and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Divine light and grace) that are
capable of being employed about so much
higher objects than those of sense, That you
should yeild to a confinement, in so great
part, to so low and mean things; whence it is,
that when you should mind things of an
higher nature, 'tis a <hi>strange work</hi> with you,
and those things seem odd and uncouth to
you, and are all with you as meer <hi>shadow</hi> and
<hi>darkness,</hi> that you should be most familiar
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:32156:168"/>
with. Urge on your spirit; make it <hi>enter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the invisible world. May you not be <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
if you will use your understanding, That
there are things you never saw, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
more excellent and glorious than
any thing you have seen, or than can be seen
by eyes of flesh?</p>
               <p>Why should your mind and thoughts be
limited within the narrow bounds of this
sublunary world; so small and minute, and
(by the apostacy and sin of man) so abject
and deformed a part of Gods Creation? Do
not bind down your spirit to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and view of the affairs and concernments
only of this Region of sin and wretchedness;
where few things fall under your notice, that
can be a comfortable (or so greatly edifying
and instructive a) prospect to a serious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
But consider, That as certainly as you
behold with your eyes the wickedness and
miseries of this forlorn world, that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
God, and is in great part forsaken of
him; so certainly, there is a vastly greater
world than this, of glorious and innocent
Creatures, that stand in direct and dutiful
subordination to their common Maker and
Lord; loving, and beloved of him; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do his will, and solacing themselves
perpetually in his blessed presence, and in
the mutual love, communion and felicity of
one another.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> Unto which happy number (or
<hi>innumerable company</hi> rather as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
the Redeemer is daily adjoining such as
he recovers and translates out of the ruins
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:32156:169"/>
and desolation of this miserable accursed part
of the Universe.</p>
               <p>Reckon your self as someway appertaining
to that blessed Society. Mind the affairs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as those of your own Country, and that
properly belong to you. When we are taught
to pray, <hi>That the will of God may be done on
earth as it is in heaven;</hi> Can it be supposed,
it ought to be a strange thing to our thoughts,
<hi>how affairs go there?</hi> Surely Faith and holy
Reason, well used, would furnish us with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and warrantable notions enough of the
state of things above, that we should not
need to carry it as persons that have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
therein; or, when we are required to
be as strangers on earth, that we should make
our selves such to heaven rather.</p>
               <p>Let your mind be much employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the state of things between God and
his Creatures. Design a large field for your
thoughts to spread themselves in, (and you
will also find it a fruitful one); let them run
backward and forward, and expatiate on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side. Think how all things sprang from
God, and among them Man, that excellent
part of this his lower Creation; what he was
towards God, and what he is now become.
Think of the admirable person, the glorious
excellences, the mighty design, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
atchievements and performances of the
Redeemer; And the blessed issue he will
bring things to at length.</p>
               <p>Think of, and study much the nature, parts
and accomplishments of the new creature;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:32156:169"/>
get your mind well-instructed and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with apprehensions of the whole entire
frame of that holy rectitude wherein the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God upon renewed Souls doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
the several lovely ornaments of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
man of the heart, how it is framed and
habited, when it is as it should be towards
God and towards men. Cast about, and you
will not want matter of spiritual employment
and exercise for your minds and hearts; nor
have occasion, if any expostulate with you,
<hi>why you mind this earth and the things of sense
so much,</hi> to say, <hi>you know not what else to
think of;</hi> you may sure find many things
else. And if you would use your thoughts to
such converse, and thus daily entertain your
self, In this way you may expect a spiritual
frame to grow habitual to you; and then
would the rest of your business do it self.
You would not need to be prest and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to <hi>delight in God,</hi> any more than
to do the acts of Nature, to <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi>
and <hi>move,</hi> yea and <hi>draw your breath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Endeavour your knowledg, or the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you have of God, may be more distinct and
clear.</hi> For observe whether when you would
apply your self to <hi>delight in him,</hi> this be not
the next (or at least one) great obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after that of an indisposed carnal heart,
That though <hi>you would, and you know 'tis fit
you should do so, you know not how to go about
it; for you are at a loss, what or how to conceive
of him.</hi> But is it fit it should be always thus?
What, ever learning and never arrive to this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:32156:170"/>
                  <hi>knowledg?</hi> 'Tis most true, <hi>We can never search
out the Almighty unto perfection;</hi> And it will
always be but a little portion we shall know
of that glorious incomprehensible Being: But
since there is a <hi>knowledg of God,</hi> we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to have our Souls furnisht with, and
whereon eternal life depends, with all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
dispositions of heart towards him, that
are the beginnings of that life; Certainly the
whole compass of our Duty and Blessedness
is not all laid upon an Impossibility; And
therefore, if we do not <hi>so far</hi> know as to <hi>love</hi>
and <hi>delight in him</hi> above all things else, this
must be through our own great default; and
more to be imputed to our carelesness and
contentedness to be ignorant, than that he
is <hi>unknowable,</hi> or hath so reserved and shut
up himself from us that we <hi>cannot</hi> know
him. There are many things belonging
to the Being of God which we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to know, and which it would be a
vain and bold curiosity to pry into: But
what is necessary to direct or practise, and
tends to shew how we should be and carry
our selves towards him, is not (such hath
been his gracious vouchsafement) impossible
or difficult to be known. We may apprehend
him to be the most excellent Being; and may
descend to many particular excellencies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may easily apprehend him infinitely to
surpass all other Beings.</p>
               <p>For we most certainly know, <hi>all things were
of him,</hi> and therefore, that whatsoever excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
we can observe in creatures, must be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:32156:170"/>
eminently and in highest perfection in Him,
without the want of any thing, but what doth
it self import weakness and imperfection; And
hath it not been His errand &amp; business into the
world,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>who lay in his bosom, to declare him?</hi> And
hath not he, <hi>who at sundry times and in divers
manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
Prophets, in these last days spoken to us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
by whom also he made the worlds, who is the
brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of
his Person?</hi> He hath been on earth the visible
Representation of God to men; The Divine
Glory shone in him;<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The glory of the only
begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and
truth;</hi> Was not that Divine?</p>
               <p>Suppose we then, we had seen Christ in
the flesh, and been the constant observers of
his whole conversation on earth, (and though
we have not seen it, we have the sufficient
Records of his Life and Actions in our hands);
Let us I say suppose him from day to day
before our eyes, in all his meek, humble, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deportments among men; and withal in
the beams of Majesty that appeared through
that vail wherein he was pleased to inwrap
himself: If we did observe him going to and
fro, and every where doing good, scattering
blessings wherever he went; with what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and tenderness he healed the sick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
the ignorant, supplied and fed the
hungry and necessitous; how he bare with
the weak, forgave the injurious (even against
his own life), and wept over secure and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:32156:171"/>
obstinate sinners; with what mighty power
he cast out Devils, raised the dead, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Winds and Seas, and they obeyed him;
with what authority, zeal and conviction he
contested against an hypocritical generation
of hardened, impenitent, unbelieving wretches,
casting flames of holy just displeasure in their
faces, and threatning them with the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hell: And now suppose the veil laid
aside, and the lustre of all these excellencies
shining forth, without the interposition of any
obscuring cloud or shadow; And such a one
is the blessed God. For this was the <hi>express
Image of his Person;</hi> and as he himself tells us,
<hi>They that have seen Him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>have seen the Father.</hi>
And do you not now see one to be <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet further, Can you not frame a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Wisdom, Goodness, Justice, Holiness,
Truth, Power, with other known Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all concurring together in a Being pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spiritual (not obvious to our sense), and
that was Eternally and Originally of Himself,
the Author and Original of all things, and
who is therefore over all and in all, infinite
and unchangeable in all the perfections before-mentioned?
Surely such conceptions are not
impossible to you? And this is He in whom
you are to <hi>delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lift up then your minds above your senses
and all sensible things; use your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
whereby you are distinguisht from brute
creatures. Consider, this is he from whom
you and all things sprang, and in whom your
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:32156:171"/>
life is. Do you perceive life, wisdom, power,
love in other things; these must all have some
or other fountain. Other things have not
these of themselves, for they are not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
therefore they must derive and partake
them from him; and thence it is evident, they
must be in him in their highest excellency.
Of this, your understandings, duly exercised,
will render you as sure, as if you saw that
infinite glory, in which all these meet, with
your eyes; and will assure you, 'tis so much
more excellent and glorious, for that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be seen with your eyes. You see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
acts and expressions of these things
from such creatures as you are: But life, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
power, love themselves are invisible
things, which in themselves you <hi>cannot see;</hi>
yet you are not the less certain that there are
such things. And do you not find, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
evidence you have, that these things meet
in this or that creature, do render it lovely and
delightful in your eyes? especially, if you have,
or apprehend you may have nearest interest in
such a creature? The blessed God not only
hath these things in himself, but is these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things himself; therefore must be <hi>invisible,</hi>
as they are; And because he not only hath
them, but is them, therefore they are in him
perfectly unchangeably and eternally, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his very Essence. Think then of a Being
that is pure, original, substantial, <hi>life, wisdom,
power, love;</hi> And how infinitely amiable and
delectable should that ever blessed Being be
unto you!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:32156:172"/>
Converse with the Word of God. Read
his descriptions of Himself; And do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your selves to have the words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
before your eyes, or in your mouths,
that represent to you his Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
but make your pauses, and consider
the things themselves signify'd by them; that
is, when you read such passages of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Book, as that which tells you his name, that
<hi>He is the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord God, gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,</hi>
&amp;c. Or that tell you <hi>He is light, He is
love, He is God only wise, He is the Almighty,
God all-sufficient, He is all in all,</hi> and that the
<hi>Heavens, and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain
Him;</hi> Or wherein you find him admired as
<hi>glorious in Holiness;</hi> Or that say, <hi>He is what
He is,</hi> that <hi>He is the first and the last,</hi> the <hi>Alpha
and Omega,</hi> &amp;c. Labour to fix the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and true import of all such expressions
deep in your mind; that you may have an
entire and well-formed representation of him
before you, unto which you may upon all
occasions have recourse, and not be at a loss
every time you are to apply your selves to
any converse with him, what or how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him.</p>
               <p>And because meer words, though they
may furnish you with a more full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
notion of him, yet it may be not
with so <hi>lively</hi> a one, or that you find so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
striking your heart, compare with that
account his Word gives you of him, the
Works which your eyes may daily behold,
and which you are assured were wrought
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:32156:172"/>
and done by him. To read or hear of his
Wisdom, Power, Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then
to have the visible effects within your constant
view, that so fully correspond to what his
Word hath said of him, and demonstrate him
to be what you were told he is; How mighty
a confirmation doth this carry with it! You
may behold somewhat of him in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
All his Works do not only represent,
but even praise and commend him to you.</p>
               <p>Above all, since he is only to be seen in
his own light, pray earnestly and continually
to the <hi>God of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Father
of Glory, that he would give you the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledg of him.</hi>
From such as so desire to know him, he will
not conceal himself. This is your more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<hi>following on to know the Lord;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 6.</note> in which
case he hath said, <hi>you shall know,</hi> and <hi>that his
going forth shall be prepared as the morning.</hi>
By your craving looks, and the expecting
posture of your waiting eye, you draw forth
and invite his enlightening communications,
which do but wait for an invitation. For it is
most reasonable you should feel your want,
and express your desire of what is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
before you find it. Hereby you put
your selves amidst the glorious beams of his
vital pleasant light; or do open your Souls
to admit and let it in upon you. Who when
he finds it is with you a <hi>desired thing</hi> and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, takes more pleasure in imparting, than
you can pains in seeking, or plesure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:32156:173"/>
Nor yet, when you have thus attained to
some competent measure of the knowledg of
God, are you to satisfie your selves that now
you are not altogether ignorant: But,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Imploy your knowledg in frequent and
solemn thinking on him;</hi> which is one (and
the next) <hi>end</hi> of that knowledg, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great <hi>means</hi> to your <hi>delighting in him.</hi>
Your knowledg of God signifies little to this
purpose, or any other, if, as it gives you the
advantage of having frequent actual thoughts
of him, it be not <hi>used to this end. Not having
this knowledg,</hi> when you would set your selves
seriously to think on God, you are lost in the
dark, and know not which way to turn your
selves; And <hi>having it,</hi> you will be as much
strangers to <hi>delight in him,</hi> if you let your
knowledg lye bound up in dead and spiritless
notion, and labour not to have it turned into
active life and fervent love, by the agitation
of your working thoughts. By your musing
this fire must be kindled. Do you suppose it
possible, to <hi>delight</hi> in God and not <hi>think</hi> of
him? If God be the solace and joy of your
Souls, surely it must be <hi>God remembered</hi> and
minded much, not neglected and forgotten.
<hi>My soul</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>shall be satisfied
as with marrow and fatness,<note place="margin">Psal. 63.</note> and my mouth shall
praise thee with joyful lips; when I remember
thee on my bed, and meditate on thee in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 34.</note>
And he at the same time says <hi>his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of him shall be sweet,</hi> when he says <hi>he
will be glad in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not a brutal delight you are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:32156:173"/>
to. Even such creatures have their
Pleasures also; and do need thereto, besides
a sutable object, only the help and ministry
of their senses. Your <hi>delight in God</hi> can find
no way into your hearts, but by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of your exercised minds. There the
matter must be prepared and form'd, by which
your <hi>delight</hi> is to be nourish'd &amp; maintained.
Hereto then you must apply your selves with
design, and with serious diligence, and take
pains with your recoiling thoughts. Do not
make that fulsom pretence, to excuse your
slothful neglect, that you cannot command
your own thoughts. The thing it self is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
true, and that you are not of
your selves sufficient to think any thing that
is good, as of your selves; and so you may
truly enough say, that you cannot think any
thought at all without God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or so much as
draw a breath. Only, as besides your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dependence on God for the support of your
natural life and being, there must be that
course taken, and those things done, by which
in an orderly course of Providence you may
live; so for the maintaining of your spiritual
life (which very much stands in delight and
joy in God) you must join a spiritual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for that special influence and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which is necessary hereto, with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such things as by Gods appointment
and prescription are to serve this end. They
who complain therefore they cannot attain to
it, to <hi>delight in God,</hi> or their <hi>delight in him</hi>
is faint and languishing; while in the mean
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:32156:174"/>
time they use no endeavour to bend and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their thoughts towards him, do make as
idle a complaint, as he that shall say, he is
in a miserable straving condition, and nothing
nourishes him, who wanting nothing sutable
for him, is so wretchedly slothful, that he will
be at no pains to prepare, or so much as eat
and chew his own necessary food. You may
not imagine, <hi>you have</hi> all that is needful for
the well-governing of your spirits in your
own hands and power. Nor ought you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to think, that what is simply needful <hi>is
not to be had.</hi> God is not behind-hand with
you; He is no such hard task-master, as to
require Brick and allow no Straw: But may
most righteously say, <hi>ye are idle,</hi> and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only complain like the sluggard in his
bed, whose hands cannot endure to labour.
You dare not deliberately go to God, and
tell him, you do all you can to fix the thoughts
of your hearts on him, and yet it will not be;
or that he gives you no help. Though he can
be no way indebted to you, but by his own
free promise; He giveth <hi>meat to them that
fear him, being ever mindful of his Covenant,</hi>
(yea he doth it for Ravens and Sparrows);
He will not then famish the Souls that cry
to him, and wait on him; <hi>Their heart shall
live that seek God.</hi> It's becoming and sutable
to the state of things between him and you,
that he should put you upon <hi>seeking that you
may find.</hi> Your reasonable nature and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(especially being already rectified in
some measure, and enlivened by his Grace and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:32156:174"/>
Spirit) do require to be held to such terms.
It is natural to you <hi>to think;</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more sutable to the new creature, than
that you apply and set your selves to <hi>think on
him,</hi> and that your thoughts be set (and
held) on work to enquire and seek him out.
Know therefore, you do not your parts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you make this more your business: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be here more particular;</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Solemnly set your selves at chosen times to
think on God.</hi> Meditation is of it self a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Duty, and must have a considerable
time allow'd it among the other exercises of
the Christian Life. It challenges a just share
and part in the time of our Lives; and he in
whom <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to place our <hi>delight,</hi> is, you
know, the prime and chief Object of this
holy Work. Is it reasonable that he who is
our Life, and our All, should never be thought
on, but now and then, as it were by chance,
and on the by? <hi>My meditation on him shall be
sweet.</hi> Doth not that imply that it was with
the Psalmist a designed thing to meditate on
God? that it was a stated course? whereas
it was become customary and usual to him,
his ordinary practice to appoint times for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
on God, his well-known exercise,
(which is supposed) he promises himself sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and solace of soul herein.</p>
               <p>Let your eyes herein therefore prevent the
Night-watches. Reckon you have neglected
one of the most important businesses of the day,

Wherein therefore are you to repair your
selves but by redressing this great neglect?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Think often of him amidst your other affairs.
Every one as he is called</hi> (be his state or way of
living what it will,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> be he bond or free) is
required <hi>therein</hi> to <hi>abide with God.</hi> And how
is that but by often thinking of him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great part (and fundamental to all the
rest) of what can be meant <hi>by this abode?</hi>
How grateful a mixture would the thoughts
of God make with that great variety of <hi>other
things</hi> which we are necessarily to be concern'd
in, while we are in this world! If they be
serious and right thoughts they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with <hi>same</hi> favour and relish of
sweetness, and at least, tend to keep the heart
in a disposition for more <hi>delightful</hi> solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourses
<hi>with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a sad Truth (than which also nothing
is more appar<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt) that whatsoever there is,
either of sinfulness or uncomfortableness in
the lives of those who have engaged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
themselves to God, doth in greatest
part proceed from their neglect to <hi>mind God.</hi>
A thing, if due heed were taken about it, so
easie, so little laborious, and the labour
whereof (so much as it is) were sure to be
recompenc't with so unspeakable pleasure;
that they are so often lost in darkness,
drown'd in carnality, buried in earthliness,
and overwhelmed with miseries and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of spirit, and all this for want of a
right employing of their thoughts, is from
hence only; They set their thoughts upon
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:32156:175"/>
things that tend either to corrupt and deprave
their spirits, or to disquiet and afflict them.</p>
               <p>At this in-let, and by the labour of their
own thoughts, sins and calamities are brought
in upon them as a flood; which very thoughts
if they were plac't and exercised aright,
would let in God upon them, fill them with
his fulness, replenish their Souls with his
light, grace, and consolations. And how
much more easie an exercise were it to keep
their thoughts imployed upon <hi>one object</hi> that
is ever full, <hi>delectable</hi> and present; than to
divide them <hi>among many,</hi> that <hi>either lie remote,</hi>
and out of their power, to be pursued with
anxiety, toil, and very often with disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Or, <hi>being nearer hand,</hi> are to be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed</hi>
(if they be things that have an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of good in them) with much danger
and damage to their spirits, and with little
satisfaction; or (if they appear evil) to be
<hi>endured</hi> with pain and sorrow! So that the
<hi>labour</hi> of their thoughts, among those many
things, brings them in torture, when their
<hi>Rest</hi> upon God alone,<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 13</note> would be all pleasure,
<hi>delight and joy: Here their souls might dwell
at ease</hi> or (as those words import) <hi>rest in
goodness</hi> (even with that quiet repose which
men are wont to take by night; for so the word
we read <hi>Dwell</hi> peculiarly fignifies, after the
weariness which we may suppose to have been
contracted by the labour of the foregoing day.</p>
               <p>And if no such sweet and pleasant fruit
were to be hoped for from the careful go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and ordering of our thoughts, Is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:32156:176"/>
the obligation of Gods Law in this matter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with us? whom we are bound to fear,
and love, to trust and obey above all things, of
him are we not bound so much as to think?
And what is <hi>loving God with all our mind,</hi> so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
mentioned in <hi>that great summary</hi> of our
duty towards him? Or what can it mean, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the required love of all the heart, and all
the soul, to add so particularly, and <hi>with all
thy mind,</hi> when-as the mind we know is not
the seat of love? Surely it cannot at least, but
imply, that our thoughts must be much
exercised upon God even by the direction
of our Love, and that our Love must
be maintain'd by thoughts of him; That
our minds and hearts must continually corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond
and concur to the <hi>loving of God;</hi> and
so our whole soul be exercised and set on
work therein.</p>
               <p>What doth it mean that our Youth is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
to the remembrance of him?<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 1.</note> What, is
our riper Age more exempt? Do we as we
longer live by him ow him less? Doth it signifie
nothing with us that (as was hinted formerly)
the wicked bear this brand in the Scriptures,
<hi>They that forget God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 16.</note> That it is a differencing
character of his own people, That <hi>they thought
on his Name?</hi> Why do we suppose our
thoughts exempt from his Government, or
the obligation of his Laws? Why should it
be reckoned less insolent to say <hi>our thoughts,</hi>
than <hi>our tongues</hi> are <hi>our own, who is Lord over
as?</hi> May we do what we will with our
thoughts? Who gave us our thinking power,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:32156:176"/>
or made us capable of forming a thought?
And now, Will we assume the confidence to
tell God we think on him all that we can?
How many idle thoughts in the day might we
have exchang'd for thoughts of God! and
every thought have been to us a spring of
pleasure, and holy <hi>delight in him!</hi> Know
then that if ever you will do any thing in this
great matter of <hi>deligbting in God,</hi> you must
arrest your thoughts for him, and engage
them in more constant converse with him:
And withal mix prayers with those thoughts;
or let them often be praying, craving thoughts,
such as may carry with them annexed desires;
or wherein your heart may breath out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,<note place="margin">Psal. 86. 4.</note>
such as that (for instance) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
the Soul of thy Servant; For unto thee,
O Lord, do I lift up my soul,</hi> &amp;c. See they be
spiritful thoughts that carry life in them, and
aim to draw more.</p>
               <p>But now our thoughts may be conversant
about him under very various considerations,
and all of them very <hi>delightful.</hi> And this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
may much increase our <hi>delight,</hi> while our
minds converse with him, now under one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then under another. They are apt to
tire and grow weary, being long imployed
the same way upon the same thing. And it
were an injury to the blessed God himself,
when he presents himself under various
aspects and appearances, so to take notice of
any one, as to overlook and neglect the rest.
Therefore,</p>
               <p>4. Look often to him according as absolutely
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:32156:177"/>
considered he is in himself the most excellent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and as in reference to his creatures, he is
the Supream Author and Lord of all.</p>
               <p>There is an unspeakable pleasure to be taken
in him so beheld. Too many while their
distrust, or their carnality and strangeness to
God holds them in suspence concerning their
own special relation to him, are apt to fancy
themselves excused of <hi>delighting in him:</hi> It
belongs not to them they think, but to some
familiar friends, and great favourites of his to
whom he expresses special kindness, and on
whom he places the marks of his more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
good-will. But do you think so to shift
and wave the obligation of an universal Law
upon mankind, and all reasonable nature? You
are to remember (as hath been said) your
<hi>delight in God</hi> is not to be considered only as
your priviledg, but as an act of homage to
him that made you, and put an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
apprehensive spirit into you, by which
you are capable of knowing who made you,
and of beholding your Makers excellency with
admiration and <hi>delight.</hi> And if now you are
become guilty and vile; Will you run into
darkness and hide your selves from him, or
close your eyes, and then say, the Sun doth
not shine, and deny the blessed glorious God
to be what most truly and unchangeably he
is? What-ever you are or have desired he
should be towards you, yet do <hi>him</hi> right.
Behold and confess his glorious excellency, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way most worthy to be <hi>delighted in.</hi>
Nor have you rendered your selves so vile,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:32156:177"/>
nor had so much cause of apprehending his
displeasure towards you, by any thing so
much as this, <hi>Your not having taken delight in
him all this while;</hi> and your neglect to take
the ways (spoken of before) tending to
bring you thereto. If you think you have
no special relation to him, Do you think you
ever shall if you continue, in the temper of
your spirits, strangers to him, and look upon
him as one in whom you are to take no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</hi>
Surely 'tis your dutiful affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him and complacency in him, that must
give you ground to hope you are his, and he
is yours; And therefore the beginnings and
first degrees of that complacency and <hi>delight</hi>
must be in you before; being begotten by the
view of that excellency which he hath in
himself antecedently to his being related to
you.</p>
               <p>Yea, and if your relation to him were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
as sure and evident to you as can be
supposed; yet are you to take heed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
your <hi>delight in him</hi> to that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him only; or of making it the chief
reason of that your <hi>delight.</hi> For so your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in him</hi> will be more for your own sakes,
or upon your own account than his. Learn
to look upon things as they are, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their aspect upon your affairs. Is
it not a greater thing that <hi>he is God,</hi> than
that <hi>he is yours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a purer, a more noble and generous
affection to him you are to aim at, than what
is measured only by your private interest. Is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:32156:178"/>
that boundless fulness of life, glory, and all
perfection (treasured up in the eternal and
incomprehensible Being) to be all estimated
by the capacity and concerns of a silly worm?
That consideration, therefore, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
laid aside, sit down and contemplate
God as he is in himself, not <hi>disowning</hi> (as it
is not fit you should) but only <hi>waving</hi> the
present consideration of any more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
relation, wherein you may (though most
justly) suppose him to stand to <hi>you;</hi> and see
if you cannot take pleasure in this, that he
is great and glorious, and to have a being so
every way perfect before your eyes. Try if
it will not be pleasant to you to fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and give him Glory; To join your
Praises and triumphant Songs to those of
Saints and Angels: And how much yet also it
will add to your satisfaction to behold and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
him exalted above all blessing and
praise. How great <hi>delight</hi> hath been taken in
him upon such accounts! In what transports
have holy souls been upon the view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his Sovereign Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
his wife and righteous Government;
his large and flowing Goodness, that extends
in common to all the Works of his hands!
Labour to imitate the ingenous and loyal
affection of this kind, whereof you find
many expressions in the sacred Volume. For
what hath been matter of <hi>delight</hi> to Saints of
old, ought surely still as much to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so. To give instances.</p>

read such passages as these (whether they
be elogies or commendations of him, or doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
and direct attributions of glory to him),
you are to bethink your selves, with what
temper of heart these things were uttered!
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:32156:180"/>
with how raised and exalted a spirit! what
high delight and pleasure was conceived in
glorifying God, or in beholding him glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous!
How large and unbounded a heart, and
how full of his praise doth still every where
discover it self in such strains; When all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when all Creatures, when every-thing
that hath breath, when Heaven and Earth
are invited together, to join in the consort,
and bear a part in his praises! And now
eye him under the same notions under which
you have seen him so magnified, that in the
same way you may have your own heart
wrought up to the same pitch and temper
towards him. Should it not provoke an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and make you covet to be amidst the
throng of loyal and devoted Souls, when
you see them ascending as if they were all
incense! When you behold them dissolving
and melting away in delight and love, and
ready to expire, even fainting that they can
do no more; designing their very last breath
shall go forth in the close of a Song! <hi>(I
will sing unto the Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>as long as I live, I

                  <hi>a greater height.</hi> Read
over such Psalms as are more especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the magnifying of God; and when
you see what were the things that were most
taking to so spiritual and pious hearts; thence
receive instruction, and aim to have your
hearts alike affected and transported with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:32156:180"/>
the same things. Frame the supposition, that
you are meant, that the invitation is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you, <hi>O Come let us sing unto the Lord,
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
and make a joyful noise to him with Psalms;
for the Lord is a great God, and a great King
above all gods,</hi> &amp;c. And think with your
selves, Is he not as great as he was? Is he
not as much our Maker as he was theirs? Is
it not now as true, that <hi>the Lord reigneth, and
is high above all the earth, and exalted far above
all gods?</hi> Now since these were the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon which so great complacency was
taken in him, set the same before your own
eyes. And since these were proposed as the
matter of so common a joy, and the Creation
seems design'd for a musical instrument of as
many strings as there are Creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth; Awake, and make haste to
get your heart fixed: Lest <hi>the heavens rejoice,
and the earth be glad, the world and all that
dwell therein:</hi> Lest <hi>the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof, the floods clap their hands, the fields and
the hills be joyful together, and all the trees of
the wood rejoice before the Lord,</hi> while you
only are silent and unconcern'd.</p>
               <p>And seriously consider the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of that <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>delight in God</hi> wherewith
the hearts of holy men did so exceedingly
abound; Which is to be collected from the
expressed ground and reasons of it, for the
most part, wheresoever you have any discovery
of that joy it self; This general and principal
character may be given of it, that it was a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:32156:181"/>
                  <hi>sincerely-devout and a loyal joy;</hi> not a mean,
narrow, selfish pleasure, an hugging of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this apprehension meerly, <hi>It is well
with me,</hi> or <hi>I am safe and happy whatsoever
becomes of the world.</hi> This was still the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of their Song; <hi>The Lord is great, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and excellent is exalted; and most high over
all.</hi> And it is to be observed, that as this
was the common and more usual strain and
temper of holy Souls, in the ages whereof
the Scriptures give us any account; so were
doubts, and fears, and troubled thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their own interest in God, a great
deal less usual and common in those days.
So that in proportion to the other pious
and holy exercises of such as were true fearers
of God and devoted to him, there is little
account given us of any thing of that kind
in the sacred Writings, and especially in the
New Testament of our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An argument,
That such as were sincerely religious were
most taken up about the interest of God and
Christ in the world, rejoicing either in the
observation of its growth and increase, or
in the hope and confidence that it shall grow:
And that they were much less concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their own interest; yea and that this
course did thrive best with them. While they
were most intent upon the affairs of their
common Lord, their own were well enough
provided for.</p>
               <p>We cannot hereupon but note therefore
by the way, how altered a thing Religion is
now become. Almost the whole business of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:32156:181"/>
it, even among them that more seriously mind
any thing belonging to it, is a <hi>fear of going
to Hell;</hi> and hence perpetual endless scruples,
doubts and enquiries about marks and signs,
and how to know what is the least degree of
that grace which is necessary to their being
saved. As if the intention were to beat down
the price to the very lowest, and dodge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and cheapen heaven to the utmost, it
may be feared (as too many) with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
not to aim at any thing higher than
what is meerly necessary to that purpose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and never to mind being excellent, but
only being saved.</p>
               <p>And yet also it were well, in a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sense, if that it self were minded in good
earnest by many that profess beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rate; And That whereas their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is the thing they most mind, it were not
their meanest and least considerable interest, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that of their sense, and flesh, and secular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and that under the pretence too
(which makes the matter so much the worse)
of much love and zeal Godward, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness
to his interest; which they supposed
involved and wrapt up wholly with theirs.
Whence also all their <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
only by the aspect of the world, and
of <hi>publick affairs</hi> upon them and <hi>their private
ones:</hi> And they are either overwhelmed with
sorrow, or transported with joy, according as
the state of things doth either frown upon,
or favour their concernments. In the days
when the interest of Christ lay more entirely
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:32156:182"/>
and undividedly among one sort of men; and
more apparently, their contests being less
among themselves, and chiefly with the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
world; and they had, for the most part,
no enemies but those in common of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Name and Cause: So that any common
state of suffering to them, was the visible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of that Cause and Interest:</p>
               <p>Why, what, Did they <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>please</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in nothing but a warm Sun and <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon</hi>-seasons?
Surely they had matter little
enough for that sort of joy. And what, Did
they therefore dejectedly languish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond,
and give themselves up to sorrow and
despair? Nor that neither; unless they had
all had but one neck, and that also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in the enemies power, it had been an
impossible thing to stifle and extinguish their
<hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy:</hi> So fully did Christ make it
good to them, That <hi>their sorrow should be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into joy, and their joy should no man take
from them.</hi> For even that increased it which
aim'd at it's suppression; and the waters
thrown upon their flame, became rivers of
oyl. They had got a secret way of <hi>rejoicing
in tribulation,</hi> of <hi>counting it all joy when they
fell into divers tentations,</hi> of <hi>taking pleasure in
reproaches for the sake of Christ,</hi> of turning
difficulties and hazards into matter of triumph,
of <hi>taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods,</hi> and
glorying to be <hi>counted worthy to suffer</hi> any
thing for so excellent a <hi>name.</hi> Insomuch, that
though their Head and Lord was in a most
ignominious way taken from them, and they
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:32156:182"/>
left as a despised party of men in the midst of
an outragious world, under the (seemingly-hopeless)
profession of addictedness to the
interest of a Man that dy'd upon a Cross a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Thieves but the other day: And though
many of them never saw his face, but had
their knowledg of him by report and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
yet <hi>believing they rejoic'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and full of glory.</hi> The matter and
ground of their <hi>joy</hi> was not so uncertain and
changeable a thing, nor so light and unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
as the worlds kindness and favour,
and the smooth face of a serene Sky. <hi>These</hi>
were <hi>true Lovers</hi> of Christ; and such as count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him worthy for whom they should do
all that lay in their power, and suffer all which
it was in the power of any others to do against
them upon his account.</p>
               <p>They that rejoice and place their <hi>delight</hi>
in the blessed God himself through Jesus
Christ, have for the Object of their joy the
<hi>Everlasting I AM,</hi> Him <hi>who is the same ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
and to day, and for ever.</hi> And whose
excellent glory may be clouded indeed and
eclips'd to the world and the eye of Sense;
but still shines in it self, and to the eye of
Faith, with the same bright and undiminish'd
lustre.</p>
               <p>That <hi>delight</hi> will then be continued and
permanent, and ever springing up in fresh
liveliness and vigour, which is taken in this
blessed Object, considered as it is in it self;
and that hath place in a Soul that acts in a
steady <hi>direct</hi> course towards that Object,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:32156:183"/>
without sinister respects, or any selfish ones,
of even the highest kind, otherwise than in
that subordination which will be sutable to
the vast disproportion and inequality between
Gods interest and ours; that is, (looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our own external concernments as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be named in the same day), That
though we reckon what there is delectable
in God will make for our eternal advantage;
yet to consider that advantage of ours so
much less, and to be so much more pleased
and satisfy'd, that he is in himself blessed and
glorious, as it is in it self a thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
that he be so, than it is what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of us, or of any creature, or of this
whole Creation. We are not indeed concern'd,
nor may think it warrantable to put our
selves upon any such severe and unnatural
trials of our love and fidelity to him, as to
put the question to our own hearts, Could
we be content to lye in Hell, or be in the
state of the damned for ever for his Glory?
For it were a most injurious and vile suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of somewhat inconsistent with his own
most blessed Nature, and eternal, essential fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
(for his happiness cannot but be much
placed in the benignity of his Nature), to
imagine that ever he can be pleased, or esteem
himself glorify'd by the everlasting miseries
of any one that truly loves him. We ought to
abhor the mention or imagination of such a
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a blasphemy against his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the denial whereof were to deny his
Godhead. And it were also an absurd and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:32156:183"/>
self-contradicting supposition: For none can
be in the state of the damned, but they must
be also in a state of extream enmity to God,
and of all wickedness and malignity arrived
and grown up to its highest pitch; Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the very horrour, and immost center
of Hell: Wickedness and eternal misery dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
(for the most part) but in degree, as
grace and glory do. So that to put our
selves upon this trial of sincerity towards God,
were to ask ourselves, Whether we would be
willing to express our sincere love to God,
by everlasting hatred of him; and the Truth
of our grace by being as maliciously wicked
as the Devil and his Angels? The expressions
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> so frequently alledged can be
wiredrawn to no such sense. This is no place
to discuss the importance of them. But i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were
certainly most imprudent (whatsoever they
import) to seek marks of sincere love to God
thence, which may be fetcht from so many
plain texts of Scripture. But it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
that we may and ought to mind and take
complacency in our own blessedness, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
inferior and subordinate to that which
we take in the glory of the blessed God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making the sinful and absurd supposition
of their inconsistency: Or that we can ever
be put to choose the absence or privation
of the one as a means to the other. And such
complacency and delight in God as arises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such grounds is of the right stamp and
kind.</p>
               <p>See then that yours be a well-complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion'd
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:32156:184"/>
delight, and such as inwardly partakes
of the true nature of Religion <hi>i. e.</hi> that hath in
it entire <hi>devotedness to God</hi> as the very life,
Soul, spirit of it: And if this be not the thing
but meerly self-satisfaction which you chiefly
have in pursuit under the name of delight
in God; you beat the air, and do but hunt
after a shadow. For there is no such thing
as real solid delight in God any-where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting,
or ever will be, separately and apart
from a supream love and addictedness of
heart to him and his interest as our chief and
utmost end. Which temper of spirit towards
him, must be maintained and improved, by
our fixed intuition and view of his glorius
greatness, and absolute excellency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and the congruity and fitness which
we thereupon apprehend, that we and all
things, (as all are of him) should be wholly
to him, that he alone may have the glory.</p>
               <p>5. And though you are not to <hi>prefer</hi> the
consideration of your own interest in God as
<hi>a good sutable to you,</hi> or to give it the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
place in your <hi>delight; yet also you must take
heed of neglecting it, or of denying it any place
at all.</hi> For though we may plainly observe,
as hath been said, That it was the usual temper
of holy Men of Old, to be <hi>most taken</hi> up in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
God upon the account of his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and Glory in it self considered; and
may thence collect <hi>that</hi> to be the genuine
right temper of a gracious heart when it is
most it self: Yet also 'tis as evident, That they
were far from <hi>neglecting</hi> their own interest in
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:32156:184"/>
God, and that they counted it not a small
matter; Yea, that it had (though not the
principal) a very great influence upon their
<hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy in him.</hi> No one can read the
Bible, and not have frequent occasion to take
notice of this. For how often do we find
him spoken of under the names of their <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Heritage,</hi> &amp;c! And in what raptures of Joy
do we often find them upon that account!
So the Psalmist considers him, when he says,
<hi>The lines are fallen to him in pleasant places,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and
he had a goodly heritage.</hi> How often do we
find them glorying in their relation by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and making their boasts of him as
<hi>their God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my strength,</hi> &amp;c!
You have <hi>[my]</hi> no less than nine times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the beginning (the first and second
verses) of that Psalm, <hi>My strength, my rock,
my fortress, my deliverer, my God,</hi> &amp;c. And
afterwards How glorious a triumph is there
raised, and in what exultation do we behold
them upon this!<note place="margin">v. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is God save the Lord,</hi> and
who is a Rock <hi>save our God?</hi> And again, <hi>The
Lord liveth and blessed be my Rock, and let the
God of my Salvation be exalted.</hi> And this was
some of the last holy breath uttered by that
anointed one of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.</note> and the
sweet Psalmist of <hi>Israel; He hath made with
me an everlasting Covenant ordered in all things
and sure.</hi> And this is all my Salvation and
all my Desire—With this, How well satisfied
and pleased did he expire, and go down to
the grave! And the People of God are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
represented as so taken with this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:32156:185"/>
of their peculiar relation to God that
they cannot be content to <hi>know,</hi> but they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim;</hi>
it; nor was it enough the present age
should know, but they must have it told the
following generation; <hi>Let Mount Sion rejoice,</hi>
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Psal. 48.</note> Mark—<hi>That ye may tell the generation
following—For this God is our God.</hi> See their
ostentation of him, <hi>This God!</hi> q. d. Behold
what a God have we! View him well, and
take notice how glorious a God he is. And
as they glory in the greatness of the God to
whom they were related, so they do in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of the relation. This God is our
God <hi>for ever and ever!</hi> &amp;c. And how unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
was the inward pleasure wherewith
we may suppose those words to have been
uttered,<note place="margin">Psal. 67. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>God even our own God shall bless us!</hi>
How <hi>delightful</hi> an appropriation! as if it
were intended to be said, The blessing it self
were less significant, it could not have that
savour with it if it were not from <hi>our own
God.</hi> Not only therefore <hi>allow</hi> but <hi>urge</hi> your
spirits thus to look towards God, that you
may both <hi>delight in him, as being in himself the
most excellent one,</hi> &amp; also as <hi>being yours;</hi> for know,
you are not <hi>permitted</hi> only, but <hi>obliged</hi> to eye,
accept and rejoice in him as such. It is his
first and great Law, and the form of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which he requires you to enter into
with him, <hi>To take him for your God.</hi> Herein
to be shie and decline, is to <hi>rebel.</hi> And when
he offers himself in all his rich fulness to be
your Portion and your God, How <hi>vile ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
were it to neglect and overlook the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:32156:185"/>
kindness of the overture. It is his glory to
have indigent souls satiating themselves in
him, drawing from him their vital breath,
living upon him as their All: Confessing they
cannot live, but by his vouchsafed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
And if you should say you love him,
but <hi>so he be ever glorious in himself, you care
not to be happy;</hi> It would sound like an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
complement. You are not to deal with
<hi>a God</hi> upon such terms. It becomes you not,
nor is sutable to him. It is fit for you to
own it to him, that he is your <hi>Life,</hi> that you
are a <hi>meer nothing</hi> in your self, and must seek
your All in him.<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 8.</note> Your <hi>Song</hi> and your <hi>Prayer</hi>
must be directed to him <hi>as the God of your life.</hi>
You do not own him <hi>as God,</hi> except you own
and adore him as your all-sufficient Good,
and that fulness which filleth all in all. You
detract from the glory of his Godhead, if
you attribute not this to him; And if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
as one that cannot live without
him, you do not seek union with him, and
joyn your self to him, and then rejoyce and
solace your self in that blessed conjunction.</p>
               <p>And if you be not sure as yet that he is
yours, your delighting in him is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be suspended and delayed till you be.
But in the mean time delight in him as <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to become yours.</hi> To disbeleive that he
is willing, is to give him <hi>the lye.</hi> It is the
great design of his Gospel so to represent
him to you. See that your hearts do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and close with that as a most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and lovely representation: <hi>The great and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:32156:186"/>
glorious Lord of heaven and earth offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all his fulness to be thine! Thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and thy God for ever!</hi> How transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
should this be to you! Nor, if you
suspect the sincerity of your own heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him (which is the only thing you
can have any pretence to suspect, for it were
a blasphemy to his Truth and Goodness to
intimate a suspicious thought <hi>of him)</hi> may
you therefore spend all your time in anxious
enquiries, or in looking only upon your own
evil heart: But look most, and with a direct
and steady eye towards him. Behold and
view well his glory and his love, that by
this means your heart may be captivated
and more entirely won to him.</p>
               <p>This makes delight in God a strange thing
in the hearts and practice of many. They
find too much cause of complaint concerning
their own hearts, that they are disaffected,
and disenclin'd Godward. And what is the
course they take hereupon? Their Religion is
nothing but complaint. And all their days are
spent in beholding that they are bad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever taking the way to become better.
They conclude their case to be evil and full
of danger, because they find they can take
no delight in God: And they will take no
delight in him because they have that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the danger of their case. And
so their not-delighting in God resolves into
it self. And they delight not in him because
they delight not in him. Tis strange the
absurdity of this is not more reflected on.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:32156:186"/>
And what now is to be done in this case?
To rest here is to be held in a circle of sin
and misery all your days: And would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
as if delighting in God were a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
impossibility, or as if not to delight in
God, were a thing so highly rational as to
be its own sufficient self-justification; And
that it were reason enough not to delight
in him because we do not. There can be
no other way to be taken but to behold
him more in that discovery of him which
his Gospel sets before your eyes, and in
that way seek to have your hearts taken
with his amiableness and love, and allured
to delight in him. And labour in this way
to have that delight increased to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that it may cease to be a question or
doubt with you, <hi>Do I delight in God or
no?</hi> Whence when you reflect and find
that you do; Then shall you have that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
matter of further delight; That
whereas you before took delight in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being in himself so excellent a one he
hath freely offered himself to you to become
yours; You may now delight in him also,
because you are sure he is so: Whereof you
cannot have a more fatisfying assurance than
from his so express saying,<note place="margin">1 John 4.</note> 
                  <hi>I Love them that
Love me;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> and <hi>we love him because he loved us first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Take especial heed of more apparent and gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
transgressions. Nor account your security from
the danger of them so much to stand in your
being ordinarily out of the way of temptations
to them, as in an habitual frame of holiness,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:32156:187"/>
and the settled aversion of your heart to them.</hi>
Endeavour a growing conformity to God
in the temper of your spirit, and to be in
Love with purity; That your heart may no
more endure an impure thought, than you
would fire in your bosom. If you be herein
careless and remiss, and suffer your heart to
grow dissolute, or more bold and adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
in admitting sinful cogitations; Or if
you have more liking or less dislike of any
wicked course wherein others take their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
you are approaching the borders of
a dangerous precipice. And if some greater
breach hereupon ensue between God and you,
what becomes of your delight in him? A sad
interruption of such pleasant intercourse can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but follow, both on his part, and on
yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On his part,</hi> a suspension and restraint of
those communications of light and grace
which are necessary to your delight in him.
He will be just in his way of dealing towards
those of his own family, as well as merciful.
It appears how much <hi>David</hi>'s delight in God
was intermitted, upon his great transgression,
through Gods withdrawing from him, when
he prays he would <hi>restore the joy of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 12</note>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>on your part,</hi> will insue both <hi>less liking</hi>
of Gods presence, and a <hi>dread</hi> of it: Your
inclination will not be towards him as before;
though the act of sin be soon over, the effect
will remain; even a carnal frame of spirit
that disaffects converse with God, and cares
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:32156:187"/>
not to come nigh him. And if that were
not, a guilty fear would hold you off; so
that if you were <hi>willing,</hi> you would not <hi>dare</hi>
to approach him: Your liberty taken to sin
would soon infer a bondage upon your spirit
God-ward, unless conscience be wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep;
and you have learned a stupid insolent
confidence to affront God, which surely
would signifie little to your <hi>delight in him.
Thou shalt put away iniquity from thy taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
—Then shalt thou have thy delight in the

                  <note place="margin">Job 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</hi>
The conscience of unpurged iniquity, will
not let you lift up your face or appear in that
glorious presence.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Cherish the great grace of humility; And
be ever mean and low in your own eyes.</hi> That
temper carries in it even a natural disposition
to <hi>delight in God.</hi> How sweet complacency
will such a Soul take in him! His <hi>light and
glory</hi> shine with great lustre in the eyes of such
a one while there is not a nearer (imagined)
lustre to vie therewith (Stars are seen at
noon, by them that descend low into a deep
pit). They will admire God but little that
admire themselves much. And take little
pleasure in him, who are too much pleased
with themselves. And how sweet a relish
<hi>have his love and grace</hi> to an humble lowly soul,
that esteems it self less than the least of his
mercies! With what ravishing <hi>delight,</hi> will Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mercy be entertain'd, when it is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
vouchsafed; when this shall be
the sense of the Soul now caught into the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:32156:188"/>
of Gods love, <hi>What I vile creature!
impure worm! what, beloved of God!</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
grounded especially upon an opinion
of merit, would unspeakably lessen a favour,
if it were afforded (as also expected evils
seem the less when they come). But the lowly
soul, that apprehends desert of nothing but
Hell, is surprized and overcome with wonder
and <hi>delight,</hi> when the great God expresses
kindness towards it. Besides that he more
freely communicates himself to such: <hi>To this
man will I look, even to him that is poor and of
a contrite spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 1, 2.</note> &amp;c. And he looks to such
with a design of habitation; Heaven and
Earth are not to him so pleasant a dwelling.
Down then into the dust, there you are in
the fittest place and posture for <hi>delightful</hi>
converse with God.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Reckon much upon an eternal abode in
that presence where is fulness of joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore.</hi> Enjoy by a serious believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foresight the delights of heaven, labour
to <hi>rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi> Look
beyond this your present state. Confine not
your eye and delight to what is now to be
enjoyed, but think of what shall be. Set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes the glorious prospect of the
blessed God communicating himself to that
vast Assembly <hi>of Angels and the spirits of just
men made perfect,</hi> in clearest discoveries
of his glory, and richest effusions of his
goodness. The best appearance of things
in this world, <hi>makes but a dull scene</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of this. If you look towards God
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:32156:188"/>
according to what now appears of his glory
in the frame of the universe, and the course
of his administrations and government over
his Creatures, He hath not, 'tis true, <hi>left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without witness.</hi> And you may behold
much that would be to you the matter of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi>
admiration; <hi>If your eye be clear,
and can pierce through clouds and darkness and
a manifold veil.</hi> He hath made this world
and is every-where in it, but it knows him
not. His light shines in darkness, that doth
not comprehend it. Beams of his glory do
every-where break forth, through every
Creature, Providence, Law, and Ordinance
of his. But much of his glory that shines in
the Creation is hid by a train of second causes,
through which few look to the first. His Laws
men judg of according to their interests and
inclinations, while the holy glorious Majesty
that enacted them is out of sight. His work
in the world is carried on in a mystery; His
interest lives, but is deprest; They who are
most devoted to him are supported indeed by
his invisible hand, but are, in the mean time,
low, for the most part, and afflicted. If you
now limit and confine your apprehensions of
him to his present appearances, the matter of
your <hi>delight</hi> is <hi>real,</hi> but much <hi>diminish't:</hi>
But conceive of him (as your Faith can
behold him at a distance) in that posture
wherein having setled the eternal State of
things he will finally shew himself. Conceive
him as having now gathered home all that
that have been recovered to him out of the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:32156:189"/>
apostacy, and joined them to those number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
legions of innocent and pure spirits about
his throne that never offended: Conceive
him as dispensing rewards, pouring out
blessings upon the loyal heads and hearts of
them that expressed fidelity and duty to him
in the time and state of trial and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Letting his Glory shine out with
bright and direct beams, to so many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
and admiring eyes; Giving forth the
full and satisfying communications of his <hi>love,</hi>
and making Rivers of pleasure flow perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to the replenishing the vast enlarged
capacities, of so innumerable a multitude of
grateful adoring spirits, to whom it is now
sensibly to be perceived how his fulness filleth
All in all. Take this view of him; and
let your Faith and Hope thus enter into that
which is within the veil: And remember
there is only <hi>a little time</hi> between you and
that blessed state; That then you are <hi>to
enter into the joy of your Lord;</hi> so that the
very element and region wherein you are to
live for ever, shall be nothing else but <hi>delight</hi>
and <hi>joy.</hi> In this way of believing foresight,
and by this lawful and allowed prepossession
of future blessedness, much surely would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to your present <hi>delight in God.</hi> Should not
the thoughts of him be pleasant to you from
whom you are expecting so great things? If
your <hi>delight</hi> in him be any at all, upon what
you have already found and experienced of
his goodness; It should be abundantly the
more upon what you are by his Word encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to look for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:32156:189"/>
And having thus given some account in
what way <hi>delight in God</hi> is to be exercised and
improved; It were a charitable hope that
there would be little need to propound ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to perswade unto it: But it were
an hope not grounded upon common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which too plainly tells us, that though
such directions as these are plain and obvious,
not unknown to Christians; but only less
considered (whence it was not needless here
to recommend them), yet <hi>delight in God</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
little place in the practice of the most.
There will therefore too probably be still
much need of excitation to it.</p>
               <p>And yet because it is not <hi>multitude of
words</hi> that is likely to do the business, but
the <hi>weight of things,</hi> urged on by a more
powerful hand than that of man, and that
much may be collected to this purpose from
what hath been said of the sinfulness of the
omission; I shall, with great brevity, offer
these things only to be considered.</p>
               <p>Is it not a merciful vouchsafement that the
holy God allows you to place your <hi>delight</hi> on
him, and invites you to it? How much Grace
and Love breaths in these words, <hi>Delight thy
self also in the Lord! Trust</hi> in him was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
before, and now this being added
<hi>also;</hi> How plain is it that your ease and rest
is the thing designed! Is it fit to receive so
much kindness with neglect?</p>
               <p>Again, He <hi>delights</hi> in you, I speak to such
of whom this may be supposed.<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> And it is
indefinitely said His <hi>delights</hi> were with the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:32156:190"/>
sons of men. Think <hi>what he is,</hi> and <hi>what
you are;</hi> And at once, both <hi>wonder</hi> and
<hi>yield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what else have you to <hi>delight</hi> in? what
thing will you name, that shall supply the
place of [GOD] or be to you in the stead
of him?</p>
               <p>Moreover, Who should <hi>delight in him</hi> but
you? his friends? his sons? those of his
own house?</p>
               <p>Think what life and vigour it will infuse
into you;<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.</note> and that, <hi>The joy of the Lord will
be your strength.</hi> How pleasantly will you
hold on your course! and discharge all the
other Duties of this your present state! You
must serve him. Dare you think of throwing
off his yoke? How <hi>desirable</hi> is it then to take
<hi>delight in him</hi> whom I must serve! which
only makes that service acceptable to him, and
easie to my self!</p>
               <p>Further, This is a pleasure none can rob
you of; A joy that cannot be taken from you.
Other Objects of your <hi>delight</hi> are vanishing
daily. Neither Men nor Devils can ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your <hi>delighting in God,</hi> if your hearts be
so enclin'd; And were you never brought to
take pleasure in any person or thing to which
you had a former aversion; One that had
wrong'd you might yet possibly win you by
after-kindness. Give a reason why you
should be more difficult towards the blessed
God that never wrong'd you! and whose
way towards you hath constantly imported so
much good-will!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:32156:190"/>
And consider that your condition on earth
is such, as exposes you to many sufferings and
hardships; Which by <hi>your not-delighting in him,</hi>
you can never be sure to <hi>avoid,</hi> (for they are
things common to men) but which, <hi>by your
delighting in him,</hi> you may be easily able to
<hi>endure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides all this, seriously consider, that you
must die; You can make no shift to avoid
that. How easily tolerable and pleasant, will
it be to think, then, of going to him with
whom you have lived in a <hi>delightful</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
before! And how dreadful to appear
before him, to whom your own heart shall
accuse you to have been (against all his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
and allurements) a disaffected
stranger!</p>
               <p>To these I add the consideration in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the verse; <hi>And he shall give thee
the desire of thine heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Desire]</hi> it's plain we are to understand
the <hi>thing desired</hi> which is usual.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the thing desired,</hi> we must not be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
as to think is meant, <hi>any thing
whatsoever it be,</hi> that, even with the greatest
extravagancy, we may set our hearts upon;
as worldly possessions, riches, honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
For it were most unbecoming that <hi>delight in
God</hi> should be so mercenary; or be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as the price of so mean things. Yea, and
if the matter were so to be understood, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God</hi> were a <hi>means</hi> to the attaining of
these things as the <hi>end;</hi> which were to make
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:32156:191"/>
the blessed God an inferiour good to these.
Nor can we suppose that one who <hi>delights in
God</hi> should ever esteem any reward or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<hi>of another kind,</hi> greater than what he
finds in this very <hi>delight</hi> it self. And besides,
we are very prone to desire things that (as
the case may be) would prove very hurtful
to us. If God should gratifie us with every
thing we fancy he should many times please
us to our ruine. And do we believe that
when he hath won a person to place his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
and take pleasure in himself, <hi>He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
him with a mischief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then we may not understand him to
mean <hi>that whatsoever we desire, if we delight
in him, we shall have;</hi> We are to enquire
further. And it's plain the things that can
be supposed to be desired by such persons as
are here spoken to, must be of one of these
two sorts: Either <hi>things</hi> of a <hi>spiritual nature,</hi>
that tend directly to the gratification and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the inward man; Or else <hi>external
good things,</hi> that make for the support and
comfort of this present life.</p>
               <p>We will suppose it to be the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these. And shall shew that whichsoever
sort it be that is desired, <hi>Delighting in God</hi>
doth naturally infer the satisfaction (some
way or other) of such <hi>desires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Supposing they be spiritual good things
that are desired, <hi>Delight in God</hi> is most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
the satisfaction it self of such desire.
Whatsoever purely spiritual good we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:32156:191"/>
is either <hi>God himself,</hi> or <hi>somewhat in order
to him. If it be God himself</hi> we desire, so far
as we <hi>delight in him</hi> we <hi>enjoy</hi> him, and have
what we would have; And can only <hi>enjoy</hi>
him more fully, by more entire and composed
<hi>rest</hi> and <hi>delight in him. If it be somewhat in
order to him,</hi> He is still supreamly and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
desired in that very <hi>desire;</hi> so that in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in him,</hi> we have our end, and that
upon which this desire doth lastly terminate.
And now should not this be a great induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us to <hi>delight in God,</hi> that hereby our
desires, the motions of our working hearts
directed towards him, do immediately find
in him a <hi>peaceful and pleasant rest,</hi> and turn
into a satisfying fruition?</p>
               <p>2. Supposing the things we desire be those
of an inferiour kind; <hi>Delight in God</hi> doth not
a little to the satisfying of them also.</p>
               <p>It doth not, as was said, intitle us to the
things themselves we desire whatever they be,
or how unsutable soever to us.</p>
               <p>But first, It moderates these desires, makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
them sober, prudent, and rational, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being satisfied with what is fit
for us. He that is much habituated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God is not apt to foolish extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
desires. This is the sence of such a
one, <hi>Not my will Lord, but thine be done.</hi> He
may desire the same thing that others do,
yet not with the same peremptory and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant
desire, but with a desire tempered
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:32156:192"/>
with submission, and with a reserved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the matter to the Divine pleasure:
<hi>This thing, Lord, I desire if thou see good.</hi> So
that the general object of such a ones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is only <hi>that which in the divine estimate
is fit and good for him.</hi> And though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
this or that particular thing, yet not
as <hi>it is this thing,</hi> but as supposing it possible
this thing may be judged fit for him by
the supream Wisdom, whereto he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
the matter. But if it shall be judged
otherwise; <hi>This thing</hi> falls without the
compass of the general object of his desire,
and in just construction he desires it not.
For he desires it not <hi>otherwise</hi> than on that
condition that God see it meet for him; And
not longer than till he find he does not. In
which case the sobriety and submissiveness
of his former desire, appears in his <hi>cheerful
patient want</hi> of the thing which he finds
God hath thought fit to deny him. So that
even then, his desire is satisfied, that is,
It doth not (as often it is with a carnal
heart) turn, being crost, into rage and
madness; But into a <hi>complacential peace,</hi>
and rest in the Divine will. He is satisfied
in what God hath thought fit to do. Yea
the very thing is done which he would have
done: God hath given him his <hi>hearts desire.</hi> For
let the question be put to such a person,
<hi>Do you desire such a thing though God judg it
will be hurtful to you or unfit for you?</hi> And
no doubt he will, not in faint Words that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:32156:192"/>
have no sence under them (as almost any
other man would) but from his very heart
and Soul say, <hi>No.</hi> And if he deliberate the
matter of his own accord, or by any ones
enquiry be occasion'd to do so, This will
be found the sence of his heart, (though his
desire hath inclin'd to this or that thing in
particular): And this would be his Prayer
in such a case, <hi>Lord, If thy wisdom, which is
infinitely more than mine, see this thing not
fit, cross me, deny me in this desire of mine.</hi>
And <hi>this general desire</hi> at least, which is the
measure of the particular one, is sure to
be accomplisht to one that hath God for
his delight.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28</note> For the promise is express and
cannot fail, <hi>All things shall Work together for
good, to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>this love to God,</hi> or <hi>delight in him,</hi>
as it entitles such to that his care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for them which is exprest in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
So it doth <hi>in its own nature</hi> dispose
their hearts to an acquiescence and satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
therein. For <hi>love to God,</hi> where it
is <hi>true,</hi> is <hi>supream,</hi> and prevails over all
other love to this or that particular good.
Whence it cannot be, but, <hi>if this love be in
act,</hi> (as, the Text must be understood to call
unto actual and exercised delight in God)
it must subdue, and keep the heart so far
subject to the divine good pleasure, as that
its desire and addictedness to this <hi>particular
lesser good</hi> (concerning which there may also
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:32156:193"/>
be a just and rational doubt whether it will
be <hi>now a good to him</hi> yea or no) shall never
be a matter of controversy and quarrel with
him who is, <hi>unquestionably,</hi> the <hi>Supream and
universal good.</hi> How will that one thought
overcome, if such a one shall but apprehend
God saying to him, <hi>Dost thou love me above
all things, and wilt yet contend with me for
such a trifle!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we may by the way note, That upon
this ground <hi>of the dubious mutability of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
good things</hi> (which, by circumstances,
may become evil to this or that person)
As they are not <hi>here,</hi> so nor can they be
<hi>any-where</hi> the matter of a <hi>general absolute
promise,</hi> to be claim'd indefinitely by any
ones faith. The nature of the thing refuses
it. For suppose we, that what <hi>may,</hi> in this
or that case, become evil or prejudicial to this
or that person, doth <hi>now</hi> actually <hi>become
so,</hi> and is the matter of an absolute promise,
now claimable by such a person, What
would follow? <hi>That an evil is now the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
matter of a promise!</hi> Than which what
can be said or supposed more absurd? when
nothing can further or otherwise be the
matter of a promise, than <hi>as it is good.</hi>
Wherefore that promise would, in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
case, degenerate (as the matter of it
is by the present circumstances varied) and
turn into a threatning. Wherefore when
that condition or proviso is not expresly
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:32156:193"/>
added to a promise concerning a temporal
good, the very nature of the thing implies
(and requires) <hi>it to be understood.</hi> For it
is not, otherwise than as qualifi'd by that
condition, any way a promise. Now he
that is in the present exercise of delight in
God, hath his heart so set upon God and
alienated from earthly things, as that the
present temper of it bears proportion to the
<hi>natural tenor</hi> of such promises; And is not
otherwise than <hi>by the cessation of this delight,</hi>
liable to the torture of unsatisfied desire in
reference to these lower things: <hi>Although the
fig-tree shall not blossom—yet I will rejoyce in
the Lord</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 17, 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as delight in God doth thus reduce
and moderate desires in reference to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
good; so that, <hi>if it be with-held,</hi> they
admit a satisfaction without it, and the want
of is easily tolerable. So secondly, <hi>If it be
granted,</hi> Delight in God addes a satisfying
sweetness to the enjoyment. A lover of God
hath another taste and relish, even of
earthly good things, than an earthly-minded
man can have. He hath that sweet
Savor of the Love of God upon his spirit,
that imparts a sweetness to all the enjoyments
of this World, beyond what such things
<hi>in their own nature</hi> have with them.<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 16</note> 
                  <hi>This
makes the righteous mans little, better than the
great revenues of many wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:32156:194"/>
Upon the whole therefore, This is, if
duly weighed, a mighty and most perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
argument to delight in God. For it
imports thus much, which I add for a close
to this discourse.</p>
               <p>If you place your delight here; You are
most certainly delivered from the vexation
and torment <hi>of unsatisfied desire.</hi> The
motions of your Souls are sure to end in a
pleasant rest. Your lesser desires will be
swallowed up in greater, and all in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
fulness; So that you will now say,
<hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is
none on earth I desire besides thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal 73. 25.</note> If you
take no delight in God, your own Souls
will be a <hi>present Hell</hi> to you. And it may
be it is not enough considered, how much
the <hi>future Hell</hi> stands also in <hi>unsatisfied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;</hi>
Which desire (all sutable Objects being
for ever cut off from it) turns wholly to
despair, rage and torture. And that ravenous
appetite, which would be preying upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Objects that now fail, turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and as an insatiable Vulture, gnaws
everlastingly the wretched Soul it self.</p>
               <p>And the beginnings of <hi>this Hell</hi> you will
now have within you, while you refuse to
<hi>delight in God.</hi> The sapless, earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
upon which your hearts are set
give you some present content, which allays
your misery for a little while, and renders
it less sensible to you: But they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:32156:194"/>
in them to answer the vast desires of
a reasonable immortal spirit. Whereby you
certainly doom yourselves to perpetual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
For <hi>in these false vanishing shadows of
goodness,</hi> you <hi>cannot</hi> have satisfaction, and
<hi>in the blessed God</hi> you <hi>will not.</hi>
