         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FIrst, single out a convenient place or soyle, where you meane to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your Edifice or building, not farre distant from some running River, Fountaine, or other water, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering neare some Thicket or Grove; or shadowed with Elmes, or other Trees, for they are a very delectable object to the Eye; for they many times besides, breake the heat of the Sunne, and the rage of the winds, and are convenient both for shelter and sight. And likewise as in these, so you must be regardfull, that the ayre

wherein your scituation should be, be not corrupt and damped by the Exhalation of Fogges, and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours suckt up by the Sunne from Fennes and Marishes, and other low and rotten grounds there neare-unto neighbouring. For the ayre is a great preserver, or drawer-on of health or sicknesse, and hath a powerfull hand in the state of every mans bodie; and is the originall cause of many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diseases, and much continued health.</p>
               <p>And for the Foundation thereof, it is necessary and convenient, that it be placed upon a dry and sandy ground, of some fit height and elevation, with the windowes towards the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, except the prospect otherwise perswade you.</p>
               <p>All these things being thus consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and effected, compasse in a plot of ground convenient for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which stored with variety of sweet hearbs and flowers, yeelds much content and profit, both for the pleasure and health of man.

               <p>THat there are dietary times and houres appointed for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past and Refection, as decency and order requires, is not unknowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, yet we though allowing they may be observed at all times for civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and fashion, conclude, wee may not sometimes partake of them without satiety and danger. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our times of eating, <hi>Rasis</hi> saith, it is then most convenient to

eat (not at the times appointed) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it so happen that the substance and weight of our meats before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are decocted and descended to the inferiour parts of the Belly; and those parts are become light and easie in themselves, in the which no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or crudity remaineth: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient exercise having proceeded thereupon. For indeed to prescribe against the strictnesse of rule, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the appetite best serves, then it is thought most wholesome and convenient to eat. For as saith <hi>Rasis,</hi> wee must be wary wee dull not the edge thereof by over-long fasting and breaking of houres, unlesse it prove false unto us, as it doth most usuall with Drunkards, and such like unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ill Dieted persons: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a man of good observation and Dyet shall desire to eat, and the nourishment taken before was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grosse nor much, and which hee finds now well digested, let him then Dyet himselfe an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And furthermore, it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that every man take those meats that stand best with the state and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his Body, and doe eat as often as before hee hath beene most accustomed unto; for use and custome being once associates of long familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doe so incorporate and colleague withus, that they become part of our selves; unlesse hee haue growne upon an ill ordered custome, which is altogether to be taken heed of and avoyded, though not suddenly, as at once, yet by little and little; For, <hi>Consuetudo est altera natura;</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is another Nature, and will not easily forsake us hastily: And for our times of repast, they should bee so ordered, that at least we should eat once in one day, and at most not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twice: or that which is more temperate, to eat thrice in two daies. For as it is good for them to eat twice

in one day, that have weak and moist bodies, so it is hurtfull for them that have bodies fat and grosse; but to those that use much exercise or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, greater quantities, and grosser meats may be lesse offensive.

these or any other occasion, it is prescribed, that our meat should be prepared and fitted according to the seasons of the yeare, and to the Temper of our bodies, (that is to say) hot in the winter, and cold in the summer; yet not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames in either: For wee must abstaine from those <hi>Sorbilia,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping meats, but immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Fier, as from those that are so cold, that they are kept as under the snow, other Countries presidenting us in the example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Avicen</hi> in his Canticles saith, that in our meales and repastures, we should so farre become <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> over our owne bodies, as to mingle those that are moyst and soluble, with others that are stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike and binding, so allaying the violence in both, by the mutuall moderation of eithers quality, that we may enioy the temperature of them, to our health and pleasure, by this mixitive application of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands

                  <p>Examine thy custome of Dyer, Sleepe, Exercise, Apparell, and the like; and try in anything thou shalt judge hurtfull, to disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it by degrees; but so, as if thou dost finde any inconvenience by the change, thou mayst return: For, it is hard to distinguish that which is generally held good and wholesome, from that which is good particularly, and fit onely for thine owne body.</p>

answered, that meat; (although drinke be the more desired) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is most necessary that restores the members, than that which but convayes the meat, and disperceth it in the body; but meat is ordained to restore the members, drinke but for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that meat through the members, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> But that drinke is both more, and more earnestly desired then meat, the reason is, because drinke cooles the burning of the naturall heat, and therefore is more necessary to life then meat, as the ayre.

To the which is answered so, and as natural heat continually worketh upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the body, for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment is ever in agitation, as is experienced upon Children, which in their young yeares through their vehement heat doe eat more and more often, then the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and as contrarily in old men we see that they more easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure fasting, through the defect of their Naturall heat, then Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and as likewise we see in men of middle age, their naturall heat stirred up with any exercise, more strongly desire meat then otherwise they should.

To which is answered, (according to <hi>Galen)</hi> that they are: the reason whereof may bee thus given, That when all the Members doe equally partake, the Stomacke is then of least Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, because every member su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth her owne want.

                  <p>NExt is demanded, whether Water more quencheth the thirst then Wine? To the which is answered, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> Thirst is ingendred two manner of wayes: the one by fasting, the other, out of heat and drynesse of the heart.

In like manner, that chirst which is caused out of heat, is of three-fold: the one arising from the stomacke, the other from the lungs, the third from parts more remote.

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AMongst those things that are hurtfull after Meat, it is first demanded, From whence ariseth the eructation or belching
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:730:118"/>
of the Stomacke? To the which is answered (according to <hi>Galen)</hi> that the bitternesse and belching thereof, is principally caused by the shutting up of the heat in the body, and straightning of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row passages that should bring in the Ayre to coole it, whereby it is the more increased, which of it selfe is the originall ground of all bitternesse in the Stomacke, and the more especially so, if begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Digest it, it be afterwards hindered by excluding this cold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, it is demanded, why presently after our meats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, this bitternesse is not felt in the Stomacke? To the which is answered, that meats newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, some little time doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the stomacke, in their owne nature, as if they were without us: and therefore as yet cannot this bitternesse be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by them. But when as the naturall heat beginneth to digest, and is by some accident or other
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:730:119"/>
hindered, whereupon followeth an indigestion: from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth this bitternesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not presently perceived.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it is demanded why this bitternesse more often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to them that sleepe, then to those that wake? To which is answered, That by sleepe the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is closed up; that the meats received cannot descend into the bottome thereof, where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion is made, but remaine in the upper part; where swimming, they putrifie and corrupt, and cause a windinesse and belching therein, which otherwayes would be avoyded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why Wine being hot in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, should not produce diseases of like kinde, but contrary, such as are cold? To the which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that Wine causeth not the disease, unlesse by over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the braine and nerves; but repletions follow indigestions, and indigestions cause cold diseases:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:730:119"/>
and therefore Wine produceth no other but cold diseases.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next is demanded whether sicke persons may eat much, as they were accustomed when they were well? It is answered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that Custome is another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore he which hath accustomed to eat much in Health, must have some relation thereto in his sicknesse, eating oftner (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rasis)</hi> then he which in health was but of spare Diet.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Next is demanded whether for sicke persons, having lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their health, bread or flesh be more convenient? To the which we answer with <hi>Rasis,</hi> that flesh: and because amongst all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meats Hogges-flesh is most nourishing, therefore that flesh is <note place="margin">Hogs-flesh of al other most nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,</note> most convenient for them, being most easie of Digestion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Next is demanded whether flesh or bread be most convenient to those that are troubled with Agues? It is answered, that two
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:730:120"/>
things are to be respected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: first, flesh is of an easie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and therefore thought more convenient: fecondly, Bread is easie conversion, and therefore more convenient then Flesh, and because flesh by the fatnesse, doth more easily inflame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Next is demanded whether Flesh or Wine are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to those that have newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their Healths? To the which is answered, that Flesh; and therfore the vulgar are much deceived that thinke Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause amongst all other things it is the most easie converted into blood, spirituall and naturall heat, and therefore to be taken after Flesh.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Next is demanded whether he that is lately recovered from his sicknesse, must for some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes observe theOrder and Diet that he used in his sicknesse, or not? To the which is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that so; and that for three
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:730:120"/>
reasons: First, for the weaknesse of Nature, Secondly, for the not breach of Custome. Thirdly, for the imbecility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>FIrst, It is demanded why Bread of Wheat doth more nourish than of Barley? To the which is answered, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problemes, because of the moderate viscosity and moysture, most requisite therein,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:730:121"/>
for the better conglutination and fastning thereof to the body, which the other wanting, is not therefore held so convenient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next is demanded where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bread that is stale, is either more whiter than that which is new? To the which we answer, the cause of the blacknesse is the water therein, which in bread that is stale is dried up, and therefore the more white.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next is demanded why bread unsalted is more heavy than that which is salted? To the which it is answered, that salt dryeth up the moysture therein, for which reason likewise it becommeth more light and white.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next is demanded why bread of Wheat becommeth not hard, being old, as other bread doth? To the which is answered, that the Wheat hath in it a certaine sweet and humane moysture, which is as it were the life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that suffereth it not to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</p>

5. Wherefore Bread that is made of new corne, is no so good as that which is made of the old; the reason is, that new graine hath in it too great a moysture and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trishnesse than is commendable, and therefore Bread made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not so good as of the old.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Next is demanded why chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being hot in nature, are not lovers of Wine, but old men? To the which is answered, that old men are hot and dry, but children hot and moyst.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next is demanded what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is most ingendred of wine, whether Phlegme or blood? To the which is answered, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:730:122"/>
wine breeds cold diseases, as formerly we have proved, therefore doth it more ingender phlegmaticall humours than any other; and the renson is, because when much Wine is taken, it is not fully digested, and whatsoever remaines in the body indigested, is converted into phlegme, and therefore of wine, by reason of the often exceeding therein, is more ingendred than of any other thing. But wine being moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is more converted into blood than phlegme.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next is demanded why strong wine comforteth the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and hurteth the braine; but weake wine effecteth the contrary? It is answered, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke doth digest, and digestion commeth of heat, therefore it seemeth to helpe the stomacke in digestion, because it addeth to the heat, which the weaker doth not. But wine the stronger it is, from it doe the more vapours arise into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:730:123"/>
the head, and so much more hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the braine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next is demanded whether wine or meat are the greatest comforters of naturall heat? To the which is answered, according to <hi>Isacke,</hi> that wine: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because it more easily and swiftly converteth into naturall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat, and doth more strengthen than meats doe. But meat, being couerted, is of longer durance, and greater restauration.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Next is demanded whether if wine be to be given to one that is weake, new or old be the more commended? To the which we answer, against the opinion of the vulgar, that in this case the new is better than the old: and the reason is, because Wine, by how much more it is new, by so much lesse it inflameth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this respect better than the old.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Next is demanded why Wine purged from his lees, is of

greater strength and force, but lesse lasting?

               <p n="1">1. NExt is demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flesh rosted or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led be more moyst? To the which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:730:124"/>
is answered the rosted, that by the heat of the fire is hardned and rosted on the outward parts, whereby the humidity and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture is shut up and retained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that it cannot goe forth. But in that which is boyled, the outmost parts become softned and tender by the moderate heat of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, that the moysture therein hath the freer vent and issue forth, and therefore meats rosted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they seeme more dryer without, yet within they are more moyst, and the boyled more dry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next is demanded why the Moóne-light doth more putrifie flesh that is killed, than the heat of the Sunne?

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> demanded whether the yolke or the white be of more heat? It is answered, that amongst all the humours of the body, the blood is the hottest, yet most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in heat: and therefore that which comes nearest to the nature
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:730:125"/>
of blood, is nearest of the quality, of which is the yolke, and therfore the more hotter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next it is demanded, why the yolke being put into water, immediately descends to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, but the white contrariwise swimmes on the top? It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the white of the Egge is siymy and viscous, and cleaves unto that whereunto it is put, and therefore put into water, swims on the top; but the yolke descends with its owne weight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next is demanded why Egges in birds are of a more harder shell than those of Fishes? To the which is answered, that Fishes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Egges in watry and moyst places, and therefore need but soft shels. But fals contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in more hard and dangerous places, as upon Rockes, and Hils, and such like; and therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath more warily provided for them, and for their withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hurt and danger, untill their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:730:125"/>
young ones come to perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next is demanded, why Egges in birds are of greater quantities, though fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than those of Fishes? To the which is answered, that Birds are of greater heat than Fishes, which is the cause of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their Egges; but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude out of the matter which is the principle of division, and therefore because Fowles have more heat than Fishes, therefore the Egges are greater in substance but few in number; and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise of Fishes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next is demanded, why Egges in Birds are of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and those of Fishes not? It is answered, because the heat in Birds is more strong, which doth separate those things which are of adverse nature, as the yolke from the white, &amp;c. but in Fishes the heat is more weake; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot separate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Next is demanded why the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:730:126"/>
Egges of Fishes are round, and the Egges of Fowles are of a longer figure? It is answered, that heat moves to his centor, especially to a piramidall figure, as appeares in a flame of fire that ever ascends upward, &amp; ends stil in a point. And therefore because heat is more strong in Fowles than in Fishes, the Egges of Fowles are longer, the Fishes more round, because their heat being weak, dispearseth it selfe thereinto.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Next is demanded why some Egges cracke in the fire, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rs not? It is answered, that those most cracke in the fire which are of most windinesse, from the which when the shell is broken in the fire, out comes the wind with violence and noyse, and this most happens when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heat is strong; whereupon if the Egge of any Fowle be put into such a fire, the shell is quickly broken, and the windinesse comes out with great violence and noyse

               <p n="1">1. FIrst, it is demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fishes eat their owne spawne or not? It is answered, that they doe. First, because they are greedy and ravenous through the coldnesse of their stomackes: and next, because they are dull of sense, and discerne not betwixt their owne and others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most greedily devoure their owne with others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next is demanded whether Fishes chew their meat? It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, not: the reason is, First,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:730:127"/>
because if they should chew it, they should superfluously swallow the water, to the suffocation of themselves: Secondly, because they are gluttenous, and doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it is demanded why raine is convenient to Fishes, and hurtfull to Birds? It is answered, that to Fishes raine-water is very convenient, because it washeth in the sweet of the soyle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled in the waters, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes much feed upon, &amp; grow fat. But Birds are of another nature, living in the ayre, and supporting their bodies by the wing, which hereby their feathers being fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, their flight is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="1">1. FIrst, it is demanded why the Gout happeneth to them most commonly that eat many kinds of pulses. It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of <hi>Galen,</hi> because they are hard and windy, and not easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, by reason of which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion <note place="margin">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>xt is demanded, why Beanes being that they are windy by decoction, lose not their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse as Barley doth? To which is answered, that Beanes are of nature more windy than Barley, and because they are of a more grosse and compact substance, therefore more hardly altered, than Barley which is more thinne and easie. Wherefore saith <hi>Isacke,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:730:128"/>
according to <hi>Galen,</hi> by decocting of Beanes we lose not their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, but by strong seething, we something diminish it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next is demanded why the eating of Figges breedeth Lice? <note place="margin">Why the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ng of figs breed Lice.</note> To the which is answered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though figges of themselves soone putrifie and corrupt, yet have they a property to present all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corrupt humours they find in the body, to the uppermost part of the skinne; and out of such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are Lice ingendred, although otherwise sometimes by sweaty and unshifted linnen betweene the skinne and that alone, as the two parents without any other materials ingendred; to which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one merrily jesteth upon a lousie shifter in this Epigram, as followeth:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>By want of shift, since Lice at first are bred,</l>
                  <l>And after by the same increas'd and fed:</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Since that is sure he shifts as much as any.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Yet <hi>Auicen</hi> thus farre commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth figges, that they cause a good colour in the face, by driving the blood to the outermost part of the skinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next is demanded, why wine being drunke after any rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fruit tasteth bitter? To the which is answered, that from the fruit is derived a certaine bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which remaineth upon the tongue, which being mixed with Wine maketh it of a bitter tast.</p>
               <p>Next is demanded whether new Hony be better than old? To the which is answered, that it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with Hony than with Wine, because the newest Hony and the oldest Wine is ever the best: and the reason is, because the nature of Wine is moyst, but the nature of Hony dry: the experience
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:730:129"/>
whereof may be taken in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, where those having dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moystned with Wine, as those that are moyst and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke are dryed with Honey.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next is demanded why oyle in the top, wine in the middle, and hony in the bottome is ever best to begin with the last first? It is answered, because that honey which is best, is waightier than the other, and so sinketh downe to the bottome, and therefore in a vessell of honey, that in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome <note place="margin">To chuse Honey.</note> is ever the best.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But in a vessell of wine the middle, because the bottome thereof is thickned with Lees, and the top is troubled with ayre; whereupon the husbandmen knowing it not sufficient to keep it in a close house, mine and digge deepe to lay it in the ground, so to remove it from the ayre as much as they can, by which it is so manifestly hurt, that it is scarce conserved in a vessell halfe full;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:730:129"/>
and therefore that in the middle removed from these inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is the best.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But that oyle which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the top of the vessell, or in a vessell halfe full, is both the best, and bettered thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the ayre entring into it, dries up the vacuous and superfluous humour wherein it lyes, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it both of better taste and quality.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Next is demanded, why oyle sometimes is frozen, but wine more seldome? it is answered, that in oile there is a cause of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation being glutenous and thicke, which in wine there is not being of a more liquid and strong vertue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Next is demanded, why Vinegar being that it is most cold, is never frozen, seeing that the coldest things are most apt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? It is answered, because Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar is the most liquid amongst all other humours, and the most
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:730:130"/>
piercing and tart, which like the sea being alwayes respersed with his owne bitternesse, doth never freeze.</p>
               <p>Next is demanded why pepper and mustard doe gnaw the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward skin, and hurt the stomacke? To the which is answered, being opposed unto the outward skin, it worketh thereupon in his full vertue and nature, which is to corrode and gnaw; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into the stomacke, the force thereof is abated through the quality and nature thereof, and so ceaseth in that effect.</p>
