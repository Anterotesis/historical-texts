         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His worthy Man, eſpecially in his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded (through Gods bleſſing on him) with a very great conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what might give forth <hi>Contentment</hi> to a vaſt ſpirit of his ranck and calling. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a large meaſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and opportunities in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Lord (to glorifie whom, and do much good to others, is the divine part of a man gracious (which he was) the higheſt and moſt ſolid ſatisfaction, and in many reſpects exceeds what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall

In the midſt of theſe his ſtudy was to finde out a more ſublime way, and hidden art of ſelfe ſufficiency, then was in the power of all things to contribute or teach: Such a skill as did not only poyſe &amp; compoſe his ſpirit in the preſent enjoyment of all; but might fortifie and furniſh him with proviſion for the future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the loſſe of all, in times wherein <hi>no man knoweth what evil will be in the earth.</hi> This mark his firſt lines ſhew he ſhot at: This Art ſome Philoſophers of

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Spirit of a man</hi> feeling it ſelfe greater then all creatures, gathering up and conſolidating it ſelf into it ſelf, is able (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies) <hi>to ſuſtaine its owne, and all other infirmites.</hi> But that <hi>Autarchy</hi> this Author here preſents, is a Myſtery, which <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note>

and all-ſufficiencie, with whom aſſociated and made intimate, it melts it ſelfe into all his intereſts, making them its owne, and thereby comes to have all that All-ſufficiency of the High God to be its ſelf-ſufficiency: And then, what ſtate can that ſoule be in, wherein it may not be content? ſeeing it hath God to be the chiefeſt comfort in its beſt times, and onely comfort in its worſt. This, though it be the inheritance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint, in the right and title to it, yet the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepends upon an improvement of this inheritance, and that upon a skill which is to be <hi>learned</hi> by experience and much exerciſe (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>I have learned in whatſoever eſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> This piece of learning this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpirited man inured himſelfe unto, and <hi>digging for it as Rubies,</hi> as <hi>Solomons</hi> ſcholler for wiſdome, hath found it, and hath hewen forth this <hi>Jewel</hi> (a Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neither by himſelfe, not us the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers, to the ſubject it ſelfe, yet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE is a very <hi>ſeaſonable Cordial</hi> to revive the drooping ſpirits of the Saints in theſe ſad and ſinking times: For the <hi>hour of temptation</hi> is already come upon all the world to try the Inhabitants of the earth; and in ſpecial, this is the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> troubles in our owne bowels.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> experimentally holds forth in this Goſpel-Text, the very life and ſoul of all practical Divinity; wherein we may plainly reade his own proficiency in Chriſts School; and what leſſon every Chriſtian that would evidence the power and growth of godlineſs in his own ſoul, muſt neceſſarily learn from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58996:10"/>Theſe words are brought in by <hi>Paul,</hi> as a plain argument to perſwade the Philippians that he did not ſeek after great things in the world, and that he ſought not <hi>theirs,</hi> but <hi>them</hi>: He did not paſſe for a great eſtate; he had better things to take up his heart withal. I do not ſpeak (ſaith he) in reſpect of want, [<hi>For</hi>] whether I have or have not, my heart is fully ſatisfied, I have enough; <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi>

                  </gap>,</note> which we render <hi>Content</hi> here, hath in the Original much elegancy and fulneſſe of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in it. In ſtrictneſſe of phraſe it is only attributed unto God, who hath ſtiled himſelf <hi>God alſufficiant,</hi> as reſting wholly ſatisfied in and with himſelf alone; but he is pleaſed freely to comunicate of his fulneſs to the creature ſo that from God in Chriſt the Saints <hi>receive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. in ſomuch that there is in them an anſwerableneſſe of the ſame grace in their proportion that is in Chriſt. And in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I have a <hi>Self-ſufficiency,</hi> as the word notes.</p>
            <p>But hath <hi>Paul</hi> a ſelf-ſufficiency you will ſay? How are we ſufficient of our ſelves?

of ſatisfaction in my own heart, through the grace of Chriſt that is in me; though I have not outward comforts and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodations to ſupply my neceſſities, yet I enjoy portion enough betwixt Chriſt and my own ſoul abundantly to ſatisfie me in every condition. And this interpretation is ſutable to that place, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.1<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf</hi>; and agreeable to what he verifies of himſelf in another place; that <hi>though he had nothing yet he poſſeſſed all things</hi>; becauſe he had right to the covenant and promiſe, which virtually contains all, and an intereſt in Chriſt the fountain and good of all, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, no marvell he ſaith that in whatſoever ſtate he was in, he was content. Thus you have the genuine interpretation of the text. I ſhall not make any diviſion of the words, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe I take them only to proſecute that <hi>one duty</hi> moſt neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> The quieting and comforting the hearts of Gods people under the troubles and changes they meet withall, in theſe heart-ſhaking times, And the doctrinal concluſion is in brief this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That to be well skill'd in the myſtery of Chriſtian Contentment is the Duty, Glory, and Excellency of a Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Evangelical truth is held forth ſufficiently in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet take one or two paralel places more for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6, &amp; 8. you have both the duty expreſt, and the glory thereof: <hi>Having food and raiment</hi> (ſaith he verſ. 8.) <hi>let us be therewith content,</hi> there is the duty; <hi>But godlineſs with Contentment is great gain,</hi> verſ. 6. there is the glory and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it: as if godlineſſe were not gain except there were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment withal. The like exhortation you have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your converſation be without Covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have.</hi> I do not find any Apoſtle or Writer of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture treat ſo much of this ſpiritual myſtery of Contentment as this our Apoſtle hath done throughout his Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>For the cleer opening and proving of this practical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I ſhall indeavour to demonſtrate theſe four things;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The nature of this Chriſtian Contentment, what it is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The art and myſtery of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58996:11"/>Thirdly, What thoſe leſſons are that muſt be learn'd to work the heart to contentment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Wherein the glorious excellencies of this grace doth principally conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Concerming the firſt, take this diſcription; <hi>Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is that ſweet, inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods wiſe, and fatherly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in euery condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall break open this diſcription, for it is a box of precious ointment, very comfortable and uſeful for troubled hearts, in troubled time and conditions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Contentment</hi> (I ſay) <hi>is a ſweet [inward] heart thing, it is a work of the ſpirit within doors</hi>: It is not only a not-ſeeking help to our ſelves by outward violence, or a forbearance of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed murmuring expreſſions, in froward words and carriages againſt God or others; but it is the inward ſubmiſſion of the heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. <hi>Truly, my ſoul waiteth upon God; and ver.</hi> 5. <hi>My ſoul wait thou only upon God,</hi> ſo it is in your Books; but the words may be tranſlated as rightly, <hi>My ſoul be thou ſilent unto God; Hold thy peace O my ſoul</hi>: Not only the tongue muſt hold it's peace, but the ſoul muſt be ſilent: Many may ſit down ſilently, forbearing diſcontented expreſſions, yet are inwardly ſwollen with diſcontentment; now this manifeſteth a perplexed diſtemper and a great frowardneſſe in their hearts: And God notwithſtanding their outward ſilence hears the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fretting language of their ſouls. The ſhoe may be ſmooth and neat without, whilſt the fleſh is pinched within: There may be much calmneſſe and ſtilneſſe outwardly, and yet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful confuſion, bitterneſſe, diſturbance and vexation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Some are ſo weak that they are not able to contain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of their own ſpirits, but in words and behaviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what woful perturbations there are within, their ſpirits being like the raging Sea caſting forth nothing but mire and dirt, being not only troubleſome to themſelves but to all thoſe they live with: Others there are who are able to keep in ſuch diſtempers of heart, (as <hi>Judas</hi> did when he betrayed Chriſt with a kiſſe,) but ſtill they boyl inwardly and eat like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning ſome whoſe words are ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58996:11"/>
than honey, and butter, and yet have war in their hearts; and as he ſaith in another place, whilſt <hi>I kept ſilence my bones waxed old</hi>; ſo theſe, whilſt there is a ſerene calme upon their tongues, have yet bluſtring ſtorms in their ſpirits, and whilſt they keep ſilence their hearts are troubled, and even worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with anguiſh and vexation; they have peace and quiet outwardly, but war from the unruly and turbulent workings of their hearts, that is within. If the attainment to true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment were as eaſy as keeping quiet outwardly, there need be no great learning of it; it might be had with leſſe skill and ſtrength than an Apoſtle had; yea than an ordinary Chriſtian hath or may have. Therefore certainly there is a great deal more in it than can be attained by common gifts, and ordinary power of reaſon, which often bridles in nature. It is a heart-buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It is the [quiet] of the heart</hi>; All is ſedate and ſtill there, and to underſtand this the better; This quiet gracious frame of ſpirit, It is not oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>To a due ſenſe of affliction.</hi> God doth give leave to his people to be ſenſible of what they ſuffer: Chriſt doth not ſay, Do not count that a croſſe which is a croſſe, but take up your croſſe daily. As it is in the body natural, if the body takes phyſick and is not able to bear it but preſently vomits it up, or if it be not at all ſenſible, if it ſtir not the body; either of theſe waies the phyſick doth no good, but argues the body much diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and will hardly be cured. So it is with the ſpirits of men under afflictions; if either they cannot bear Gods potions but caſt them up again, or are not ſenſible of them, and their ſouls are no more ſtir'd by them than the body is by a draught of ſmal beer, it is a ſad ſymptome that their ſouls are in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and almoſt incurable condition. So that this inward quietneſſe is not in oppoſition to the ſenſe of affliction: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were no true Contentment if you were not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſenſible of your afflictions when God is angry. It is not oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>To an orderly making our moan and complaint to God, and to our friends.</hi> Though a Chriſtian ought to be quiet under Gods correcting hand, yet he may without any breach of Chriſtian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58996:12"/>
contentment complain to God; (as one of the Ancients ſaith) though not with a tumultuous clamour and skreeking out in a perplexed paſſion, yet in a quit ſtill ſubmiſſive way he may unboſom his heart unto God. And likewiſe communicate his ſad condition to his gracious friends, ſhewing them how God hath dealt with him and how heavy the affliction is upon him, that they may ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to his wearied ſoul. It is not oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>To all lawful ſeeking out for help into another condition, or ſimply endeavouring to be delivered out of the preſent affliction by the uſe of lawfull means.</hi> No, I may lay in proviſion for my deliverance, &amp; uſe Gods meanes, waiting on him, becauſe I know not but that it may be his will to alter my condition, and ſo far as he leads me I may follow his providence, it is but my duty. God is thus far mercifully indulgent to our weakneſs, and he will not take it ill at our hands if by earneſt and importunate prayer we ſeek unto him for deliverance, till we know his good pleaſure therein. And certainly thus ſeeking for help with ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and holy reſignation of ſpirit, to be delivered when God will, and as God will, and how God will, ſo that our wils are melted into the will of God, this is no oppoſition to the quietneſs which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then, what is this quietneſſe of ſpirit oppoſed unto?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>To murmuring and repining at the hand of God; as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Iſraelits often did,</hi> which if we our ſelves cannot indure either in our children or ſervants, much leſſe can God bear it in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>To vexing and fretting</hi>; which is a degree beyond murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is a ſpeech I remember of an Heathen, A wiſe man may greive under, but not be vexed with his afflictions. There is a vaſt difference betwixt a kindly grieving and a diſtempered vexation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>To tumultuouſneſs of ſpirit</hi>: When the thoughts run diſtractingly and work in a confuſed manner, ſo that the affections are like the unruly multitude in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who knew not for what end they were come together. The Lord expects that you ſhould be ſilent under his rod, and as he ſaid in <hi>Act.</hi> 19.36. <hi>You
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58996:12"/>
ought to be quiet and to do nothing raſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>To unſetledneſs and unfixedneſs of ſpirit, whereby the heart is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the preſent duty that God requires in our ſeveral relations, both towards God, our ſelves, and others.</hi> We ſhould prize duty at a higher rate than to be taken off by every trivial occaſion; a Chriſtian indeed values every ſervice of God ſo much, that though ſome may be in the eye of the world and of natural reaſon, a ſlight empty buſineſſe, beggerly rudiments, fooliſhneſſe, yet ſeeing God cals for it, the authority of the command doth ſo over awe his heart, that he is willing to ſpend himſelf and to be ſpent in the diſcharge of it. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Luthers,</hi> ordinary works that are done in faith, and from faith, are more precious than heaven and earth. And if this be ſo, and a Chriſtian know it, it is not a little matter that ſhould divert him: but he ſhould anſwer every avocation, and reſiſt every tentation, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did chap. 6.3. <hi>Sanballat, Geſhem, and Tobiah</hi> (when they would have hindred the building of the wall) with this, <hi>I am doing a great wo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come down, why ſhould the work of the Lord ceaſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>To diſtracting, heart-eating cares and fears.</hi> A gracious heart ſo eſtimates it's union with Chriſt and the work that God ſets it about, as it will not willingly ſuffer any thing to come in to choak it, or dead it. A Chriſtian is deſirous that the word of God ſhould take ſuch full poſſeſſion as to divide between ſoul and ſpirit, but he would not ſuffer the fear and noiſe of evil-tidings to take ſuch impreſſion in his ſoul, as to make a diviſion and ſtrugling there, like the twins in <hi>Rebeckah's</hi> womb. A great man will permit common people to ſtand without his doors, but he will not let them come in and make a noiſe in his cloſet or bed-chamber when he purpoſely retires himſelf from all worldly imployments. So a well tempered ſpirit though it may inquire after things abroad without doors in the world, and ſuffer ſome ordinary cares and fears to break in to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs of the ſoul, ſo as to have a light touch upon the thoughts: Yet it will not upon any terms admit of an intruſion into the privy-chamber, which ſhould be wholly reſerved for Jeſus Chriſt as his inward Temple.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>To ſinking diſcouragements.</hi> When things fall not out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58996:13"/>
to expectation, when the tyde of ſecond cauſes runs ſo low that we ſee little left in the outward means to bear up our hopes and hearts. That then the heart begins to reaſon as he in the <hi>Kings, If the Lord ſhould open the windows of heaven how ſhould this be?</hi> Never conſidering that God can open the eyes of the blind with clay and ſpittle, he can work above, beyond, nay contrary to means; he often makes the faireſt flowers of mans indeavours to wither, and brings improbable things to paſſe, that the glory of interprizes may be given to himſelf. Nay if his people ſtand in need of miracles to work their deliverance, miracles fall as eaſily out of Gods hands, as to give his people daily bread. Gods bleſſing is many times ſecret upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that they know not which way it comes; as 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 3.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee wind, neither ſhall you ſee rain, yet the valley ſhall be filled with water,</hi> God would have us depend on him though we do not ſee means how the thing ſhould be brought to paſſe, elſe we do not ſhew a quiet ſpirit; though an affliction be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, let not thy heart ſink under it. So far as thy heart ſinks and thou art diſcouraged under thy affliction, ſo much thou wanteſt of this leſſon of Contentment.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>To ſinful ſhiftings and ſhirkings out for eaſe and help.</hi> As we ſee in <hi>Saul</hi> running to the witch of Endor, and in his offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came: Nay the good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> joynes himſelf with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt. And</hi> Aſa <hi>goes to</hi> Penhadad <hi>King of Aſſyria for help, not relying upon the Lord,</hi> (2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 16.7, 8.) Though the Lord had delivered the Ethiopian Army into his hands, conſiſting of a thouſand thouſand, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14.11. And good <hi>Jacob</hi> joyned in a lye with his mother to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was not content to ſtay Gods time, and uſe Gods means, but made too great haſte and ſtept out of his way, to procure the bleſſing which God intended for him: as many do through the corruption of their hearts and weakneſſe of their faith, becauſe they are not able to truſt God, and follow him fully in all things and alwaies; and for this cauſe the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follows the Saints with many ſore temporal croſſes, (as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi>) though they obtain the mercy. It may be thy wretched carnal heart thinks, I care not how I be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58996:13"/>
delivered, ſo I may but get free from it: Is it not ſo many times in ſome of your hearts when any croſſe or affliction befals you? Have not you ſuch kind of workings of ſpirit as this; Oh that I could but be delivered out of this affliction any way, I would not care; your hearts are far from being quiet. And this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhifting is the next thing in oppoſition to this quietneſſe, which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Eighth and laſt thing that this quietneſſe of Spirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to, is <hi>deſparate riſings of heart againſt God in a way of rebellion</hi>: That is moſt abominable. I hope many of you have learned ſo far to be content, as to keep down your hearts from ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; and yet the truth is, not only wicked men, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the very Saints of God find the beginnings of this, when an affliction lies long, and is very ſore and heavy upon them indeed, and ſtrikes them as it were in the maſter vein; they find ſomewhat of this in their hearts, ariſing againſt God, their thoughts begin to bubble, and their affections begin to ſtir in riſing againſt God himſelf; eſpecially ſuch as together with their corruptions have much melancholy, and the Devil wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both upon the corruptions of their hearts, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſtemper of their bodies; though there may lie much grace at the bottom, yet there may be ſome riſings againſt God himſelf under affliction. Now Chriſtian quietneſs is oppoſite to all theſe things: that is, When afflictions come, be it what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction it will be, yet you do not murmur, though you be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though you make your moan, though you deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and ſeek it by all good means, yet you do not murmur nor repine, you do not fret, nor vex, there is not that tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſpirit in you, there is not unſetledneſs in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, there are not diſtracting fears in your hearts, no ſinking diſcouragements, no baſe ſhiftings, no riſing in rebellion any way againſt God: This is the quietneſs of Spirit under an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that is the ſecond thing when the ſoul is ſo far able to bear an affliction as to keep quiet under it.</p>
            <p>Now the Third thing I would open in the diſcription is this, <hi>It is an inward, quiet, gracious [frame] of Spirit.</hi> It is a frame of Spirit, and then a gracious frame of Spirit. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is a Soule buſineſſe, Firſt it is inward; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58996:14"/>
quiet; Thirdly it is a quiet <hi>Frame</hi> of Spirit. [<hi>Frame</hi>] by that I mean theſe Three things: There are Three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable when I ſay, Contentment conſiſts in the quiet <hi>frame</hi> of the Spirit of a man.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a grace that ſpreads it ſelf through the whol Soul</hi>: as thus, It is in the judgment, that is, The judgment of the ſoul of a man or woman tends to quiet the heart: In my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am ſatisfied, that is one thing to be ſatisfied in ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and judgment, as thus, This is the hand of God; and this is that that is ſutable to my condition, or beſt for me; although I do not ſee the reaſon of the thing, yet I am ſatisfied in my judgment about it.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>it is in the thoughts of a man or woman</hi>: As my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſatisfied, ſo my thoughts are kept in order.</p>
            <p>And then it comes to the <hi>will, My will yeilds and ſubmits to it, my affections are all likewiſe kept in order, ſo that it goes through the whol ſoul.</hi> There is in ſome a partiall Contentment, and ſo 'tis not the frame of the ſoul, but ſome part of the ſoul hath ſome Contentment, as thus, Many a man may be ſatisfied in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about a thing, and yet cannot for his life rule his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor his thoughts, cannot rule his thoughts, nor the wil, nor the affections though the judgments be ſatisfied: I make no queſtion but many of you may know this by your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you do but obſerve the workings of your own hearts. Cannot you ſay when ſuch an affliction befals you, I can bleſſe God I am ſatisfied in my judgment about it, I have nothing in the world to ſay in reſpect of my judgment againſt it, I ſee the hand of God and I ſhould be content: yea I am ſatisfied in my judgment, that my condition is a good condition in which I am; but I cannot for my life rule my thoughts, and will, and my affections, me thinks I feel my heart heavy, and ſad, and troubled more than it ſhould be, and yet my judgment is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This ſeem'd to be the caſe of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 43. <hi>O my Soul why art thou diſquieted? David</hi> as far as his judgment went, there was a contentedneſſe, that is, His judgment was ſatisfied in the work of God upon him; and he was troubled, but he knew not wherefore, <hi>O my ſoul why art thou eaſt down within me?</hi> That Pſalm is a very good Pſalm for thoſe that feel a fretting, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58996:14"/>
diſtemper in their hearts at any time, for them to be reading or ſinging: he hath it once or twice in that <hi>Pſalm, Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> In verſ. 5. <hi>And why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God for I ſhall yet praiſe him, for the helpe of his countenance. David</hi> had enough to quiet him, and that that he had had prevailed with his judgement, but after it had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his judgement he could not get it further. He could not get this grace of Contentment to go through the whole frame of the Soul. There is a great deal of ſtir ſometimes to get Contentment into their judgments, that is, To ſatisfie their judgment about their condition: Come to many, that the hand of God is upon perhaps in a grievous manner, and ſeek to ſatisfie them, and tel them that there is no ſuch cauſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, O not ſuch cauſe ſaith the troubled ſpirit! O then there is no cauſe that any ſhould be diſquieted; there was never any ſuch affliction as I have! and a hundred things they have to put off what is ſaid to them, ſo as you cannot ſo much as get into their judgments to ſatisfie them; but there is a great deal of hope of Contentment if once your judgments come to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that you can ſit down and ſay in your judgments, I ſee cauſe to be contented; but though you have gotten thus far, yet you may have much to do with your hearts afterward: for there is ſuch unrulineſſe in our thoughts and affections, that our judgments are not able alwaies to rule our thoughts and affections, and that makes me to ſay, That Contentment is an inward, quiet, gracious frame of Spirit, that is, the whol Soul, Judgment, Thoughts, Will, Affections and all are ſatisfied and quiet. I ſuppoſe in the very opening this, you begin to ſee it is a leſſon that you had need learn, and it is not a thing ſoon got, if Contentment be ſuch a thing as this is.</p>
            <p>The Second thing is this, which is very obſervable, <hi>That ſpiritual contentment comes from the frame of the Soul.</hi> A man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is contented in a right way, their Contentment doth not ſo much come from outward arguments, or any outward thing that helps them to be content, as it doth from the diſpoſition of their own hearts; It is the diſpoſition of their own hearts that cauſes this Contentment; that brings forth this gracious Contentment rather than any external thing that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58996:15"/>
doth it; as thus I would open my ſelf, one that is diſquieted, ſuppoſe a child, or man, or woman, if you come and bring them ſome great matter to pleaſe them, that perhaps will quiet them, and they will be contented; it is the thing you bring them that quiets them, but it is not the diſpoſition of their own ſpirits, not from any good temper that there is in their own hearts: but from ſome external thing that is brought them: but when a Chriſtian is contented in a right way, the quiet doth come more from the inward temper and diſpoſition of their own hearts than from any external arguments, or poſſeſſion of any thing in the world. I would yet open this further to you in this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. The being content upon ſome external thing, it is like the warming of a mans cloathes by the fire; but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by the inward diſpoſition of the ſoul, it is like the warmth that a mans cloathes hath from the natural heat of his body: A man that is of a healthful body, he puts on his cloathes, and perhaps when he puts them on at the firſt in a cold morning he feels his cloathes cold; but after he hath them on a little while, they are warm; why how come they warm? they came not nigh the fire: No, but it came from the natural heat of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now a ſickly man that hath his natural heat decayed, if he put on his cloathes cold, they will not be hot in a long time, but he muſt have them warmed by the fire, and then they will quickly be cold again; So this will difference the Contentments of men. There are ſome men now that are very gracious, and when an affliction comes upon them, indeed at firſt it ſeems to be a little cold, but after it hath been on a while, the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their hearts being gracious it makes their afflictions eaſie, and makes them to be quiet under it, and not to complain of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcontentment. But now you ſhall have others that have an affliction upon them, that have not this good temper in their hearts, their afflictions are very cold upon them and greivous; and it may be if you bring them ſome external arguments, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from without, as the fire that warms the cloathes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will be quiet for a while: but alas, wanting a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition within in their own hearts that warmth will not hold long. The warmth of the fire, that is, a Contentment that comes meerly from externall arguments will not hold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58996:15"/>
long, but that holds that doth come from the gracious temper of the Spirit. It is from the frame and the diſpoſition of the ſpirit of a man or woman, there's the true Contentment. But this we ſhall ſpeak too further in the opening of the <hi>Myſtery of Contentment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third thing is this, <hi>It is the frame of Spirit, that ſhews the habitualneſs of this grace of Contentment.</hi> Contentment is not meerly one act, a flaſh in a good mood; you ſhall have many men and women, that take them in ſome good mood and they will be very quiet; but this will not hold, this is not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way, there is not a conſtant tenour of their ſpirits to be holy and gracious under affliction: But I ſay, It is the quiet frame of ſpirit, by that I mean, The habitual diſpoſition of their Souls, that it is not only at this time, and the other time when you take men and women in a good mood, but it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour and temper of the heart; that is a Chriſtian that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, that in the conſtant tenour and temper of heart is contented, and can carry it's ſelf quietly in a conſtant way, or elſe it is worth nothing: for there is no body that is ſo furious in their diſcontent, but will be quiet in ſome good mood or other. Now Firſt it is a heart-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; Secondly, it is the heart-quiet; and then Thirdly, it is the frame of the heart.</p>
            <p>But Fourthly, <hi>It is the [gracious] frame of the heart.</hi> Indeed in Contentment there is a compoſition of all graces if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment be Spiritual, if it be truely Chriſtian, there is I ſay a compoſition of all Spiritual graces; As it is in ſome Oyls, there is a compoſition of a great many very precious ingredients: ſo in this grace of Contentment, which we ſhall yet further ſpeak of in the opening of the Excellency of it. But now the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame of Spirit is in oppoſition to Three things;</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>In oppoſition to the natural ſtilneſs that there is in many men and women.</hi> There is ſome of ſuch a natural conſtitution that makes them to be more ſtill and more quiet than others: others are of a violent and hot conſtitution, and they are more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly. <hi>In oppoſition to a ſturdy reſolution.</hi> As ſome men through the ſtrength of ſome ſturdy reſolution, they have not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58996:16"/>
ſeemed to be troubled let come what will come; and ſo it may be that through a ſturdy reſolution at ſome times they are not ſo much diſquieted as others are.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>In way of diſtinction, from the very ſtrength of reaſon</hi> (though not ſanctified) <hi>the ſtrength of natural reaſon may quiet the heart in ſome meaſure.</hi> But now I ſay, A gracious frame of ſpirit is not a meer ſtilneſſe of body through a natural conſtitution and temper, nor ſturdineſſe of reſolution, nor meerly through the ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, wherein is this graciouſneſs of Contentment diſtinguiſht from all theſe? More of this will be ſpoken to when we ſhew the myſtery of it, and the leſſons that are learned, but now we may ſpeak a little by way of diſtinction here, as now, From the natural ſtilneſſe of mens ſpirits, many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſuch a natural ſtilneſſe of ſpirit, and conſtitution of body, that you ſhall find them ſeldom diſquieted. But now mark theſe kind of people that are ſo, they likewiſe are very dull, of a dull ſpirit in any good thing, they have no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor livelineſſe of ſpirit in that which is good; but now mark where contentment of heart is gracious, the heart is very quick and lively in the ſervice of God, yea the more any gracious heart can bring its ſelf to be in a contented diſpoſition Oh the more fit it is for any ſervice of God, and is very active and lively in Gods ſervice, not dull in the ſervice of God: And as a Contented heart is very active and ſtirring in the work of God, ſo he is very active and ſtirring in ſanctifying Gods Name in the affliction that doth befall him: The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will appear very cleer thus, One that is of a ſtill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not diſquieted indeed as others, neither hath he any activeneſſe of ſpirit in ſanctifying the Name of God in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction; but now one that is content in a gracious way as he <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not diſquieted, but keep his heartt quiet in reſpect of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trouble, ſo on the other ſide he is not dull nor heavy but is very active to ſanctifie Gods Name in the affliction thas is upon him, for it is not enough meerly not to murmur, not to be diſcontented and troubled, but you muſt be active in the ſanctifying Gods Name in the affliction. And indeed this will diſtinguiſh it from the other, from a ſturdy reſolution, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58996:16"/>
will not be troubled: but though you have a ſturdy reſolution that you will not be troubled, is there a conſcionableneſſe in you to ſanctifie Gods Name in your affliction, and doth it come from thence? That is the main thing that brings the quiet of heart, and helps againſt diſcontentedneſſe in a gracious heart. I ſay the deſire and care that thy ſoul hath to ſanctifie Gods Name in an affliction, it is that that quiets the ſoul, which doth not in the other. Neither when it is meerly from reaſon: As <hi>Socrates</hi> it is ſaid of him (though he were but an heathen) that what ever befel him he would never ſo much as change his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and he got this power over his ſpirit meerly by ſtrength of reaſon and morallity: but now this gracious contentment comes from principles beyond the ſtrength of reaſon. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open that, (from whence it comes) till we come to open the myſtery of ſpiritual Contentment. I will only give you this one note of difference between a man and a woman that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in a natural way, and another that is contented in a ſpiritual way. Thoſe that are contented in a natural way, they overcome themſelves when outward afflictions doth befal them, they are contented, yea and they are contented as well when they commit ſin againſt God, either when they have outward croſſes or when God is diſhonoured it is all one, either when themſelves are croſt or when God is croſt; but now a gracious heart that is contented with it's own affliction, yet mightily ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when God is diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>The Fift is [<hi>Freely</hi>] <hi>freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe,</hi> it is a free work of the ſpirit: now there are four things to be opened in this freedom of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the heart is readily brought over, that that one doth freely there is no great ſtir to bring them to it; there are many men and women when their afflictions are grievous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with much adoe they are brought to be contented, a great deal of ſtir there is to quiet their hearts when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, yet at laſt perhaps they are brought to it, I but now this doth not come off freely: if I deſire a thing of another and I get it perhaps with much adoe, and a great deal of ſtir there is, but here's no freedom of ſpirit; but when a man is free in a thing do but mention it and preſently he comes off to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58996:17"/>
it. So if you have learned this art of Contentment, you will not only be contented after a great deal of do to quiet your hearts, but readily as ſoon as ever you do come to think that it is the hand of God, your heart preſently cloſeth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>freely, That is not by conſtraint,</hi> not patience by force (as we uſe to ſay.) As many will ſay that you muſt be content, this is the hand of God and there is no help for it; O this is too low an expreſſion for Chriſtians, yet when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come to viſit one another, they ſay friend or neighbour you muſt be content, this is to low an expreſſion for a Chriſtian, <hi>Muſt be content,</hi> no, readily, and freely I will be content. It is ſutable to my heart to yeild to God, and to be content, I find it is a thing that comes off of it ſelf, that my ſoul will be content. Oh you ſhould anſwer your friends ſo that come and tell you you muſt be content, nay I am willing to yeild to God, and I am freely content, that's the Second. And then a free act it comes after a rational way, that's freedom, that is, it doth not come through ignorance, becauſe I know no better condition, or that I know not what my affliction is, I but it comes through a ſanctified judgment, for that is the reaſon that no creature can do an act of freedom, but the rational creature, the liberty of action is only in rational creatures, and it comes from hence, for that's only freedom and out of liberty that's wrought in a rational way, as a natural freedom is when I by my judgment ſee what is to be done, underſtand the thing, and then there is a cloſing with what I do underſtand in my judgment, that is freely done; but now if a man doth a thing, and underſtands not what he doth, he cannot be ſaid to do it freely. So if men are contented, but it is becauſe they underſtand not what their affliction is, or becauſe they underſtand no better, this is not freely: as for inſtance, Suppoſe a Child born in a priſon and never in all his life went out, the Child is contented, why? Becauſe he never knew better, but this is no free act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation. But now for men and women that do know better, that know that the condition in which they are in it is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition, and a ſad condition, and yet they can bring their hearts to a Contentation out of a ſunctified judgment, this is freedom</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58996:17"/>Thirdly, <hi>This freedom it is in oppoſition to ſtupidneſs,</hi> for a man and woman may be contented meerly out of want of ſence, this is not free, as a man in a dead palſie that doth not feel you nip his fleſh, he is not freely patient; but if one ſhould have their fleſh nipt, and feel it, and yet for all that can be able to bridle themſelves, and do it freely, that is another matter. So it is here, many are contented meerly out of ſtupidneſſe, they have a dead palſie upon them; but now a gracious heart hath ſence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and yet is contented, and therefore is free.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Freely [ſubmitting] to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> Submitting to Gods diſpoſe, What is that? The word <hi>Submit,</hi> it ſignifies nothing elſe, but to ſend under; as thus, One that is diſcontented, the heart will be unruly, and would even get above God ſo far as diſcontentment prevailes; but now comes the grace of Contentment and ſends it under; to ſubmit, it is to ſend under a thing; now when the ſoul comes to ſee the unrulineſſe that there is in it, here's the hand of God that brings an affliction, and my heart is troubled and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; what ſaith the Soul? Wilt thou be above God? Is it not Gods hand, and muſt thy will be regarded more than Gods? O under, under, O thou ſoul get under, keep under, keep low, keep under Gods feet; thou art under Gods feet, and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, keep under the Authority of God, the Majeſty of God, the Soveraignity of God, the Power that God hath over thee: Keep under, that is to ſubmit; then the Soul can ſubmit to God when it can ſend it's ſelf under the Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Soveraignity, and Dominion that God hath over it; that is the Sixth Particular: Yea but that is not enough, yet you have not got to this Grace of Contentment, except in the next place you take.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Taking a [complacency] in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> That is thus, I am well pleaſed in what God doth, ſo far as I can ſee God in it, though as I ſaid, I may be ſenſible of the affliction, and may deſire that God in his due time would take it off, and uſe means to take it off; yet I may be well pleaſed ſo far as Gods hand is in it. To be well pleaſed with Gods hand, that is a higher degree than the other: and this comes from hence, not only becauſe I ſee that I ſhould be content in this affliction, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58996:18"/>
becauſe I ſee that there is good in this affliction. I find there is hony in this rock, and ſo I do not only ſay, I <hi>muſt,</hi> or I <hi>will</hi> ſubmit to Gods hand: no, but the hand of God is <hi>good</hi>; it is <hi>good that I am afflicted.</hi> That it is juſt that I am afflicted, that may be in one that is not truly contented; I may be convinced that God deals juſtly in this, God is righteous and juſt, and tis fit I ſhould ſubmit to what he hath done, O the Lord hath done righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in al his waies: but that is not enough, but thou muſt ſay Good is the hand of the Lord, the expreſſion of old <hi>Ely, Good is the word of the Lord,</hi> when it was a ſore &amp; hard word, that word that did threaten very grievous things to <hi>Ely</hi> and his houſe, and yet, Good is the word of the Lord, ſaith <hi>Ely.</hi> Perhaps ſome of you may ſay as <hi>David,</hi> It is good that I was afflicted; nay, you muſt come to ſay thus, <hi>It is good that I am afflicted.</hi> Not good when you ſee the good fruit that it hath wrought, but when you are afflicted to ſay, It is good that I am afflicted: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the affliction be, yet through the mercy of God my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a good condition; it is the top indeed, and the height of this art of Contentment to come to this pitch, to be able to ſay, Well, my condition and afflictions are thus and thus, and is very grievous and ſore, yet I am through Gods mercy in a good condition, and the hand of God is good upon me notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now I ſhould have given you divers Scriptures about this, I ſhall but give you one or two that are very remarkable; you will think this is a hard leſſon to come thus far, not only to be quiet, but to have a complacency in affliction. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.6. <hi>In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure, but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</hi> Here's a Scripture now that will ſhew that a gracious heart hath cauſe to ſay, it is in a good condition what ever it be. In the houſe of the Righteous is much Treaſure, his houſe, what houſe? it may be a poor Cottage, perhaps he hath ſcarce a ſtool to ſit on; perhaps he is fain to ſit upon a ſtump of wood, a piece of a block, inſtead of a ſtool; or perhaps he hath ſcarce a bed to lie upon, or a diſh to eat in; yet ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure: Let the righteous man be the pooreſt man in the world: It may be there are ſome that have come and taken all the goods out of his houſe for debt; perhaps his houſe is plundered and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58996:18"/>
all is gone, yet ſtill, <hi>In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure</hi>; the righteous man can never be brought to be ſo poor, to have his houſe rifled and ſpoiled, but there will remain much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within, if he hath but a diſh or a ſpoon or any thing in the world in his houſe, there will be much treaſure; ſo long as he is there, there is the preſence of God and the bleſſing of God upon him, and therein is much treaſure; but in the revenues of the wicked there is trouble: There is more treaſure in the pooreſt bodies houſe, if he be godly, than in the houſe of the greateſt man in the world, that hath his brave hangings, and brave wrought beds, and chairs, and couches, and cupbords of plate, and the like; what ever he hath, he hath not ſo much treaſure in it, as in the houſe of the pooreſt righteous ſoul; therefore in a verſe, or two after my text, no mervail though <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he) was Content, you ſhall ſee in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>But I have all, and abound, I am full.</hi> I have all: Alas poor man what had <hi>Paul</hi> that could make him ſay he had all; where was there ever man more afflicted than <hi>Paul</hi> was? many times he had not tatters to hang about his body, to cover his nakedneſſe, he had not bread to eat, he was often in nakedneſſe, and put in the ſtocks, and whipt and cruelly uſed, <hi>yet I have all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) for all that. Yea you ſhall have it in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. he profeſſes there, <hi>That he did poſſeſs all things, as ſorrowful, yet alwaies rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things,</hi> but mark what he ſaith, it is, <hi>As having nothing,</hi> but it is <hi>Poſſeſſing all things.</hi> He doth not ſay as poſſeſſing all things, but poſſeſſing all things; it is very little I have in the world, but yet poſſeſſing all things: So that you ſee a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath cauſe to take complacency in Gods hand, whatſoever his hand be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Eight thing in Contentment it is [In Gods diſpoſe] Submitting to and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> That is, the ſoul that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, looks up to God in all things; looks not down to the inſtruments or the means, as ſuch a man did it, and it was unreaſonableneſſe of ſuch and ſuch inſtruments, and the like barbarous uſage of ſuch and ſuch; but looks up to God; a contented heart looks to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſubmits to Gods diſpoſe, that is, ſees the wiſdom of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58996:19"/>
God in all, in his ſubmiſſion ſees his ſoveraignity, but that that makes him take complacency, it is Gods wiſdom; the Lord knows how to order things better than I, the Lord ſees further tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do, I ſee things but at preſent, but the Lord ſees a great whil hence, and how do I know but had it not been for this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I had been undone? I know that the love of God <hi>may as well ſtand with an afflicted eſtate, as with a proſperous eſtate</hi>; and ſuch kind of reaſonings there are in a contented ſpirit, ſubmitting unto the diſpoſe of God.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing is, <hi>This is in</hi> [<hi>every condition,</hi>] It may be in ſome things you could be content: You ſhall have many will ſay, if my affliction were but as the affliction of ſuch a one I could be content, yea but it muſt be in the preſent affliction that is upon you. We uſe to ſay, There is a great deal of deceit in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſals; in the general, come to any man or woman and ſay Will not you be content with Gods diſpoſe? Yes ſay they God forbid but we ſhould ſubmit to Gods hand what ever it be; you ſay thus in the general, it is an eaſie matter to learn this leſſon, but when it comes to the particular, when the croſſe comes ſore indeed, when it ſtriks you in the heavieſt croſſe that you think could befall you, what ſaith your heart now? Can you in every condition be content not onely for the matter, but for the time, that is to be in ſuch a condition ſo long as God would have you, to be content to be at Gods time in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to have ſuch an affliction ſo long as God would have the affliction abide upon you, to be willing to ſtay and not to come out of the affliction no ſooner than the Lord would have you come out of it? you are not content in your condition elſe; to be content meerly that I have ſuch a hand of God upon me, and not to ſtay under the hand of God, that is not to be content under every condition, but when I can find my heart ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Gods diſpoſe in ſuch particular afflictions that are very hard, and very greivous, and yet my heart is quiet, here is one that hath learned the leſſon of Contentment: Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition: That is the diſcription. Now in this there hath been Nine ſeveral things opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58996:19"/>1 Firſt, That Contentment is a heart-work within the ſoul. 2 Secondly, It is the quieting of the heart. 3 Thirdly, It is the frame of the ſpirit. 4 Fourthly, It is a gracious frame. 5 Fiftly, It is the free working of this gracious frame. 6 Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is in it a ſubmiſſion to God, ſending the ſoul under God. 7 Seventhly, There is a taking complacency in the hand of God. 8 Eightly, All to Gods diſpoſe. 9 Ninthly, In every condition, every condition though never ſo hard, though continue never ſo long: Now thoſe of you that have learned to be Content, have learned to attain unto theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things; the very opening of theſe things I hope may ſo far work upon your hearts as, Firſt, That you may lay your hands upon your hearts upon this that hath been ſaid, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry telling of you what the leſſon is, I fay may cauſe you to lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſay, Lord I ſee there is more in Chriſtian Contentation than I thought there was, and I have been far from learning this leſſon, I indeed have learned but my A B C in this leſſon of Contentment, I am but in the lower forme in Chriſts ſchool if I am in it at all; but theſe we ſhall ſpeak too more afterward; but the ſpecial thing I aim'd at in the opening of this point, is to ſhew how great a Myſtery there is in Chriſtian Contentment; and how many ſeveral leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be learned, that we may come to attain to this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſpoſition, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did attain too.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have made entrance (you may remember) into the Argument of <hi>Chriſtian Contentment.</hi> And have opened the words, and ſhewed you what this Chriſtian Contentation is; that it is, The inward, quiet, gracious frame of Spirit, freely ſubmitting too, and taking Complacency in Gods diſpoſe in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And therein came to this laſt thing, [<hi>In every condition</hi>] Now we ſhall a little in large that, and ſo proceed:</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Submitting to God in what ever Affliction befalls us: for the kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>For the time and continuance of the Affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>For the variety and changes of Affliction:</hi> Let them be what they will, yet there muſt be a ſubmitting to Gods diſpoſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the kind, Many men and women will in the general ſay, that they muſt ſubmit to God in affliction; I ſuppoſe now if you ſhould come from one end of this Congregation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpeak to every ſoul thus; Would not you ſubmit to Gods diſpoſe, in what ever condition he ſhould diſpoſe of you too; you would ſay, God forbid it ſhould be otherwiſe, but we uſe to ſay, <hi>There is a great deal of deceit in generals.</hi> In general you would ſubmit to any thing: but what if it be in this and that particular, that is moſt croſſe to you? Then any thing but that: we are uſually apt to think that any condition is better
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58996:20"/>
than the condition that God doth diſpoſe us too, now here is not Contentment; it ſhould not be only to any condition in general, but for the kind of the affliction, if it be that which is moſt croſſe to you. God (it may be) ſtriks you in your Child, Oh if it had been in my Eſtate ſaith one, I ſhould be content; perhaps he ſtriks you in your Match, Oh ſaith he I had rather have been ſtrucken in my health; and if he had ſtruck you in your health, Oh then if it had been in my trading I would not have cared; but we muſt not be our own carvers, what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular afflictions God ſhall diſpoſe us to, there muſt be Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There muſt be a ſubmiſſion to God in every affliction, for the time and continuance of the affliction.</hi> It may be ſaith one I could ſubmit and be content, but this affliction hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me a long time, a quarter of a year, a year, divers years, and I know not how to yeild and ſubmit to it, my patience is even worn and broke; yea it may be it is a ſpiritual affliction, you could ſubmit to God you ſay in any outward affliction, but not in a ſoul-affliction, or if it were an affliction upon the ſoul, trouble upon the heart, if it were the withdrawing of Gods face, yet if this had been but for a little time I could ſubmit; but ſeeking of God ſo long a time and yet God doth not appear, Oh how ſhall I bear this! We muſt not be our own diſpoſers for the <hi>time</hi> of deliverance no more than the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of deliverance, and I will give you a Scripture or two about this; That we are to ſubmit unto God for the time as well as the kind, in the latter end of the 1. Chap. of <hi>Ezek. When I ſaw it I fel upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that ſpake,</hi> (the Prophet was caſt down upon his face, but how long muſt he lie upon his face) <hi>And he ſaid vnto me, Son of man ſtand upon thy feet and I will ſpeak unto thee, and the Spirit entered into me, when he ſpake unto me and ſet me upon my feet. Ezekiel</hi> was caſt down upon his face, and there he muſt lie till God bid him ſtand up, yea and not only ſo, but till Gods Spirit came into him to enable him to ſtand up: So when God caſts us down, we muſt be content to lie till God bid us ſtand up, and Gods Spirit enter into us to enable us to ſtand up. So you know <hi>Noah</hi> he was put into the Ark, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he knew there was much affliction in the Ark, having all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58996:21"/>
kind of creatures ſhut up with him for twelve monthes together, it was a mighty thing, yet God ſhutting him up (though the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were aſſwaged) <hi>Noah</hi> was not to come out of the Ark til God bid him: So though we be ſhut up in great afflictions, and we may think there may be this and that and the other means to come out of that affliction, yet till God doth open the door we ſhould be willing to ſtay; God hath put us in, and God is to bring us out: As we reade in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> when they had ſhut him in Priſon and would have ſent for him out; Nay, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> they ſhut us in, let them come and fetch us out: So in a holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way ſhould a ſoul ſay, Well, this affliction that I am brought into, it is by the hand of God, and I am content to be here till God brings me out himſelf. God doth require it at our hands, that we ſhould not be willing to come out till he comes and fetches us out. In <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.10. you have a notable hiſtory there that may very well ſerve our purpoſe; we reade of the Prieſts, that the Prieſts bear the Ark and ſtood in the middeſt of Jordan; you know when the children of Iſrael went into the Land of Canaan they went through the River of Jordan: Now the going through the river Jordan was a very dangerous thing, only God bad them to go, they might have been afraid that the water might have come in upon them: but mark, it is ſaid, <hi>The Prieſt that bear the Ark ſtood in the middeſt of Jordan till every thing was finiſhed that the Lord commanded</hi> Joſhua <hi>to ſpeak unto the people, according to all that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded</hi> Joſhua, <hi>and the people haſted and paſſed over: and it came to paſs when all the people were clean paſſed over, that the Ark of the Lord paſſed over, and the Prieſts in the preſence of the people.</hi> Now it was Gods diſpoſe that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould paſſe over firſt, that they ſhould be ſafe upon the land; but the Prieſts they muſt ſtand ſtill till all the people be paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and then they muſt have leave to go, but they muſt ſtay till God would have them go, ſtay in all that danger; for certainly in reaſon and ſence there was a great deal of danger in ſtaying: for the text ſaith, the people haſted over, but the Prieſts they muſt ſtay till the people be gone, ſtay til God cals them out from that place of danger; and ſo many times it doth prove that God is pleaſed to diſpoſe of things ſo that the Miniſters muſt ſtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in danger than the people, and Magiſtrates and thoſe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58996:21"/>
place, which ſhould make people to be ſatisfied and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a lower condition that God hath put them into: Though your condition be low, yet you are not in that danger that thoſe are in that are in a higher condition; God cals them in publick place to ſtand longer in the gap and place of danger than other people, but we muſt be content to ſtay even in Jordan till the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to call us out.</p>
               <p>And then for the variety of our condition, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the particular affliction, and the time and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances about the affliction; for ſometimes the circumſtances are greater afflictions than the afflictions themſelves: And for the variety, if God will exerciſe us with various afflictions one after another: As that hath been very obſervable even of late, that many that have been plundered and come away, afterwards have fallen ſick and died: They have fled for their lives and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the plague hath come among them, and if not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction it may be ſome other affliction, it is very rare that one affliction comes alone, commonly afflictions are not ſingle things but they come one upon the neck of another; it may be God ſtrikes one in his eſtate, then in his body, then in his name, wife or child or dear friend, and ſo it comes in a various way it is the way of God ordinarily (you may find it by experience) that ſeldom one affliction comes alone, now this is hard when one affliction followes after another, when there is a variety of afflictions, when there is a mighty change in a condition, up and down, this way, and that way; there indeed is the tryal of a Chriſtian; there muſt be ſubmiſſion to Gods diſpoſe in them. I remember it is ſaid even of <hi>Cato</hi> that was a Heathen, that no man ſaw him to be changed, though he lived in a time when the Common-wealth was ſo often changed, yet it is ſaid of him, he was the ſame ſtill though his condition was changed, and he ran through variety of conditions. Oh that it could be ſaid ſo of many Chriſtians, that though their conditions be changed yet that nobody could ſee <hi>them</hi> changed, they are the ſame. Look what gracious ſweet and holy temper they were in before, that they are in ſtill: thus we are to ſubmit to the diſpoſe of God in every condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, This that you ſpeake of is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58996:22"/>
if we could attain to it, but is it poſſible for one to attain to this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is if you get skill in the Art of it, you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it, and it will prove to be no ſuch difficult thing to you neither, if you underſtand but the myſtery of it; as there's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that men do in their callings, that if a country man comes and ſees, he thinks it a mighty hard thing, and that he ſhould never be able to do it, but that's becauſe he underſtands not the art of it, there is a turning of the hand ſo as you may do it with eaſe. Now that's the buſineſs of this exerciſe, to open unto you the art and myſtery of Contentment: What way a Chriſtian comes to Contentment, there is a great Myſterie and art in it, by that hath been opened to you there will appear ſome myſtery and art, as that a man ſhould be content with his affliction and yet throughly ſenſible of his affliction too, to be throughly ſenſible of an affliction, and to endeavour the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it by all lawful means, and yet to be content, there's a myſtery in that, how to joyne theſe two together to be ſenſible of an affliction as much as that man or woman that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I am ſenſible of it as fully as they, and I ſeek waies to be delivered from it as well as they, and yet ſtill my heart abides content, this is I ſay a myſtery that is very hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a carnal heart; but grace doth teach ſuch a mixture, doth teach us how to make a mixture of ſorrow and a mixture of joy together; and that makes Contentment, the mingling of joy and ſorrow, of gracious joy and gracious ſorrow together, grace teaches us how to moderate and to order an affliction ſo as there ſhall be a ſence of it, and yet for all that Contentment under it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are divers things further for the opening of the Myſtery of </hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</p>
               <p>The Firſt Thing therefore is this, <hi>To ſhew that there is a great myſtery in it.</hi> One that is contented in a Chriſtian way it may be ſaid of him that he is the moſt <hi>contented</hi> man in the world, and yet the moſt <hi>unſatisfied</hi> man in the world, theſe two together muſt needs be myſterious, I ſay a contented man as he is the moſt contented ſo he is the moſt unſatisfied of any man in the world. You never learned the myſtery of contentment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58996:22"/>
it may be ſaid of you that as you are the moſt contented man ſo you are the moſt unſatisfied man in the world.</p>
               <p>You will ſay how is that? A man that hath learned the art of Contentment is the moſt contented with any low condition that he hath in the world, and yet he cannot be ſatisfied with the injoyment of all the world, and yet he is contented if he hath but a cruſt, but bread and water, that is if God diſpoſes of him for the things of the world to have but bread and water for his preſent condition, he can be ſatisfied with Gods diſpoſe in that, yet if God ſhould give unto him Kingdoms and Empiers, all the world to rule, if he ſhould give it him for his portion he would not be ſatisfied with that, here's the myſtery of it, though his heart be ſo inlarged as the injoyment of all the world and ten thouſand worlds cannot ſatisfie him for his portion; yet he hath a heart quieted under Gods diſpoſe, if he gives him but bread and water, to joyn theſe two together, this muſt needs be a great art and myſtery. Though he be contented with God in a little, yet thoſe things that would content other men will not content him; The men of the world they ſeek after eſtates, and think if they had thus much, and thus much, they would be content, they aime at no great matters; but if I had (perhaps ſome man thinks) but two or three hundred a year, then I ſhould be well enough; If I had but a hundred a year, or a thouſand a year (ſaith another) then I ſhould be ſatisfied: but ſaith a gracious heart, If he had ten hundred thouſand times ſo much a year, it would not ſatisfie him, if he had the quinteſcence of all the excellencies of all the creatures in the world, it could not ſatisfie him, and yet this man can ſing, and be merry, and joyfull when he hath but a cruſt of bread and a little water in the world: Surely Religion is a great myſtery, great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, not only in the Doctrinal part of it, but in the Practical part of it alſo. Godlineſs teacheth us this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Not to be ſatisfied with all the world for our portion, and yet to be content with the meaneſt condition in which we are. As <hi>Luther,</hi> when he had great gifts ſent him from Dukes and Princes, he refuſed it, and ſaith he, I did vehemently proteſt God ſhould not put me off ſo; 'tis not that which will content me: A little in the world will content a Chriſtian for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58996:23"/>
Marke, here lies the Myſtery of it, A little in the world will Content a Chriſtian for his paſſage, but all the world and ten thouſand times more will not Content a Chriſtian for his <hi>portion</hi>: Now a carnal heart will be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with theſe things of the world for his portion; and there is the differnce between a Carnal heart and a Gracious heart: But ſaith a gracious heart, Lord do with me what thou wilt for my paſſage through this world, I will be content with that, but I cannot be content with all the world for my portion: ſo there is the myſtery of true Contentation. A contented man though he be moſt contented with the leaſt things in the world; yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man that lives in the world. That Soul that is capable of God, can be filled with nothing elſe but God; nothing but God can fill a ſoul that is capable of God: though a gracious heart knows that it is capable of God, and was made for God; Carnal hearts think of no reference to God, but a gracious heart being inlarged to be capable of God, and injoying ſomewhat of him, nothing in the world can fill a gracious heart, it muſt be only God himſelf; and therefore you ſhall obſerve, That let God give what he will to a gracious heart, a heart that is godly, except he gives Himſelf, it will not do; a godly heart will not only have the mercy, but the God of that mercy as well as its ſelf, and then a little matter is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the world, ſo be it he hath the God of that mercy he doth injoy; In <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7.9. I ſhall need go no further to ſhew a notable Scripture for this, Compare verſ. 7. with verſ. 9. <hi>And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The peace of God ſhall keep your hearts. Then in verſ. 9. <hi>Thoſe things which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you, The peace of God ſhall keep you, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> This is that that I would obſerve from this Text, That the peace of God is not enough to a gracious heart except it may have the God of that peace. A carnall heart could be ſatisfied if he might but have outward peace, though it be not the peace of God; peace in the State and his trading would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him: But mark how a Godly heart goes beyond a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, all outward peace is not enough, but I muſt have the peace
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58996:23"/>
of God: But ſuppoſe you have the peace of God, Will not that quiet you? No, I muſt have the God of peace, as the peace of God ſo the God of peace, that is, I muſt injoy that God that gives me the peace, I muſt have the cauſe as well as the effect; I muſt ſee from whence my peace comes, and injoy the fountain of my peace, as well as the ſtream of my peace; and ſo in other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have I health from God, I muſt have the God of my health to be my portion, or elſe I am not ſatisfied: It is not life, but the God of my life; it is not riches, but the God of thoſe riches that I muſt have, the God of my preſervation, as well as my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; a gracious heart is not ſatisfied without this, To have the God of the mercy, as well as the mercy. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and there is none upon the earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> It is nothing in heaven or earth, can ſatisfie me, but thy ſelf; if God give thee not only earth but heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt rule over Sun, Moon, and ſtars, and have the rule over the higheſt of the ſons of men, it would not be enough to ſatisfie thee, except thou hadeſt God himſelf; There lies the firſt myſtery of Contentment; &amp; truly a contented man, though he be the moſt contented man in the world, yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man in the world, that is, Thoſe things that will ſatisfie the world, will not ſatisfie him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this Myſtery in Chriſtian Contentation. <hi>A Chriſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by way of addition, as by way of Subſtraction,</hi> that is his way of Contentment, and that is a way that the world hath no skill in. I open it thus, Not ſo much by the adding to what he would have, or to what he hath, not by adding more to his condition, but rather by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting of his deſires, and ſo to make his deſires and conditon to be even and equal. A carnal heart knows no way to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented but this, I have ſuch and ſuch an eſtate, and if I had this added to it, and the other comfort added that now I have not, then I ſhould be Contented; it may be I have loſt my eſtate, if I could have but that given to me ſo as to make up my loſſe, then I ſhould be a contented man: But now Contentmet doth not come in that way, it comes not in I ſay by the adding to what thou wanteſt, but by the ſubſtracting of thy deſires; it is all one to a Chriſtian, either that I may get up unto what I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58996:24"/>
would have, or get my deſires down to what I have; either that I may attain to what I do deſire, or bring down my deſires to what I have already attained; my eſtate is the ſame, for it is as ſutable to me to bring my deſire down to my condition, as it is to raiſe up my condition to my deſire. Now I ſay a heart that hath no grace, and is not inſtructed in this Myſtery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, knows no way to get Contentment, but to have his eſtate raiſed up to his deſires; but the other hath another way to Contentment, that is, He can bring his deſires down to his eſtate, and ſo he doth attain to his Contentment. So the Lord faſhions the hearts of the Children of men: Now if the heart of a man be faſhioned to his condition, he may have as much contentment as if his condition be faſhioned to his heart; ſome men have a mighty large heart, but they have a ſtraight condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they can never have Contentment when their hearts are big and their condition is little; but now though a man cannot bring his condition to be as big as his heart, yet if he can bring his heart to be as little as his condition, to bring them even, from thence is Contentment. The world is infinitly deceived in this, To think that Contentment lies in having more than they have; here lies the bottom and root of all Contentment, when there is an evenneſſe and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our hearts and our conditions; and that is the reaſon that many that are godly men that are in a low condition live more ſweet and comfortable lives than thoſe that are richer: Contentment is not alwaies cloathed with ſilk, and purple, and velvets, but Contentment is ſometimes in a ruſſet ſure, in a mean condition as well as in a higher; and many men that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have had great eſtates, and God hath brought them into a lower condition, they have had more Contentment in that condition than the other: Now how can that poſſible be? Thus eaſily, For if you did but underſtand the root of Contentment, it conſiſts in the ſutableneſſe and proportion of the ſpirit of a man to his eſtate, and the evenneſs, when one end is not longer and bigger than another; the heart is contented, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that condition; now let God give a man never ſo great riches, yet if the Lord gives him up to the pride of his heart, he will never be contented: But now, let God bring any one into
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58996:24"/>
a mean condition, and then let God but faſhion and ſute his heart to that condition and he will be content. As now in a mans going, Suppoſe a man had a mighty long leg, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leg were ſhort, why though one of his legs be longer than ordinary yet he could not go ſo well as a man that hath both his legs ſhorter than he. I compare a long leg, when one is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than another, to a man that hath a high condition, and is very rich, and a great man in the world, but he hath a great proud heart too, and that is longer and larger than his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: now this man cannot but be troubled in his condition: Now another man that is in a mean condition, his condition is low, and his heart is low too; ſo that his heart and his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both even together, and this man goes on with more eaſe abundantly than the other doth: So that now a gracious heart works after this manner, The Lord hath been pleaſed to bring down my condition, now if the Lord bring down my heart and make it even with my condition, then I am well enough: And ſo when God brings down his condition, he doth not ſo much labour to raiſe up his condition again as to bring down his heart to his condition: The Heathens themſelves they had a little glimps of this; they could ſay, That the beſt riches that is, it is the poverty of deſires: that is a ſpeech of a Heathen, that is, If a man or woman have their deſires cut ſhort, and have no large deſires, that man and woman they are rich when they can bring their deſires to be but low: So this is the Art of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Not to ſeek to adde to our conditions, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from our deſires. Another hath this, The way to be rich, ſaith he, it is not by increaſing of wealth, but by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our deſires; for certainly that man or woman is a rich man or woman that hath their deſires ſatisfied; now a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man hath his deſires ſatisfied, God ſatisfies his deſires, that is, all conſidered, he is ſatisfied in his condition for the preſent to be the beſt condition, and ſo he comes to this Contentment by way of Subſtraction, and not Addition.</p>
               <p>The Third thing in the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by getting off his burden that is upon him, as by the adding another burden to him</hi>; this is a way that fleſh and blood hath little skilll in. You will ſay how is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58996:25"/>
this? In this manner, art thou afflicted, and is there a great load and burden upon thee by reaſon of thy affliction? thou thinkeſt there is no way in the world to get Contentment, but, O that this burden were but off, O it is a heavy load, and few know what a burden I have! What doeſt thou think there is no way for the Contentment of thy ſpirit but this getting off thy burden? O thou art deceived, the way of Contentment is to adde another burden, that is, labour to load and burden thy heart with thy ſin, and the heaviour the burden of thy ſin is to thy heart, the lighter will the burden of thy affliction be to thy ſoule, and ſo ſhalt thou come to be Content: If thy burden were lightened that would content thee, thou thinkeſt there is no way to lighten it but to get it off, but thou art deceived, for if thou canſt get thy heart to be more burdened with thy ſin; thou wilt be leſſe burdened with thy afflictions: You will ſay this is a ſtrange way, for a man or woman to get eaſe to their condition, when they are burdened, to lay a greater burden upon them? You think there is no other way when you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but to be jolly and merry, and get into company, Oh no, you are deceived, your burden will come again, alas this is a poor way to get his ſpirit quieted, poor man, the burden will be upon him again; but if thou wouldeſt have thy burden light, if thou canſt get alone and examine thy heart for thy ſin, and charge thy ſoul with thy ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n: if thy burden be in thy eſtate, for the abuſe of it, or if it be a burden upon thy body, for the abuſe of thy health, and ſtrength, and the abuſe of any mercies that now the Lord hath taken away from thee, thou haſt not honoured God with thoſe mercies that thou haſt had, but thou haſt walked wantonly and careleſly; and ſo fall a bemoning thy ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n before the Lord, and thou ſhalt quickly find the burden of thy affliction to be lighter than it was before; do but try this piece of skill and art, to get your ſouls contented with any low condition that God puts you into; many times in a family, when any affliction befals them, Oh what a deal of diſcontentment is there between man and wife, if croſt in their eſtates at Land, or ill news from Sea, or thoſe that they truſted are broke and the like, and perhaps ſomwhat in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily fals croſſe between man and wife, or in reference to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58996:25"/>
children or ſervants, and there is nothing but brabling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content among them, now they many times are burdened with their own diſcontent, and perhaps will ſay one to another, this life is very uncomfortable for us to live thus diſcontented ſo as we do; but have you ever tried this way, the husband and the wife? have you ever got alone and ſaid, Come, Oh let us go and humble our ſouls before God together, let us go into our chamber and humble our ſouls before God for our ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have abuſed thoſe mercies that God hath taken away from us, and we have provok'd God againſt us, Oh let us charge our ſelves with our ſin, and be humbled before the Lord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have you tried ſuch a way as this is? Oh you would find the cloud would be taken away, and the Sun would ſhine in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and you would have a great deal more Conntentment than ever yet you had: If a mans eſtate be broken, either by plunderers, or any other way; now how ſhall this man have Contentment? how? By the breaking of his heart, God hath broken thy eſtate, Oh ſeek to him for the breaking of thy heart likewiſe; Indeed a broken eſtate, and a whole heart, a hard heart, will not joyn together, there will be no Contentment; but a broken eſtate, and a broken heart, will ſo ſute together, as there will be more Contentment than there was before; adde therefore to the breaking of thy eſtate, the breaking of thy heart what thou canſt, and that is the way to be Contented in a Chriſtian manner, which is the Third Myſtery in Chriſtian Contentation.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is this, <hi>It is not ſo much the removing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that is upon us, as the changing of the affliction, the Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing of the affliction, when it is quite turned and changed into another thing:</hi> I meane in regard of the uſe of it, though for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the affliction abide ſtil. The way of Contentment to a carnal heart it's only the removing of the affliction, Oh that it may be gone; no but ſaith a gracious heart, God hath taught me a way for Contentment though the affliction ſhall continue ſtill for the matter of it; but there is a vertue of grace to turn this affliction into good; it takes away but only the ſting and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; As now, Suppoſe poverty, A mans eſtate is loſt; well, is there no way to be contented till your eſtate be made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58996:26"/>
up again? Till your poverty be removed? Yes, certainly Chriſtianity would teach Contentment, though poverty conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues yet it will teach you how to turn your poverty to ſpiritual riches; that you ſhall be poor ſtill for your outward eſtate; but this ſhall be altered, whereas before it was once a natural evil to you, it comes now to be turned into a ſpiritual benefit to you; and ſo you come to be content. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> Even <hi>poverty it's ſelf it is riches unto holy men</hi>: Godly men do make their poverty turn to be riches, they get more riches out of their poverty then ever they get out of their revenues, out of all their trading in this world they never had ſuch incomes as they have had out of their poverty; this a carnall heart will think ſtrange that a man ſhall make poverty to be the moſt gainfull trade that ever he had in the world; I am perſwaded that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians have found it ſo, that they have got more good by their poverty than ever they got by all their riches, you find it in Scripture, therefore think not this ſtrange that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, you do not find any one Godly man that came out of an affliction worſe than when he came into it, though for a while he was ſhaken, yet at laſt he was better for an affliction; but a great many Godly men you find have been worſe for their proſperity, ſcarce one Godly man that you reade in Scripture of but was worſe for proſperity (except <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> I do not reade of any hurt they got by their proſperity that they had) ſcarce (I think) is any one example of any Godly man, but was rather worſe for his proſperity than better; ſo that you ſee it's no ſuch ſtrange thing, neither to one that is gracious that they ſhall get good by their affliction: <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his Comment upon the 5. Chap. of the <hi>Galatians</hi>; in the 17. verſe in his Comment upon that place ſaith, <hi>A Chriſtian becometh a mighty worker and a wonderful creator,</hi> that is (ſaith he) to create out of heavineſſe joy, out of terrour comfort, out of ſin righteouſneſſe, out of death life, and brings light out of darkneſſe. It was Gods prerogative and great power, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating power to command the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe; now a Chriſtian is partaker of the divine nature, ſo the ſcripture ſaith, Grace it is part of the Divine Nature, and being part of the Divine Nature it hath an impreſſion of Gods Omnipotent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58996:26"/>
power that is, to create light out of darkenſſe, to being good out of evill, now by this way a Chriſtian comes to be content. God hath given a Chriſtian ſuch a vertue, as can turn affliction into mercyes, can turn darkeneſſe into light; if a man had the power that Chriſt had when the water pots were fil'd, he could by a word turn the water into wine; if you that have nothing but water to drink, yet if you had a power to turn it into wine then you may be contented: Certainly a Chriſtian hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this power from God, to work thus miraculouſly; it is the nature of grace to turn water into wine, that is, to turn the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your affliction, into the wine of heavenly conſolation. If you underſtand this in a carnal way, I know it will be redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous for a Miniſter to ſpeak thus before you, and many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal people are ready to make ſuch expreſſions as theſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, underſtanding them in a carnal way: Juſt as <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> in the 3. of <hi>John, What can a man be born when he is old, can be enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be born?</hi> So when we ſpeak of grace that it can turn water into wine, and turn poverty into riches, and make poverty a gainful trade, ſaith a carnal heart, Let them have that trade if they will, and let them have water to drink, and ſee if they can turn it into wine: Oh take heed thou ſpeakeſt not in a ſcornful way of the waies of God; grace hath the power to turn afflictions into mercies. Two men ſhall have one affliction, and to one man it ſhall be as gall and wormwood, and it ſhall be wine, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and delightfulneſs, and joy, and advantage, and riches, to another. This is the myſtery of Contentment, not ſo much by removing the evil, as by Metamorphoſing the evil by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the evil into good.</p>
               <p>The Fifth thing is this, <hi>A Chriſtain comes to this Contentment by making up the wants of his condition, by the performance of the work of his condition.</hi> This is the way of Contentment. There is ſuch a condition that I am in, many wants, I want this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort, well, how ſhall I come to be ſatisfied and content? A carnal heart thinks this, I muſt have my wants made up or elſe it is impoſſible that I ſhould be content: No, but ſaith a gracious heart, What is the duty of the condition God hath put me into? Indeed my condition is changed, I was not long
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58996:27"/>
ſince in a proſperous condition, but God hath changed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: the Lord hath called me no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah</hi>; Now what am I to do? what can I think now, are thoſe duties that God requires of me in the condition that he hath now put me into? and let me put forth my ſtrength, in the performance of the duties of my preſent condition. Others they ſpend their thoughts in thoſe things that ſhall diſturb and diſquiet them, and ſo they grow more and more diſcontented; yea, but let me ſpend my thoughts in thinking what my duty is, what is the duty of my preſent condition which I am in: O ſaith a man whoſe condition is changed and he hath loſt his eſtate, Had I but my eſtate as I had heretofore, how would I uſe it to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! But God hath made me to ſee that I did not honour him with my eſtate as I ought to have done: Oh had I it again, I would do better than ever I did! but this may be but a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore you ſhould rather think, What doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me in the condition I am now brought into? And thou ſhouldeſt labour to bring thy heart to quiet and Contentnent, by ſetting thy ſoul on work about the duties of thy preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And the truth is, I know nothing more available for the quieting of a Chriſtian Soul, and getting Contentment then this, The ſetting thy heart on work about the duties of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſent condition that now thou art in, and take heed of thy thoughts about other conditions as a meer temptation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compare the folly of men and women that think to get Contentment with their muſing about other conditions better than to the way of Children; perhaps they are gotten upon a hill, and they look a good way off and ſee another hill, and they think if they were on the top of that, then they were able to touch the clouds with their fingers; but when they are on the top of that hill; alas then they are as far from the clouds, as they were before: So it is with many that think, If they were in ſuch a condition, then I ſhould have Contentment; and perhaps they get into that condition, then they are as far from Contentment as before: But then they think if they were in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother condition, they would be contented, and then when they have got into that condition, they are ſtil as far from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as before. No, no, let me conſider what is the duty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58996:27"/>
of my preſent condition, and content my heart with this, and ſay, Well, though I am in a low condition, yet I am ſerving the counſels of God in that condition wherein I am; it is the counſel of God that hath brought me into this condition that I am in, and I deſire to ſerve the counſel of God in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is a notable Scripture concerning <hi>David,</hi> it is ſaid of him, That he ſerved his Generation, after <hi>David</hi> had ſerved his Generation according to the will of God, then he ſlept. It is a Speech of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning him, in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. So it is in your books, <hi>After he had ſerved his generation according to the will of God</hi>: But now the word that is tranſlated <hi>will,</hi> it is the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God,</hi> and ſo it may be tranſlated as well, <hi>That after</hi> David <hi>in his generation had ſerved Gods counſel, then he fell aſleep.</hi> We or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily take the words thus, That <hi>David ſerved his generation</hi>; that is, He did the work of his generation, that is to ſerve a mans generation. But it is more plain, if you reade it thus, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>David</hi> in his generation had ſerved the Counſell of God, then <hi>David</hi> fell aſleep. O that ſhould be the care of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to ſerve out Gods Counſels. What is the Counſel of God? The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I am in, God doth put me into it by his own Counſel, the Counſel of his own will; Now I muſt ſerve Gods Counſel in my generation, look what is the Counſel of God in my condition, I muſt look to ſerve that; and ſo I ſhall have my heart quieted for the preſent, and ſhall live and die peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and comfortably, if I be carefull to ſerve Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p>A Sixt thing in the myſtery of Contentment is this, <hi>A gracious heart is contented by the melting of his will and deſires into Gods will and deſires,</hi> by this means he gets Contentment; and this is a myſtery to a carnal heart. It is not by having his own deſires ſatisfied as before, but by melting his will and deſires into Gods will: So that he comes to have (in one ſenſe) his deſires ſatisfied though he hath not the thing that before he did deſire, yet he comes to be ſatisfied in this, becauſe he makes his will to be all one with Gods will. This is a little higher degree than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the will of God. You all ſay, you ſhould ſubmit to Gods will; but a Chriſtian hath gotten beyond this; that is, he can make Gods will and his to be the ſame: So it is ſaid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58996:28"/>
of beleevers, that they are joyned to the Lord, and are one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, look what Gods will is, I do not only ſee reaſon to ſubmit to it, but Gods will is my will: When the ſoul can make over (as it were) it's will to God, it muſt needs then have Contentment. Others would fain get the thing they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, O but ſaith a gracious heart, that that God would have, I would have too, I will not only yeild to it, but I would have it too; a gracious heart hath learned this art, not only to make the commanding will of God to be it's own will, that is, what God commands me to do I will do it, but to make the providential will of God, and the opperative will of God to be his will too: God commands this thing, which perhaps you that are Chriſtians may have ſome skill in, but whatſoever God works, you muſt will as well as what God commands, you muſt make Gods providential will, and his opperative will, as well your will, as Gods will, and ſo you muſt come to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; here a Chriſtian makes over his will to God, and in making over his will to God, he hath no other will but only Gods; as ſuppoſe a man makes over his debt to another man, if that man that I owe the debt to, be ſatisfied and contented, I am ſatisfied becauſe I have made it over to him, and I need not be diſcontented and ſay, my debt is not payd, and I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, yes, you are ſatisfied, for he that you made over your debt to, he is ſatisfied: Juſt thus it is for all the world between God and a Chriſtian, a Chriſtian heart makes over his will to God, now then if Gods will be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, for I have then no will of mine own, it is melted into the will of God, for ſo that is the excellency of grace, grace doth not only ſubject the will to God, but it doth melt the will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods will, ſo that they are now but one will; what a ſweet ſatisfaction muſt the ſoul have then in this condition, when all is made over to God; You will ſay this is hard? I will expreſs it a little more: A gracious heart muſt needs have ſatisfaction this way, becauſe godlineſs doth teach him this, to ſee that his good is more in God than in himſelf, the good of my life, and comforts, and my happineſſe, and my glory, and my riches is more in God than it is in my ſelf; (that perhaps we may ſpeak too further, when we come to the leſſons that are to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58996:28"/>
learned.) But upon this it is, that a gracious heart hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he doth melt his will into Gods, for ſaith he, if God have glory, I have glory, Gods glory is my glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods will is mine, if God have riches, then I have riches, if God be magnified, then I am magnified, if God be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, Gods wiſdom and holineſſe is mine, and therefore his will muſt needs be mine, and my will muſt needs be his; here is the art of a Chriſtians Contentment, he melts his will into the will of God, and makes over his will to God, <hi>Oh Lord thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance for us. Pſal.</hi> 73.</p>
               <p>The Seventh thing in the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>The Myſtery conſiſts not ſo much by bringing any thing without, to make my condition more comfortable, as to purge out ſomething that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> The men of the world now, when they would have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and want any thing, Oh they muſt have ſomewhat from without to content them; but ſaith a godly man, let me get ſomthing out that is in already, and then I ſhall come to Contentment; As ſuppoſe a man hath an aguiſh humour that makes his drink taſte bitter, now ſaith he, You muſt put ſome ſugar into my drink, and his wife puts in ſome, and yet the drink taſtes bitter, Why? Becauſe the bitterneſſe comes from a bitter cholerick humour within; but let the Phyſitian come and give him a bitter potion to purge out the bitterneſſe that is within, and then he can taſte his drink well enough: Juſt thus it is with the men of the world, Oh ſuch a condition is bitter, and if I could have ſuch and ſuch a mercy added, to this mercy, then it would be ſweet; now if God ſhould put a ſpoonful or two of ſugar in, it would be bitter ſtill. But the way to Contentment is to purge out thy luſts and bitter hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence are wars, and ſtrifs, are they not from your luſts that are within you?</hi> they are not ſo much from things without, but from within; as ſometimes I have ſaid, it is not all the ſtorms that are abroad that can make an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, but the vapours that are got within: and ſo if thoſe luſts that are within, in thy heart, if they were got out, thy condition would be a contented condition. Theſe are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious waies of godlineſſe, that the men of the world never think of; when dideſt thou ever think of ſuch a way as this is,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58996:29"/>
for to go and purge out the diſtempers of thy heart that are within: Here are Seaven particulars now named, there were a great many more that I had thought of, and now without the underſtanding of theſe things, and the practice of them, you will never come to a true Contentation in your way, Oh you will be bunglers in this trade of Chriſtianity; but the right perceiving of theſe things, will help you to be inſtructed in it as in a Myſtery.</p>

of, in a ſecret way is a Chriſtian fed by the dew of the bleſſing of God, a poor man or woman that hath but a little which hath grace, lives a more contented life than his rich neighbour that hath a great deal coming in, we find it ſo ordinarily, ſo that though they have but a little, yet they have a ſecret bleſſing of God going in it, that they are not able to expreſſe to any other man; if you would come to them and ſay; How comes it that you live ſo comfortably as you do? they are not able to tell you what they have, but they find there is a ſweetneſſe in what they do injoy, and they know this by experience that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſuch ſweetneſſe in former times, that though they had more plenty in former times than now they have, yet they know they had not ſuch ſweetneſſe; but how this comes they cannot tell; and we may ſhew ſome particulars, even in that godly men do enjoy, that make their condition to be ſweet.</p>
               <p>As now, Take theſe four or five particulars that godly men finds Contentment in what he hath, though it be never ſo little.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe in what he hath, he hath the love of God,</hi> he hath Gods love to him in what he hath: If a King ſhould ſend a piece of meat from his own table, it is a great deal more comfortable to a Courrier than if he had twenty diſhes at ordinary allowance, if the King ſend but any little thing and ſay, Go and carry this to ſuch a man as a token of my love, Oh how delightful is that unto him? are your husbands at Sea and ſend you a token of their love, it is more than forty times ſo much that you have in your houſes already: Every good thing the people of God do injoy, they injoy it in Gods love, as a token of Gods love, and coming from Gods eternal love unto them, and this muſt needs be very ſweet unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What they have it is ſanctified to them for good</hi>; Other men have what they injoy in a way of common providence, but the Saints in a ſpecial way; Others have what they have and there is all, they have meate, and drink, and houſes, and cloaths, and money and that's all. But a gracious heart finds content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, I have it, and I have a ſanctified uſe of it too; I find God going along with what I have to draw my heart neerer to him, and ſanctifie my heart to him: If I find my heart drawn
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58996:30"/>
nearer to God by what I injoy; it's more a great deal than if I have it without any ſanctifying my heart by it; there's a ſecret dew that goes along with it, there's the dew of Gods love in it, and the dew of ſanctification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A gracious heart what he hath he hath it upon free-coſt, he is not like to be called to pay for what he hath</hi>: The difference between what a godly man hath; and a wicked man is in this: A godly man is as a child in an Inne; an In-keeper hath his child in his houſe, and the Father provides his dyet, and lodging, and what is fit for him; Now there comes a ſtranger, and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath dinner and ſupper provided, and lodging, but the ſtranger muſt pay for all; it may be the childs fare is meaner than the fare of the ſtranger, the ſtranger hath boyld, and roſt and baked; but he muſt pay for it, there muſt come a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for it. Juſt thus it is, many of Gods people have but mean fare; but God as a father provides it, and it is on free-coſt, and they muſt not pay for what they have, it is paid for before; but the wicked in all their pomp, and pride, and bravery, they have what they call for, but there muſt come a reckoning for all, they muſt pay for all in the concluſion, and is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a little upon free coſt, than to come to have all to pay for? Grace doth ſhew a man that what he hath, he hath it on free coſt, from God as from a Father, and therefore muſt needs be very ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A godly man may very well be content, though he hath but little, <hi>For what he hath he hath it by right of Jeſus Chriſt, by the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he hath a right to it, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of right to what he hath, than any wicked man can have to what he hath; a wicked man hath theſe outward things; I do not ſay they are uſurpers of what they have, but they have a right to it, and that before God, but how? it is a right by meer donation, that is, God by his free bounty doth give it to them; but the right that the Saints have, it is a right of purchaſe, it is paid for, and it is their own, and they may in a holy manner, and holy way, challenge whatſoever they have need of. We cannot expreſs the right of a holy man, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his right, and the right of the wicked more fully than by this ſimilitude; a Malefactor that is condemned to die,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58996:30"/>
yet he hath by favour granted to him his ſupper provided over night, and you cannot ſay though the Malefactor hath forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his right to all things, to every bit of bread, yet if he ſhall have a ſupper granted to him he doth not ſteal it, though all his right is forfeited by his fault, after he is once condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he hath no right to any thing; ſo it is with the wicked, they have forfeited all their right to all comforts in this world, they are condemned by God as Malefactors and are going to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if God will in his bounty give them ſomething to preſerve them here in the world, they cannot be ſaid to be thieves or robbers: Now a man hath granted to him a ſupper over night before his execution, but is that like the ſupper that he was wont to have in his own houſe, when he eat his own bread, and had his wife and children about him? Oh a diſh of green herbs at home would be a great deal better than any dainties in ſuch a ſupper as that is; but now a child of God hath not a right meerly by donation, but what he hath it is his own through the purchaſe of Chriſt; every bit of bread that thou eateſt, if thou beeſt a godly man or woman, Jeſus Chriſt hath bought it for thee, thou goeſt to market and buyeſt thy meat and drink with thy money, but know that before thou haſt bought it, or paid money, Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of God the Father with his blood, thou haſt it at the hands of men for money, but Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of his Father by his blood: And certainly it is a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſweeter now though it be but a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, There's another thing that ſhews the ſweetneſs that there is in that little that the Saints have, by which they come to have contentment, whereas others cannot; that is, <hi>Every little that they have, it is but as an earneſt penny of all the glory that is reſerved for them, it is given them by God, but as the Fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies that the Lord intends for them</hi>; now if a man hath but twelve pence given to him as an earneſt penny for ſome great poſſeſſion that he muſt have; is not that better than if he had forty pounds given unto him otherwiſe? So every comfort that the Saints have in this world, it is an earneſt penny to them of thoſe eternall mercies that the Lord hath provided for them; as every affliction that the wicked have here it is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58996:31"/>
of ſorrowes, and fore-runner of thoſe eternall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that they are like to have hereafter in Hell; ſo every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thou haſt is a fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies thou ſhalt have with God in Heaven; not only the conſolations of Gods Spirit are the fore-runners of thoſe eternal comforts thou ſhalt have in Heaven; but when thou ſitteſt at thy Table, and rejoyceſt with thy wife and children and friends, thou mayeſt look upon every one of thoſe but as a fore-runner, yea the very earneſt-penny of eternal life unto thee. Now then if this be ſo, no marvel though a Chriſtian be contented; (this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to the wicked:) I have what I have out of the love of God, and I have it ſanctified to me by God, and I have it of free-coſt from God by the purcaſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and I have it as a fore-runner of thoſe eternal mercies that are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for me; and in this my ſoul rejoyces, There's a ſecret dew of Gods goodneſs, and bleſſing upon him in his eſtate that others have not; and by all this you may ſee the meaning of that Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Better is a little with righteouſneſs, than great revenues without right.</hi> A man that hath but a little, yet if he hath it with righteouſneſs, it is better than a great deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out right; yea, better than the great revenues of the wicked: ſo you have it in another Scripture; That's the next Particular in Chriſtian Contentment; the myſtery is in this, That he lives upon the dew of Gods bleſſing, in all the good things that he doth enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Ninth thing wherein the myſtery of Chriſtian Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts, is this, <hi>Not only the good things that he hath, he hath the dew of Gods bleſſing in them, and they are very ſweet to him; but all the afflictions, all the evils that do befall him he can ſee love in them all: And can enjoy the ſweetneſs of love in his afflictions, as well as in his mercies</hi>; yea the truth is, the afflictions of Gods people comes from the ſame Eternal love that Jeſus Chriſt did come from. And that ſpeech of <hi>Hierom, He is a happy man that is beaten when the ſtroke is a ſtroke of love.</hi> All Gods ſtrokes are ſtrokes of love and mercy, all Gods waies are mercy and truth, to thoſe that fear him and love him, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 25.10. <hi>The wayes of God,</hi> the waies of affliction, as well as the waies of proſperity, are mercy and love to him. Grace gives a man an eye, a piercing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58996:31"/>
ye to pierce into the Councels of God, thoſe Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God for good unto him, even in his afflictions, to ſee the love of God in every affliction as well as in proſperity. Now this is a myſtery to a carnal heart, they can ſee no ſuch thing, perhaps they think God loves them when he proſpers them, and makes them rich; but they think God loves them not when he doth afflict them, that's a myſtery; but grace inſtructs men in that myſtery, grace inables men to ſee love in the very frowns of Gods face, and ſo comes to receive contentment.</p>
               <p>In the Tenth place, A godly man hath Contentment in the way of a myſtery, <hi>becauſe as he ſees all his afflictions come from the ſame love that Jeſus Chriſt did; ſo he ſees them all ſanctified in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſanctified as a Mediator</hi>; he ſees (I ſay) all the ſting and venom, and poyſon of them all to be taken out by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator between God and Man: As now for inſtance, Thus, a Chriſtian when he would have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment fals a working, what is my affliction? Is it poverty that God ſtrikes me withall? Jeſus Chriſt had not a houſe to hide his head in, the Fowls of the air had neſts, and the Foxes had holes, but the Son of Man not a hole to hide his head in: now my poverty is ſanctified by Chriſts poverty, I can ſee by faith the curſe and ſting and venom of my poverty, taken out by the poverty of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt Jeſus he was poor in this world to deliver me from the curſe of my poverty, that it ſhould not be curſed unto me, then my poverty is not afflictive, if I can be contented in ſuch a condition. That is the way, not to ſtand and repine, becauſe I have not what others have, no, but I am poor, and Chriſt was therefore poor that he might bleſs my poverty to me.</p>
               <p>And ſo again, Am I diſgraced, diſhonoured, is my good-name taken away? why Jeſus Chriſt he had diſhonour put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and a Samaritan, and they ſaid he had a Devil in him, all the foul aſperſions that could be were caſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and this was for me, that I might have the diſgrace that is caſt upon me to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, whereas another man his heart is overwhelmed with diſhonour, and diſgrace, and he goes this way to work to get Conntetment; perhaps if you be ſpoken ill of, you have no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58996:32"/>
other way to eaſe and right your ſelves, but if they do rail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, you will rail upon them again; and thus you think to eaſe your ſelves: Oh but a Chriſtian hath another manner of way to eaſe himſelf, others rail and ſpeak ill of me, but did they not rail upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpeak ill of him? and what am I in compariſon of Chriſt? And the ſubjection of Chriſt to ſuch an evil, it was for me, that though ſuch a thing ſhould come upon me, I might know that the curſe of it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me through Chriſts ſubjection to that evill; thus a Chriſtian can be contented when any body ſpeaks ill of him; now this is a myſterie to you to get Contentment after ſuch a manner as this is: So if men jeer and ſcoffe at you, did they not do ſo to Jeſus Chriſt? they jeer'd and ſcoff't at him, and that when he was in his greateſt extremity upon the Croſſe, ſay they, Here's the King of the Jews, and they bowed the knee, and ſaid hail King of the Jews, and put a Reed into his hand, and mocked him: now I get Contentment in the midſt of ſcorns and jeers, by conſidering that Chriſt was ſcorned, and by acting faith upon that which Chriſt did ſuffer for me. So, am I in great pain of my body? Jeſus Chriſt had as great pain upon his body as I have, though it's true he had not ſuch kind of ſickneſſes as we have, but yet he had as great pain and tortours in his body, and that that was deadly to him, as wel as any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to us: the exerciſing of faith upon what Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that's the way to get Contentment in the midſt of our pains: one lies vexing and fretting, and cannot bear his pain, art thou a Chriſtian? haſt thou ever tryed this way of getting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to act thy faith upon all the pains and ſufferings that Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer? this would be the way of Contentment, and a Chriſtian gets contentment under pains after this maner: ſometimes one that is very godly and gracious, you ſhall have them lie under grievous pains and extremities very cheerfully, and you wonder at it, this is the way that he gets it, he gets it by acting his faith upon what pains Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer, thou art afraid of death; the way to get Contentment, it is by exerciſing thy faith upon the death of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, it may be thou haſt inward troubles in thy ſoule, and God withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from thee, but ſtill thy faith is to be exerciſed upon the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58996:32"/>
ſufferings that Jeſus Chriſt indured in his ſoul, he poured forth his ſoul before God, then when he ſweat drops of water and blood, he was in an Agony in his very Spirit, and he found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God himſelf in a way to forſake him; now the acting thy faith upon Jeſus Chriſt thus, brings Contentment, and is not this a myſterie to carnal hearts? a gracious heart finds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in a way of a myſtery: no marvel though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am inſtructed in a Myſtery, to be contented in whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Eleventh place, there is yet a further myſtery (for this I hope you will find a very uſeful point unto you) and you will ſee what a plaine way there is, (before we have done) for one that is skil'd in Religion to get Contentment, though it's hard for one that is carnal. I ſay the Eleventh myſtery in contentment is this, <hi>A gracious heart hath contentment by fetching ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt, he is able to beare his burden by fetching ſtrength from another</hi>: now this is a riddle indeed, and it would be a rediculous thing to be ſpoken of in the ſchools of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, to ſay, if there be a burden upon you, you muſt fetch ſtrength from another; indeed to have another to come and ſtand under the burden, that way they would know, but that you ſhall be ſtrengthened by anothers ſtrength, that is not neer you to your outward view, that they would think rediculous: but now a Chriſtian finds ſatisfaction in every condition by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrength from another, by going out of it's ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, and by faith acting upon Chriſt, and bringing the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt into it's own ſoul, and thereby is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to bear whatſoever God laies upon him, by the ſtrength that he finds from Jeſus Chriſt, of his fulneſſe do we receive grace for grace, there is ſtrength in Chriſt not only to ſanctifie and ſave us, but ſtrength to ſupport us under all our burdens and afflictions, and Chriſt expects that when we are under any burden that we ſhould act our faith upon him to draw vertue and ſtrength from him, the acting of faith that's the great grace that is to be acted under afflictions, it's true, other graces ſhould be acted, but the grace of faith it draws ſtrength from Chriſt, in looking upon him that hath the fulneſſe of all ſtrength to be convayed into the hearts of all beleevers. Now
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58996:33"/>
if a man hath a burden upon him, yet if he can have ſtrength added to him, if the burden be doubled, yet if he can have his ſtrength to be tribled, the burden will not be heavier but ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was before to our natural ſtrength. Indeed our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be heavy, and we cry out, oh we cannot bear them, we cannot bear ſuch an affliction: Though thou canſt not tell how to bear it with thine own ſtrength, yet what canſt thou tell what thou ſhalt do with the ſtrnegth of Jeſus Chriſt? Thou ſaieſt thou canſt not bear it, why doeſt thou think that Chriſt could not bear it? if Chriſt could bear it, why may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thou come to bear it? You will ſay, Can I have the ſtrength of Chriſt? Yea, that is made over to thee by faith, ſo the Scripture ſaith <hi>That the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> God himſelf is our ſtrength, and Chriſt is our ſtrength, divers Scriptures we have that way; that Chriſts ſtrength is thine, made over to thee, that ſo thou mayeſt be able to bear whatſoever lies upon thee, and therefore we find ſuch a ſtrange kind of expreſſion in the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Colloſſians, praying for the Saints, <hi>that they might be ſtrengthened with all might according unto his glorious power,</hi> unto what? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all patience and long ſuffering with joyfulneſſe. Strengthned with all might, according to the power of God, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power of God, unto all patience, and long-ſuffering with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; You may not therefore be content with a little ſtrength, ſo that you are able to bear what a man might bear by the ſtrength of reaſon and nature; But to be ſtrengthened with all might, according to the glorious power of God, unto all patience, and to all long ſuffering; Oh you that are now under very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ſad afflictions more than ordinary, look upon this Scripture, and conſider how this Scripture is made good in you, why may you not have this Scripture made good in you, if you be godly? You ſhould not be quiet in your own ſpirits, except that you in ſome meaſure do get this Scripture to be made good in you; ſo that you may with ſome comfort ſay, through Gods mercy I find that ſtrength coming into me that is here ſpoken of in this Scripture. You ſhould labour when you are under any great affliction (you that are Godly) to walk ſo, that others may ſee ſuch a Scripture made good in you; Here is the glorious power of God that doth ſtrengthen his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58996:33"/>
to all long ſuffering; and that with joyfulneſs. Alas it may be you do not exerciſe ſo much patience, as a wiſe man or a wiſe woman that hath but natural reaſon. But where is the power of God, the glorious power of God? where's the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening with all might, unto all long-ſuffering and patience and that with joyfulneſſe? It is true, the ſpirit of a man may be able to ſuſtain his infirmities, may be able to ſuſtain and keep up his ſpirits, the naturall ſpirit of a man, but much more then when this ſpirit is acted with grace and holineſſe, and when it is fill'd with the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt; this is the way of a godly mans getting Contentment, the Myſtery of it, it is by fetching in ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Another Myſtery, that there is in it, it is, <hi>That a godly heart, injoys much of God in every thing it hath, and doth know how to make up all wants in God himſelf</hi>: that is another My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, he hath God in what he hath; that I ſpoke too ſomwhat before, in ſhewing the dew of Gods bleſſing in what he hath, for God is able to let out a great deale of his power in little things, and therefore the miracles that God hath wrought, have been as much in little things as in great; now as God lets out a great deal of his power in working miracles in ſmaler things, ſo he lets out a great deal of goodneſſe and mercy, in comforting and rejoycing the hearts of his people in little things, as well as in great; there may be as much riches in a pearl as in a great deal of lumber; but now this is a diſtinct thing.</p>
               <p>Further, a gracious heart as he lives upon Gods dew in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he hath, ſo when that little that he hath ſhall be taken from him, what ſhall he do then? Then you will ſay, If a man have nothing, there can be nothing fetcht out of nothing: But if the children of God have their little taken from them, they can make up all their wants in God himſelf: Such a man is a poor man, the plunderers came and took away all that he had, what ſhall he do then when all is gone? But when all is gone, there is an art and skill that godlineſſe teaches to make up all thoſe loſſes in God. Many men that have their houſes burnt, go about gathering, and ſo get up by many hands a little; but a godly man knows whither to go to get up all, even in God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58996:34"/>
himſelf, ſo as he ſhall injoy the quinteſcence of the ſame good and comfort as he had before, for a Godly man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he lives in God. This is now a Myſterie to a Carnal heart, I ſay a gracious man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he doth in God, he lives in God continually; if there be any thing cut off from the ſtream he knows how to go to the fountain, &amp; makes up all there; God is his all in all while he lives, I ſay tis God that is his all in all. Am not I to thee (ſaith <hi>Elkanah</hi> to <hi>Hannah</hi>) inſtead of ten Children? So ſaith God to a gracious heart, thou wanteſt this, thy eſtate is plundered: Why? Am not I to thee inſtead of ten houſes, and ten ſhops, I am to thee inſtead of All, yet not only inſtead of All, but come to me, and thou ſhalt have all again in me: This indeed is an excellent Art, to be able to draw from God what it had before in the creature: Chriſtian, how didſt thou injoy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort before? was the creature any other to thee but a Conduit, a pipe that did convey Gods goodneſſe to thee? The pipe is cut off ſaith God, come to me the Fountain and drink immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: though the beams be taken away, yet the Sun remains the ſame in the firmament as ever it was; What's that that ſatisfies God himſelf, but becauſe he doth injoy all fulneſſe in himſelf, ſo he comes to have ſatisfaction in himſelf; now if thou injoyeſt God to be thy portion, if thy ſoul can ſay with the Church in <hi>Lamentations,</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul,</hi> why ſhouldeſt thou not be ſatisfied and contented as God; God is contented, he is in eternal Contentment in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; now if thou haſt that God to be thy portion, why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not thou be contented with him alone? God is contented with himſelf alone, if thou haſt him thou mayeſt be Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him alone, and it may be, that is the reaſon that thy outward comforts are taken from thee, that God may be All in All to thee: It may be whilſt thou hadeſt theſe things here they did ſhare with God in thy affection, a great part of the ſtream of thy affection ran that way, now God would have the full ſtream run to him: As you know it is with a man that hath water come to his houſe, and if there be ſeveral pipes, upon which he finds the water comes but ſcantly into his waſh-houſe, he will rather ſtop the other pipes that he may have all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58996:34"/>
the water come in where he would have it. So here it may be God had ſome ſtream of thy affection that ran to him then when thou dideſt enjoy theſe things; yea, but a great deale was let out to the Creature, a great deal of thy affections did run waſte; now the Lord would not have the affections of his Children to run waſte, he doth not care for other mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for thine they are precious, and God would not have them to run waſte, therefore doth he cut off thy other pipes that thy heart might run wholly upon him: As if you have Children, becauſe you have ſervants perhaps do feed them and give them things, you perceive that your ſervants do ſteal away the hearts of your Children, you would hardly be able to bear it, you would be ready to turn away ſuch a ſervant, and when the ſervant is gone, the Child is at a great loſs, it hath not the nurſe; but the father or mother intends by her putting away, that the affections of the Child might run the more ſtrongly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, or herſelf; and what loſſe hath the Child that the affections that ran in a rough channel before towards the ſervant, it runs now towards the mother? So thoſe affections that runs towards the creature, God would have them run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, that ſo he may be All in All to thee here in this world. And a gracious heart can indeed tel how to enjoy God to be All in All to him: that is the happineſs of Heaven, to have God to be All in All. The Saints in Heaven have not houſes, and lands, and money, and meat and drink, and cloaths, you wil ſay, they do not need them; why do they not? It is becauſe God is All in All to them imediatly: now while thou liveſt in this world, thou mayeſt come to enjoy much of God, you may have much of heaven; while we live in this life we may come to enjoy much of the very life that there is in Heaven, and what is that but the enjoyment of God to be All in All to us: There is one text in the <hi>Revelations</hi> that ſpeaks of the glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church that is like to be even here in this world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.21. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it; and the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> They had no need of the Sun or Moon. It ſpeaks of ſuch a glorious condition that

the Church is like to be in here in this world; this doth not ſpeak of Heaven: and that appears plainly that this is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Heaven, but of a glorious eſtate that the Church ſhall be in here, in this world, for it follows preſently in the 24. and 26. verſe, <hi>And they</hi> (ſpeaking of the Kings of the earth:) <hi>And the Kings of the Earth do bring their glory and honour unto it.</hi> Why, the Kings of the Earth ſhall not bring their glory and honour into Heaven; but this is ſuch a time, when the Kings of the Earth ſhall bring their glory and honour to the Church. And in the 26. verſ. <hi>And they ſhall bring the glory and honour of the Nations into it</hi>; therfore it muſt needs be meant here in this world and not in Heaven: Now if there be ſuch a time here in this world, that God ſhall be All in All, that in compariſon there ſhall be no ſuch need of creatures as now there is, then the Saints ſhall labour to live as neer that life as poſſibly they can, that is, To make up All in God: Oh that you would but mind this Myſtery, that it may be a reality to the hearts of the Saints in ſuch times as theſe are, they would find this priviledge, that they get by Grace, to be worth thouſands of worlds: Hence is that of <hi>Jacob</hi> that I mentioned in another caſe, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and comes in fully here, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. that notable ſpeech of <hi>Jacob</hi> when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> did meet him, ye find in one place, that <hi>Eſau</hi> he refuſed <hi>Jacobs</hi> preſent, in the 8. verſe, when <hi>Jacob</hi> gave his preſent to him, he refuſed it, and tould <hi>Jacob</hi> that he had enough; <hi>What meaneſt thou by all this drove which I meet? And he ſaid, Theſe are to find grace in thy ſight: And</hi> Eſau <hi>ſaid, I have enough.</hi> Now in the 11. verſe, there <hi>Jacob</hi> urges it ſtill, (and ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>I beſeech thee take it for I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>: now in your books it is the ſame in Engliſh, <hi>I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſau</hi>:) and <hi>I have enough</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi>:) but in the Hebrew, <hi>Jacobs</hi> word is different from <hi>Eſau's, Jacobs</hi> word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>I have all things,</hi> and yet <hi>Jacob</hi> was poorer than <hi>Eſau.</hi> Oh this ſhould be a ſhame to us, that an <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould ſay, I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but now a Chriſtian ſhould ſay, I have not only enough, but <hi>I have all</hi>: how hath he all? becauſe he hath God that is All. And it was an notable ſpeech of one, <hi>He hath all things, that hath him that hath all things.</hi> Surely thou haſt all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt him <hi>for thy portion</hi> who hath al things: God hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58996:35"/>
all things in himſelf, and thou haſt God to be thine for thy portion, and in that thou haſt all, and this is the Myſtery of Contentment; It makes up all wants in God, this is that that the men of the world have little skill in.</p>
               <p>Now I have divers other things yet to open in the Myſtery of Contentment. I ſhould ſhew likewiſe that a godly man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes up all in God, but finds enough in himſelfe to make up all, to make up all in himſelfe, not from himſelfe, but in himſelfe, and that may ſeem to be ſtranger than the other: to make up all in God is ſomewhat, nay to make up all in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not from himſelf, but in himſelf, that is, a gracious heart hath ſo much of God within himſelf, that he hath enough there to make up all his wants that are without. In <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.14. <hi>A good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> from that that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, that is the meaning, a gracious man he hath a bird within his own boſom that makes him melody enough, though he wants muſick, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is within you</hi>: In <hi>Luke,</hi> 17.21. <hi>He hath a Kingdom within him, and a Kingdom of God</hi>: you ſee him ſpoken ill of abroad, he hath a conſcience within him that makes up the want of a name and credit, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirtenth, <hi>A gracious heart fetches Contentment from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God hath made with him.</hi> Now this is a way of fetching Contentment that the men of the world know not of; they can fetch contentment, if they have the creature to ſatisfie them: But to fetch contentment from the Covenant of grace that they have little skill in. I ſhould here have opened two things, Firſt, how to fetch Contentment from the Covenant of grace in generall. (But I ſhall ſpeak to that in the next Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and now only a word to the Second) Secondly, how he fetches Contentment from the particular branches of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is, from the particular promiſes that he hath for the ſupplying of every particular want: there is no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Godly man or woman can be in, but there is ſome promiſe or other in the Scripture to help him in that condition. And that's the way of his Contentment, to go out to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and fetch from the promiſe, that that may ſupply. But this is but a dry buſineſſe to a carnall heart; but it's the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58996:36"/>
moſt real thing in the world to a gracious heart; when he finds want of Contentment he repaires to the Promiſe, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and fals a pleading the promiſes that God hath made. As I ſhould have ſhewen ſeveral promiſes that God hath made let the affliction be what it will, I will but only mention one that is the ſaddeſt affliction of all; in caſe of the Viſitation, and the Plague. In <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 91. now thoſe that cannot have their friends come to them by reaſon of the plague, and that cannot have other comforts, in other afflictions they might have their frinds and other things to comfort them, but in that they cannot, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.10. <hi>There ſhall no evil befal thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling</hi>; then here is a promiſe for the penilence in the 5. and 6. verſes, this is a Scripture to thoſe that are in danger of it, you will ſay, this is a promiſe that the Plague ſhall not come nigh them, but mark theſe two are joyned <hi>There ſhall no evil befal thee, neither ſhall the plague come nigh thee</hi>; the <hi>evil of i<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> ſhall not come nigh thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, It doth come to many godly men, and how can they make uſe of this Scripture, it is rather a Scripture that may trouble them, becauſe here's a promiſe that it ſhal not come nigh them, &amp; yet it doth come nigh them as wel as others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, this is the Anſwer I would give, the promiſes of outward delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that were made <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the people of God in the time of the law, were to be underſtood then a great deal more lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, &amp; fulfilled more litterally tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the times of the Goſpel, God makes it up otherwiſe with as much mercy, though God made a covenant of grace &amp; eternal life in Chriſt with them, yet I think there was another Covenant too, that God ſpeaks of as a diſtinct covenant for outward things, to deal with his people by according to their waies, either in outward proſperity, or in outward afflictions, more than now, in a more punctual, ſet way, then in the times of the Goſpel; and therefore when the Children of Iſrael did but ſin againſt God, they were ſure to have publique judgments to come upon them, and if they did well, alwaies publique mercies; the generall conſtant way of God was to deal with the people of the Jewes according as they did well or ill, (in an ordinary way,) with outward judgments, and outward mercies: but it's not ſo now in theſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58996:36"/>
times of the Goſpel; we cannot bring ſuch a certain concluſion, that God did deal ſo ſeverely with men by ſuch and ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that he wil deal ſo with them now: and ſo, that they ſhall have outward proſperity as they had then: therfore that's the firſt thing, for the underſtanding of this, and all other texts of that kind.</p>
               <p>The Second Anſwer I would give is this, It may be their faith doth not reach to this promiſe; and God brings many times many outward afflictions, becauſe the faith of his people doth not reach the promiſe, and that not only in the old Teſtament, but in the times of the new Teſtament, <hi>Zachariah</hi> his time may be ſaid to be in the time of the new Teſtament, when he was ſtruck with dumbneſs becauſe he did not beleeve, and that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be the cauſe why he was ſtruck with dumbneſſe. But you will ſay now, hath faith warant to beleeve deliverance, that it ſhall be fully delivered? I dare not ſay ſo, but it may act upon it, to beleeve that God will make it good his own way; perhaps you have not done ſo much, and ſo upon that, this promiſe is not fulfilled to you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When God doth make ſuch promiſes to his people, yet ſtill it muſt be with this reſervation, that God muſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding his promiſe, he will have liberty to make uſe of any thing for your chaſtiſement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he muſt have liberty, to make uſe of your eſtates, or liberties, or lives, for the furtherance of his own ends: If it be to be a ſtumbling block to wicked and ungodly men: God muſt have liberty, though he have made a promiſe to you he will not looſe the propriety that he hath in your eſtates and lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God muſt have ſo much liberty to make uſe of what you have, for to ſhew that his waies are unſearchable, and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſt finding out, God reſerves theſe three things in his hand ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, What good then is there in ſuch a promiſe that God makes to his people?</p>
               <p>Firſt; That thou art under the protection of God more than others. But what comfort is this if it doth befal me?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:58996:37"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou haſt this comfort, that the evill of it ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thee, that if God will make uſe of this affliction for other ends, yet he will do it ſo as he will make it up to thee ſome other way. Perhaps you have given your children ſuch a thing, but yet afterwards if you have uſe of that thing, you will come and ſay, I muſt have it, why father may the child ſay you gave it me? But ſaith the father I muſt have it, and I will make it up to you ſome other way: Now the child doth not think that the fathers love is ever a whit the leſs to him. So when there is any ſuch promiſe as this is, that God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe gives thee his protection, and yet for all that ſuch a thing befals thee, it is but as if the father ſhould ſay, I gave you that indeed, but let me have it and I will make it up to you ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way that ſhall be as good; ſaith God let me have your health and liberty, and life, and it ſhall be made up to you ſome other way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When ever the Plague or Peſtilence comes to thoſe that are under ſuch a promiſe, it is for ſome ſpecial and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, and God requires of them to ſearch and examin in a ſpecial manner to find out his meaning; there is ſo much to be learned in the promiſe that God hath made concerning this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evill, that the people of God they may come to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and content their hearts in this affliction. I reade in this Pſalm that God hath made a promiſe to his people, to deliver them from the Plague and Peſtilence, and yet do I find it to come: It may be I have not made uſe of my faith in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe heretofore; and if God do bring afflictions upon me, yet God will make it up ſome other way, God made a promiſe to deliver me, or at leaſt to deliver me from all the evil of it, now if this thing doth befall me and yet I have a promiſe of God, certainly the evil of it is taken away, this promiſe tels me that if it doth befall me yet it is for ſome notable end, and becauſe God hath uſe of my life, and intends to fetch about his glory ſome way that I know not of: And if he will come in a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of chaſtiſement, yet I will be ſatisfied in the thing: So a Chriſtian heart by reaſoning out of the word, comes to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſoul in the middeſt of ſuch a heavy hand of God, and in ſuch a diſtreſſed condition as that is. Now Carnal hearts they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58996:37"/>
find not that power in the Word, that healing vertue that there is in the Word, to heal their deſtracted cares, and the troubles of their ſpirits; but now, thoſe that are godly when they come to hear the Word they find out, that in the Word there is as a plaiſter to all their wounds, and ſo they come to have eaſe and Contentment, in ſuch conditions as are very grievous and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable unto others. But now, for other particular promiſes, and more generally for the Covenant of grace, how, and in what myſterious way the Saints do work to fetch out Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction to their ſouls, we ſhall refer to the next time.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Exerciſe we ſpoke of divers things in the Myſtrie of Contentment, and in the cloſe we ſpoke of two more, but we could not have time to open either of them, I ſhall open them a little more largely, &amp; then proceed to ſome few more, and ſo to other things in the point.</p>
               <p>That's the next then, A Chriſtian heart hath not only Contentment in God, (and certainly, he that hath God, muſt have all, he that hath him that hath all, he hath all) <hi>But he is able to make up all his outward wants of creature-comforts from what he finds in himſelf:</hi> That may ſeem to be more ſtrange: It's true, perhaps we may convince men though they doe not feel by experience what it is to make up all in God, yet we may convince them that if they have him that hath all things, then they have al; for there is ſuch a fulneſs in God, he being the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite firſt-being of all things that may make up all their wants.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58996:38"/>
But here's another thing that's further, I ſay a godly man can make up whatſoever he wants without the creature, he can make it up in himſelf, in the 14. of the <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. <hi>A good man is ſatisfied in himſelf</hi>: as now, If he wants outward comforts, good chear, feaſting; a good conſcience is a continual feaſt, he can make up the want of a feaſt by that peace he hath in his own conſcience: if he wants melody abroad, he hath a bird within him that ſings the moſt melodious ſongs that are in the world, and the moſt delightful. And then doth he want ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? he hath his own conſcience witneſſing for him, that is as a thouſand witneſſes, the Scripture ſaith in the 17. of <hi>Luke,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there, for behold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is within you</hi>; a Chriſtian then whatſoever he wants he can make it up, for he hath a Kingdom in himſelfe, the Kingdom of God is within him. If one that is a King ſhould meet with a great deal of trouble when he is abroad, yet he Contents himſelf with this, I have a Kingdom of mine own; now here it's ſaid the Kingdom of God is within a man; truly, upon this Scripture of the Kingdom of God being within, thoſe that are learned if they would but look into that Coment upon the Goſpel that we have of a learned man, they ſhall find a very ſtrange conceit that he hath about this very text, he confeſſes indeed it is unutterable, and ſo indeed it is; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you, he makes it that there is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God and Chriſt within the ſoul of a man, that when the body dies, he ſaith, that the ſoul goes into God and Chriſt that is within him, the ſouls going into God and Chriſt, and enjoying of that Communion with God and Chriſt that is within it's ſelf, that's Heaven to it (ſaith he) he confeſſes he is not able to expreſſe himſelf, nor others cannot underſtand fully what he intends; but certainly for the preſent before death, there's a Kingdom of God within the ſoul, ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God in the ſoul that is enough to Content the heart of any godly man in the world, the Kingdom that he hath now within him, he ſhall not ſtay till afterwards, till he goes to Heaven, but certainly there is a Heaven in the ſoul of a godly man, he hath Heaven already: many times when you go to comfort your friends in their afflictions, you will ſay
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58996:38"/>
Heaven will pay for all; nay, you may certainly find Heaven pays for all already: there is a Heaven within the ſouls of the Saints, that's a certain truth, no ſoul ſhall ever come to heaven, but that Soul that hath Heaven come to it firſt. When you die you hope you ſhall goe to Heaven: But if you ſhall goe to Heaven when you die, Heaven will come to you before you die. Now this is a great Myſterie to have the Kingdom of Heaven in the Soul, no man can know this but that Soul that hath it, that Heaven which is within the Soul for the preſent (I ſay) it is like the white ſtone and the new name, that none but thoſe that have it can underſtand it: It's a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition my brethren to depend upon creatures altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our Contentment, you know that rich men account it a great happineſſe, if they need not go to buy things by the penny as others do, they have all things for pleaſure or profit upon their own ground; and all their inheritance lies intire together, they have no body comes within them, but they have all within themſelves, there lies their happineſſe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other poorer people are fain to go from one Market to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provide them neceſſaries, but yet great rich men they have ſheep and beeves, corn and cloathing, and all things elſe of their own within themſelves, and herein they place their happineſſe: But this is the happineſſe of a Chriſtian, that he hath that within himſelfe that may ſatisfie him more than all theſe; That place that we have in the firſt of <hi>James,</hi> ſeems to allude to that condition of men that have all their eſtates within themſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. <hi>But let patience have her perfect work that we may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing</hi>: the word there uſed ſignifies to have the whole inheritance to our ſelves, not a broken inheritance, but that where all lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves; as a man that hath not a piece of his eſtate here, and a piece there, but he hath it all lie together; and the heart being patient under afflictions finds it ſelf to be in ſuch an eſtate as this is, finds his whole inheritance to be together, and all intire within it's ſelf. And now ſtill to ſhew this by further ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, it is with him being fil'd with good things, juſt like as it is with many a man that injoys abundance of comforts at home, at his own houſe, God grants to him a convenient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58996:39"/>
a comfortable yoke-fellow, and fine walks and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and hath all things at home that he could deſire; now this man cares not much for going abroad, other men are fain to go abroad to take the air, but he hath a ſweet air at home, and they are fain to go abroad to ſee friends, becauſe they have raylings and contendings at home; many ill husbands will give this reaſon, (if his wife make any moan, and complaint of his ill husbandry) of their bad husbandry, and will make that their excuſe to go abroad, becauſe they can never be quiet at home. Now we account thoſe men moſt happy that have all at home; thoſe that have cloſe houſes that are unſavory, and ſmels ill, they delight to go into the freſh ayr; I but it is not ſo with many others that have theſe at home; thoſe that have no good chear at home, they are fain to go abroad to friends, but thoſe that have their Tables furniſhed, they had as live ſtay at home: ſo a carnal man he hath but little Contentment in his own ſpirit; it's <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſimilitude (ſaith he) an ill conſcience is like a ſcoulding wife, a man (ſaith he) that hath an ill conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience he cares not to look into his own ſoul, but loves to be abroad, and look into other things, but never looks to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but one that hath a good conſcience he delights in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his own heart, he hath a good conſcience within him: and ſo a carnal heart, becauſe theres nothing but filthineſſe, a filthy ſtink in himſelf, nothing but vileneſſe and baſeneſſe, within him; upron this it is that he ſeeks his Contentment elſe where: And as it is with a veſſel that is full of liquor, if you ſtrike upon it it will make no great noiſe, but if it be empty then it makes a great noiſe; ſo it is with the heart, a heart that is full of grace and goodneſſe within, ſuch a one will bear a great many ſtrokes, and never make any noiſe, but an empty heart if that be ſtruck that will make a noiſe, thoſe men and women that are ſo much complayning, and alwaies whyning, it is a ſign that there's an emptineſſe in their hearts, but if their hearts were filled with grace they would not make ſuch an noiſe as now they do. As a man that hath his bones fil'd with marrow, and veins fill'd with good blood, he complains not of cold as others do; ſo a gracious heart having the Spirit of God within him, and his heart fill'd with Grace, he hath that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58996:39"/>
within him that makes him find Contentment. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Seneca,</hi> Indeed thoſe things that I ſuffer will be incredible heavy when I cannot bear my ſelf; but now if I be no burden to my ſelf, if I have all quiet within mine own heart, then I can bear any thing: many men through their wickedneſſe they have burdens without, but the greateſt burden is the wickedneſſe of their own hearts, they are not burdened with their ſins in a godly way, that would eaſe their burden, but they have ſtill their wickedneſſe in the power of it, and ſo they are burdens to themſelves. The diſtempers of mens hearts are mighty bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to them; many times a godly man hath enough within to Content him; Vertue it is Content with its ſelf, for to live well; (Its a ſpeech of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and its in one of his Paradoxes) It finds enough within its own ſphere for the living happily: but how few are acquainted with this Myſterie? Many think O if I had that that another man hath, how happily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſhould I live: Oh but if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy condition be, yet thou haſt enough within thy ſelf, you will ſay ſuch and ſuch men that hath all things they need not be beholding to any body, you ſhall have many that will labour and take pains when they are young, that they might not be beholding to others, I love to live of my ſelfe; now a Chriſtian may do ſo; not that he doth not live upon God (I mean not ſo) but upon that that he hath of God within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he can live upon, although he doth not enjoy the comforts that are without himſelfe, thats it which I mean, and thoſe that are godly and keep cloſe to God in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, they underſtand what I mean by this, that a Chriſtian hath ſupply of all his wants within himſelfe; and here you may ſee that the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is a precious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a godly ſpirit is precious, why? becauſe it hath enough to make him happy within himſelf.</p>
               <p>The next thing that the Myſtery of Contentment conſiſts in is this, <hi>That a gracious heart fetches ſupply of all from the Covenant and ſo comes to have Contentment</hi>; which is a dry thing to a carnal ſpirit: Now there are two things here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he fetches Contentment from the Covenant in general, that is from the great Covenant that God hath made with him in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58996:40"/>Secondly, From the particular promiſes that God hath made with him in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the Covenant in general. I'le give you one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for that, it's very remarkable, in the ſecond of <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. verſ. 5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> It's a moſt admirable Scripture of <hi>David,</hi> that yet had not the Covenant of Grace opened ſo fully as we have. But yet mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Although I find not my houſe ſo, that is, ſo comfortably every way as I would, although it be not ſo, what hath he to content his ſpirit? ſaith he, He hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant; this is that that helps all: I am not (may ſome men ſay) thus and thus with God, I do not find God come in ſo fully, or it's not with my houſe and family as I hoped it might be, perhaps there is this or that affliction upon my houſe; ſuppoſe you ſhould have the plague come into your houſe, and your houſe is not ſafe, and you have not that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort in your houſe as formerly you had, but can you reade this Scripture, and ſay, Although my houſe be not ſo bleſt with health as other mens houſes are; although my houſe be not ſo, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I am one yet in Covenant with God, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant: as for theſe things in this world, I ſee they are but momentary, they are not everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, I ſee in a family when all was well but a week ago, now all is down, and the plague hath ſwept away a great many of them, and the reſt are left in ſadneſs and mourning: we ſee there is no reſting in the things of this world, yet the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things: I find diſorder in my heart, in my family; but the everlaſting Covenant, that's ordered in all things; yea, and that's ſure: alack, there's no ſureneſſe here in theſe things, I can be ſure of nothing here, eſpecially in theſe times, we know that a man can be ſure of little that he hath, who can be ſure of his eſtate? perhaps ſome of you here that have lived well and comfortably before, and all was well about you, and you thought your mountain was ſtrong, but you ſee within a day or two all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58996:40"/>
away from you, ſo that there is no ſureneſſe in the things of this world: But ſaith he the Covenant is ſure, what I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Sea thats not ſure, but here's an aſſurance Offiice indeed, here's a great aſſurance Office for the Saints, and they are not at charge, but only the exerciſing of Grace, for they may go to this Aſſurance Office to aſſure every thing that they venture, either to have the thing it ſelf, or be paid for it: In an aſſurance Office you cannot be aſſured to have the very goods come in that you inſured, but if they be loſt the Inſurers do ingage themſelves to make it good to you. And this Covenant of grace that God hath made with his people, it is Gods Aſſurance Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Saints in all their fears may and ought to go to the Covenant to aſſure all things to them, to aſſure their eſtates and aſſure their lives. You will ſay, how are they ſure, their lives and eſtates go as well as others? But God ingages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make up all: And then mark what follows, <hi>This is all my Salvation,</hi> Why <hi>David</hi> wilt thou not have ſalvation from thine enemies and outward dangers, from peſtilence and plague? The frame of his ſpirit is quieted, as if he ſhould ſay, if that Salvation comes, wel and good, I ſhall praiſe God for it, but that that I have in the Covenant, that's my ſalvation, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that as enough: Yea and then further, <hi>This is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire,</hi> Why <hi>David</hi> is there not ſomething elſe that thou wouldeſt have beſides this Covenant? No ſaith he, it is all involved in this. Now ſurely thoſe men or women muſt needs live contented lives that have all their deſires; now ſaith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man here, this is all my deſire, <hi>And though he make it not to grow.</hi> But for all this Covenant perhaps you will not proſper in the world as other men do, true, but I am at a point for that: Though God doth not make my houſe to grow, I have all my deſires.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how a godly heart finds contentment in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, many of you ſpeak of the Covenant of God, and of the Covenant of grace, but have you found it ſo effectual to your ſouls? have you ſuckt this ſweetneſſe from the Covenant and content to your hearts in your ſad conditions? It's a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſign of the truth of grace in any ſoul, that when any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth befal him, in a kind of natural way he doth preſently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58996:41"/>
repair to the Covenant; juſt as a Child as ſoon as ever it is in danger, you ſhall not need to tell him and ſay, when you are in danger you muſt go to your father or mother, nature tels him ſo: ſo it is with a gracious heart, as ſoon as it is in any trouble or affliction there is a new nature that doth carry him to the Covenant preſently, and there it finds eaſe and reſt: and if you find that your hearts do thus work, preſently to be runing to the Covenant, it is an excellent ſign of the truth of grace: thats for the general.</p>
               <p>But now for particular promiſes in the Covenant of grace. A gracious heart looks upon every promiſe as comming from the Root of the great Covenant of grace in Chriſt. Other men look upon ſome particular promiſes, that God will help them in ſtraights, and keep them and the like; but they look not upon the conection of ſuch particular promiſes, to the root, the Covenant of grace: Now Chriſtians do miſſe of a great deal of comfort they might have, from the particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Goſpel, if they'd look upon their conectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the root, the great Covenant that God hath made with them in Chriſt. Now I remember I ſpoke a little about that, that in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſes in the time of the Law, they might reſt more upon them than we can in the time of the Goſpel. I gave you the reaſon why we that live in the time of the Goſpel cannot reſt ſo fully, for a litteral performance of outward promiſes that we meet withall in the old-Teſtament, as they might in the time of the Law: for there was a ſpecial Covenant, that God pleaſed to call a New Covenant by way of diſtinction from the other Covenant that is made with us in Chriſt for eternal life: And ſo even the Law was given to them in a more peculier way for an external Covenant of outward bleſſings in the land of Canaan; and ſo God did deal with them in a more external covenant than he doth now with his people. Yet godlineſſe, hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come. We may make uſe of the promiſes for this life, but yet not ſo much to reſt upon the litteral performance of them as they might; but that God will make them good ſome way or other, in a ſpiritual way, if not in an outward way. We muſt lay no more upon outward promiſes than this, and therefore if we will lay
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58996:41"/>
more, we make the promiſe to bear more than it will bear out. For to give ſome inſtance; to beleeve fully and confidently, that the Plague ſhall not come nigh ſuch a houſe (I ſay) it is to lay more upon ſuch a promiſe than it will bear. I opened that promiſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. now if I had lived in the time of the Law, perhaps I might have been ſomewhat more confident of the litteral performance of the promiſe, than I can now in the time of the Goſpel; the promiſe now bears no more than this, that God hath a ſpecial protection over his people, and that he will deliver them from the evil of ſuch an affliction; and if he doth bring ſuch an affliction it is more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary providence, it is ſome ſpecial providence that God hath in it. I had thought to have given you divers promiſes for the contentment of the heart in the time of affliction. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall not over-flow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Certainly though this promiſe was made in the time of the law, yet it will be made good to all the Saints now, one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in the letter or ſome other waies. For ſo we find it plainly, that promiſe that was made to <hi>Joſhua, I will not fail thee nor forſake thee, Joſh.</hi> 1.5. It's applied to the Chriſtians in the time of the Goſpel. So that here is the way of faith in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contentment by the promiſes, that all the promiſes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were made to our forefathers, from the beginning of the world, the Saints of God have an intereſt in them, they are their inheritances, and ſo goes on from one generation to another, and by that they come to have Contentment, becauſe they do inherit all the promiſes made in all the book of God, So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. ſhews plainly, that it is our inheritance, and we do not inherit leſs now than they did in <hi>Joſhuas</hi> time, but we inherit more; for you ſhall find in that place of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> there is more ſaid than is to <hi>Joſhua</hi>; to <hi>Joſhua</hi> God ſaith, He will not leave him nor forſake him; now in that place in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> there's five negatives, <hi>I will not, not, not, not, not</hi> again, there is the elegancy of it very much, in the <hi>Greek</hi> (I ſay) there is five negatives in that little ſentence; as if God ſhould ſay, I will not leave you, no I will not, I will not, I will not,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58996:42"/>
with ſuch earneſtneſſe five times together: So that we have not only the ſame promiſes that they had, but we have them more inlarged and more full, though ſtill not ſo much in the litteral ſenſe, for that indeed is the leaſt part of the promiſe, In <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.17. there God made a promiſe, <hi>That no weapon formed againſt his people ſhould proſper, and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt them in judgment thou ſhalt condemne,</hi> (and mark what follows) <hi>This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſs is of me ſaith the Lord</hi>: this is a good promiſe for a ſouldier, though ſtill not to lay to much upon the litteral ſenſe: True, it holds forth thus much, that Gods protection is in a ſpecial manner over ſouldiers that are godly, <hi>And every tongue that ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee in judgment thou ſhalt condemne</hi>: and this is againſt falſe witneſſe too: Oh you, that your friends never left you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, you wil ſay, my friends died and left not me a great, but I thank God, God hath provided for me; But though thy father or mother died and left thee no heritage, yet thou haſt a heritage in the promiſe, <hi>This is their heritage.</hi> So that there's no godly man or woman, but is a great heir. Therefore when thou lookeſt into the Book of God and findeſt any promiſe there, thou mayeſt make that thine own. Juſt as an heir that rides over divers fields and meadows, ſaith he, this meadow is my heritage, and this corn-field is my heritage; and then he ſees a fair houſe, and ſaith he, this fair houſe is my heritage; and he looks upon them with another manner of eye than a ſtranger that ſhall ride over thoſe fields. So a carnal heart reades the promiſes, and reades them but meerly as ſtories, not that they have any great intreſt in them: But a godly man eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he reades the Scriptures (remember this note when you are reading the Scripture) and there meeteth with a promiſe, he ought to lay his hand upon it and ſay, this is a part of my heritage, it's mine, and I am to live upon it, and this will make you to be Contented. Here's a myſterious way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. and 37.6. there's divers other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that brings Contentment. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.10. And thus much for the Myſterie of Contentment by way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>There is two or three things more that ſhew how a godly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58996:42"/>
man, hath Contentment after another kind of way than any Carnall heart in the world hath, it's a myſterious way, as thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath Contentment by realizing the glorious things of heaven to him,</hi> he hath the Kingdom of heaven as preſent, and the glory that is to come, by faith he makes it as preſent. So the Martyrs they had Contentment in their ſufferings, for ſaid ſome of them, though we have but a hard breakfaſt, yet we ſhall have a good dinner, we ſhall preſently be in heaven; do but ſhut your eyes (ſaith one) and you ſhall be in heaven preſently. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We faint not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) Why? <hi>Becauſe theſe light afflictions that are but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory.</hi> They ſee heaven before them and that contents them. You Marriners when you can ſee the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before you, though you were mightily troubled before you could ſee any land, yet when you come nigh the ſhore and can ſee ſuch a land-mark, that contents you exceedingly: a godly man in the middeſt of the waves and ſtorms that he meets withall, he can ſee the glory of heaven before him and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf; one drop of the ſweetneſſe of heaven is enough to take away all the ſower and bitter of all the afflictions in the world: Indeed here we know that one drop of ſower, or one drop of gall will make bitter a great deal of honey, put a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſugar into a cup of gall or wormwood, that will not ſweeten it, but if you put a ſpoonful of gall into a cup of ſugar it will imbitter that; now its otherwiſe in heaven, one drop of ſweet will ſweeten a great deal of ſower affliction, but a great deal of ſower and gall will not imbitter a ſoul that ſees the glory of heaven that is to come: now a Carnal heart hath no Contentment but from what he ſees before him in this world but a godly heart hath Contentment from that that he ſees laid up for him in the higheſt heavens.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I would name is this, <hi>A godly man hath Contentment by opening and letting out of his heart to God,</hi> other men or women they are diſcontented, but how do they help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? by rayling, by ill language, ſuch a one croſſes them, and they have no way to help themſelves but by railing and by bitter words, and ſo they eaſe themſelves that way when they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58996:43"/>
are angry, but a godly man when he is croſt, how doth he eaſe himſelf? he is ſenſible of his croſſe as well as you, and he goes to God in prayer, and there opens his heart to God, and lets out his ſorrows and fears, and then can come away with a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance; now do you find that you can come away from prayer and not look ſad? As it's ſaid (in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.) of <hi>Hannah,</hi> that when ſhe had been at prayer her countenance was no more ſad, there ſhe was comforted; and this is the right way of Contentment. Thus we have done with the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Contentment. Now if you can but put theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we have ſpoken of, you may ſee fully what an Art Chriſtian Contentment is; <hi>Paul</hi> had need learn it; you ſee Contentment is not ſuch a poor buſineſs as many make it, to ſay, you muſt be content &amp;c. But it is a great art and myſterie of godlineſs to be contented in the way of a Chriſtian, and it will appear yet further to be a myſterie, when we come to the Third Head; and that's to ſhew what thoſe leſſons are that a gracious heart doth learn when it learns to be contented. I have learn'd to be Contented; <hi>Learn'd,</hi> what leſſons have you lern'd? As now a Scholer that hath great learning and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in Arts and Sciences, how did he begin it? he began (as we uſe to ſay) his A B C, and then afterwards he came to his Teſtament, and Bible, and Accidence, and ſo to his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and afterwards to his other books; ſo he learn'd one thing after another: So a Chriſtian coming to Contentment is as a Scholer in Chriſts School, and there are divers leſſons to teach the ſoul to bring it to this learning: every godly man or woman is a ſcholer, it cannot be ſaid of any Chriſtian that he is illiterate, but he is litterate, a learned man, a learned wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: now the leſſons that Chriſt teaches, to bring us to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, are theſe:</p>
               <p>The Firſt great Leſſon is, The leſſon of <hi>Self-denial</hi>: and though it be a great leſſon and hard; as you know a child at firſt cries, It's hard. It's that that I remember <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever hath not learned the leſſon of the Croſs, hath not learned his A B C in Chriſtianity.</hi> Here Chriſt begins with his Scholers, yea thoſe in the loweſt form muſt begin with this; if you mean to be Chriſtian at all, you muſt buckle to this or you can never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58996:43"/>
be Chriſtians: There is none can be a Scholler except he doth learn his A B C: ſo thou muſt learn the leſſon of ſelf-denial or thou canſt never come to be a Scholler in Chriſts School, to be learned in this myſtery of Contentment: That's the firſt leſſon that Chriſt teaches any ſoul: Oh ſelf-denial that brings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that brings down and ſoftens a mans heart; a thing (you know) that's ſoft if you ſtrike upon it it makes no noiſe, but if you ſtrike upon a hard thing it makes a noiſe; ſo the hearts of men that are full of themſelves, and hardened with ſelf-love, if they have any ſtroak they make a noiſe, but a ſelf-denying Chriſtian yeilds to Gods hand, and makes no noiſe; as when you ſtrike upon a woolſack it makes no noiſe becauſe it yeilds to the ſtroke; So a ſelf-denying heart yeilds to the ſtroke and thereby comes to this Contentment. Now in this leſſon of ſelf-denial there are divers things, I will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Doctrine of ſelf-denial, but only ſhew you how Chriſt teaches ſelf-denial, and how that brings Contentment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such a one learns to know that he is nothing,</hi> he comes to this, to be able to ſay, Well, I ſee I am nothing in my ſelf, now that man or woman which indeed knows that he or ſhe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and hath learned it throughly will be able to bear any thing: The way to be able to bear any thing, it is to know our ſelves to be nothing in our ſelves. Saith God to us, <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which is nothing? Pro.</hi> 23.5. ſpeaking of riches; Why bleſſed God doſt not thou do ſo? thou haſt ſet thy heart upon us and yet we are nothing. God would not have us ſet our hearts upon riches becauſe they are nothing, and yet God is pleaſed to ſet his heart upon us, and yet we are nothing, that's Gods grace, free grace, and therefore it's no great matter what I ſuffer for I am as nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I deſerve nothing.</hi> I am nothing, and I deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: ſuppoſe I have not this and that that others have, I am ſure I deſerve nothing except it be Hell: you will anſwer any of your ſervants ſo that is not content, I marvell what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? or your children, Do you deſerve it that you are ſo eager upon it? you think to ſtop their mouthes thus; ſo we may eaſily ſtop our own mouthes, we deſerve nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we be impatient if we have not what we deſire,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58996:44"/>
if we had deſerved any thing, we might have ſome trouble of ſpirit, as a man that hath deſerved well of the State, or of his friends and he finds not an anſwerable incouragement, it troubles him mightily, but if he be conſcious to himſelf that he hath deſerved nothing he is content with a repulſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I can do nothing. Without me you can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. why ſhould I ſtand much upon it to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſcontented if I have not this and that, when the truth is I can do nothing? If you ſhould come to one that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery becauſe he hath not ſuch dyet as he deſires, and is diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it, you will anſwer him, I mervail what you do, what uſe you are of? Shall one that will ſit ſtill and be of no uſe, yet for all that he muſt have all the ſupply that poſſibly he can deſire? Do but conſider of what uſe you are in the world; if you conſider what little need God hath of you, and what little uſe you are of, you will not be much diſcontented: If you have learned this leſſon of ſelf-denials though God doth cut you ſhort of ſuch and ſuch comforts, yet ſince that I do but little why ſhould I have much, this very thought will bring down a mans ſpirit as much as any thing, That's the Third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>So vile I am that I can receive no good neither of my ſelf,</hi> I am not only an empty veſſel, but a corrupt and unclean veſſel that would ſpoil any thing that comes into it: ſo are all our hearts, every one of our hearts is not only empty of good, but are like a muſtie veſſel that if any good licquor be powred into it it ſpoils it, And that's the Fourth thing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If God doth cleanſe us in ſome meaſure, and doth put into us ſome good licquor ſome grace of his Spirit: yet in the <hi>fifth place, We can make uſe of nothing neither when we have it, if God doth but withdraw himſelf</hi>; If God doth but leave us one moment after he hath beſtowed upon us the greateſt gifts, and whatſoever abilities we can deſire, if God ſhould ſay, I wil give you them, now go and trade now I have given you theſe and theſe abilities, we cannot ſtir one foot further neither if God doth but leave us. Doth God give us gifts and parts? Then let us fear and tremble leaſt God ſhould leave us to our ſelves, for then how foully ſhould we abuſe thoſe gifts &amp; parts, you think other men and women have memorie and gifts and parts and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58996:44"/>
you would fain have them, But ſuppoſe God ſhould give you theſe and there leave you, you would utterly ſpoil them.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>We are worſe than nothing.</hi> For by ſin we come to be a great deal worſe than nothing; ſin makes us more vile than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſin makes us contrary to all good: now it's a great deal worſe to have a contrariety to all that is good, than meerly to have an emptineſs of al that is good, we are not empty pitchers in reſpect of good, but we are like pitchers fill'd with poiſon, and is it much for ſuch as we are to be cut ſhort of outward comforts?</p>
               <p>In the Seventh place, <hi>If we periſh there will no loſs of us.</hi> If God ſhould anihilate me what loſs would there be of me? God can raiſe up another in my place, to do him other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than I have done. Now put but theſe Seven things together and then hath Chriſt taught you Self-denial: I may call theſe the ſeveral words in our leſſon of Self-denial; Chriſt teaches the ſoul this, ſo that as in the preſence of God upon a real ſight of its ſelf it can ſay, Lord I am nothing, Lord I deſerve nothing, Lord I can do nothing, I can receive nothing, I can make uſe of nothing, I am worſe than nothing, and if I come to nothing and periſh, there will be no loſſe at all of me, and therefore what great matter is it for me to be cut ſhort here? A man that is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his own eyes, ſuch a man or woman will account every affliction to be little, and every mercy to be great: <hi>Saul,</hi> There was a time (the Scripture ſaith) that he was little in his own eyes, and then his afflictions were but little to him, when ſome would not have had him to be King but ſpake contemptuouſly of him he held his peace, but when <hi>Saul</hi> began to be big in his own eyes, then the affliction began to be great upon him. <hi>There was never any ſuch contented man or woman at this ſelf-denying man or woman</hi>: There was never any denied himſelf ſo much as Jeſus Chriſt did, he gave his cheeks to the ſmiters, he opened not his mouth, he was as a lamb when he was led to the ſlaughter, he made no noiſe in the ſtreet, Oh he denied himſelf above all, and was willing to empty himſelf, and ſo he was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that ever any was in the world, &amp; the neerer we come to learn to deny our ſelves as Chriſt did, the more contented ſhall we be, and by knowing much of our own vileneſs, we come to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58996:45"/>
learn to juſtifie God, whatever the Lord ſhall lay upon us, yet, righteous is the Lord, for he hath to deal with a moſt wretched creature. A diſcontented heart he is troubled becauſe he hath no more comfort; but one that is a ſelf-denying man he rather wonders that he hath ſo much as he hath: Oh ſaith one, I have but a little; I but ſaith he that hath learned this leſſon of Self-denial, I rather wonder that God beſtows upon me the liberty of breathing in the aire, knowing how vile I am, and knowing how much ſin the Lord doth ſee in me: And that's the way of Contentment, by learning Self-denial.</p>
               <p>Eightly, There is a further thing in ſelf-denial which brings Contentment, <hi>Becauſe thereby the Soul comes to rejoyce and take ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in all Gods waies,</hi> (I beſeech you obſerve this) If a man be ſelviſh and have Self-love prevail in his heart, thoſe things that ſuits with his own ends he will be glad of them, but a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man that hath denied himſelf he will ſuit with and be glad of all things that ſhall ſuit with Gods ends: Saith a gracious heart, Gods ends are my ends, and I have denied mine own ends, and ſo he comes to find Contentment in all Gods ends and waies, and his comforts are multiplyed, whereas the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of other men are ſingle, it's but very rare that Gods waies ſhall ſuit with a mans particular end, but alwaies Gods waies ſuit with his own ends; now if you wil only have contentment when Gods waies ſuits with your own ends, you can have it but now and then, but a Self-denying man denies his own ends and only looks at the ends of God and therein is contented: When a man is ſelviſh he cannot but have a great deal of trouble and vexation, for if I regard my ſelf, my ends are ſo narrow that I ſhall have a hundred things will come and juſſel me, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have room in thoſe narrow ends of mine own; as you know in the the City what a deal of ſtir there is in narrow ſtreets, as Thames ſtreet being ſo narrow they juſſel &amp; wrangle and fight one with another becauſe the place is ſo narrow, but now in the broad ſtreets there they can go quietly; ſo men that are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh they meet and ſo juſſel one with another, one man is for ſelf in one thing, and another man is for ſelf in another thing, and ſo they make a great deal of ſtir, but thoſe whoſe hearts are inlarged, and make publicke things their ends, and can deny

themſelves, they can walk at breadth and never juſſel one with another ſo as the other do. The leſſon of Self-denial is the firſt leſſon that Jeſus Chriſt doth learn men in the ſeeking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>The Second leſſon is, <hi>The vanity of the Creature.</hi> That's the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leſſon in Chriſts School that he teaches thoſe that he would make Scholers in this Art: The vanity of the Creature, That whatſoever there is in the Creature hath an emptines in it, <hi>Vanity of vanities all is vanity,</hi> that's the leſſon that the Wiſe-man learn'd, that the Creature in it's ſelf can do us neither good nor hurt, but it is all but as wind, there is nothing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ſutable to a gracious heart to feed upon for the good and hapdineſſe of it. My brethren the reaſon why you have not Contentment in the things of the world, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not enough of them, that's not the reaſon, but the reaſon is becauſe they are not things proportionable to that immortal ſoul of yours that are capable of God himſelf; many men think when they are troubled and have not Contentment that it is becauſe they have but a little in the world, and if they had more then they ſhould be content. That were juſt thus, ſuppoſe a man is an hungrie, and ſo ſatisfie his craving ſtomak he ſhould gape and hold open his mouth to take in the wind, and then ſhould think the reaſon why he is not ſatisfied is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not enough of the wind; no, the reaſon is becauſe the thing is not ſutable to a craving ſtomake, truly there is the ſame madneſſe in the world; the wind that a man takes in by gaping will as ſoon ſatisfie a craving ſtomake which is ready to famiſh, as all the comforts in the world can ſatisfie a ſoul that knows what true happineſſe means. You would be happy, and you ſeek after ſuch and ſuch comforts in the Creature; well, have you got them, do you find your hearts ſatisfied as having that happineſſe that is ſutable to you? No, no it is not here, but you think it is becauſe you want ſuch and ſuch things: O poor deluded man, it is not becauſe you have not enough of it, but becauſe it is not the thing that is proportionable to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul that God hath given you. <hi>Why do you lay out your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not bread,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55:2.) <hi>And your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> You are mad people, you ſeek to ſatisfie your
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58996:46"/>
ſtomaks with that that is not bread, you follow the wind, you will never have Contentment, all creatures in the world ſay, Contentment it not in us, riches ſaith Contentment is not in me, pleaſure ſaith Contentment is not in me, if you look for Contentment in the creature you will fail; No, Contentment is higher: When thou comeſt into the School of Chriſt, Chriſt teaches thee that there is a vanity in all things in the world, and the ſoul that by coming into the School of Chriſt, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel comes to ſee the vanity of all things in the world, that's the ſoul that comes to true Contentment. I could tell you of abundance of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences from Heathens that ſhews the vanity all things in the world, and yet they did not learn the vanity of the Creature in the right School. But now when a Soul comes into the School of Jeſus Chriſt, and there comes to ſee a vanity in all things in the world, then ſuch a ſoul comes to have Contentment. If you ſeek Contentment elſe where, you do like the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeek for reſt but find none.</p>
               <p>A Third leſſon that Chriſt teaches a Chriſtian when he comes into his School is this, <hi>He learns him to underſtand what that one thing is that is neceſſary which he never came to underſtand before</hi>: you know what he ſaid to <hi>Martha, O</hi> Martha <hi>thou cumbereſt thy ſelf about many things, but there is one thing neceſſary.</hi> The Soul before ſought after this and the other thing, but now ſaith the Soul I ſee really that it is not neceſſary that I ſhould be rich, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould make up my peace with God, it is not neceſſary that I ſhould live a pleaſurable life in this world, but it is abſolutely neceſſary that I ſhould have pardon of my ſin, it is not neceſſary that I ſhould have honour and preferment, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould have God to be my portion, and have my part in Jeſus Chriſt, it is neceſſary that my ſoul ſhould be ſav'd in the day of Jeſus Chriſt; the other things are pretty fine things indeed, and I ſhould be glad if God would give them me, a fine habitation, and comings-in, and cloaths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion for my wife and childrrn, theſe are comfortable things, but theſe are not the neceſſary things, I may have theſe and yet periſh for ever, but the other is abſolutely neceſſary; no matter though I be poor ſo be it I may have that that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58996:46"/>
neceſſary; thus Chriſt inſtructs the Soul. There's many of you have had ſome thoughts about this that it is indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to provide for your Souls, but when you come into Chriſts School, there Chriſt cauſes the fear of eternity to fall upon you, and there he cauſes ſuch a real ſight of the great things of eternity and the abſolute neceſſity of thoſe things, that poſſeſſes your hearts with fear, and that takes you off from all other things in the world. Now I ſhould have ſhewn you how that will bring Contentment to the Soul when it comes to be inſtructed in the thing that is abſolutly neceſſary; but thus much for this time.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, The right underſtanding of that one thing that is neceſſary. A little to inlarge this one, &amp; ſo to proceed to others.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Pompie,</hi> that when he was to carry corn to <hi>Rome</hi> in time of darth, he was in a great deal of danger by ſtorms at Sea, but ſaith he, We muſt go on, it is neceſſary that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be releived, but it is not neceſſary that we ſhould live. So it would he certainly when the ſoul is once taken up with the things that are of abſolute neceſſity, it will not be much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58996:47"/>
troubled about other things. What are the things that do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet us here but ſome by-matters in this world? and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our hearts are not taken up with that one abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thing; who are the men that are moſt diſcontented, but idle perſons, perſons that have nothing to take up their minds, every little thing diſquiets and diſcontents them? but now a man that hath buſineſſe of great weight and conſequence, if all things goes well with his great buſineſſe that is in his head, he is not ſenſible of meaner things in the family; but now a man that lies at home and hath nothing to do, he finds fault with every thing; ſo it is with the heart, when the heart of a man hath nothing to do but to be buſie about creature comforts, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little thing troubles him; but now, when the heart is taken up with the weighty things of eternity, with the great things of eternal life, the heart being taken up with them, theſe things that are here below that did diſquiet it before, are things now of no conſideration with him in compariſon to the other, ſo as how things fall out here is not much regarded with him, if the one thing that is neceſſary be provided for.</p>
               <p>The Fourth leſſon that the Soul is inſtructed in to come to this knowledge in the art of Contentment, is this: <hi>The ſoul comes to underſtand in what relation it ſtands in here to the world.</hi> By that I mean thus, <hi>God comes to inſtruct the ſoul effectually through Chriſt by his Spirit, upon what terms it lives here in the world, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it is that it doth ſtand</hi>: as thus, While I live in the world my condition is to be but a pilgrim, a ſtranger, a traveller, and a ſouldiar: now the right underſtanding of this, &amp; being taught this not only by rote, that I can ſpeak the words over, but when I come indeed to have my ſoul poſſeſt with the conſideration of this truth, that God hath ſet me in this world, not as in my home, but as a meer ſtranger and a pilgrim, that I am travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here to another home, and that I am here a ſouldier in my warfare; it is a mighty help to Contentment in whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls one: as now to inſtance in all theſe conditions, When a man is at home, if he hath not things according to his deſire he will be finding fault, and is not contented, but if a man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels abroad, perhaps he meets not with conveniences as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the ſervants in the houſe are not at his beck, or are not ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58996:47"/>
diligent as his own ſerveants were, and his dyet is not as at home, and his bed not as at home, yet this very thought may moderate a mans ſpirit, I am a traveller, and I muſt not be finding fault, I am but in another mans houſe, and it were not manners for one to find fault when he is abroad in another bodies family though things be not ſo as in my own family; If a man meets with ill weather he muſt be content, it is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers fare (we uſe to ſay) both fair weather and foul weather, this is the common travellers fare, and we muſt be content with it; but if a man were at home and it ſhould drop down in his houſe, he would account it an ill thing, an affliction to him, and he cannot bear it: but when he is travelling abroad though he meet with raine and ſtormes he is not ſo much troubled: When you are abroad at Sea, though you have not thoſe many things that you have at home, you are not troubled at it, you are contented; why? you are abroad at Sea, you are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at ſtorms that do ariſe, and though you have many things otherwiſe than you would have them at home, but ſtill you are quieted with that you are at Sea. Marriners when they are at Sea they care not what cloathes they have then, though they be pich't and tar'd, and but a clout about their necks, and any mean cloaths, but they think when they come home, then they ſhall have their fine ſilk ſtockings, and brave ſutes, &amp; lac'd bands and ſuch things, and ſhall be very fine; and ſo they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad upon that thought that it ſhall be otherwiſe with them when they come home, and though they have nothing but ſalt meat, and a little hard fare, yet when they come to their houſes then they ſhall have any thing: Thus it ſhould be with us in this world, the truth is, we are all in this world but as Sea-faring men, toſt up and down on the waves of the Sea of this world, and our haven is Heaven, and we are here travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but our home it is another world, that long home. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome men have better accommodations than others have in travelling; it's true, it's a great mercy of God to us in <hi>England,</hi> in that we can travell with ſuch delight and accommodations more than they can in other Countries; and through Gods mercy we have as great accommodations in our travelling to Heaven in England as any place under Heaven hath, but yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58996:48"/>
though we do meet with travellers fare ſometimes, yet it ſhould not be greiveous to us: The Scripture tels us plainly that we muſt behave our ſelves here but as pilgrims and ſtrangers, In 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 2.11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which war againſt the Soul</hi>: Conſider what your condition is, you are pilgrims and ſtrangers, do not think to ſatisfie your ſelves here. A man when he comes into an Inn, If there be a fair cupbord of plate he is not troubled that it is not his own, Why? Becauſe he is going away; ſo let us not be troubled when we ſee othar men have great eſtates, but we have not, why? we are going away into another Country, you are lodging here but as it were for a night, if you ſhould live an hundred yeers in compariſon of eternity it is not ſo much as a night, it is but as you were travelling, and were come into an Inn: And were not this a madneſſe for a man to be diſcontent becauſe he hath not what he ſees there, ſeeing it may be he is to go away again within half a quarter of an hour? So you find it in <hi>David,</hi> this was the argument that brought off <hi>Davids</hi> heart from the things of this world, and ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other manner of things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.19. <hi>I am a ſtranger in the earth, hide not thy Commandements from me</hi>: I am a ſtranger in the earth (what then) then Lord let me have the knowledge of thy Commandements and it's ſufficient, as for the things of the earth I ſtand not upon them whether I have much or little, but hide not thy Commandements from me, Lord let me know the rule that I ſhould guide my life by.</p>
               <p>Again, We are not only travellers but ſouldiers, this is the condition of the life in which we are here in this world: and therefore we are to behave our ſelves accordingly. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes uſe of this argument in writing unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſſe as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The very thought of the condition of a man that is a ſouldier, doth ſtill his diſquiet of heart: when he is abroad, he hath not that accomodations in his quarters as he hath in his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; perhaps a man that had his bed and curtains drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and all accomodations in his chamber; now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomtimes he muſt be put to lie upon ſtraw, and he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with himſelf, I am a ſouldier and it is ſutable to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58996:48"/>
he muſt have his bed warm'd at home, but he muſt lie abroad in the fields when he is a ſouldier; and the very thought of this condition in which he ſtands quiets him in all things; yea and he goes rejoycing, to think this is but ſutable to my condition in which God hath put me: ſo it ſhould be with us in reſpect of this world. Now would it not be an unſeemly thing to ſee a ſouldier go whyning up and down with the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the eye and complaying, that he hath not hot meat every meal, and his bed warm'd as he had at home. Now Chriſtians they know that they are in their warfare, they are here in this world fighting and combating with the enemies of their ſouls and eternal condition, and they muſt be willing to endure hardneſſe here. The right underſtanding of this, that God hath put them into ſuch a condition, it is that that will content them, eſpecially when they conſider that they are certain of the victory, and that ere long they ſhall triumph with Jeſus Chriſt, and then all their ſorrows ſhall be done away, and their tears wiped from their eyes. A ſouldier is content to endure hardneſſe though he knows not that he ſhall have the victory, but a Chriſtian knows himſelf to be a ſouldier, and knows that he ſhall conquer and triumph with Jeſus Chriſt to all eternity. And that's the fourth leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the ſoul when he brings it into his School, to learn the Art of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he makes him underſtand throughly the relation in which he hath placed him in, in this world.</p>
               <p>The Fifth leſſon that Chriſt teaches, it is this, <hi>He teacheth us wherein conſiſts any good that is to be enjoyed in any creature in the world.</hi> It's true, before it hath been taught that there is a vanity in the Creature, that is, take the Creature conſidered in it's ſelf, but yet though there be a vanity in the Creature in it's ſelf, in reſpect of ſatisfying the ſoul for it's portion, yet there is ſome goodneſſe in the Creature, though there be a vanity there's ſome deſirableneſſe: But wherein doth that conſiſt? It conſiſts not in the nature of the Creature it ſelf, for that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity, but it conſiſts in the reference it hath to the firſt being of all things. This is a Leſſon that Chriſt teaches, if there be any good in an eſtate, or in any comforts in this world, it is not ſo much that it pleaſes my ſence, that it is ſutable to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58996:49"/>
my body, but the reference it hath to God the firſt being, that by theſe creatures there ſhould be ſomewhat of Gods goodneſſe conveyed to me, and I may have a ſanctified uſe of the creature to draw me neerer to God, and that I enjoy more of God, and be made more ſervicable for the glory of God in the place where God hath ſet me, here's the good of the Creature; Oh were we but inſtructed in this leſſon, did we but underſtand, and throughly beleeve this to be a truth, that there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the world hath any goodneſſe in it any further then it hath reference to the firſt infinit ſupream good of all, that ſo far as I can enjoy God in it, ſo far it is good to me, and ſo far as I do not enjoy God in it, ſo far there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any thing that I have in the Creature, how eaſie were it then for one to be contented; as thus, Suppoſe a man had a great eſtate but a few years ago, and now it is all gone, I would but appeale to this man, when you had your eſtate, wherein did you account the good of that eſtate to conſiſt? a carnal heart would ſay, any body might know that; that it brought me in ſo much a year, and that I could fare of the beſt, and be a man of repute in the place where I live, and men would regard what I ſaid, I might be cloathed as I would, and lay up porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my children, in this conſiſted the good of my eſtate; this man now never came into the School of Chriſt to know wherein the good of an eſtate did conſiſt, no marvail if he be diſquieted when he hath loſt his eſtate: But now a Chriſtian that hath been in the School of Chriſt, and hath been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the art of Contentment, when ſuch a one hath an eſtate, he thinks, in that I have an eſtate above my brethren, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the good of it tome, in that I have an opportunity to ſerve God the better, and I enjoy a great deal of Gods mercy to my Soul conveyed to me through the Creature, and hereby I am inabled to do a great deal of good, and therein I account the good of my eſtate. Now God hath taken this away from me, now if God will be pleaſed to make up the enjoyment of himſelf another way; that is, will call me to honour him by ſuffering, and if I may do God as much ſervice now in my way of ſuffering, that is to ſhew forth the Grace of his Spirit in the way of my ſuffering as I did in the way of proſperity, I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58996:49"/>
have as much of God as I had before; if I may be led to God in my low condition, as much as I was in my proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have as much comfort and contentment as I had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you wil ſay, it is true, If I could honour God in my low eſtate as much as in my proſperous eſtate then it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but how can that be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt know the ſpecial honour that God hath from his creatures in this world, it is the manifeſtation of the Graces of his Spirit; It's true, God hath a great deal of honour when a man is in a publick place, and ſo he is able to do a great deal of good, to countenance Godlineſſe, and diſcountenance Sin, but the main thing is in our <hi>ſhewing forth the vertues of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> Now if I can ſay that through Gods mercy in my affliction I find the Graces of Gods Spirit working as ſtrongly in me as ever they did when I had my eſtate, I am where I was, yea I am fully in as good a condition, for I have that good now that I had in my proſperous eſtate, for I accounted the good of it but in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, and honouring of God, and now God hath bleſt the want of it to ſtir up the Graces of his Spirit in my ſoul, and this is the work that now God cals me to, and I muſt account God is moſt honoured when I do the work that he cals me to, he ſet me a work in my proſperous eſtate at that time, to honour him in that condition, and now he ſets me a work at this time to honour him in this condition: Now God is moſt honoured when I can turn from one condition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according as he cals me to it: would you account your ſelves to be honoured by your ſervants, when you ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a work that hath ſome excellency, and they will go on and on, and you cannot get them off from it? Now let the work be never ſo good, yet if you will call them off to another work you do expect that they ſhould manifeſt ſo much reſpect to you as to be content to come off from that, though they be ſet about a meaner work, if it be more ſutable to your ends. So you were in a proſperous eſtate, and there God called you to ſome ſervice that you took ſome pleaſure in; but ſuppoſe God ſaith, I will uſe you in a ſuffering condition, and I will have you honour me in that way, now here's the honouring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58996:50"/>
of God that you can turn this way or that way, as God cals you to it; thus now you having learned this, That the good of the Creature canſiſts in the enjoyment of God in it, and the honouring of God by it, you can be content, becauſe you have the ſame good that you had before. And that's the Fifth leſſon.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the ſoul that hee brings into this School, is this, <hi>Hee doth inſtruct ſuch a man or woman in the knowledge of their own hearts</hi>: you muſt learn this or you will never learn Contentment; you muſt learn to know your own hearts well, to be good ſtudients of your own hearts, you cannot al be ſcholers in the arts and ſciences in the world, but you may all be ſtudents in your own hearts, you cannot reade in the book (many of you,) but God expects that every day you ſhould turn over a leaf in your own hearts; you will never come to get any skil in this Myſterie, except you ſtudy the book of your own hearts: Marriners, they have their books that they ſtudy, thoſe that will be good Navigaters, and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers they have their books; thoſe that ſtudy Logick, they have their books according to that; and thoſe that would ſtudy Rhetorick and Philoſophy have their books according to that; and thoſe that ſtudy Divinity, they have their books whereby they come to be helped in the ſtudy of Divinity: but a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an next to the book of God is to look into the book of his own heart, and to reade over that, and this will help you to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment theſe three waies:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the ſtudying of thy <hi>heart,</hi> thou wilt come preſently <hi>to diſcover wherein thy diſcontent lies</hi>; when thou art diſcontented, thou wilt find out the root of any diſcontentment if thou doeſt ſtudy thy heart well: many men and women they are diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the truth is they know not wherfore, they think this &amp; the other thing is the cauſe, but a man or woman that knows their own heart, they will find out preſently where the root of their diſcontent lies, that it lies in ſuch a corruption, and diſtemper of my heart, that now through Gods mercie I have found out; It is in this caſe as it is with a little child that is very froward in the houſe, if a ſtranger comes in he doth not know what the matter is, perhaps the ſtranger will give the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58996:50"/>
child a rattle, or a nut, or ſuch a thing to quiet it, but when the Nurſe comes ſhe knows the temper and diſpoſition of the Child, and therefore knows beſt how to quiet it; ſo it is here juſt thus for all the world, when we are ſtrangers with our own hearts we are mightily diſcontented, and know not how to quiet our ſelves, becauſe we know not wherein the diſquiet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and indeed when we are ſtrangers to our own hearts we cannot tell how to quiet our ſelves, but if we be very well verſt in our own hearts, when any thing fals out ſo as to diſquiet us, we find out the cauſe of it preſently, and ſo quickly come to be quiet. So a man that hath a Watch, and he underſtands the uſe of every wheel and pin, if it goes amiſſe he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find out the cauſe of it: but one that hath no skill in a Watch, when it goes amiſſe he knows not what the matter is, and therefore cannot mend it. So indeed our hearts are as a Watch, and there are many wheels, and windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings there, and we ſhould labour to know our hearts well, that when they are out of tune we may know what the matter is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This knowledge of our hearts wil help us to Contentment becauſe by this <hi>we ſhall come to know what is moſt ſutable to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> As thus, a man that knows not his own heart he thinks not what need he hath of affliction, and upon that he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted; but that man or woman that hath ſtudied their own hearts, when God comes with afflictions upon them, they can ſay, I would not for any thing in the world have been without this affliction, God hath ſo ſuted this affliction to my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath come in ſuch a way, that if this affliction had not come I am affraid I ſhould have fallen into ſin; a poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man that takes Phiſick, the Phiſick works, and he thinks it will kill him, becauſe he knows not the ill humours that are in his body, and therefore he underſtands not how ſutable the Phyſick is to him; but a Phyſitian takes a purge, and it makes him extreamly ſick, ſaith the Phyſitian I like this the better, it doth but work upon the humour that I know is the matter of my diſeaſe, and upon that ſuch a man that hath knowledge and underſtanding in his body, and the cauſe of his diſtemper, he is not troubled or diſquieted: So would we be if we did but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58996:51"/>
know the diſtempers of our own hearts, carnal men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they know not their own ſpirits, and therefore they fling and vex upon every affliction that doth befall them, they know not what diſtempers are in their hearts that may be healed by their afflictions, if it pleaſe God to give them a ſanctified uſe of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By knowing their own hearts, <hi>they know what they are able to manage,</hi> and by this means they come to be Content; the Lord perhaps takes away many comforts from them that they had before, or denies them ſome things that they hoped to have got; now they by knowing their hearts know this, that they were not able to mannage ſuch an eſtate, and they were not able to mannage ſuch proſperity, God ſaw it, and (ſaith a poor ſoul) I am in ſome meaſure convinced by looking into mine own heart, that I was not able to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nage ſuch a condition. A man deſires greedily to gripe more perhaps than he is able to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nage, and ſo undoes himſelf: as countrey men do obſerve, that if they doe over-ſtock their Land it will quickly ſpoyl them, and ſo a wiſe Husband-man that knows how much his ground will bear he is not troubled that he hath not ſo much ſtock as others, why? becauſe he knows he hath not ground enough for ſo great a ſtock, and that quiets him; ſo many men and women that know not their own hearts, they would fain have a proſperous eſtate as others have, but if they knew their own hearts they would know that they were not able to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it: if one of your little children of three or four yeers old ſhould be crying for the coat of her that is twelve or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers old, and ſay, why may not I have a coat as long as my ſiſters? If ſhe had, it would ſoon trip up her heels, and break her face, but when the Child comes to underſtanding ſhe is not diſcontented, becauſe her coat is not ſo long as her ſiſters, but ſaith, my coat is fit for me, and therein takes Content; So if we come to underſtanding in the School of Chriſt we will not cry, why have not I ſuch an eſtate as others have? the Lord ſeeth that I am not able to mannage it, and I ſee it my ſelf by the knowing of mine own heart. You ſhall have children if they ſee but a knife, they will cry for it becauſe they know not their ſtrength and that they are not able to mannage it, but you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58996:51"/>
know they are not able to mannage it, and therefore you will not give it them, and when they come to ſo much underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to know that they are not able to mannage it, they will not cry for it; ſo we would not cry for ſuch and ſuch things if we knew that we were not able to mannage them: when you vex and fret for what you have not, I may ſay to you as Chriſt ſaith, you know not of what ſpirits you are. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to <hi>Parillus,</hi> ſaith he (when they were ſpeaking about his extream poverty,) <hi>Not ſo poor, though I have been very poor, yet I would be poorer, I could be willing to be poorer than I am,</hi> for the truth is (as if he ſhould ſay) the Lord knew that that was more ſutable to me, and I knew that my own heart was ſuch, that a poor condition was more ſutable to me than a rich; ſo certainly would we ſay if we knew our own hearts, that ſuch and ſuch a condition is better for me than if it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>The Seventh leſſon, <hi>Is the burden of a proſperous eſtate.</hi> Such a one that comes into Chriſt's School to be inſtructed in this Art, never comes to attain to any great skill in this Art untill he comes to underſtand the burden that is in a proſperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, What burden is there in a proſperous eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly a great burden, and there needs a great ſtrength to bear it: as men had need of ſtrong brains that can bear ſtrong wine, ſo they had need of ſtrong ſpirits that are able to bear proſperous conditions, and not to do themſelves hurt; there's a fourfold burden in a proſperous eſtate. Many men and women look at the ſhine and glittering of proſperity, but they little think of the burden, but there's a fourfould bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There's <hi>A burden of trouble.</hi> A roſe hath it's prickles, and ſo the Scripture ſaith that he that will be rich pierceth himſelf through with many ſorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. If a mans heart be ſet upon it that he muſt be rich, and he will be rich, ſuch a man will pierce himſelf through with many ſorrows; he looks upon the delight and glory of riches that appears outwardly, but he conſiders not what piercing ſorrows he may meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58996:52"/>
in them: The conſideration of the trouble in a proſperous condition I have divers times thought of, and I cannot tell by what ſimilitude to expreſſe it better than by travelling in ſome champian country, where round about is very fair and ſandy ground, and you ſee there a Town a great way off in a bottom, and you think, Oh how bravely is that Town ſeated, but when you come and ride into the Town, you ſhall ride through a dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lane and through a company of fearful durty holes, and you could not ſee the durty lane and holes when you were two or three miles off; ſo ſometimes we look upon the proſperity of men and think ſuch a man lives bravely and comfortably, but if we did but know what troubles he meets withal in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his eſtate, in his dealings with men, we would not think his condition ſo happy. One may have a very fine new ſhoe, but no body knows where it pinches him but he that hath it on; ſo you think ſuch and ſuch men are happy, but they may have many troubles that you little think of.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>There is a burden of danger in it.</hi> Men that are in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition they are in a great deal of danger, you ſee ſome times in the evening when you light up your candles, the mothes and the gnats will be flying up and down in the candle, but they ſcorch their wings, and there they fal down dead; ſo there is a great deal of danger in a proſperous eſtate, thoſe men that are ſet upon a Pinacle on high, theſe men they are in greater danger than other men are. Honey we know doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Bees and Waſps unto it, and ſo the ſweet of proſperity doth invite the Devil and temptation. Men that are in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous eſtate are ſubject to many temptations that other men are not ſubject to. The Scripture cals the Devil Beelzebub, that is the god of flies, &amp; ſo <hi>Beelzebub</hi> come where the honey of proſperity is, they are in very great danger of temptations that are in a proſperous condition. The dangers of men that are in a proſperous eſtate that have more than others, ſhould be conſidered of by thoſe that are lower, think with thy ſelfe, though they be above me, yet they are in more danger than I am, the tal trees are more ſhattered a great deal than low ſhrubs, ſo you know the ſhip that hath all the ſails up, the top ſail &amp; all in a ſtorm, this is in more danger than that that hath al the ſails
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58996:52"/>
drawn in: And ſo men that have their Top-gallant, and all up and brave, they are more like to be drown'd, drown'd in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than other men are; and therefore you know what the Scripture ſaith, how hard it is for rich men to go into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven: ſuch a text ſhould make poor people to be contented with their eſtates. We have a notable example for that in the Children of <hi>Kohath,</hi> you ſhall find that they were in a more excellent eſtate than the other of the Levites, but they were in more danger than the other, and more trouble.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Children of <hi>Kohath</hi> were in a higher conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than other of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that I'le ſhew you out of the fourth of <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. verſ. there you ſhall find what their condition was. <hi>This ſhall be the ſervice of the ſons of</hi> Kohath <hi>in the Tabernacle of the Congregation about the moſt holy things.</hi> Mark, the Levites were exerciſed about <hi>holy things</hi>; but the ſons of <hi>Kohath,</hi> their ſervice was about the <hi>moſt holy things</hi> of all: and you ſhall find in the 21. of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> verſ. 10. That God did honour the ſons of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath</hi> in a more ſpecial manner than he did honor the other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, which honour the Children of <hi>Aaron</hi> (being of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> who were of the Children of <hi>Levi</hi>) had, for theirs was the firſt lot, and they were prefer'd before the other families of <hi>Levi,</hi> thoſe that were imployed in the moſt honourable imployment, they had the moſt honourable Lot, the firſt Lot fell to them: thus you ſee God honoured the Children of the <hi>Kohathites.</hi> But (might other Levites ſay) how hath God prefer'd this family before us? They were honoured more than the other were: But now, mark their burden that comes in with their honour, and that I'le ſhew you out of two Scriptures, the firſt is, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took the Wagons and the Oxen, and gave them unto the</hi> Levites. <hi>Two wagons and four oxen be gave unto the ſons of</hi> Gerſhom, <hi>according to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the ſons of</hi> Merari, <hi>according unto their ſervice, under the hand of</hi> Ithamer <hi>the ſon of</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>the Prieſt.</hi> But ſaith he in the 9. verſ. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the ſons of</hi> Kohath <hi>he gave none; becauſe the ſervice of the Sanctuary that belonged unto them, was, that they ſhould bear upon their ſhouldiers.</hi> Mark, the other Levites had oxen, and wagons given to them, to eaſe them of their ſervice: but (ſaith he) to the ſons of <hi>Kohath</hi> he gave none,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58996:53"/>
but they ſhould bear their ſervice upon their ſhoulders; and that's the reaſon why God was ſo diſpleaſed, becauſe that they would have more eaſe in Gods ſervice than God would have them, for whereas they ſhould carry it upon their ſhoulders, they would carry it upon a cart: Mark here, you ſee the firſt burden that they had, beyond what the other Levites had. And thoſe indeed that are in more honourable places than others, thoſe that are under them think not of their burden that they are to carry upon their ſhoulders, when as others have means to eaſe them; and many times thoſe that are imployed in the Miniſtrie, or Majeſtracie, that ſit at the ſtern to order the great Affairs of the Common-wealth and State, you think they live bravely: they lie awake when you are aſleep; if you knew the burden that lies upon their ſpirits, you would think that your labour and burden were verie little in compariſon of theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's another burden of danger more than the reſt, and that you ſhall find in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the</hi> Kohathites <hi>from among the</hi> Levites, <hi>but thus do unto them that they may live and not die: When they approch unto the moſt holy things,</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons ſhall go in and appoint them every one to his ſervice and to his burden; but they ſhall not go in to ſee when the holy things are covered, leſt they die.</hi> Mark this text: ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Cut ye not off the tribe of the family of the <hi>Kohath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> from among the <hi>Levites.</hi> Cut them not off, why? what had they done? had they done any thing amiſſe? no, they had not done any thing that provoked God: but the meaning is this; Take a great care of the family of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> to inſtruct them in their duty that they were to do; for (ſaith God) they are in a great deal of danger, being to ſerve in the moſt holy things: if they ſhould go in to ſee the holy things more than God would have them, it is as much as their lives are worth, and therefore if you ſhould but neglect them, and not inform them thorowly in their duty they would be undone: (ſaith God) they are to adminiſter in the moſt holy things, and if they ſhould but dare to preſume to do any thing otherwiſe than God would have them about thoſe ſervices, it would coſt them their lives; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58996:53"/>
therefore be not you careleſſe of them, for if you neglect them you will be a means of cutting them off. Thus you ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the family of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> were in; they were prefer'd before others, but they were in more danger. So you think there are ſuch men in a pariſh that bear the ſway, and are implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed in publick ſervice, and they carry all before them; but you conſider not their danger. And ſo the Miniſters, they ſtand in the fore-front of all the ſpight and mallice of ungodly men: indeed God imployes them in honourable ſervice, and that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the Angels would take delight in; but though the ſervice be honourable, above the imployment of other works, yet the burden of danger, that likewiſe is greater than the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of men that are in an inferiour condition. Now when the Soul comes to get wiſdom from Chriſt to think of the danger that it is in, then it wil be content with that low eſtate in which it is. A poor man that is in a low condition, thinks, I am low, and others are raiſed, but I know not what their burden is: and ſo, if he be rightly inſtructed in the ſchool of Chriſt he coms to be contented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I a proſperous eſtate there is the burden of duty.</hi> You look only at the ſweet and comfort that they have, and the honour and reſpect that they have that are in a proſperous condition; but you muſt conſider of the duty that they owe to God: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more duty at their hands than at yours, you are ready to be diſcontented that you have not ſuch parts and abilities as ſuch have, but God requires more duty of them that have more parts, God requires more duty of them that have greater eſtates than of you that have not ſuch eſtates: Oh you would faine have the honour, but can you carrie the burden of the duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt is, <hi>The burden of account in a proſperous eſtate.</hi> There is a great account that they are to give to God that enjoy great eſtates and a proſperous condition: Now we are all ſtewards, and one is a ſteward to a meaner man, perhaps but an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knight; another is a ſteward to a Noble-man, an Earle: now the ſteward of the meaner man, he hath not ſo much as the other hath under his hand: now ſhall he be diſcontented becauſe there comes not ſo much under his hand as under the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58996:54"/>
others? No thinks he I have leſſe, and I am to give the leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: So your account in compariſon of the Miniſters and Magiſtrates will be nothing; you are to give an account of your own ſouls, and ſo are they, you are to give an account for your own family, and ſo are they, but you are not to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for Congregations, and for Towns, and Cities, and Countries. You think of Princes and Kings, Oh! what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition they are in. But what do you think of a King to give account for all the diſorder and wickedneſſe in a Kingdom that he poſſibly might have prevented? What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of glory might a Prince bring to God if ſo be that he bent his ſoul and all his thoughts to lift up the Name of God in a Kingdom; now what God loſes for want of this, that King, Prince, or Governour he muſt give an account for. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in that place of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> where it's ſaid that men muſt give an account for their ſouls, he wonders that any men in publick place can be ſaved, becauſe their account is ſo great that they are to give. And I remember I have read a ſpeech of <hi>Philip</hi> that was King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (though the ſtory ſaith of him, that he had ſuch a natural conſcience, that he profeſt he would not do any thing againſt his conſcience, no not in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for the gaining of the world, yet when this man was to die) Oh ſaith he, that I had never been a King; Oh that I had liv'd a ſollitary and privat life all my daies; then ſhould I have died a great deal more ſecurely, I ſhould with more confidence have gone before the Throne of God to give my account: but here's the fruit of my kingdom, that I had all the glory of it, it hath made my account to be harder to give to God: and thus he cries out when he was to die. And therefore you that live in private conditions remember this, If you come into Chriſt's School, and be taught this leſſon, you will be quiet in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or private eſtate, in regard your account is not ſo great as others. It's a ſpeech I remember I have met withall in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timers</hi> Sermons that he was wont to uſe, <hi>The half is more than the whole.</hi> That is, when a man is in a mean condition, he is but halfe way towards the height of proſperity that others are in: yet ſaith he, this is more ſafe though it be a meaner condition than others. Thoſe that are in a high and proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58996:54"/>
there is anexed to it the burden of trouble, and of danger and of duty, and of account. And thus you ſee how Chriſt traines up his Scholers in his School, and though they be weak otherwiſe, yet by his Spirit he gives them wiſdom to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe aright.</p>
               <p>The Eight leſſon is this, <hi>Chriſt teaches them what a great and dreadful evil it is to be given up to ones hearts deſires.</hi> The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this leſſon that it is a moſt dreadful evil, one of the moſt hideous and fearfull evills that can befall any man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, for God to give him up to his hearts deſires: when the ſoul underſtands this once, and together with it, (for it goes along together) that ſpiritual judgments are more fearfull than any outward judgments in the world, the underſtanding of this will teach any one to be content in Gods croſſing of them in their deſires. Thou art croſt in thy deſires, now thou art diſcontented and vext and fretted at it, is that thy only miſery that thou art croſt in thy deſires? no no, thou art infinitly miſtaken, the greateſt miſery of all is for God to give thee up to thy hearts luſts and deſires, to give thee up to thine own counſells: ſo you have it in <hi>Pſal,</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me</hi> [what then?] <hi>So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> Oh ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> let me not have ſuch a miſerie as that is, for to give me what I would have, to give me my hearts deſires, it is one of the moſt hideous judgments in the world for a man to be given up to his hearts deſires. We have not indeed in Scripture any certain evident ſign of a reprobate, we cannot ſay except we knew a man had committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that he is a reprobate, for we know not what God may work upon him, but the neereſt of all and the blackeſt ſign of a reprobate is this, for God to give up a man to his hearts deſires, all the pain of diſeaſes, all the calamities that can be thought of in the world, are no judgments in compariſon of this, for a man to be given up to his hearts deſires; now when the Soul comes to underſtand this, the Soul then cries out, why am I ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I have not my deſires? There is nothing that God conveys his wrath more through than a proſperous eſtate.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58996:55"/>
I remember I have read of a Jewiſh Tradition that they ſay of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> when God ſtruck <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> with a Leproſie, they ſay that the beams of the Sun was darted upon the fore-head of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> and he was ſtruck with a Leproſie by the darting of the beams of the Sun upon his fore-head; the Scripture ſaith, Indeed the Prieſts looked upon him; but they ſay there was a ſpeciall light and beam of the Sun upon the fore-head that did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Leproſie to the Prieſts, and they ſay it was the way of conveying of it. Whether that were true or no, I am ſure this is true, that the ſtrong beams of the Sun of proſperity upon many men makes them to be leprous; would any poor man in the countrey have been diſcontented that he was not in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziahs</hi> condition? he was a great King, I but there was the Leproſie in his fore-head, the poor man may ſay, though I live meanly in the countrey yet I thank God my body is whole and ſound, would not any man rather have ruſſet and skins of beaſts to cloath him with, than to have ſattin and velvet that ſhould have the Plague in it; The Lord conveys the plague of his curſe through proſperity, as much as through any thing in the world, and therefore the ſoul coming to underſtand this, this makes it to be quiet and content.</p>
               <p>And then ſpirituall judgments are the greateſt judgments of all; the Lord laies ſuch an affliction upon my outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but what if he had taken away my life, a mans health is a greater mercy than his eſtate, and you that are poor people you ſhould conſider of that; but is the health of a mans body better than his eſtate? what is the health of a mans ſoul? that's a great deal better; the Lord hath inflicted externall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he hath not inflicted ſpirituall judgments upon thee, he hath not given thee up to hardneſſe of heart, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the ſpirit of prayer from thee in thine afflicted eſtate, Oh then be of good comfort though there be outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon thee, yet thy ſoul, thy more excellent part is not affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Now when the ſoul comes to underſtand this, that here lies the ſore wroth of God to be given up to a mans deſires, and for ſpiritual judgments to be upon a man, this quiets him, and contents him, though outward afflictions be upon him; perhaps one of a mans children hath the fit of an ague, or the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58996:55"/>
tooth-ach, but perhaps his next neighbour hath the plague, or all his Children are dead of the plague, now ſhall he be ſo diſcontented, becauſe his Children have the tooth-ach when his neighbours Children are dead? now think thus, Lord thou haſt laid an afflicted condition upon me, but Lord thou haſt not given me the plague of a hard heart. Now take theſe Eight things before mentioned, and lay them together, and you may well apply that Scripture in the 29. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> the laſt verſe, ſaith the text there, <hi>They alſo that erred in ſpirit, ſhall come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and they that murmured ſhall learn doctrine.</hi> Hath there bin any of you (as I fear many may be found) that have erred in ſpirit, even in regard of this truth that now we are preaching of, and many that have murmured, Oh that this day you might come to underſtand, that Chriſt would bring you into his School, and seach you underſtanding, <hi>And they that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured ſhall learn doctrine</hi>: what doctrine ſhall they learn?

way the univerſality of providence in every particular paſſage from morning to night every day; that there's not any thing that doth befall thee but there's a hand of God in it, it is from God, it is a mighty furtherance to Contentment. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will grant the truth of the thing that it is ſo, but as the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By faith we underſtand that the worlds were made,</hi> by faith we underſtand it: why by faith? we can underſtand by reaſon that no finit thing can be from it ſelfe, And therefore that the world could not be of it's ſelf, but we can underſtand it by faith in another manner than by reaſon. So whatſoever we underſtand of God in way of providence, yet when Chriſt doth take us into his School we come to underſtand it by faith in a better manner than we do by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The efficacy that there is in providence</hi>; that is, That the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God goes on in all things with ſtrength and power, and it is not to be altered by our power; let us be diſcontented and vext and troubled, and fret, and rage, yet we muſt not think to alter the courſe of providence by our diſcontent. Some of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſaid to him, <hi>Shall the earth be forſaken for thee, and ſhall the rock be removed out of his place? Job,</hi> 18.4. when they ſaw him to be impatient. So I may ſay to every diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented impatient heart, what ſhall the providence of God change it's courſe for thee? Do'ſt thou think it ſuch a weak thing that becauſe it doth not pleaſe thee it muſt alter it's courſe? be thou content or not content, the providence of God will go on, it hath an efficacie of power, of vertue, to carry all things before it: Canſt thou make one hair black or white with all the ſtir that thou keepeſt? When you are in a ſhip at Sea that hath all her ſails ſpread with a full gale of wind, and ſwiftly ſailing; can you make it ſtand ſtill with running up and down in the ſhip? No more can you make the providence of God to alter and change it's courſe with your vexing and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but it will go on with power do what thou canſt. Do but underſtand the power and efficacie of providence and it will be a mighty means for the helping to learn this leſſon of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The infinite variety of the works of providence,</hi> and yet <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58996:57"/>
of things, one working towards another</hi>; there is infinite variety of the works of God in an ordinary providence, and yet all work in an ordinary way; we put theſe two together; for God in the way of his providence cauſes a thouſand thouſand things one to depend upon another, there are infinite ſeveral wheels (as I may ſo ſay) in the works of providence, all the works that ever God did from all eternity or ever will do, put them all together, and all make up but one work, and they have been as ſeveral wheels that have had their orderly motion to attain the end that God from all eternity hath appointed: We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed look at things by pieces, we look at one particular and do not conſider the reference that one thing hath to another, but God he looks at all things at once, and ſees the reference that one thing hath to another: As a child that looks upon a clock, looks firſt upon one wheel, and then upon another wheel, he looks not at all together or the dependance that one hath upon another, but the workman hath his eyes upon all together and ſees the dependance of all one upon another, and the art that there is in the dependance of one upon another; ſo it is in Gods providence. Now obſerve how this works to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; where there is ſuch a paſſage of providence befalls me, that's one wheel, and it may be if this wheel ſhould be ſtopt, there might a thouſand other wheels come to be ſtopt by this: as in a clock, ſtop but one wheel and you ſtop every wheel, becauſe they have dependance one upon another: ſo when God hath ordered a thing for the preſent to be thus and thus, how do'ſt thou know how many things do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thing? God may have ſome work that he hath to do twenty yeers hence that may depend upon this paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that fals out this day, or this week. And here (by the way) we may ſee a great deal of evil that there is in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for thou wouldeſt have Gods providence altered in ſuch and ſuch a particular, indeed if it were only in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that had reference to nothing elſe it were not ſo much, but by thy deſire to have thy will in ſuch a particular, it may be thou wouldeſt croſſe God in a thouſand things that he hath to bring about, becauſe it's poſſible there may be a thouſand things depend upon that one thing that thou wouldeſt fain
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58996:57"/>
have to be otherwiſe than it is, juſt as if a child ſhould cry out and ſay, let but that one wheel ſtop, though he ſaith but one wheel, yet if that ſtop, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay they muſt all ſtop; ſo in providence, let but this one paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſtop, it is as much as if a thouſand ſtopt: Let me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be quiet and content, for though I be croſt in ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular God attains his end, at leaſt his end may be furthered in a thouſand things by this one thing that I am croſt in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let a man conſider this is an act of providence, and how do I know what God is about to do, and how many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this providence? Now we are willing to ſuffer our friends will to be croſt in one thing, ſo that our friend may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what he deſires in a thouſand things; if thou haſt a love and friendſhip to God, be willing to be croſt in ſome few things, that the Lord may have his work go on in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, in a thouſand of other things. Now that's the Third thing to be underſtood in Gods providence, that Chriſt doth learn thoſe that he teacheth in the Art of Contentment.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſt teaches them the knowledge of providence, that is, <hi>The knowledge of Gods uſual way in his dealings with his people more particularly.</hi> The other is, the knowledge of God in his providence in general: But the right underſtanding of the way of God in his providence towards his people and Saints, is a notable leſſon to help us in the Art of Contentment. If we come once to know a mans way and courſe we may better ſute and be contented to live with him, than before we come to know his way and courſe: as when a man comes to live in a ſociety with men and women, it may be the men and women may be good, but till a man comes to know their way and courſe and diſpoſition, many things may fall very croſſe, and we think they are very hard, but when we come to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their way and ſpirit, then we can ſute and cotten with them very well; and the reaſon of our trouble is, becauſe we do not underſtand their way. So it is with you, thoſe that are but as ſtrangers to God, and do not underſtand the way of God, they are troubled with the providences of God, and they think them very ſtrange and cannot tell what to make of them, becauſe they underſtand not the ordinary courſe and way of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58996:58"/>
God towards his people. If a ſtranger ſometimes comes into a family and ſees ſuch and ſuch things done, he wonders what the matter is, but thoſe that are acquainted with it, it troubles them not at all. So ſervants, when they come firſt together and know not one another, it may be they are froward and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but when they come to be aquainted with one anothers waies, then they are more contented: juſt ſo it is when we come firſt to underſtand Gods waies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, What do you underſtand by Gods waies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> By that I mean theſe Three things. And when we come to know them we ſhall not wonder ſo much at the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, but be quiet and contented with them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Firſt thing is this, <hi>Gods ordinary courſe is, that his people in this world ſhould be in an afflicted condition</hi>: God hath revealed in his Word, and we may there find he hath ſet down to be his ordinary way even from the begining af the world to this day, (but more eſpecially in the times of the Goſpel,) that his people here ſhould be in an afflicted condition. Now men that do not underſtand this, they ſtand and wonder to hear of the people of God that they are afflicted, and the enemies proſper in their way; for thoſe that ſeek God in his way, and ſeek for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for them to be afflicted and routed and ſpoiled, and the enemies to prevail, they wonder at it: but now, one that is in the School of Chriſt, he is taught by Jeſus Chriſt that God by his eternal Counſels hath ſet this to be his courſe and way, to bring up his people in this world in an afflicted condition, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Account it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. We are not therefore to be diſcontented with it ſeeing God hath ſet ſuch a courſe and way, &amp; we know ſuch is the will of God that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>The Second thing that is in Gods way is this, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually when God intends the greateſt mercy to any of his people, he doth bring them into the loweſt condition.</hi> God doth ſeem to go quite croſſe and work in a contrary way; when he intends the greateſt mercies to his people he doth firſt uſually bring them into very low conditions, if it be a bodily mercy, an outward mercy that he intends to beſtow he uſeth to bring them bodily low, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58996:58"/>
low, if it be a mercie in their eſtates that he intends to beſtow, he brings them low in that and then raiſes them; and in their names he brings them low there, and then raiſes them, and in their Spirits God doth ordinarily bring their Spirits low and then raiſes their ſpirits, uſually the people of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greateſt comforts have the greateſt afflictions and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, now thoſe that underſtand not Gods waies they think that when God brings his people into ſad conditions, that God leaves and forſakes them, and that God doth intend no great matter of good to them; but now a Child of God that is inſtructed in this way of God, he is not troubled; my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very low, but (ſaith he) this is Gods way when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the greateſt mercy, to bring men under the greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. When he intended to raiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be the Second in the Kingdom, God caſt him into a dungeon a little before. So when God intended to raiſe <hi>David</hi> and ſet him upon the Throne, he made him to be hunted as a partrige in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.20. God went this way with his Son; Chriſt himſelf went into glory by ſuffering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.20. And if God deal ſo with his own Son, much more with his people; as a little before break of day you ſhall obſerve it is darker than it was any time before; ſo God doth uſe to make our conditions darker a little before the mercy come. When God beſtowed the laſt great mercy at <hi>Nazby,</hi> we were in a very low condition, God knew what he had to do before-hand, he knew that his time was coming for great mercies; it is the way of God to do ſo. Be but inſtructed aright in this courſe and tract that God uſes to walk in; and that will help us to Contentment excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>The Third thing that there is in Gods way and courſe is this, <hi>It is the way of God to work by contraries, to turn the greateſt evill into the greateſt good.</hi> To grant great good after great evil is one thing, and to turn great evils into the greateſt good that's another; and yet that's Gods way, the greateſt good that God intends for his people, many times he works it out of the greateſt evil; the greateſt light is brought out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darkneſſe: and <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) hath a notable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this, (ſaith he) it is the way of God, he doth humble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58996:59"/>
that he might exalt, he doth kill that he might make alive, he doth confound that he might glorifie; this is the way of God (ſaith he:) but ſaith ſaith he, Every one doth not underſtand this, this is the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, the knowledge of knowledges to underſtand this, that God doth uſe when he will bring life, he doth bring it out of death, he brings joy out of ſorrow, and he brings proſperity out of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yea, and many times he brings grace out of ſin, that is, makes uſe of ſin to work furtherance of grace; it is the way of God to bring good out of evil; not only to overcome the evil, but to make the evil to work towards the good: here's the way of God: now when the ſoul comes to underſtand this, it will take away our murmuring and bring Contentment into our ſpirits: But I fear there are but few that underſtand it aright, perhaps they reade of ſuch things, and hear ſuch things in a Sermon, but they are not by Jeſus Chriſt inſtructed in this, that this is the way of God, To bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt evil.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Now, thus having diſpach'd the Third Head, the Leſſons that we are to learn; we come to the Fourth, and that is, <hi>The excellency of this Grace of Contentment:</hi> And there is a great deal of excellencie in Contentment; that's a kind of Leſſon too for us to learn. And this Head likewiſe will be ſomewhat long.</head>
                  <p>Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have learned.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Bleſſed be God for this: Oh! it is a mercy of God to me that I have learned this leſſon, I find ſo much good in this Contentment, that I would not for a world but have it: (I have learned it ſaith he.)</p>
                  <p>Now the very Heathens had a ſight of a great excellency that there is in Contentment: I remember I have read of <hi>Antiſtenes</hi> a Philoſopher, that deſired of his gods, (ſpeaking after the heatheniſh way) nothing in this world to make his life happy, but Contentment; and if he might have any thing that hee would deſire to make his life happy, he would aske of them, that he might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he might have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Socrates</hi> had, to be able to bear any wrong, any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58996:59"/>
injuries that he met withall, and to continue in a quiet temper of ſpirit whatſoever befell him; for that was the temper of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> whatever befell him he continued the ſame man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever croſſe befell him no body could perceive any alteration of his ſpirit though never ſo great croſſes did befall him. This a Heathen did attain to by the ſtrength of Nature, and a common work of the ſpirit: Now this <hi>Antiſtenes</hi> ſaw ſuch an excellency in this ſpirit: As when God ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> What ſhall I give thee? he asked of God wiſdom: ſo ſaith he, If the gods ſhould put it to me to know what I would have, I would deſire this thing, that I might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates</hi>: he ſaw a great excellency that there was in this. And certainly a Chriſtian may ſee abundance of excellency in it: I ſhall labour to ſet it out to you in this Sermon that you may be in love with this Grace of Contentment.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt place, <hi>By Contentment we come to give God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is due to him:</hi> It is a ſpecial part of Divine worſhip that we owe to God, if we be content in a Chriſtian way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as hath been opened to you; I ſay it is a ſpecial part of the Divine worſhip that the creature owes to the infinit Creator, in that I do tender that reſpect that is due from me to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The word that the Greeks have that ſignifies to worſhip, it is as much as to come and crouch before another, as a dog ſhould come crouching unto you, and be willing to lie down at your feet; ſo the creature in the apprehenſion of its owne baſeneſſe, and the infinit Excellency that there is in God above it; when it comes to worſhip God, it comes and crouches to this God, and it lies down at the feet of God, then doth the creature worſhip God. When you ſee a dog come crouching to you, and you can make him with holding your hand over him to lie down at your feet; then conſider, thus ſhould you do before the Lord, you ſhould come crouching to him, and lie down at his feet even upon your backs or bellies, to lie down in the duſt before him, ſo as to be willing that he ſhould do with you what he will; as ſomtimes you may turn a dog this way or that way up and down with the hand, and there he lies before you, according to your ſhewing him with your hand: So when the creature ſhall come and lie down thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58996:60"/>
the Lord, then a Creature worſhips God, doth tender you that worſhip that is due to God. Now in what diſpoſition of heart do we thus <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouch to God more, than when we have this Contentation in all conditions that God diſpoſed us unto? This is a crouching unto Gods diſpoſe, to be like the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when Chriſt ſaid, it is not fit to give Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens meat to dogs, but (ſaith ſhe) the dogs have crums. I am a dog I confeſſe, I but let me have but a crum. And ſo when the ſoul ſhall be in ſuch a diſpoſition as to lie down and ſay, Lord I am but as a dog, yet let me have a crum, then doth it highly honour God. It may be ſome of you have not your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpread as others have, but God gives you crums; now ſaith the poor woman, dogs have crums, and when you can find your hearts thus ſubjecting unto God, to be but as a dog, and can be Contented and bleſſe God for any crum: I ſay this is a great worſhip of God, you worſhip God by this more than when you come to hear a Sermon, or ſpend half an hour, or an hour in prayer, or when you come to receive a Sacrament; Theſe are the acts of Gods worſhip, I but theſe are but external acts of worſhip, to hear, and pray, and receive Sacraments: But now this is the Soul-worſhip, to ſubject its ſelf thus to God. You that often will worſhip God by Hearing, and Praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments, and yet afterwards will be froward and diſcontented, know, that God regards not that worſhip, he will have the ſoul-worſhip in this ſubjecting of the ſoul to God. Obſerve it I beſeech you, in active obedience, there we worſhip God by doing that that pleaſes God, but by paſſive obedience we do as well worſhip God by being pleaſed with that that God doth. Now when I perform a duty, I worſhip God, I do what pleaſes God: why ſhould I not as well worſhip God when I am pleaſed with what God doth? As it was ſaid of Chriſts obedience, Chriſt was active in his paſſive obedience, and paſſive in his active obedience: So the Saints they are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their active obedience; they are firſt paſſive in their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace, and then active: And when they come to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience they are active, they put forth grace in active obedience, when they perform actions to God, then ſaith the Soul, Oh! that I could do that that pleaſes God, when they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58996:60"/>
come to ſuffer any croſſe, Oh that what God doth might pleaſe me. I labour to do what pleaſes God, and I labour that what God doth ſhall pleaſe me, here's a Chriſtian indeed that ſhall endeavour both theſe; now this is but one ſide of a Chriſtian, to endeavour to do what pleaſes God, but you muſt as well endeavour to be pleaſed with what God doth, and ſo you ſhall come to be a compleat Chriſtian when you can do both. And that's the firſt thing in the excellency of this Grace of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing in the opening of this excellency of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is, <hi>That in Contentment there is much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is much ſtrength of Grace, yea there is much beauty of Grace in Contentment, there is much exerciſe of Grace, ſtrength of Grace, and beauty of Grace, I put all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is a compoſition of Grace in Contentment, there is faith, and there is humility, and love, and there is patience, and there is wiſdom, and there is hope, all graces almoſt are compounded, it's an oyle that hath the ingredients of all kind of graces, and therefore though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the particular grace, yet in this oyl you have it all; God ſees the Graces of his Spirit exerciſed in a ſpecial manner, and this pleaſes God at the heart to ſee the Graces of his Spirit exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. In ſome one action that you do you may exerciſe ſome one grace eſpecially, but now in Contentment you exerciſe a great many graces at once.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>There is a great deal of ſtrength of Grace in Contentment,</hi> It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a great deal of ſtrength in the body, the body to be able to endure hard weather and whatſoever fals out, and yet not to be much altered by it; ſo it argues ſtrength of Grace to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: You that complain of weakneſſe of memory, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of parts, you cannot do what others do in other things, but have you this gracious heart-contentment that hath been opened to you; I know that you have attained to ſtrength of Grace in this, when it is ſo ſpiritual as hath been opened to you in the explication of this point. As it is with a mans braine, if a man be diſtempered in his body and hath many obſtructions in his body, hath an ill ſtomack, and his ſpleen
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58996:61"/>
and liver obſtructed, and yet for all this his brain is not diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, it is an argument of a great ſtrength of brain, and though there be many ill fumes that riſeth from his corrupt ſtomack, yet ſtill his brain is not diſtempered but he continues in the free exerciſe of the uſe of his reaſon and underſtanding; every one may underſtand that this man hath a very ſtrong brain, that ſuch things ſhall not diſtemper him, whereas other people that have a weak brain, if they do not diſgeſt but one meals meat, the fumes that do ariſe from their ſtomacks, doth diſtemper their brain and makes them unfit for every thing, whereas you ſhall have others that have ſtrong heads, and ſtrong brains, though their ſtomacks be ill that they do not diſgeſt meat, yet ſtill they have the free uſe of their brain, this argues ſtrength: So it is in a mans ſpirit, you ſhall have many that have weak ſpirits, and if they have any ill fumes, if accidents befal them, you ſhall preſently have them out of temper, but you ſhall have other men that though things do fume up yet ſtill they keep in a ſteady-way, and have the uſe of reaſon and of other graces, and poſſeſs their Souls with patience. As I remember it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Eagle, it's not like other fowls, other fowls when they are hungrie make an noiſe, but the Eagle is never heard to make an noiſe though it wants food, and it is from the magnitude of his ſpirit that it will not make ſuch complaints as other fowls will do when they want food, it is becauſe it is above hunger, and above thirſt: So it is argument of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous magnitude of ſpirit that whatſoever befals it, yet it is not alwaies whyning and complaining ſo as others are, but goes on ſtill in it's way and courſe, and bleſſes God and keeps in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour whatſoever thing befals it, ſuch things as cauſes others to be dejected and fretted and vexed, and takes away all the comfort of their lives, it makes no alteration at all in the ſpirits of theſe men and women, I ſay this is a ſign of a great deal of ſtrength of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>It's alſo an argument of a great deal of beauty of Grace.</hi> It's a ſpeech that <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen once had, ſaith he, When you go abroad into groves and woods; and there you ſee the talneſſe of the trees and their ſhadows, it ſtrikes a kind of awful fear of a Deity in you, and when you ſee the vaſt rivers and fountains,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58996:61"/>
and deep waters that ſtrikes a kind of fear of a God in you but (ſaith he) do you ſee a man that is quiet in tempeſts, and that lives happily in the middeſt of adverſities, why do not you worſhip that man? he doth think him a man even to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſhall be quiet and live a happy life though in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of adverſities. The glory of God appears here more than in any of his works; there is no works that God hath made, the Sun Moon and Stars and all the world wherein ſo much of the glory of God doth appear, as in a man that lives quietly in the middeſt of adverſity. That was that that covinc'd the King, when he ſaw the three Children could walk in the mideſt of the fiery furnace &amp; not be toucht, the King was mightily convinc'd by this, that ſurely their God was a great God indeed, &amp; that they were highly beloved of their God that could walk in the mid'ſt of the furnace and not be toucht, whereas the others that came but to the mouth of the furnace were devoured, ſo when a Chriſtian can walk in the mid'ſt of fiery trials, and not his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſinged, but have comfort and joy in the mid'ſt of all (as <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſtocks) can ſing, (that wrought upon the jaylour:) ſo it will convince men when they ſee the power of grace in the middeſt of afflictions, ſuch afflictions as would make others to rore under them, yet they can behave themſelves in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy manner; Oh it's the glory of a Chriſtian. It is that that is ſaid to be the glory of Chriſt, (for ſo by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it is thought to be meant of Chriſt) In <hi>Micah,</hi> 5.5. <hi>And this man</hi> (the text ſaith) <hi>ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land, and when he ſhall tread in our pallaces.</hi> This man ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land; for one to be in peace when there is no enemies it's no great matter, but ſaith the text when the Aſſyrian ſhal come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our land, then this man ſhall be the peace; that is, when all ſhal be in an hubbub and uprore yet then this man ſhal be peace. That's the tryal of grace when you find Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts to be peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into the land. You may think you find peace in Chriſt when you have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, but is Chriſt your peace when the Aſſyrian comes into the land, when the enemy comes? Suppoſe you ſhould hear the enemy come marching to the City &amp; had taken
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58996:62"/>
the works, and were plundering, what would be your peace? Jeſus Chriſt would be peace to the ſoul when the enemy comes into the City, and into your houſes; If there be any of you that have been where the enemy hath come, what hath been the peace of your ſouls? That that's ſaid of Chriſt may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this grace of Contentment, when the Aſſyrian, the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, the enemies, when any affliction, trouble, diſtreſſe doth befal ſuch a heart, then this grace of Contentment brings peace to the ſoul; at that time brings peace to their ſoul when the Aſſyrian comes into the land: The grace of Contentment it's an excellent grace, ther<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'s much beauty, much ſtrength in it, there is a great deal of worth in this grace, and therefore be in love with it.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing in the excellency of Contentment is this, <hi>By Contentment the ſoul is fitted to receive mercy, and to do ſervice,</hi> I'le put thoſe two together, Contentment makes the ſoul fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy, and to do ſervice; no man or woman in the world is ſo fit for to receive the Grace of God, and to do the work of God as thoſe that have contented ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Thoſe are fitted to receive mercy from the Lord that are contented</hi>: As now, if you would have a veſſel to take in any licquor, you muſt hold the veſſel ſtill, if the veſſel ſtir and ſhake up and down you cannot powre in any thing, but you will bid hold ſtil that you may powre it in and not looſe any; ſo if we would be the veſſels to receive Gods mercy, and would have the Lord powr in his mercy to us, we muſt have quiet ſtill hearts, we muſt not have hearts hurrying up and down in trouble diſcontent and vexing, but we muſt have ſtill and quiet hearts if we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy from the Lord: If a child throws and flings up and down for a thing, you will not give it him then when he cries ſo, but firſt you will have the child quiet, though perhaps you do intend the child ſhall have the thing he cries for, but you will not give it him till he is quiet and comes and ſtands ſtill before you and is contented without it and then you will give it him: and truly ſo doth the Lord deal with us, (for our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with him are juſt as your froward childrens are with you) as ſoon as you would have a thing from God if you have it not you are diſquieted preſently and all in an upprore (as it were)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58996:62"/>
in your ſpirits: God intends mercy to you, but ſaith God you ſhall not have it yet, I will ſee you quiet firſt, and then in the quietneſſe of your hearts come to me and ſee what I will do with you. I appeal to you, you that are any way acquainted with the waies of God, have you not found this to be the way of God towards you, when you have been troubled for want perhaps of ſome ſpiritual comfort, and your hearts were vext at it, you get nothing from God all that while; but now if you have got your heart into a quiet frame, and can ſay, well, it's fit the Lord ſhould do with his poor creatures what he will, I am under his feet, and am reſolv'd to do what I can to honour him; and let him do with me what he will I will ſeek him as long as I live, I will be content with what God gives; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gives or no I will be content; yea, are you in this frame (ſaith God) now you ſhall have comfort, now I will give you the mercy. A priſoner muſt not think to get off his fetters by pulling and tearing, he may gall his fleſh and rend it to the very bone, certainly he will be unfettered never the ſooner, but if he would have his fetters taken off he muſt quietly give up himſelf to ſome man to take them off; If a begger after he hath knockt once or twice at the door and you come not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is vext and troubled and thinks much that you let him ſtand a little while without any thing, you think that this beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not fit to receive an almes, but if you hear two or three beggers at your door, and if you hear them out of your window ſay, let us be content to ſtay, perhaps they are buſie, it's fit that we ſhould ſtay, it's well if we have any thing at laſt, we deſerve nothing at all, and therefore we may well wait a while; you would then quickly ſend them an almes; ſo God deals with the heart, when it is in a diſquiet way then God doth not give; but when the heart lies down quietly under Gods hand, then is the heart in a fit frame to receive mercy: Your ſtrength ſhall be to ſit ſtill (ſaith God,) you ſhall not be delivered from <hi>Babylon</hi> but by your ſitting ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As fit to receive mercy, <hi>So fit to do ſervice,</hi> Oh the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe, the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſſe; they indeed do proſper and multiply moſt when they come to be peacable fruits of righteouſneſſe. As the Philoſophers ſay
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58996:63"/>
of every thing that moves, nothing that moves but it moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething that is immovable; as a thing that moves upon the earth, if the earth were not ſtill it could not move.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The ſhips move upon the Sea, and that is not ſtill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the Seas they move upon that which is ſtill and immovable, there is nothing moves but it hath ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable that doth uphold it: The wheels in a Coach they move up and down, but the exletree that moves not up and down; ſo it is with the heart of a man. As they ſay of the Heaven, it moves up and down upon a pole that is immovable: ſo it is in the heart of a man, if he will move to do ſervice to God he muſt have a ſteady heart within him, that muſt help him to move in the ſervice of God, thoſe that have unſteady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſpirits that have no ſteadfaſtneſſe at all in them, they are not fit to do ſervice for God, but ſuch as have ſteadfaſtneſſe in their ſpirits they are men and women fit to do any ſervice, and that's the reaſon that when the Lord hath any great work for any ſervants of his to do, uſually he doth firſt quiet their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, he doth bring their ſpirits into a quiet ſweet frame to be contented with any thing, and then he ſets them about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                  <p>The Fift excellency is this, <hi>Contentment it doth deliver us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of temptations.</hi> Oh the temptations that men of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirits are ſubject to, the Devil loves to fiſh in troubled waters. That's our proverb of men and women, their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is to fiſh in troubled waters, they ſay it is good fiſhing in troubled waters, this is the maxime of the Devil, he loves to fiſh in troubled waters, where he ſees the ſpirits men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men troubled and vext, there the Devil comes, ſaith he, there's good fiſhing for me, when he ſees men and women go diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented up and down and he can get them alone, then he comes with his temptations, ſaith he, will you ſuffer ſuch a thing? take ſuch a ſhifting indirect way, do not you ſee how poor you are, others are brave, you know not what you ſhall do againſt winter, to provide fewell and get bread for you and your children, and ſo he tempts them to unlawful courſes; this is the ſpecial diſtemper that the Devil faſtens upon, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58996:63"/>
he brings men and women to give up their ſouls to him, it is upon diſcontent: That's the ground of all thoſe that have been witches, and ſo have given up themſelves to the Devil, the riſe of it hath been their diſcontent, and therefore it is obſervable that thoſe the Devil worketh upon to make them witches, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are old and melancholy people, and women eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and thoſe that are of the poorer ſort, that are diſcontent at home, their neighbours trouble them and vex them, and their ſpirits are weak and they cannot bear it, ſo upon that the Devil faſtens his temptations and draws them to any thing; if they be poor, then he promiſes them money, if they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull ſpirits, then he tels them that he will revenge them upon ſuch and ſuch perſons, now this quiets and contents them. Oh! there's matter of temptation for the Devil where he meets with a diſcontented ſpirit. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith of God, God doth not dwell in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but in <hi>Salem, Babylon</hi> ſignifies confuſion, and <hi>Salem</hi> ſignifies peace: now God doth not dwell in ſpirits that are in a confuſion, but he dwels in peacable and quiet ſpirits. Oh if you would free your ſelves from temptations, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Contentment, It is the peace of God that guards the heart from temptation. I remember I have read of one <hi>Marius Curio</hi> that when he had bribes ſent him, to tempt him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to his Countrey, he was ſitting at home at dinner with a diſh of turnips, and they came and promiſed him rewards, ſaith he, That man that can be contented with this fare that I have, will not be tempted with your rewards, I thank God I am content with this fare, and as for rewards let them be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe that cannot be content to dine with a diſh of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips. So the truth is we ſee it apparently, that the reaſon why many do betray their truſt, as in the Parliament ſervice and Kingdom, becauſe they cannot be contented to be in a low condition. Let a man be contented to be in a low condition, and to go meanly cloathed if God ſees it fit, ſuch a man is ſhot-free (as I may ſo ſay) from thouſands of temptations of the Devil, that do prevail againſt others to the damning of their ſouls; Oh in ſuch times as theſe are when men are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the loſs of their eſtates, I ſay theſe men that have not got this grace are in a moſt lamentable condition, they are in more
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58996:64"/>
danger for their ſouls then they are for their outward eſtates, you think it is a ſad thing to be in danger of your outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates that you may looſe all in an night, but if you have not this contented ſpirit within you, you are in more danger of the temptations of the Devil to be plundered that way of any good, and to be led into ſin; Oh when men think thus, they muſt live as brave as they were wont to do, theſe men make themſelves a prey to the Devil; but for ſuch as can ſay let God do with me what he pleaſes, I am content to ſubmit to his hand in it, the Devil wil ſcarce meddle with ſuch men. It's a notable ſpeech of a Phyloſopher that lived upon mean fare, and as he was eating herbs and roots, ſaith one to him, If you would but pleaſe <hi>Dioniſius</hi> you need not eat herbs and roots: but he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him thus, If you would but be content with ſuch mean fare you need not flatter <hi>Dioniſius.</hi> So temptations will no more prevail upon a contented man, then a dart that is thrown againſt a braſen wal. That's the Fifth particular.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth excellency is, <hi>The abundant comforts in a mans life that Contentment will bring</hi>: Contentment will make a mans life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſweet and comfortable, nothing more than the grace of Contentment; many waies I will ſhew how it brings in Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 As firſt, What a man hath <hi>he hath it in a kind of Independent way,</hi> not depending upon any Creature for his Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>A Contented man whoſe eſtate is low, if God raiſes his eſtate he hath the love of God in it,</hi> and then it's abundantly more ſweet than if he had it and his heart not contented: for if he had not the love of God in it, for it may be God grants to a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man his deſire, but he cannot ſay it is from love; if a man hath quieted his ſpirit firſt, and then God grant him his deſire, he may have more comfort in it, and more aſſurance that he hath the love of God in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This Contentment is a comfort to a mans ſpirit in this, <hi>that it doth keep in his comforts, and keep out whatſoever may damp his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, or put out the light of them:</hi> I may compare this Grace of Contentment to a Marriners Lanthorn, a Marriner when he is at Sea let him have never ſo much proviſion in his ſhip, yet if he be thouſands of leagues from land, or in a rode that he ſhall not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58996:64"/>
meet with a ſhip in three or four moneths, if he hath never a Lanthorn in his ſhip, nor nothing whereby he can keep a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light in a ſtorm, he will be in a ſad condition, he would give a great deal to have a Lanthorn, or ſome thing that may ſerve in ſtead of it. When a ſtorm comes in the night, and he cannot have any light come above-board, but is puft out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, his condition is very ſad: ſo many men can have the light of comfort when there is no ſtorm, but let there come but any affliction, any ſtorm upon them their light is puft out preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what ſhall they do now? When the heart is furniſhed with this Grace of Contentment; this Grace is (as it were) the Lanthorn, and it keeps comfort in the ſpirit of a man, light in the midſt of a ſtorm and tempeſt. When you have a Lanthorn in the midſt of a ſtorm you can carry a light every where up and down the ſhip to the top of the Maſt if you will, and yet keep it light; ſo the comfort of a Chriſtian when it is enlivened with the grace of Contentment, it may be keept light whatever ſtorms or tempeſts come, yet he can keep light in his ſoul. Oh! this helps thy comforts exceeding much.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly. <hi>There is this Excellency in Contentment, that it fetches in the comfort of thoſe things we have not really in poſſeſſion</hi>; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many that have not outward things, have more comfort than thoſe have that do enjoy them themſelves: As now, a man by diſtilling herbs, though he hath not the herbs themſelves, yet having the water that is diſtil'd out of them, he may enjoy the benefit of the herbs: ſo though a man hath not the reall poſſeſſion of ſuch an outward eſtate, an outward comfort, yet he by the grace of Contentment may fetch it in to himſelf. By the art of Navigation we can fetch in the riches of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies to our ſelves; ſo by the art of Contentment we may fetch in the comfort of any condition to our ſelves, that is, we may have that comfort by Contentment, that we ſhould have if we had the thing it ſelf. There is an notable ſtory you have for this in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyrus</hi>; one <hi>Sineus</hi> comes to him, and would very fain have had him deſiſt from the wars, and not war with the Romans; ſaith he to him, May it pleaſe your Majeſtie, it is reported that the Romans are very good men of warre, and if it pleaſe the gods we do over-come them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58996:65"/>
what benefit ſhall we have of that Victory? <hi>Pyrhus</hi> anſwered him, We ſhall then ſtraight conquer all the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> with eaſe. Saith <hi>Sineus,</hi> Indeed it is likely which your Grace ſpeaketh: But when we have won <hi>Italy,</hi> will then our wars end? If the Gods were pleaſed ſaid <hi>Pyrhus,</hi> that the victory were achieved, the way were then broad open for us to attain great conqueſts, for who would not afterwards go into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage?</hi> But (ſaith <hi>Sineus</hi>) when we have all in our hands, what ſhall we do in the end? then <hi>Pyrhus</hi> laughing, told him again, we will then be quiet, and take our eaſe, and make feaſts every day, and be as merry one with another as we can poſſible: ſaith <hi>Sineus,</hi> What letteth us now to be as quiet, and merry together, fith we enjoy that preſently without further travel and trouble which we ſhould go ſeek for abroad, with ſuch ſhedding of blood, and ſo manifeſt danger: Cannot you ſit down and be merry now? So a man may think, if I had ſuch a thing, then I would have another, and if I had that, then I ſhould have more: and what if you had got al your deſire? then you would be content, why? you may be content now without them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Contentment doth not conſiſt in the getting of the thing we deſire, but in Gods faſhioning our ſpirits to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: There's ſome men that have not a foot of ground of their own, yet will live better than other men that are heirs to a great deal of land. I have known it in the country ſomtimes, that a man lives upon his own land, and yet lives very poorly, but you ſhall have another man that ſhall farm his land, and yet by his good husbandry, and by his care ſhall live better ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times than he that hath the land of his own: ſo a man by this art of Contentment may live better without an eſtate than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man can of an eſtate: Oh! it adds exceeding much to the comfort of a Chriſtian: and that I may ſhew it farther, there is more comfort even in grace of Contentment than there is in any poſſeſſions whatſoever; a man hath more comfort in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without a thing, than he can have in the thing that he in a diſcontented way doth deſire.</p>
                  <p>You think, if I had ſuch a thing, then I ſhould be content. I ſay, There is more good in Contentment, than there is in the thing that you would fain have to cure your diſcontent, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58996:65"/>
that I ſhall open in divers particulars, As thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I would fain have ſuch a thing, and then I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but if I had it then it were but the creature that did help to my Contentment; but now it's the Grace of God in my ſoul that makes me content: and ſurely it is better to be Content with the Grace of God in my ſoul, than with the enjoying of an outward comfort.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If I had ſuch a thing, indeed my eſtate might be better, but my ſoul would not be better, but by Contentment my ſoul is better, that would not be bettered by an eſtate, or lands, or friends; but Contentment makes my ſelf to be better: and therefore Contentment is a better portion than the thing is that I would fain have to be my portion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If I get Content by having my deſire ſatisfied, that's but ſelf-love; but when I am Contented with the hand of God, and am willing to be at his diſpoſe, that comes from my love to God in having my deſire ſatisfied, there I am contented through ſelf-love, but through the Grace of Contentment I come to be contented out of love to God; and is it not beteer to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a principle of love to God, than from a principle of ſelf-love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If I am contented becauſe I have that that I have a deſire to, perhaps I am contented in that one particular, but that one particular doth not furniſh me with Contentment in another thing; perhaps I may grow more dainty and nice, and froward in other things: if you give children what they would have in ſome things, they grow ſo much the more coy and dainty, and diſcontented if they have not other things that they would have; but if I have once overcome my heart, and am conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the grace of God in my heart, then this doth not content me only in a particular, but in general, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals me. I am diſcontented, and would fain have ſuch a thing, and afterwards I have it: now doth this prepare me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in other things? no, but when I have gotten this Grace of Contentment, I am prepar'd to be contented in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and thus you ſee that Contentment doth bring comfort to a mans life, fils a mans life full of comfort in this world: yea, the truth is, it is even a Heaven upon Earth, why? what is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58996:66"/>
Heaven, but the reſt and quiet of a mans ſpirit; what's the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial thing that is in Heaven, but reſt, and joy, that makes the life of Heaven, there's reſt and joy, and ſatisfaction in God: ſo it's here in a contented ſpirit, there's reſt, and joy, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in God: In Heaven, there's ſinging praiſes to God; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented heart is alwaies praiſing and bleſſing God; thou haſt Heaven while thou art upon earth when thou haſt a contented ſpirit, yea, in ſome regards it's better than Heaven. How is that you will ſay? there's ſome kind of honour that God hath in it, and ſome excellency that he hath not in Heaven, and that's this,</p>
                  <p>In Heaven there is no overcoming of temptations, they are not put to any trials by afflictions: there in Heaven they have exerciſe of grace, but they have nothing but encouragement to it, and indeed thoſe that are there their grace is perfect, and in that they do excel us; but there is nothing to croſs their grace, they have no trials at all to tempt them to do contrary; but now for a man or woman to be in the midſt of afflictions, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and troubles, and yet to have grace exerciſed, and yet to be ſatisfied in God and Chriſt, and in the Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the mid'ſt of all they ſuffer, this may ſeem to be an honour that God hath from us, that he hath not from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Heaven. Is it ſo much for one that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that hath nothing elſe but good from God, hath nothing to try them, no temptations, is that ſo much for them to be praiſing and bleſſing God, as for the poor ſoul that is in the mid'ſt of trials and temptations, and afflictions, and troubles? for this ſoul to go on prayſing and bleſſing, and ſerving God; I (ſay) it is an excellency that thou ſhalt not have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God ſhal not have this kind of glory from thee in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore be contented, and prize this Contentment, and be willing to live in this world as long as God ſhal pleaſe, and do not think, Oh that I were delivered from all theſe afflictions and troubles herein this world! if thou wert, then thou ſhouldeſt have more eaſe to thy ſelf: but here's a way of honouring God, and manifeſting the excellency of Grace here when thou art in this Conflict of temptation that God ſhal not have from thee in Heaven, and therefore be ſatisfied and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58996:66"/>
quiet, be contented with thy Contentment: I want ſuch and ſuch things that others have, but bleſſed be God I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented heart that others have not, then I ſay be content with thy Contenement, for that's a rich portion that the Lord hath granted unto them, if the Lord ſhould give unto thee thouſands here in this world, it would not be ſuch a rich portion as this, that he hath given thee a contented ſpirit: Oh go away and praiſe the Name of God, and ſay, Lord, it's true theſe and theſe comforts that others have I ſhould be glad if I had them, but thou haſt cut me ſhort, but though I want theſe, yet thou haſt given me that that is as good and better, thou haſt given me a quiet contented heart, to be willing to be at thy diſpoſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E proceed now. There are ſome two or three things more of the excellency of Contentment and then we are to proceed to Applycation of the point.</p>
               <p>The Eight excellency is, <hi>Contentment is a great bleſſing of God upon the Soul.</hi> There is Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thoſe that are content, the bleſſing of God is upon them, and their eſtates, and upon all that they have. We reade in <hi>Deut.</hi> of the bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> the principal Tribe; this is the bleſſing of <hi>Judah, And he ſaid hear Lord the voice of</hi> Judah <hi>and bring him unto his people, let his hands be ſufficient for him, and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</hi> Let his hand
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58996:67"/>
be ſufficient for him, that is, bring in a ſufficiency of all good unto him that he may have of his own, that's the bleſſing of <hi>Judah.</hi> So when God gives thee a ſufficiency of thine own, (as every contented man hath) there is the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, the bleſſing of the principle Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> is upon thee. It is the Lord that gives us all things to injoy, we may have the thing and yet not enjoy it except God comes in with his bleſſing now whatſoever thou haſt thou do'ſt injoy it: Many men have eſtates and do not enjoy them, it's the bleſſing of God that gives us all things to enjoy, it is God that through his bleſſing, hath faſhioned thy heart and made it ſutable to thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Ninth excellency, <hi>Thoſe that are content they may expect reward from God, that God ſhall give unto them the good of all thoſe things that they are contented to be without,</hi> and this brings in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good to a contented ſpirit: There is ſuch and ſuch a mercy that thou thinkeſt would be very comfortable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee if thou had'ſt it, but canſt thou bring thy heart to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God in it? thou ſhalt have the bleſſing of the mercy one way or other; if thou haſt not the thing it ſelf in <hi>re</hi>; thou ſhalt have it made up one way or other, thou ſhalt have a bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to receive ſomewhat in lieu of it, there is no comfort that any ſoul is content to be without, but the Lord will give either the comfort or ſomewhat in ſtead of it: Thou ſhalt have a reward to thy ſoul for what ever good thing thou art content to be without. You know what the Scripture ſaith of active obedience, and the Lord doth accept (of his ſervants) their will for the deed, though we do not do a good thing, yet if our hearts be upright, to will to do it, we ſhall have the bleſſing though we do not do the thing: You that complain of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you cannot do as others do, you cannot do as much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as others do, if your hearts be as upright with God, and would fain do the ſame ſervice that you ſee others do, you would account it a great bleſſing of God upon you, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bleſſing in the world if you were able to do as others do; now you may comfort your ſelves with this, having to deal with God in the way of the Covenant of Grace you ſhall have from God the reward of all you will do, as a wicked man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58996:67"/>
ſhall have puniſhment for all the ſin he would commit, ſo thou ſhalt have the reward for all the good thou wouldeſt do. Now may not we draw an argument from active obedience to paſſive; there is as good reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt expect that God will reward thee for all that thou art willing to ſuffer, as well as for all that thou art willing to do, now if thou beeſt willing to be without ſuch a comfort and mercy when God ſees it fit, thou ſhalt be no looſer, certainly God will reward thee either with the comfort or with that that ſhall be as good to thee as the comfort, therefore conſider how many things have I that others want, and can I bring my heart into a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame to want what others have? I have the bleſſing of all that they have, and I ſhall either poſſeſſe ſuch things as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, or elſe God will make it up one way or other, either here, or hereafter in eternity to me; Oh what riches are here! with Contentment thou haſt all kind of riches.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, By contentation <hi>the ſoul comes to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie neer to God himſelfe, yea the neereſt that may be,</hi> for this word that is tranſlated <hi>Content,</hi> it is a word that ſignifies <hi>a Self-ſufficiencie,</hi> as I told you in the opening of the words. A contented man is a ſelf-ſufficient man, what is the great glory of God but to be happy and ſelf-ſufficient in himſelf? Indeed he is ſaid to be All-ſufficient, but that's but a further addition of the word All, rather than of any matter, for to be ſufficient, is All-ſufficient, now is this the glory of God to be Sufficient, to have ſufficiencie in himſelfe, <hi>El-ſhaddai,</hi> to be God having ſufficiency in himſelf? now thou comeſt neer to this, thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeſt of the Divine Nature, as by grace in generall, ſo in a more peculiar manner by this grace of Chriſtian Contentment, what's the excellency and glory of God but this? Suppoſe there were no creatures in the world, and that all the creatures in the world were anihilated, God would remain the ſame bleſſed God that he is now, he would not be in a worſe condition if all creatures were gone, neither would a contented heart if God ſhould take away all creatures from him, a contented heart hath enough in the want of al creatures and would not be more miſerable than now he is. Suppoſe that God ſhould continue thee here, and all creatures that are here in this world were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58996:68"/>
away, yet thou ſtill (having God to be thy portion) woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be as happy as now thou art, and therefore contentation hath a great deal of excellency in it.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſhewed in many particulars the excellency of this grace, labouring to preſent the beauty of it before your ſouls that you may be in love with it.</p>
               <p>Now my brethren what remains but the practice of this, for this Art of Contentment it's not a Speculative thing, only for contemplation, but it is an art of Divinity, and therfore practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, ye are now to labour to work upon your hearts, that there may be this grace in you, that you may honour God and honour your profeſſion with this grace of Contentment, for there is none doth more honour God, and honour their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion than thoſe that have this grace of Contentment. Now that we may fall upon the practice there, is required,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we ſhould he humbled in our hearts for the want of this, that we have had ſo little of this grace in us.</hi> For there is no way to ſet upon any duty with profit, till the heart be humbled for the want of the performance of the duty before; many men when they hear of a duty that they ſhould perform, they will labour to perform it, but firſt thou muſt be humbled for the want of it, therefore that's the thing that I ſhall endeavour in the Application, to get your hearts to be humbled for the want of this grace; Oh had I had this grace of Contentment, what a happy life I might have lived? what abundance of honour I might have brought to the Name of God? and how might I have honoured my profeſſion? and what a deal of comfort might I have enjoyed? but the Lord knows it hath been far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, Oh how far have I been from this grace of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath been opened to me? I have had a murmuring, a vexing and a fretting heart within me, every little croſſe hath put me out of temper and out of frame, Oh the boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe of my ſpirit, what a deal of evil doth God ſee in my heart, in the vexing and fretting of my heart, and murmuring and repining of my ſpirit? Oh that God would make you to ſee it: Now to the end that you might be humbled for the want of this, I ſhall endeavour in theſe particulars to ſpeak unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:58996:68"/>Firſt, I ſhall ſet before you, <hi>The evil of a murmuring ſpirit, there is more evil than you are aware of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Second place, <hi>I will ſhew you ſome agravations of this evil,</hi> It's evil in all, but in ſome more than in others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I ſhall labour to take away the pleas that any murmuring diſcontented heart hath for this diſtemper of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's theſe Three things in this uſe of humiliation of the Soul for the want of this grace of Contentment.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, now at this time. The great evil that there is in a murmuring diſcontented heart.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>This thy murmuring and diſcontentedneſs it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much corruption that is in the Soul,</hi> as Contentment argues much grace, and ſtrong grace, and beautiful grace; ſo this argues much corruption, and ſtrong corruption, and very vile corruptions in thy heart. As it is in a mans body, if a mans body be of that temper that every ſcratch of a pin makes his fleſh to ranckle and to be a ſore, you will ſay, ſurely this mans body is very corrupt, his blood and his fleſh is corrupt, that every ſcratch of a pin ſhal make it ranckle, ſo it is in thy ſpirit; if every little trouble and affliction ſhal make thee diſcontented, and make thee murmur, and even cauſe thy ſpirit within thee to ranckle, or as it is in a wound in a mans body, the evil of a wound, it is not ſo much in the largeneſſe of the wound, and the abundance of blood that comes out of the wound, but in the inflamation that there is in it, or in a fretting and corroding humour that is in the wound; an unskilful man when he comes and ſees a large wound in the fleſh, looks upon it as a dangerous wound, and when he ſees a great deal of blood guſh out, he thinks theſe are the evils of it, but when a Chirurgion comes and ſees a great gaſh, ſaith he, this will be heal'd within a few daies, but there's a leſſe wound and there's an inflamation or a fretting humour that is in it, and this will coſt time (ſaith he) to cure, ſo that he doth not lay balſome and healing ſalves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but his great care is to get out the fretting humour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, ſo that the thing that muſt heal this wound it is ſome drink to purge; But (ſaith the patient) what good will this do to my wound? You give me ſomewhat to drink, and my wound is in my arme, or in my leg, what good will this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58996:69"/>
do that I put in my ſtomack? Yes it purges out the fretting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or takes away the inflamation, and till that be taken away the ſalves can do no good. So it is juſt for all the world in the ſouls of men, it may be there is ſome affliction upon them that I compare to the wound; now they think that the greatneſſe of the affliction is that that makes their condition moſt miſerable: Oh no, there is a fretting humour, an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart, a murmuring ſpirit that is within thee and that is the miſery of thy condition, and that muſt be purged out of thee before thou canſt be healed, and let God do with thee what he will, till he purges out that fretting humour thy wound will not be healed; a murmuring heart is a very ſinful heart, ſo that when thou art troubled for ſuch an affliction, thou hadſt need turn thy thoughts, rather to be troubled for the murmuring of thy heart, for that's the greateſt trouble, there is an affliction upon thee and that is grievous, but there is a murmuring heart within and that's more grievous. Oh that we could but convince men and women that a murmuring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a greater evil than any affliction, let the affliction be what it will be. We ſhall ſhew more afterward that a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit is the evil of the evil, and the miſery of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The evill of murmuring is ſuch, that God when he would ſpeak of wicked men, and deſcribe them, and ſlew the brand of a wicked and ungodly man or woman, he inſtances in this ſin in a more ſpecial manner</hi>: I might name many Scriptures, but that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Jude</hi> is a moſt remarkable one, in the 14. verſe, and ſo forward, there it is ſaid, <hi>That the Lord comes with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark here in this 15. verſe, there is four times mentioned ungodly ones; All that are <hi>ungodly</hi> among them, all their <hi>ungodly</hi> deeds which they have <hi>ungodly</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which <hi>ungodly</hi> ſinners have ſpoken againſt him: This is in the general. But now he comes in the particular to ſhew who theſe are, theſe are (ſaith he) Murmurers: that's the very firſt. Would you know who are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58996:69"/>
ungodly men, that God when he comes with ten thouſand of Angels ſhall come to puniſh for all their ungodly deeds that they do, and thoſe that ſpeak ungodly things againſt them; Theſe ungodly ones are murmurers, murmurers in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are put in the fore front of ungodly one, it's a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Scripture, that the Lord when he ſpeaks of ungodly ones puts murmurers in the very fore-front of all, you had need look to your ſpirits, you may ſee that this murmuring, which is the vice contrary to this Contentment is not ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you think, you think you are not ſo ungodly as others, becauſe you do not ſwear and drink as others do, but you may be ungodly in murmuring, it's true there is no ſin but ſome ſeeds and remainers of it are in thoſe that are godly, but when they are under the power of this ſin of murmuring, it doth convince them to be ungodly, as well as if they were under the power of drunkenneſſe, or whordom, or any other ſin, God will look upon you as ungodly for this ſin as well as for any ſin whatſoever. This one Scripture ſhould make the heart ſhake at the thought of the ſin of murmuring.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As it's made a brand of ungodly men, ſo you ſhal find in Scripture <hi>that God accounts it rebellion,</hi> that is contrary to the worſhip that there was in contentedneſſe: that's worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, crouching to God and falling down before him, even as a dog that would crouch when you hould a ſtaffe over him, but a murmuring heart it's a rebellious heart, and that you ſhall find if you compare two Scriptures together, they are both in the book of <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.41. <hi>But on the morrow</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>all the congregation of the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.</hi> They all murmured, now compare this with the Chap. 17. &amp; verſ. 10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Bring</hi> Aarons <hi>rod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, before the teſtimony to be kept for a token againſt the Rebels.</hi> In the 16. Chap. they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in the 17. Chap. bring the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> again, before the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for a token againſt the <hi>Rebels.</hi> So that to be a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murer, and to be a Rebel you ſee in Scripture phraſe is all one, It is a rebellion againſt God: as it is the beginning of rebellion and ſedition in a kingdom when the people are diſcontent,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58996:70"/>
and when diſcontentment comes it grows to murmuring, and you can go into no houſe almoſt but there is murmuring when men are diſcontent, ſo that within a little while it breaks forth into ſedition or rebellion. Murmuring it's but as the ſmoke of the fire, there is firſt a ſmoke and ſmother before the flame breaks forth, and ſo before open rebellion in a kingdom there is firſt a ſmoke of murmuring, and then it breaks forth into open rebellion; but becauſe it hath rebellion in the ſeeds of it therefore it is accounted before the Lord to be rebellion. Wilt thou be a Rebel againſt God? When thou feeleſt thy heart diſcontented and murmuring againſt the diſpenſations of God towards thee, thou ſhouldeſt check thy heart thus, Oh thou wretched heart, what wilt thou be a Rebel againſt God? wilt thou riſe in a way of Rebellion againſt the infinite God? yet thus thou haſt done, charge thy heart with this ſin of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, you that are guilty of this ſin of murmuring you are this day by the Lord charged as being guilty of Rebellion againſt him, and God expects that when you go home you ſhould humble your ſouls before him for this ſin, that you ſhould charge your ſouls for being guilty of rebellion againſt God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you may ſay, I never thought that I had been a Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God before, I thought that I had many infirmities, but now I ſee the Scripture ſpeaks of ſin in another manner than men do, the Scripture makes men (though but murmurers) to be Rebels againſt God, Oh this rebellious heart that I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord that hath manifeſted it's ſelf in this way of murmuring againſt the Lord? That's a Third particular in the evil of diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>A Fourth particular in the evil of Diſcontentment, <hi>it is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs that is exeeeding contrary to Grace, and eſpecially contrary to the work of God, in bringing of the ſoul home to himſelf</hi>; I know no diſtemper more oppoſite and contrary to the work of God in converſion of a ſinner, than this is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What's the work of God when he brings a ſinner home to himſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The uſual way is for God to make the ſoul to ſee and be ſenſible of the dreadful evil that there is in ſin, and the great breach that ſin hath made between God and it, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58996:70"/>
Jeſus Chriſt can never be known in his beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency till the ſoule know that. I do not ſpeak what ſecret work of the Holy-Ghoſt there may be in the ſoul, but before the ſoul can actually apply Jeſus Chriſt to its ſelf, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but it muſt come to know the evil of ſin, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Jeſus Chriſt: there may be a ſeed of faith put into the ſoul, but the ſoul muſt firſt know Chriſt, and know ſin, and be made ſenſible of it. Now how contrary is this ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring to any ſuch work of God; hath God made me ſee the dreadful evil of ſin, and made my ſoul to be ſenſible of the evil of ſin as the greateſt burden? how can I then be ſo much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for every little affliction? certainly if I ſaw what the evill of ſin were, that ſight would ſwallow up all other evils, and if I were burdened with the evil of ſin, it would ſwallow up all other burdens; what am I now murmuring againſt Gods hand (ſaith ſuch a ſoul) when as a while ago the Lord made me ſee my ſelf to be a damned wretch, and apprehend it as a wonder that I am not in Hell?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea, it's mighty contrary to the ſight of the infinit excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. What am I that ſoul that the Lord hath diſcovered ſuch infinit excellency of Jeſus Chriſt to? and yet ſhall I think ſuch a little affliction to be ſo grievous to me, when I have had the ſight of ſuch glory in Chriſt that is more worth than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds? (for ſo will a true convert ſay) Oh! the Lord at ſuch a time hath given me that fight of Chriſt that I would not be without for ten thouſand thouſand worlds; but hath God given thee that, and wilt thou be diſcontent for a trifle in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to that?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third work when God brings the ſoul home to himſelf it is, <hi>By taking the heart off from the Creature, the diſinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the heart from all Creature-comforts:</hi> that's the Third work ordinarily that the ſoul may perceive of its ſelfe. It's true, Gods work may be altogether in the ſeeds in him, but in the ſeveral actings of the ſoul in turning to God it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe things in it; the diſingagement of the heart from the Creature, that's the calling off the ſoul from the world, <hi>Whom the Lord hath called he hath juſtified</hi>: what's the calling of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58996:71"/>
ſoul but this, the ſoul that was before ſeeking for Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, and cleaving to the Creature, now the Lord calls the ſoul out of the world, and ſaith, Oh ſoul, thy happineſſe is not here, thy reſt is not here, thy happineſſe is elſe-where, and thy heart muſt be looſned from all theſe things that are here below in the world; and this is the work of God in the ſoul to diſingage the heart from the Creature, and how contrary is a murmuring heart to ſuch a thing; a thing that is glued to another you cannot take off, but you muſt rend it, ſo it's a ſign thy heart is glued to the world, that when God would take thee off, thy heart rends, if God by an affliction ſhould come to take any thing in the world from thee, if thou canſt part from it with eaſe without rending, it's a ſign then that thy heart is not glued to the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth work of God in the converting of a ſinner, is this, <hi>The caſting of the ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all its good:</hi> I ſee Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel the Fountain of all good, and God out of free Grace tendering him to me for life, and for ſalvation, and now my ſoul caſts its ſelf, rouls it ſelf upon the infinit Grace of God in Chriſt for al good; now haſt thou done ſo? hath God converted thee, and drawn thee to his Son to caſt thy ſoul upon him for all thy good, and yet thou diſcontented for the want of ſome little matter in a creature-comfort? art thou he that hath caſt thy ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all good? as he ſaith in another caſe, Is this thy faith?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Soul is ſubdued to God</hi>; and then it comes to receive Jeſus Chriſt as a King, to rule, to order and diſpoſe of him how he pleaſes, and ſo the heart is ſubdued unto God. Now how oppoſite is a murmuring diſcontented heart to a heart ſubdued to Jeſus Chriſt as a King, and receiving him as a Lord to rule and diſpoſe of him as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is in the work of thy turning to God the giving up of thy ſelf to God in an everlaſting Covenant? as thou takeſt Chriſt the Head of the Covenant to be thine, ſo thou giveſt up thy ſelf to Chriſt; In the work of Converſion there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Soul wholly to God in an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be his; haſt thou ever ſurrendred up thy ſelf to God in an everlaſting Covenant? then certainly this thy fretting, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58996:71"/>
heart is mighty oppoſite to it, certainly thou forgetteſt this Covenant of thine, and the Reſignation of thy ſelf up to God, it would be of marvellous help to you to humble your Souls when you are in a murmuring condition; if you could but obtain ſo much liberty of your own ſpirits as to look back to ſee what the work of God was in converting you, there is nothing would prevail more than to think of that. I am now in a murmuring diſcontented way, but how did I feel my ſoul working when God did turn my Soul to himſelf? Oh how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite is this to that work, and how unſeeming? Oh what ſhame and confuſion would come upon the ſpirits of men and women, if they could but compare the work of corruption in their murmuring and diſcontent, with the work of God that was upon their Souls in converſion, now we ſhould labour to keep the work of God upon our Souls that was at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for Converſion muſt not be only at one inſtant at firſt: men are deceived in this, if they think their Converſion is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed meerly at firſt, thou muſt be in a way of converſion to God all the daies of thy life, and therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, except ye be converted and become as little children: <hi>Ye be Converted,</hi> why, were they not converted before? Yes they were converted, but they were ſtill to continue the work of Converſion all the daies of their lives, and what work of God there is at the firſt Converſion it is to abide afterwards. As thus, alwaies there muſt abide ſome ſight and ſenſe of ſin, it may be not in the way which you had, which was rather a preparation than any thing elſe, but the ſight and ſenſe of ſin it is to continue ſtill, that is, you are ſtill to be ſenſible of the burden of ſin as it is againſt the Holineſſe, and Goodneſſe, and Mercy of God unto thee, and the ſight of the excellency of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is to continue, and thy calling out of the Creature: and thy caſting of thy Soul upon Chriſt, and thy receiving Chriſt as a King, ſtill receive him day by day, and the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy heart, and the ſurrendring of thy ſelfe up to God in a way of Covenant; now if this were but daily continued there would be no ſpace nor time for murmuring to work upon thy heart: that's the Fourth Particular.</p>
               <p>The Fift thing in the evil of diſcontentment, <hi>Murmuring
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58996:72"/>
and diſcontentment is exceedingly below a Chriſtian</hi>; Oh! it is too mean and baſe a diſtemper for a Chriſtian to give place to it. Now it's below a Chriſtian in many reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1 How below the relation of a Chriſtian? The relation in which thou ſtandeſt. With what relation (you will ſay?)</p>
               <p>Firſt, The relation thou ſtandeſt in to God: Do'ſt not thou call God thy father? and do'ſt not thou ſtand in relation to him as a child? what? thou murmer? In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.4. it's a ſpeech of <hi>Jonadab</hi> to <hi>Amnon, Why art thou, being the Kings Son, lean from day to day, wilt thou not tell me?</hi> and ſo he told him; (but that was for a wicked cauſe) he perceived that his ſpirit was troubled, for otherwiſe he was of a fat and plump temper of body, but becauſe of trouble of ſpirit he was even pin'd away why? what's the matter? thou that ſtandeſt in this relation to the King and yet any thing ſhould trouble thy heart, (that's his meaning) is there any thing that ſhould diſquiet thy heart, and yet ſtandeſt in ſuch a relation to the King, the King's Son? So I may ſay to a Chriſtian, Art thou the King's Son, the Son, the Daughter of the King of Heaven, and yet ſo diſquieted and troubled, and vext at every little thing that falls out? as if a King's Son ſhould cry out, he is undone for loſing a bable, what an unworthy thing were this: So doeſt thou, thou crieſt out as if thou wert undon, and yet a Kings Son, thou that ſtandeſt in ſuch relation to God, as unto a father, thou doeſt diſhonour thy father in this; as if ſo be either he had not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or not power, or not mercy enough to provide for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to Jeſus Chriſt, thou art the ſpouſe of Chriſt</hi>: what! one married to Jeſus Chriſt &amp; yet troubled and diſcontented? haſt thou not enough in him; doth not Chriſt ſay to his ſpouſe, as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>Am not I better to thee than ten ſons?</hi> So doth not Chriſt thy husband ſay to thee, Am not I better to thee than thouſands of riches and comforts? ſuch comforts as thou murmureſt for want of; hath not God given thee his Son? and will he not with him give thee all things? hath the love of God bin to thee to give thee his Son in way of marriage? why art thou diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and murmuring? conſider thy relation to Jeſus Chriſt,

as thou art a ſpouſe and married to him, his perſon is thine, and ſo all the riches of Jeſus Chriſt is thine, as the riches of a husband are the wives, and though there are ſome husbands ſo vile as the wives may be forced to ſue for maintainance; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Jeſus Chriſt will never deny maintainance to his ſpouſe, it's a diſhonour for a husband to have the wife go whining up-and down; what, thou art macht with Chriſt &amp; art his ſpouſe, and wilt thou murmur now and be diſcontented in thy ſpirit? You ſhall obſerve among thoſe that are newly matched, when there is diſcontent between the wife and the husband, their friends will ſhake their heads and ſay, they do not meet with that that they did expect, ye ſee ever ſince they were married to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether how the man looks, and the woman looks, they are not ſo chearly as they were wont to be, ſurely (ſay they) it is like to prove an ill match. But it's not ſo here, it ſhall not be ſo between thee and Chriſt: Oh Jeſus Chriſt doth not love to ſee his ſpouſe to have a lowring countenance: no man loves to ſee diſcontentment in the face of his wife, ſurely Chriſt doth not love to ſee diſcontentment in the face of his ſpouſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Thou ſtandeſt in relation to Chriſt</hi> not only as a ſpouſe, but as <hi>a member, Thou art bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh</hi>; and to have a member of Jeſus Chriſt to be in ſuch a condition, it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unworthy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He is thy Elder brother likewiſe, and ſo thou art a Co heir with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Spirit of God,</hi> thou art the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, the holy Ghoſt is thy Comforter, it is he that is appointed to convey all comfort from the Father and the Son, to the Souls of his people. And art thou the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the holy Ghoſt, and doth he dwell in thee, and yet for all that thou murmur for every little matter.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Angels, thou art made one body with them:</hi> for ſo Chriſt hath joyned principalities and powers with his Church, they are Miniſtring Spirits for good to his people, to ſupply what they need, and thou, and they are joyned together, and Chriſt is the head of you and Angels.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>The relation that you ſtand in to the Saints, you are of the ſame body with them,</hi> they and you make up but one myſtical body

with Jeſus Chriſt, and if they be happy you muſt needs be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; Oh how beneath a Chriſtian is a murmuring Spirit if he conſiders his relations in which he ſtands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Chriſtian ſhould conſider, <hi>That murmuring and diſcontentedneſse is below the high dignities that God hath put upon him:</hi> Do but conſider the high dignitie that God hath put upon thee; the meaneſt Chriſtian in the world is a lord of heaven and earth; he hath made us Kings unto himſelfe, Kings unto God, not Kings unto men to rule over them, and yet I ſay every Chriſtian is lord of heaven and earth, yea of life and death. That is, as Chriſt he is Lord of all, ſo he hath made thoſe that are his members to be lords of all, all are yours ſaith the Apoſtle, even life and death, every thing is yours. It's a very ſtrange expreſſion that death ſhould be theirs, death is yours, that is, you are as it were lords over it, you have that that ſhall make death to be your ſervant, your ſlave, even death it's ſelf, your greateſt enemies are turned to be your ſlaves; faith makes a Chriſtian to be as lord over all, to be lifted up in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above all creatures that ever God made except the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yea and in ſome reſpect above them, I ſay the pooreſt Chriſtian that lives is raiſed to an eſtate above all the creatures in the world except Angels, yea and above them in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects too, and yet diſcontented, that thou who wert as a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of hell, and might have been ſcorching and yelling and roring there to all eternity, yet that God ſhould raiſe thee to have a higher excellency in thee than there is in all the works of creation that ever he made except Angels, and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are in thy condition, yea and thou art neerer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature than the Angels, becauſe thy nature is joyned in an hypoſtatical union to the Divine Nature, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thy nature is more honoured than the nature of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And the death of Chriſt is thine, he died for thee and not for the Angels, and therefore thou art like to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels in divers reſpects: yea thou that art in ſuch an eſtate as this is, thou that art ſet apart to the end that God might manifeſt to all eternity what the infinite power of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is able to raiſe a creature too; for that's the condition of a Saint, a Beleever, his condition is ſuch as he is ſet apart to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58996:73"/>
end that God might manifeſt to all eternity what his infinite power is able to do to make the creature happy; art thou in ſuch a condition? Oh! how low and beneath this condition is a murmuring and diſcontented heart for want of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts here in this world: How unſeemly is it that thou ſhouldeſt be a ſlave to every croſſe, that every affliction ſhal be able to ſay to thy ſoul, bow down to us: We accounted that a great ſlavery, when men would ſay to our ſouls, bow down: As the cruel Prelats were wont to do in impoſing things upon mens conſciences, they did in effect ſay, let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down to us, that we may tread upon them; that is the greateſt ſlavery in the world, that one man ſhould ſay to another, let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down that we may tread upon them; but wilt thou ſuffer every affliction to ſay, bow down that we may tread upon thee? truly it's ſo, when thy heart is overcome with murmuring and diſcontent: Know that thoſe afflictions which have cauſed thee to murmur, have ſaid to thee, bow down that we may tread upon thee; nay, not afflictions, but the very Devil doth prevail againſt you in this: Oh! how beneath is this to the happy eſtate that God hath raiſed a Chriſtian unto! What! the ſon of a King, ſhal he have every baſe fellow to come and bid him bow down that he may tread upon his neck? thus doeſt thou in every affliction: the affliction, the croſs, and trouble that doth befal thee, ſaith bow down that we come and tread upon thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Murmuring it's below the Spirit of a Chriſtian.</hi> Below his Spirit, the Spirit of every Chriſtian ſhould be like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Father; every father loves to ſee his ſpirit in his child, loves to ſee his image, not the image of his body only, to ſay, here's a child for all the world like the father, but he hath the ſpirit of his father too: a father that is a man of ſpirit, loves to ſee his ſpirit in his child, rather than the feature of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Oh the Lord that is our Father, loves to ſee his Spirit in us: Great men love to ſee great ſpirits in their Children, and the great God loves to ſee a great Spirit in his Children; we are one Spirit with God, and with Chriſt, and one Spirit with the Holy-Ghoſt, therefore we ſhould have a Spirit that might manifeſt the glory of the Father, Son, &amp; holy-Ghoſt in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58996:74"/>
that's the ſpirit of a Chriſtian indeed. The ſpirit of a Chriſtian ſhould be a lyon-like Spirit, as Jeſus Chriſt is the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> (ſo he is cal'd) ſo we ſhould manifeſt ſomewhat of the Lyon-like Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lyon-like Spirit in paſſing through all afflictions and troubles whatſoever without any murmuring againſt God: When he came to drink that bitter cup, and even the dregs of it, he prayed to God (indeed) that if it were poſſible it might paſſe from him, but preſently, not my will, but thy will be done: As ſoon as ever he did mention the paſſing of the cup from him, (though it were the moſt dreadful cup that ever was drunk ſince the world began, yet at the mentioning of it) not my will, but thy will be done; here Chriſt ſhewed a Lyon-like Spirit in going through all kind of afflictions whatſoever with out any murmuring againſt God in them: now a murmuring ſpirit is a baſe dejected ſpirit, croſſe and contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Chriſtian, and it's very baſe. I remember that the Heathens accounted it very baſe, <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth report of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain people that did uſe to manifeſt their diſdain to men that were overmuch dejected by any affliction, they did condemn them to this puniſhment, to wear womens cloaths all their daies, or ſuch a ſpace of time at leaſt they ſhould go in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cloaths in token of ſhame and diſgrace to them becauſe they had ſuch effeminate ſpirits, they thought it againſt a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpirit, and therefore ſeeing they did un-man themſelves they ſhould go as women, now ſhall they account it an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpirit, to be overmuch dejected in afflictions; and ſhall not a Chriſtian account it an unchriſtian-like ſpirit to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much dejected by any affliction whatſoever? I remember ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compares murmuring ſpirits, to children when they are weaning, what a deal of ſtir have you with your children when you wean them, how froward and vexing are they? So when God would wean thee from ſome outward comforts in this world, Oh how fretting and diſcontented art thou! Children will not ſleep themſelves, nor let their mothers ſleep when they are weaning; and ſo when God would wean us from the world, and we fret, vex, and murmur, this is a childiſh ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58996:74"/>Fourthly, <hi>It's below the profeſſion of a Chriſtian.</hi> The profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Chriſtian, what's that? A Chriſtians profeſſion is to be dead to the world, and to be alive to God, that's his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to have his life to be hid with Chriſt in God, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf in God; what is this thy profeſſion? and yet if thou haſt not every thing that thou wouldeſt have to murmur and be diſcontent, thou doeſt in that even deny thy profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>It is below that ſpecial Grace of faith.</hi> Faith is that that doth overcome the world, it is that that makes all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God to be ours: Now when thou tookeſt upon thee the profeſſion of Religion, did God ever promiſe thee that thou ſhouldeſt live at eaſe, and quiet, and have no trouble? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, What is this thy faith? what did I ever promiſe thee, (ſaith he) that thou ſhouldeſt ever flouriſh in the world? art thou a Chriſtian to that end? and is this thy faith? I never made any ſuch promiſe to thee when thou tookeſt upon thee to be a Chriſtian: Oh it's mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thy profeſſion, thou haſt never a promiſe for this, that thou ſhouldeſt not have ſuch an affliction upon thee: And a Chriſtian ſhould live by his faith; it is ſaid, that the juſt do live by faith; now thou ſhouldeſt not look after any other life but the life that thou haſt by faith; now thou haſt no ground for thy faith, to beleeve that thou ſhouldeſt be delivered out of ſuch an affliction; and then, why ſhouldeſt thou account it ſuch a great evil to be under ſuch an affliction? Certainly that good that we have in the ground for our faith, it is enough to content our hearts here, and to all eternity: A Chriſtian ſhould be ſatisfied with that that God hath made to be the object of his faith, the object of his faith is high enough to ſatisfie his ſoul, were it capable of a thouſand times more than it is: Now if thou mayeſt have the object of thy faith full, thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to content thy ſoul: And know that when thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſuch and ſuch comforts, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt but think thus, God did never promiſe me that I ſhould have theſe Comforts, and at this time, and in ſuch a way as I would have, but I am diſcontented becauſe I have not theſe which God did never yet promiſe me, and therefore I ſin much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58996:75"/>
againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the grace of faith.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing, It's below the hopes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Oh! the moſt glorious things that the Saints hope for.</p>
               <p>And againſt the helps that Chriſtians have, Chriſtians have great helps that may help them againſt murmuring.</p>
               <p>And it is againſt that which God expects from Chriſtians. God he expects other manner of things from them than this.</p>
               <p>Yea, and it is below that that God hath from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe things I ſhall open at another time.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, It is below a Chriſtian in this, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's below thoſe helps that a Chriſtian hath more than others have</hi>; they have the promiſes to help them that others have not; it's not ſo much to have a <hi>Nabal</hi> have his heart ſink, becauſe he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the creature to uphold him, but it's much for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that hath promiſes and ordinances to uphold his ſpirit which others have not.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>It's below the expectation that God hath of Chriſtians,</hi> for God expects not only that they ſhould be patient in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that they ſhould rejoyce and triumph in them: now
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58996:75"/>
Chriſtians, when God expects this from you, for you not ſo much as to have attained to contentedneſſe under afflictions, Oh this is beneath the expectation of God from you.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>It is below that that God hath had from other Chriſtians.</hi> Others have not only bin contented with little croſſes, but they have Triumphed under great afflictions, they have ſuffered the ſpoiling of their goods with joy, reade but the latter part of the 11. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and you ſhall find what great things God hath had from his people, and therefore not to be content with ſmaler croſſes, this muſt needs be a great evil.</p>
               <p>The Sixth evil that there is in a murmuring ſpirit, is this, <hi>By murmuring you undo your prayers, for it is exceeding contrary to the prayers that you make unto God</hi>: When you come to prayer to God, you acknowledge his Sovereignity over you, you come there to profeſſe your ſelves to be at Gods diſpoſe, what do you pray for except you acknowledge that you are at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, except you will ſtand (as it were) at his diſpoſe never come to petition to him, if you will come to petition him, and yet will be your own carver you go croſſe to your prayers, to come as if you would beg your bread at your Fathers gates every day, and yet you muſt do what you liſt, this is the undoing of the prayers of a Chriſtian. I remember I have read of <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> that ſpeaking concerning <hi>Peter</hi> that denyed his maſter, (ſaith he) <hi>Peter</hi> forgot his Pater-noſter, for that was, <hi>hallowed be thy name,</hi> and <hi>thy kingdom come</hi>: So we may ſay, when you have murmuring and diſcontented hearts you forget your prayers, you forget what you have prayed for, for you muſt make the Lords-prayer to be as a pattern for your prayers though you ſay not alwaies the ſame words, what do you pray, <hi>but give us this day our dayly bread</hi>? for that's Chriſts intention that we ſhould have that as a pattern, and is a directory (as it were) how to make our prayers, now God doth not teach any of you to pray, Lord give me ſo much a yeer, or let me have ſuch kind of cloath, and ſo many diſhes at my table, Chriſt doth not teach you to pray ſo; but he teaches us to pray, <hi>Lord give us our bread,</hi> ſhewing that you ſhould be content with a little, what have you not bread to eat? I hope there's none of you here but have that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58996:76"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I do not know if I ſhould die what ſhould become of my children: Or if I have bread now I know not where I ſhall have it the next week, or where I ſhall have proviſion for the winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where did Chriſt teach us to pray, Lord give us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſo long a time; no, but if we have bread for this day Chriſt would have us content: Therefore when we murmur becauſe we have not ſo much variety as others have, we do (as it were) forget our <hi>Pater-noſter</hi>; It's againſt our prayers, we do not in our lives hold forth the acknowledgement of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignity of God over us as we ſeem to acknowledg in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; therefore when at any time you find your hearts murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then do but reflect upon your ſelves and think thus, is this according to my prayers, wherein I held forth the Sovereign Power and Authority that God had over me?</p>
               <p>The Seventh thing that I adde for the evil of diſcontentment, is, The wofull effects that comes to a diſcontented heart from murmuring, I'le name you five, there are five evil effects that comes from a murmuring ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>By murmuring and diſcontent in your hearts, you come to looſe a great deal of time</hi>; how many times do men and women when they are diſcontented let their thoughts run, and are muſing and contriving through their preſent diſcontentedneſſe; then let their diſcontented thoughts be working in them, for ſome hours together, and they ſpend their time in vain. When you are alone you ſhould ſpend your time in holy meditation, but you are ſpending your time in diſcontented thoughts; you who complain that you cannot meditate, you cannot think on good things, but if you begin to think of them a little, preſently your thoughts are off from them, but if you be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with any thing, then you can go alone, and muſe, and roul things up and down in your thoughts to feed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humour: Oh labour to ſee this evil effect of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, the loſing of your time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It doth unfit you for duty</hi>: A man or woman that is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame, you may turn ſuch a one to any thing at any time, he is fit for to go to God at any time; but when one is in a diſcontented condition, then a man or woman is exceeding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58996:76"/>
unfit for the ſervice of God. And it cauſes many diſtractions in duty, it unfits for duty, and when you come to perform duties, Oh the diſtractions that are in your duties, when your ſpirits are diſcontented; when you hear of any ill news from Sea and cannot bear it, or of any ill from a friend, or any loſſe or croſſe, Oh what diſtractions do they cauſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties! When you ſhould be in enjoying communion with God, you are diſtracted in your thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the croſſe that hath befallen you, whereas had you but a quiet ſpirit, though there ſhould great croſſes befal you, yet they would never hinder you in the performance of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Conſider what wicked riſings of heart, &amp; reſolutions of ſpirit there are many times in a diſcontented fit.</hi> In ſome diſcontented fits the heart riſes againſt God, and againſt others, and ſometimes hath even deſperate reſolutions what to do to help themſelves. If the Lord ſhould have ſuffered you to have done, (ſometimes in a diſcontented fit) what you had thought to do, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miſery had you brought upon your ſelves! Oh it was a mercy of God that did ſtop you, had not God ſtopt you, but let you go on when you thought to help your ſelves this way and the other way, Oh it had been ill with you, do you but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe riſings of heart and wicked reſolutions that ſometimes you have had in a diſcontented mood, and learn to be humbled upon that.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankefulneſſe, that's an evil and a wicked effect that comes from diſcontent.</hi> Unthankfulneſſe the Scripture doth ranke among very great ſins. For men and women that are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent though they enjoy many mercies from God, yet they are thankfull for none of them, for this is the vile nature of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, to leſſen every mercy of God, to make thoſe mercies they have from God to be as nothing to them, becauſe they have not what they would have. Sometimes it's ſo even in ſpiritual things, if they have not all they would have, the comforts that they would have, then what they have is nothing to them, do you think that God will take this well? If you ſhould give a friend, a kinſman, a purſe of money to go and trade withal, and he ſhould come and ſay, what do you give
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58996:77"/>
me? they are but a few counters, they wil do me no good: you cannot bear this at his hand if he ſhould do ſo, becauſe he hath not as much money as he would: So for you to be ready to ſay, All that God hath given me is nothing worth, will do me no good, they are but counters; though they are the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Graces of Gods Spirit that are more worth than thouſands of worlds, yet for you to ſay, they are nothing, they are but common gifts, and all is but in hypocriſie, all counterfeit, Oh! what an unthankful thing is this! the graces of Gods Spirit are nothing to a diſcontented heart that hath not all that it would have; and ſo for outward bleſſings, though God hath given you health of body, and ſtrength, and hath given you ſome competency for your family, ſome way of lively-hood, yet becauſe you are diſappointed in ſomwhat that you would have therefore all is nothing unto you; Oh! what unthankfulneſſe is here? God expects that every day you ſhould ſpend ſome time in bleſſing his Name for what mercy he hath granted unto you, there's not any one of you who are in the loweſt condition but you have abundance of mercies to bleſſe God for, but diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe makes them nothing. It's an excellent ſpeech that I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath, (ſaith he) This is the Rhetorick of the Spirit of God, (it's a very fine ſpeech of his) to extenuate evil things, and to amplyfie good things; if there fals out a croſſe, to make the croſſe to be but little, but if there be a mercy to make the mercy to be great; as thus, If there be a croſs, if the Spirit of God prevails in the heart, ſuch a man or woman will wonder that it is no greater, and will bleſſe God that though there be ſuch a croſſe, yet that it is no more; that's the work of the Spirit of God; and if there be a mercy, wonders at Gods goodneſſe that God granted ſo great a mercy: The Spirit of God extenuates evils and croſſes, and doth magnifie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie all mercies, and makes all mercies ſeem to be great, and all afflictions ſeem to be little. But (ſaith he) the Devil goes quite contrary, the Rhetorick of the Devil is quite otherwiſe, he doth leſſen Gods mercies, and amplifie evill things, as thus, A godly man wonders at his croſſe that it is no more, a wicked man wonders his croſſe is ſo much, Oh (ſaith he) none was ever ſo afflicted as I am! If there be a croſſe, the Devil puts the ſoul
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58996:77"/>
upon muſing on it, and making it greater than it is, and ſo it brings diſcontent: And then on the other ſide, if there be a mercy, then it's the Rhetorick of the Devil to leſſen the mercy, I indeed (ſaith he) the thing is a good thing, but what is it, it is no great matter, and for all this I may be miſerable. Thus the Rhetorick of Satan doth leſſen Gods mercies, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe afflictions: And for this I'le give you a notable example that we have in Scripture, it is the example of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram,</hi> In <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.12, 13. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſent to call</hi> Dathan, <hi>&amp;</hi> Abiram <hi>the ſons of</hi> Eliab: <hi>which ſaid, we will not come up: Is it a ſmal thing that thou haſt brought us up out of a Land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderneſs, except thou make thy ſelf altogether a Prince over us</hi>? Mark, they ſlighted the land that they were going unto, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was the Land that God promiſed them that ſhould flow with milk and honey: But mark here their diſcontentedneſſe, becauſe they met with ſome troubles in the wilderneſſe, Oh it was to ſlay them, they made their affliction in the wilderneſs to be greater than it was, Oh it was to kill them, though it were indeed to carry them to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But now their deliverance from Egypt though it was a great mercy, they made that mercy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for ſay they, you have brought us out of a land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with milk and honey, what land was that? It was the Land of Egypt, the Land of their bondage, but they call it a Land that flowed with milk and honey, though it were the land of their moſt cruel and unſupportable bondage; whereas they ſhould have bleſſed God as long as they had liv'd for Gods delivering them out of the land of Egypt, yet meeting with ſome croſſe they make their deliverance from Egypt no mercie, no, it was rather a miſerie to them, Oh (ſay they) Egypt was a land that flowed with milk and honey. Oh what baſeneſſe is there in a diſcontented ſpirit! a diſcontented ſpirit out of envie to Gods grace will make mercies that are great to be little, yea to be none at all. Would one ever have thought that ſuch a word ſhould have come from the mouth of an Iſraelite that had been under bondage and cried under it, and yet when they meet with a little croſſe in their way to ſay, you have brought us out of the Land that floweth with milk and honey, to ſay they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58996:78"/>
were better before than now, and yet before they could not be contented neither; this is the uſual unthankful expreſſion of a diſcontented heart: And it is ſo with us now when we meet with any croſſe in our eſtates, any taxations and trouble, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any among you have been where the enemy hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, you are ready to ſay, we had plenty before and we are now brought to a condition of hardſhip, we were better before when we had the Prelats and others to domineer: and ſo we indanger our ſelves to be brought into that bondage again; Oh let us take heed of this, of a diſcontented heart, there is this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſed fruit of diſcontent to make men and women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful for all the mercies God hath granted to them, and this is a ſore and grievous evil.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>There's this evil effect in murmuring, It cauſes ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſpirit:</hi> they that murmur and are diſcontent, are lyable to temptations, to ſhift for themſelves in ſinful and ungodly waies, diſcontent is the ground of ſhifting courſes and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waies. How many of you may have your conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you of this, that you in the time of your afflictions have fought to ſhift for your ſelves by waies that have been ſinful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and your diſcontent was the bottom and ground of it? If you would avoid ſhiftings for your ſelves by wicked waies, labour to mortifie this ſin of diſcontent, to mortifie it at the root.</p>
               <p>The Eight evil that there is in murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There is a great deal of folly, extream folly in a diſcontented heart, it's a fooliſh ſin.</hi> I ſhall open the folly of it in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>It takes away the preſent comfort of what you have, becauſe you have not ſomwhat that you would have.</hi> What a fooliſh thing is this, that becauſe I have not what I would have, I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of what I have? Do not you account this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your children, you give them ſome victuals and they are not contented, perhaps (they ſay) it's not enough, they cry for more, and if you do not preſently give them more they will throw away that they have, and though you account that folly in your children, yet you deal thus with God; God gives you many mercies, but you ſee others have more mercies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58996:78"/>
than you and therefore you cry for more; I but God gives you not what you would have and upon that you throw away what you have, is not this follie in your hearts? It is unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There's a great deal of follie in diſcontentment, for <hi>by all your diſcontent you cannot help your ſelves,</hi> you cannot get anie thing by it. Who can by taking anie carking care <hi>adde one cubit to his ſtature, or make one hair that is white to be black</hi>? You may vex and trouble your ſelves, but you can get nothing by it. Do you think that the Lord will come in a way of mercie ever a whit the ſooner becauſe of the murmuring of your ſpirits, Oh no, but mercie will be rather deferred the longer for it, though the Lord were before in a way of mercie, yet this diſtemper of your hearts were enough to put him out of his courſe of mercie, and though he had thoughts that you ſhould have the thing before, yet now you ſhall not have it. If you had a mind to give ſuch a thing to your child, yet if you ſee him in a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented fretting way you will not give it him; and this is the verie reaſon why there are ſo manie mercies denied to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of your diſcontentment, you are diſcontented for want of them, and therefore you have them not, you do deprive your ſelves of the enjoyment of your own deſires becauſe of the diſcontentment of your hearts, becauſe you have not your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and is not this a fooliſh thing?</p>
               <p n="3">3 There's a great deal of folly in this, <hi>there are many fooliſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages commonly that a diſcontented heart is guilty of: They carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fooliſhly towards God and towards men,</hi> there are ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and ſuch kind of behaviour comes from them, as makes their friends to be aſhamed of them manie times, their carriages are ſo unſeemlie, they are a ſhame to themſelves &amp; their friends.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>There is a great deal of folly in diſcontent and murmuring; for it doth eat out the good and ſweetneſſe of a mercy before it comes.</hi> If God ſhould give a mercie that we are diſcontented for the want of, yet the bleſſing of the mercie is as it were eaten out before we come to have it. Diſcontent is like a worm that eats the meat out of the nut, and then when the meat is eaten out of it, then you ſhall have the ſhell. If a child ſhould crie for a nut
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58996:79"/>
that hath the meat eaten out, or all worm-eaten, what good would the child have by having the nut; ſo ſuch an outward comfort you would fain have and you are troubled for the want of it, but the verie trouble of your ſpirits is the worm that eats out the bleſſing of the mercy, and then perhaps God gives it you, but gives you it with a curſe mixed with it that you were better not have it than have it. That man or woman that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſome good thing, if God doth give that good thing to them before they be humbled for their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that did proceed from them, ſuch a man or woman can have no comfort of the mercie, but it will be rather an evil than a good to them: And therefore for my part if I ſhould have a friend or brother or one that were as deer to me as my own ſoul, that I ſhould ſee diſcontented for the want of ſuch a comfort, I ſhould rather pray, Lord keep this thing from them, til thou wilt be pleaſed to humble their hearts for their diſcontent, let not them have the mercie til they come to be humbled for their diſcontent for the want of it, for if they have it before that time they will have it without any bleſſing: And therefore it ſhould be your care when you find your hearts diſcontented for want of any thing, to be humbled for it, thinking thus with your ſelves, Lord if that that I do ſo immoderatly deſire ſhould come to me before I be humbled for my diſcontent for want of it, I am certain I can have no comfort of it, but I ſhall rather have it as an affliction to me. Many things which you deſire as your lives, and think that you ſhould be happy if you had them, yet when they do come you find not ſuch happineſſe in them, but they prove to be the greateſt croſſes and afflictions to you that ever you had, and upon this ground, becauſe your hearts were immoderatly ſet upon them before you had them. As it was with <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe muſt have children or elſe ſhe died, well ſaith God ſeeing you <hi>muſt,</hi> you ſhal have them, but though ſhe had a child ſhe died according to what ſhe ſaid, <hi>Give me children or elſe I die.</hi> So in regard of any other outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, people may have the thing, but often times they have it ſo as it proves the heavieſt croſſe to them that ever they had in all their lives, ſuch a child as you were diſcontent for the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58996:79"/>
want of it, it may be it was ſick, and your hearts were out of temper for fear that you ſhould loſe it, and God reſtores it, but he reſtores it ſo as he makes it a croſs to your heart all the daies of your lives. One obſerves concerning <hi>Manna,</hi> when the people were contented with their allowance that God allowed them, then it was verie good, but when they would not be content with Gods allowance, but would gather more than God would have them; then (ſaith the text) there was worms in it: So when we are content with our conditions, and that that God diſpoſes of us to be in, there's a bleſſing in it, then it's ſweet to us, but if we muſt needs have more, and keep it longer than God would have us to have it, then there will be worms in it and no good at all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There's a great deal of folly in diſcontentedneſs, for it makes our afflictions a great deal worſe than otherwiſe it would be</hi>; it no way removes our affliction, nay, while they do continue they are a great deal the worſe and heaviour, for a diſcontented heart is a proud heart, and a proud heart wil not pul down his ſails when there comes a tempeſt and ſtorme: If a Marriner when a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and ſtorme comes ſhould be froward and would not pull down his ſails, but is diſcontented with the ſtorm, is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the better becauſe he is diſcontented and will not pull down his ſails? Will this help him? Juſt ſo is it for all the world with a diſcontented heart, a diſcontented heart is a proud heart, and he out of his pride is troubled with his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is not contented with Gods diſpoſe, and ſo he will not pull down his ſpirit at all, and make it bow to God in this condition in which God hath brought him; now is his condition the better becauſe he will not pull down his ſpirit? no certainly abundantly worſe, a thouſand to one but the tempeſt and ſtorm over-whelms his ſoul. And thus you ſee what a great deal of folly there is in the ſinne of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Ninth Evil of murmuring and diſcontentment is this, <hi>There is a mighty deal of danger in the ſin of diſcontentment, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provoketh the wrath of God</hi>; it's a ſin that doth much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God againſt his creature; we find moſt ſad expreſſions in Scripture (and examples too) how God hath been provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58996:80"/>
many for their diſcontent; in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. you have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table text, and one would think that that were enough for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make you fear murmuring, in the 26. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaying,</hi> what did he ſay? <hi>How long ſhall I bear with this evill Congregation which murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me?</hi> How long ſhall I bear with them ſaith God, <hi>This evil congregation</hi>; Oh it's an evil congregation that murmur againſt me! And how long ſhall I bear with them? they do murmur, and they have murmured: as thoſe that have murmuring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and murmuring diſpoſitions, they wil murmur again, and again, <hi>How long ſhall I hear with this evil congregation that murmur againſt me?</hi> How juſtly may God ſpeak this of many of you that are this morning before the Lord, How long ſhall I bear with this wicked man or woman that doth murmur againſt me, and hath uſually in the courſe of their lives murmured againſt me when any thing falls out otherwiſe than they would have it? And mark what follows after, <hi>I have heard the murmurings of the Children of Iſrael</hi>: You murmur, it may be others hear you not, nay it may be you ſpeak not at all, or but half-words, yet God hears the language of your murmuring hearts, and thoſe muttering ſpeeches, and thoſe half-words that comes from you. And obſerve further in this verſe, how the Lord repeats this ſin of murmuring, <hi>How long ſhall I bear with this evill congregation which murmur againſt me?</hi> Secondly, <hi>I have heard their murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>which they murmur againſt me: Murmur, murmur, murmur,</hi> Three times in one verſe he repeats it; and this is to ſhew his indignation againſt the thing: When you expreſſe indignation againſt a thing, you will repeat it over again, and again: now the Lord becauſe he would expreſs his indignation againſt this ſin, he repeats it over again, and again, and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the 28. verſ. <hi>Say unto them, as truly as I live ſaith the Lord, as ye have ſpoken in mine ears, ſo will I do to you.</hi> Mark, God ſwears againſt a murmurer; ſometimes in your diſcontent you will be ready to ſwear (it may be,) do you ſwear in your diſcontent? So doth God ſwear againſt you for your diſcontent. And what was it that God would do unto them? verſe, 29, 30. <hi>Doubtleſs your carkeiſes ſhall fall in the wilderneſs, and you ſhall not come into the land concerning which I ſwear, to make you dwel therein</hi>: as if God
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58996:80"/>
ſhould ſay, if I have any life in me, your lives ſhall go for it, as I live it ſhall coſt you your lives. A diſcontented murmuring fit of yours may coſt you your lives. You ſee how it provokes God, there is more evil in it than you are aware of, it may coſt you your lives, and therefore look to your ſelves, and learn to be humbled at the very beginnings of ſuch diſtempers in the heart. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24, 25. <hi>Yea they deſpiſed the pleaſant Land, they beleeved not his word; But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord; therefore be lifted up his hand againſt them to overthrow them in the wilderneſſe.</hi> Here are divers things obſervable in this Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which we ſpoke to before, How a murmuring heart doth ſlight Gods mercies, ſo it is here, <hi>They deſpiſed the pleaſant land</hi>: and that a murmuring heart is contrary to faith, <hi>they beleeved not his word, but</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>they murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.</hi> Many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will hearken to the voice of their own baſe murmuring hearts, that will not hearken to the voice of the Lord; if you would hearken to the voice of the Lord there would not be ſuch murmuring as there is: But mark what follows upon it, you may not think to pleaſe your ſelves in your murmuring diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe, and think that no evil ſhall come of it; <hi>Therefore he lifted up his hand againſt them to overthrow them</hi>: you that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, you lift up your hearts againſt God, and you cauſe God to lift up his hand againſt you; perhaps God laies his finger upon you ſoftly in ſome afflictions that are upon you, in your families or elſe where, and you cannot bear the hand of God that lies upon you as tenderly as a tender-hearted nurſe that laies her hand upon the child, you cannot bear the tender hand of God that is upon you in a leſſer affliction; it were juſt with God to lift up his hand againſt you in another manner of affliction; Oh a murmuring ſpirit provokes God exceedingly. There is another place in 16. of <hi>Num.</hi> compare the 41. verſe, and the 46. verſ. together, <hi>But on the morrow all the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>murmured againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord</hi>: and mark in the 46. verſe, <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>Take a Cenſer and put fire therein, from off the Altar, and put on incenſe, and go quickly unto
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58996:81"/>
the Congregation and make an attonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun</hi>; mark how Gods wrath is kindled; in the 41. verſe, the Congregation had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured; and they murmured but againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>haps you murmur more directly againſt God) and that was a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt God in murmuring againſt Gods Miniſters, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God but not ſo directly; but it may be the murmuring of your hearts is more directly againſt Gods dealings with you, if you murmur againſt thoſe that God makes inſtruments, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not every thing that you would have) as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, or ſuch and ſuch that are publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, it's againſt God; it was but againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that the Iſraelites murmured, and they ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had killed the people of the Lord, though it was the hand of God that was upon them for their former wickedneſſe, in murmuring. It is uſual for wicked vile hearts to deal thus with God, that when Gods hand is a little upon them for to murmur again and again, and ſo to bring upon themſelves even infinite kind of evils; but now the anger of God was quickly kindled, Oh ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Go, take the Cenſer quickly for wrath is gone out from Jehovah, the plague is begun: ſo while you are murmuring in your families, the wrath of God may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go out againſt you, quickly, in a morning or evening, when you are murmuring, the wrath of God may come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out upon your families or perſons, you are never ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for preſent wrath as when you are in a murmuring diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented fit, thoſe that ſtand by and ſee you in a murmuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented fit, have cauſe to ſay, Oh let us go and take the cenſer, let us go to prayer, for we are afraid that wrath is gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this familie, againſt this perſon: And it were a verie good thing for thee that art a godly wife when you ſee your husband come home and fall to murmuring becauſe things go not according to his deſire, to go to prayer, and ſay, Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſin of my husband; and ſo for the husband to go to God in prayer falling down and beſeeching of him that wrath may not come out againſt his familie for the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wife. And the truth is, at this day there hath been (at leaſt lately) as much murmuring in England as ever was,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58996:81"/>
and even in this very particular the plague is begun, and this very judgment it doth come many times upon murmuring upon thoſe that are ſo diſcontented in their families and are alwaies grumbling and murmuring at any thing that fals out amiſſe, (I ſay) this text of Scripture in <hi>Numbers</hi> doth cleerly hold forth this, that the Lord brings the plague upon men for this ſin of murmuring, he doth it in kingdomes and families, and upon particular perſons. Though we cannot alwaies point out the particular ſin that God brings this for, yet this ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined how far we are guilty of the ſin of murmuring; becauſe the Scripture holds forth this ſo cleerly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> when he did but hear that they murmured, Do they murmur? (ſaith he) Go forth quickly, and ſeek to paſſifie the anger of God, for wrath is gone out, and the plague is begun. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. there you have an notable example of Gods heavie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt murmuring, <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Take heed of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring as ſome of them did, (he ſpeaks of the people of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe,) but ſaith he, what came of it? <hi>They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Now the deſtroyer is thought to be the fiery-ſerpents that were ſent among them: They murmured, and God ſent fiery ſerpents to ſting them. What do you think that ſuch a croſs and affliction doth ſting you? perhaps ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is upon you, and it ſeems to be grievous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what? do you murmur and repine? God hath greater croſſes to bring upon you: Thoſe people that murmur for the want of outward comforts, for want of water, (ſometimes) and for the want of bread, they murmur, but the Lord ſends fiery-ſerpents among them. I may ſay to a murmuring heart, <hi>Wo to thee that ſtriveſt with thy Maker</hi>: wo to that man, that woman that ſtrives againſt their Maker; what doeſt thou elſe, but ſtrive againſt thy Maker? Thy Maker hath the abſolute diſpoſe of thee, and wilt thou ſtrive againſt thy Maker? What doth this murmuring diſcontented heart of thine do otherwiſe but wrangle and contind and ſtrive even with God himſelf? Oh wo to him that ſtrives againſt his Maker! I may further ſay to thee, as Gods ſpeaks to <hi>Job: Job,</hi> 38.1, 2. when <hi>Job</hi> was impatient, <hi>Now God ſpake</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>out of the whirlwind,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58996:82"/>
and ſaid, Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> So, doeſt thou ſpeak againſt Gods waies, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that hath fallen out concerning thy eſtate and outward comforts? who is this? <hi>Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Where's that man or woman whoſe hearts are ſo bold and impudent, as dares ſpeak againſt the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods providence?</p>
               <p>The Tenth Evil of murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There's a great curſe of God upon it, ſo far as it doth prevail in one that is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it hath the curſe of God upon it.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.15. ſee there what the curſe of God is upon wicked and ungodly men, <hi>Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not ſatisfied.</hi> That is the imprecation and curſe upon wicked and ungodly men, that if they be not ſatisfied they ſhall grudge; when thou art not ſatisfied in thy deſires and findeſt thy heart grudging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, apply this Scripture, What, is the curſe of the wicked upon me? This is the curſe that is threatned upon wicked and ungodly ones, That they ſhall grudge if they be not ſatisfied. And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.27. There it's threatned as a curſe of God upon men, that they cannot be content with their preſent condition, <hi>But they ſhall ſay in the morning, would God it were even; and at even, would God it were morning</hi>; and ſo they lie toſſing up and down and cannot be content with any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are in, becauſe of the ſore afflictions that be upon them; and therefore it is further threatned as a curſe upon them, in the 34. verſe, <hi>That they ſhould be mad for the ſight of their eyes which they ſhould ſee</hi>: This is but the extremity of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſſe; that is, they ſhall be ſo diſcontented, as they ſhall be even mad: Many men and women in diſcontented moods are mad kind of people, and though you may pleaſe your ſelves in ſuch a mad kind of behaviour, yet know, that it is a curſe of God upon men to be given up to a kind of madneſs for evils that they ſuppoſe are upon them, and that they fear. In the 47. verſe, there is a notable expreſſion for to ſhew the curſe of God upon murmuring hearts; the Lord threatning the curſes that ſhall be upon them, (ſaith he) verſe 45, 46, &amp; 47. <hi>The Curſe ſhall purſue thee, and they ſhall be upon thee for a ſign, and for a wonder, and upon thy ſeed for ever: Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58996:82"/>
Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things.</hi> God here threatens to bring his curſe ſo upon them, as to make them a wonder and a ſign to others, why? <hi>Becauſe they ſerved not the Lord with joyfulneſs of heart,</hi> (that may be added to that of the wrath of God upon men) therefore God would bring ſuch a curſe upon them as would make them a wonder to all that were about them; Oh how far art thou then that haſt a murmuring heart, from ſerving the Lord with joyfulneſſe?</p>
               <p>The Eleventh evill of diſcontent and murmuring is this. <hi>There is much of the ſpirit of Satan in a murmuring ſpirit.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is the moſt diſcontented creature that is in the world: He is the proudeſt creature that is, and the diſcontentedſt creature; and the moſt dejected creature. Now therefore ſo much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as thou haſt, ſo much of the ſpirit of Satan thou haſt. It was the unclean ſpirit that went up and down and found no reſt; ſo when a man or womans ſpirit hath no reſt, it is a ſign that it hath much of the unclean ſpirit, of the ſpirit of Satan, and thou ſhouldeſt think thus with thy ſelf, Oh Lord what have I the ſpirit of Satan upon me? It is Satan that is the moſt diſcontented ſpirit that is, and Oh! how much of his ſpirit have I upon me that can find no reſt at all?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Murmuring and diſcontent hath this evil in it, <hi>There is an abſolute neceſſity that thou ſhouldeſt have diſquiet all the daies of thy life.</hi> As if a man that is in a great croud ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that other folks touch him; While we are in this world God hath ſo ordred things that afflictions muſt befal us, and if we will complain and be diſcontented upon every croſſe and affliction, why we muſt complain and be diſcontent all the daies of our lives, yea God in juſt judgment will let things fall out on purpoſe to vex thoſe that have vexing ſpirits, and diſcontented hearts, and therefore there is a neceſſitie that they ſhould live diſquiet all their daies: and men will not much care to diſquiet thoſe that are continually murmuring, Oh they will have diſquiet all their daies.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there's this dreadful evil in diſcontent and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>God may juſtly withdraw his care off you, and his protection over you, ſeeing God cannot pleaſe you in his adminiſtrations.</hi> We
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58996:83"/>
uſe to ſay ſo to diſcontented ſervants; nay, if you be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mend your ſelves when you will. If you have a ſervant not content with his diet and wages, and work, you ſay, mend your ſelves; ſo may God juſtly ſay to us, we that profeſſe our ſelves ſervants to him, to be in his work, and yet are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this thing or that in Gods family, God might juſtly ſay, mend your ſelves. What if God ſhould ſay to any of you, If my care over you do not pleaſe you, then take care of your ſelves, if my protection over you will not pleaſe you, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect your ſelves: Now all things that do befall you, befall you through a providence of God, and if you be thoſe that belong to God there is a protection of God over you, and a care of God. Now if God ſhould ſay, Well, you ſhall not have the benefit of my protection anie longer, and I will take no further care of you: would not this be a moſt dreadful judgment of God from Heaven upon you? Take heed what you do then in being diſcontent with Gods will towards you, and indeed upon diſcontent this may befal you. And this is the reaſon why manie people though Gods protection hath bin verie gracious over them for a time, and they have thriven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, yet afterwards almoſt all that behold them may ſay that they live as if God had caſt off his care over them, and as if God did not care what befell them. Now then my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, put all theſe together, all that we were ſpeaking of the laſt day, and theſe particulars that have been added now this morning for the ſetting out of a murmuring and diſcontented ſpirit, Oh what an ugly face hath this ſin of murmuring, and diſcontentedneſſe, Oh what cauſe is there that we ſhould lay our hands upon our hearts, and go away and be humbled before the Lord becauſe of this! whereas your thoughts were wont to be exerciſed about providing for your ſelves, and getting more comforts to your ſelves, let the ſtream of your thoughts now be turned to humble your ſelves for your diſcontentedneſſe, Oh that you may have your hearts break before God, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will fall to it again, Oh the wretchedneſſe of mans heart! You ſhall find in Scripture concerning the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> how ſtrangely they fell to their murmuring again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, do but obſerve three texts of Scripture, for that, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58996:83"/>
firſt in the 15. of <hi>Exod.</hi> at the beginning, there you ſhall have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Congregation ſinging to God and bleſſing God for his mercy, <hi>Then ſang</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>this ſong unto the Lord, and ſpake ſaying, I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly, the Horſe and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea. And then, The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my ſalvation, he is my God and I will prepare him an habitation, my Fathers God and I will exalt him</hi>; and ſo he goes on, <hi>and who is like unto thee O Lord amongſt the gods, who is like thee, glorious in holineſſe, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders?</hi> Thus their hearts triumphed in God, but mark before the Chapter is ended in the 23. verſe, <hi>When they came to Marah</hi> (in the ſame Chapter) <hi>they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter, therefore the name of it was called Marah, and the people murmured againſt</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. After ſo great a mercy as this was, what unthankfulnes was there here in their murmuring! Then God gave them water, but in the very next Chapter they fell to their murmuring, (you reade not that they were humbled for their former murmuring, and therefore they murmur again) <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.1. &amp;c. <hi>All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>came to the wilderneſſe of Sin, &amp;c. And the whole Congregation</hi> (in the ſecond verſe) <hi>of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>murmured againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron <hi>in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid unto them, Would to God we had dyed by the hand of the Lord in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>when we ſate by the fleſh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.</hi> Now they want fleſh, they wanted water before, but now they want meat, they fell to murmuring again, they were not humbled for this murmuring againſt God, neither when God gave them fleſh according to their deſires, but they fell to murmuring again, they wanted ſomewhat elſe. In the very next Chapter, (they went not far) in the 17 of <hi>Exod.</hi> beginning. <hi>And all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>journied from the wilderneſſe of Sin and pitthed in</hi> Rephadim, <hi>and there was no water for the people to drink</hi>: then in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Wherefore the people did chide with</hi> Moſes, <hi>and ſaid, Give us water that we may drink, and</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto them, Why chide you with me? wherefore do you tempt the Lord?</hi> And in the third verſe, <hi>And the people thirſted there for water, and the people murmured againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and ſaid, Wherefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58996:84"/>
is this, that thou haſt brought us up out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>to kill us, and our Children, and our Cattell with thirſt?</hi> So one time after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill as ſoon as ever they had received the mercie then they were a little quieted, but they were not humbled. I bring theſe Scriptures for this to ſhew, that if we have not been humbled for murmuring, the next croſſe that we meet withal we will fall to murmuring again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now there are divers agravations of this ſin of murmuring,</hi> I'le mention but one now, and I ſhall but begin that. The firſt Agravation is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To murmur when we enjoy abundance of mercy, the greater and the more abundant the mercy is that we enjoy, the greater, and the viler is the ſin of murmuring.</hi> As here now when God had newly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them out of the houſe of bondage, for them, now to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, becauſe they want ſome few particulars that they deſire, Oh to ſin againſt God after a great mercy this is a great agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and a moſt abominable thing. Now my brethren, the Lord hath granted us very great mercies, I'le but ſpeak a word of what God hath done of late, what mercies hath the Lord granted to us this ſummer, heaped mercies upon us, one mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon another, what a condition were we in at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſummer? and what a different condition are we in now! Oh what a mercie is it that the Lord hath not taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages againſt us, that he hath not made thoſe Scriptures (before mentioned) good upon us for all our murmuring, the Lord hath gone on with one mercie after another. We hear of mercie in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and mercy to our brethren in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But ſtill if after this we ſhould have any thing befall us that is but croſſe to us, that we ſhould be ready to murmur again preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Oh let us not ſo requite God for thoſe mercies of his; Oh let's take heed of giving God any ill requital for his mercies; Oh give God praiſe according to his excellent greatneſs, to his excellent goodneſſe and grace.</p>
               <p>And now hath God given to you the Contentment of your hearts? Take you heed of being the cauſe of any greife to your brethren, think not that becauſe God hath been gracious unto you, that therefore he hath given you liberty for to bring them
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58996:84"/>
into bondage, Oh let not there be ſuch an il effect of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to you, as for you to exclude by petitioning, or any other way your Brethren that the Lord hath been pleaſed to make Inſtruments of your peace, let not that be the fruit of it, nor to deſire any thing that your ſelves do not yet underſtand. God is very jealous of the glory of his mercy, and if there ſhould be an ill uſe made of the mercy of God after we enjoy it, Oh it would go to the heart of God! nothing is more grievous to the heart of God than the abuſe of mercy: As now, if any way that is hard and rigid ſhould be taken towards our Brethren, and thoſe eſpecially that God hath made ſuch ſpecial Inſtruments of good to us, that have been ſo willing to venture their lives, and all for us; now when we have our turns ſerved, let God and his People, and Servants that have been a means to ſave us ſhift for themſelves as well as they can: Oh! this is a great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ſin, to ſin againſt the mercies of God: But for this Aggravation, and ſpecially in this particular, we ſhall ſpeak to (God willing) the next day.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW becauſe it is very hard to work upon a murmuring ſpirit, there are divers aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (I told you) we are to conſider of for the further ſetting out of the greatneſs of this ſin; I mentioned but only one the laſt day, now we ſhall proceed in that.</p>
               <p>The firſt Agravation of the ſin of diſcontent and murmuring is this, <hi>For men and women to be diſcontent in the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58996:85"/>
mid'ſt of mercies, in enjoyment of abundance of mercies.</hi> To be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in any afflicted condition, is ſinful and evil, but to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content when we are in the middeſt of Gods mercies, when we are not able to count the mercies of God, yet after to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent becauſe we have not all we would have, this is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil. I only mentioned this the laſt day, that I might ſhew to you what a great ſin it is at ſuch a time as this. The Lord this ſummer hath multiplied mercies one upon another, the Lord hath made this ſummer to be a continued miracle of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; never did a Kingdom enjoy (in ſo little ſpace of time) ſuch mercies one upon another: Now the publick mercies of God ſhould quiet our hearts and keep us from diſcontent; and the ſin of diſcontent for private afflictions is exceedingly aggravated by the conſideration of publick mercies to the Land; when the Lord hath bin ſo merciful to the Land, wilt thou be feetting and murmuring, becauſe thou haſt not in thy family all the comforts that thou would'ſt have? As it is a great aggravation of a mans evill for him to rejoyce immoderately in his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate comforts when the Church is in affliction, when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſuffers grievous and hard troubles, if any man ſhall then rejoyce and give liberty to himſelf, at that time to ſatisfie his fleſh to the uttermoſt in all outward comforts, this is a great aggravation of his ſin: So on the contrary for any man to be immoderately troubled for any private afflictions when it goes well with the publick, with the Churches, this is a great aggravation of his ſin: It may be when the Church of God was loweſt, and it went worſt in other parts, yet thou didſt abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the comfort of thy fleſh, but gaveſt full liberty to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy fleſh as formerly, know this was thy great ſin; ſo on the other ſide when we have received ſuch mercies in publick, we ſhould have all our private afflictions ſwallowed up in the publick merci<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we ſhould think with our ſelves, though we be afflicted for our particular, yet (bleſſed be God) it goes well with the Church, and with the publick; the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſhould mightily quiet our hearts in all our private diſcontents, and if it doth not ſo, know that our ſin is much increaſed by the mercies of God that are abroad. Now ſhall Gods mercies aggravate our ſins? This is a ſad thing, this is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58996:85"/>
to turne the mercies of God to be our miſery. Did'ſt not thou pray to God for theſe mercies that God hath ſent of late to the publick, theſe great victories that God hath given, did'ſt not thou pray for them? now thou haſt them, Is not there enough in them to quiet thy heart for ſome privat trouble thou meeteſt withall in thy family? Is not there goodneſs enough there to cure thy diſcontentment? Certainly they were not ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies worthy to be prayed for, except they have ſo much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them as to countervail ſome private afflictions. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mercies are the aggravation of privat diſcontent, as ſo of publick diſcontent too; if we receive ſo many publick mercies, yet if every thing goes not in the publick according as we deſire, if we be diſcontent at that it will exceedingly aggravate our ſin, God may ſay, what ſhall I beſtow ſuch mercies upon a people, and yet if they have not every thing they would have they will be diſcontent? Oh! it's exceeding evil. So in particular, the mercies that concerns thy ſelf, thy family, if thou wouldeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thou haſt a great many more mercies than thou had'ſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, I dare boldly aver it concerning any one in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, (ſuppoſe thy afflictions be what they will) there is never a one of you but that have more mercies than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, I, but you do not know what our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are, our afflictions are ſo as you do not conceive of them becauſe you feel them not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I cannot know what your afflictions are, yet I know what your mercies are, and I know they are ſo great as I am ſure there can be no afflictions in this world ſo great as the mercies you have: If it we<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e but this mercy, that you have this day of grace and ſalvation continued to you, it's a greater mercie than any affliction, ſet any affliction by this mercie and ſee which would weigh heavieſt, this is certainly greater than any affliction; that you have the day of grace and ſalvation, that you are not now in Hell, this is a greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that you have the ſound of the Goſpel yet in your ears; that you have the uſe of your reaſon; this is a greater mercie than your afflictions; that you have the uſe of your limbs, your ſences, that you have the health of your bodies, health
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58996:86"/>
of body is a greater mercy than poverty is an affliction, there is no man that is rich but if he be wiſe, if he hath a ſickly body, he would part with all his riches that he might have his health, therefore thy mercies are more than thy afflictions. We find in Scripture how the holy Ghoſt doth aggravate the ſin of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content from the conſideration of mercies, you have a notable Scripture for it in the 16, of <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. verſe &amp;c. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Korah</hi> and his company when they murmured, <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Korah, <hi>hear I pray you ye ſons of</hi> Levi, (there's ſomewhat that you are ſons of <hi>Levi,) Seemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you that the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath ſeparated you from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to bring you neer to himſelf to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Congregation to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto them? Korah</hi> and his company were murmuring, but mark how <hi>Moſes</hi> aggravates this; Seemeth it a ſmal thing unto you that the God of Iſrael hath ſeparated you from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael to bring you neer to himſelfe to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord? &amp;c. You ſee 'tis a great honour that God puts upon a man a great mercy that he doth beſtow upon any man to ſeperate him from others for himſelf, to come neer to him, to imploy him in the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to miniſter to the Congregation in holy things, this is a great mercy, and indeed it's ſuch a mercy as one would think there ſhould be none that God beſtows ſuch a mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhould have a murmuring heart for any affliction; It's true, many Miniſters of God they meet with hard things that might diſcourage them, and trouble and grieve their ſpirits, but now this conſideration that God is pleaſed to imploy them in ſuch a ſervice neer to himſelf, that though they cannot do good to themſelves, yet they may do good to others, this ſhould quiet them. And yet in the 10. verſe, <hi>And he hath brought thee neer to him, and all thy Brethren the Sons of</hi> Levi <hi>with thee, and ſeek ye the Prieſt-hood alſo?</hi> have not you enough already? but ſtill you are diſcontented with what you have and muſt have more, ſeek ye yet more? <hi>Seek ye the Prieſt-hood alſo? for which cauſe both thou and all thy company are gathered together againſt the Lord: And what is</hi> Aaron <hi>that ye murmur againſt him?</hi> what hath God given you ſuch things, and yet will you be murmuring, becauſe you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58996:86"/>
cannot have more? Me thinks that this place ſhould keep Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from murmuring, though they ſhould meet with never ſuch afflictions and croſſes, and unkind dealings from men, yet ſtill they ſhould go on with hearts quieted and comforted in the work that God hath ſet them about, and labour to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile all their Afflictions by being more abundant in the work of the Lord. That is the firſt text of Scripture that ſhews how the mercies we enjoy are Aggravations to the ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</p>
               <p>And then a ſecond Scripture is in the 2. of <hi>Job,</hi> 10. verſ. A ſpeech of <hi>Job</hi> to his wife, what ſaith <hi>Job</hi> when his wife would have had him curſe God and die? (that was a degree beyond murmuring) ſaith he, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women, ſhall we receive good at the band of God and not evil?</hi> you ſee <hi>Job</hi> did help himſelf againſt all murmuring thoughts againſt the waies of God with this conſideration, that he had received ſo much good from the Lord; what though we receive evil, yet do not we receive good as well as evil? let us ſet one againſt the other, that's the way we ſhould go. In the 17. of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the 14. verſ. you have a notable Scripture there whereby you may ſee what courſe is to be taken when the heart riſes in murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, In the day of proſperity be joyfull, <hi>but in the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity conſider</hi>; what ſhould they conſider? (mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) <hi>God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, that's thus, When thou art in proſperity, then indeed every man can be joyfull, but what if Afflictions befals him, what then? then conſider, conſider what? That God hath ſet one over againſt the other, thou haſt a great deal of Affliction, and thou haſt had a great deal of proſperity, thou haſt many troubles, and thou haſt had many mercies, make one column of mercies, and one column of afflictions, and write one againſt the other, and fee if God hath not fil'd one column as full as the other, you look altogether upon your afflictions, but look upon your mercies alſo; for inſtance, It may be God hath afflicted you in one child, but he hath been merciful to you in another child, ſet one againſt the other, God afflicted <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but he was merciful to <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:58996:87"/>
in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and therefore when <hi>David</hi> cryed out, Oh <hi>Abſolom my Son my Son!</hi> if <hi>David</hi> had thought upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> and cried, Oh <hi>Solomon</hi> my ſon my ſon, it would have quieted him. And it may be God hath been merciful to thee in a wife, or in thy husband, ſet that againſt thy affliction, it may be God croſſes thee in thy eſtate, but it may be he doth imploy thee in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it may be thou art afflicted in ſome of thy friends, but thou haſt other friends that are great mercies to thee, and therefore you ſhould ſet one againſt the other, and it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you ſo to do, for thoſe mercies will be aggravations of your ſins, and you had better make Gods mercies a means to leſſen your ſins, than to be the aggravation of your ſins: If you make not the mercies of God to help you againſt your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, you will make them to be aggravations of the ſin of murmuring: I beſeech you for this take but this one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration further, and if you will but work it upon your hearts I hope you may find a great deal of power in it, You find affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and your hearts are troubled and murmur, conſider how Gods mercies doth aggravate this ſin, thus: In the midſt of our ſins we do make account God ſhould accept of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, do but conſider thus, if in the midſt of our manie ſins we hope that God will accept of our poor ſervices, why then ſhould not we in the midſt of our afflictions bleſſe God for his manie mercies? ſhall God be thus gracious to us that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our many ſins, yet he will not caſt away our poor duties and ſervices that we perform, then why ſhould not we in the midſt of our ſufferings accept of what mercies we have, and not ſlight them and diſregard them? If thou in the midſt of Gods mercies ſhalt not be willing to bear afflictions that God laies upon thee, then it were juſt with God that in the midſt of thy ſins he ſhould not regard any of thy duties, now is there not as much power in thy manifold ſins to cauſe God to reject thy duties and ſervices, as there is power in afflictions (in the midſt of many mercies) to take off thy heart from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with Gods mercies? And that's the firſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſin of murmuring, to murmur in the midſt of mercies.</p>
               <p>A Second Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>When we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58996:87"/>
murmur for ſmal things.</hi> Saith <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervant to him, Father (for ſo he called him) if the Prophet had required you to do ſome great thing, would not you have done it? how much more this little thing. So I ſay, if the Lord had required you to ſuffer ſome great matter, would not you have been willing to ſuffer? How much more this little thing. I remember I have read in <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen, he hath this ſimilitude which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine one to ſet out the great evil of murmuring upon ſmaller afflictions, (ſaith he) Suppoſe a man hath a very fair houſe to dwell in, and he hath fair orchyards and gardens, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with brave tall trees for ornament, if this man now ſhould murmur becauſe the wind blows off a few leaves off his trees, what a moſt unreaſonable thing were it for him to be weeping and wringing his hands becauſe he loſes a few leaves off his trees, when he hath abundance of all kind of fruit? thus it is with many (ſaith he) though they have a great many comforts about them, yet ſome little matter, the blowing off of a few leaves from them is enough to diſquiet them. It was a great evil when <hi>Ahab</hi> having a kingdom, yet the want of his neighbours vinyard had ſuch power to diſquiet him: So for us to murmur, not becauſe we have not ſuch a thing as we have need of, but becauſe we have not what poſſibly we might have, this is a very great ſin. Suppoſe God gives a child that hath all the limbs and parts compleat, a child that is very comly, and hath excellent parts, wit, and memory, but it may be there is a wart that grows upon the finger of the child, and ſhe murmurs at it, and Oh what an affliction is this to her! ſhe is ſo taken up with that as ſhe forgets to give any thanks to God for her child, and all the goodneſſe of God to her in the child is ſwallowed up in that; would not you ſay, this were a folly &amp; a very great evil in a woman ſo to do? Truly our afflictions if we weighed them aright they are but ſuch kind of things in compariſon of our mercies. <hi>Rebeckah</hi> ſhe had a mighty deſire to have children, but becauſe ſhe found ſome trouble in her body when ſhe was with child, ſaith ſhe, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, I had as good have none, only becauſe ſhe found a little pain and trouble in her body. To be diſcontent when the affliction is ſmall and little, that increaſes very much the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58996:88"/>
ſin of murmuring, it is to much for any one to murmur upon the heavieſt croſſe that can befall one in this world, but upon ſome ſmall things to be diſcontent and murmur, that's worſe. I have read of one when he lay upon a heap of damask-roſes, he complained that there was one of the roſe leaves lay double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: So we are readie thus for verie ſmall things to make complaints and to be diſcontented with our condition. And that's a Second aggravation.</p>
               <p>A Third aggravation is this, <hi>For men that are of parts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that God hath given wiſdom to, for them to be diſcontent and murmur, that is more than if others do it.</hi> Murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe is too much in the weakeſt, yet we can bear with it ſometimes in children and women that are weak, but for thoſe that are men, men of underſtanding, that have wiſdom, that God imployes in publick ſervice, that they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with every thing, this is an exceeding great evil; for men in their families (to whom God hath given parts and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) when things fall out amiſſe there, to be alwaies murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining, their ſin is greater than for women or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to do it.</p>
               <p>A fourth aggravation, <hi>Is the conſideration of the freeneſs of all Gods mercies to us.</hi> What ever we have it is of free coſt, what though we have not all we would have, ſeeing what we have is free? If what we have were earned then it were ſomewhat, but when we conſider that all is from God, for us to murmur at his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations is verie evil. Suppoſe a man were in a family entertained by a friend, and he did not pay for his board, but he hath it given him for nothing, it's expected ſuch a one ſhould not be ready to find fault with every thing in the houſe, with ſervants or with meat at table or the like, i<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch a one that hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion and all given him <hi>Gratis,</hi> and paies nothing for his board, ſhould be diſcontented if a cup ſhould not be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for him as he would have it, or if he ſhould ſtay a minute of an hour longer for a thing than he would, this we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a great evil: So it is with us, we are at Gods table every day, and it is upon free-coſt whatever we have: It is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very unmannerly for a man at his friends table to find fault with things, though at home he may be bold: Now when we

are at the table of God (for ſo all Gods adminiſtrations to us are his table) and are at free-coſt, now for us to be finding fault and be diſcontented this is a great Aggravation of our ſin.</p>
               <p>A fift Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>When men and women murmur and are diſcontented and impatient when they have the things that they were diſcontented for the want of before they had them.</hi> So it is ſometimes with children, they will cry for ſuch a thing, and when you give it them then throw it away, they are as much diſcontented as they were before. So it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nothing would quiet them but they muſt have a King, <hi>Samuel</hi> perſwaded them to be contrary, and told them what kind of King they ſhould have; and when they had a King, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.3. <hi>What ſhall a King do to us?</hi> they were not contented when they had one. So <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe muſt have children or elſe ſhe died, and when ſhe had a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe was diſcontented too; ſo that we are neither well full nor faſting (as we uſe to ſay.)</p>
               <p>The ſixt Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For thoſe men and women to be diſcontent and murmur that God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from mean and low eſtates and conditions</hi>; This is a very great aggravation if thou be diſcontent now: There was a time when thou wert low enough, and perhaps when thou wert ſo low then thou dideſt ſay, oh if God would deliver me from ſuch an affliction, or give me but a little more in my eſtate I ſhould think my ſelf in a good condition: but if God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth raiſe thee, thou art as greedy of more ſtill as thou wert before, and as much diſcontented as thou wert before: this is an evil thing for people that had mean breeding, and poor beginings for them to be ſo nice, and dainty that nothing can pleaſe them, whereas there was a time not long ſince that they were low and mean enough; but it is very ordinary for thoſe that are raiſed from a low and mean condition to be the more nice and dainty, and more proud when they are raiſed than others that are of better breeding: It's to much for a child to be diſcontented in his fathers houſe, but if a man hath taken a poor begger boy, if you had taken ſuch a one into your houſe that lay begging at your door, and ſet him at your own table,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58996:89"/>
could you bear that ſuch a one ſhould complain that ſuch a thing is not well dreſt, or the like, you could not bear it if your children ſhould do it, but you could bear it a great deal better with them than to hear ſuch a one do it: But thou art a poor beggar, and God hath (as it were) taken thee into his great family, and if the Lord hath been pleaſed to raiſe thee higher, that now thou haſt a competency, that thou mayeſt live as a man, to be of uſe and ſervice in the place where God hath ſet thee, now wilt thou be diſcontent becauſe thou haſt not every thing that thou deſireſt? We know the Prodigal, when he came to himſelf, Oh! ſaith he, <hi>In my fathers houſe is bread enough.</hi> He did not ſay, there's good-chear enough, and a great deal of dainties; no, he thought of nothing but bread, <hi>there's bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>: So it's ordinary for men and women when they are in a low condition, they think that if they may have bread, any competency, they will be contented and bleſs God, but when they have their bread and things convenient, they muſt have more or elſe they are not contented; know that this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great aggravation to thy diſcontentment, when you are raiſed from a very low condition and yet you cannot be contented with what you have.</p>
               <p>A Seventh Aggravation of this ſin is this, <hi>For them to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that have been very great ſinners and ungodly in their former time.</hi> For men and women that have much guiltineſſe upon them, the guilt of very many ſins upon them, that have provok'd God exceedingly againſt them, and have brought themſelves in a moſt dreadful manner under the ſentence of Gods juſtice, and yet God being pleaſed to reprieve them, for them to murmur and to be diſcontent with Gods adminiſtrations towards them, this is exceeding evil, Oh it were conſideration enough to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et any murmuring in our hearrs, to think thus, We are but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, why ſhould not we be ſufferers that are ſinners? but then conſider, we that are ſuch great ſinners, guilty of ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins, that it is a wonder that we are out of Hell at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet for us to be diſcontent and murmur, how exceedingly doth this increaſe our ſin! Conſider how we have croſſed God in our ſinnes, then if God ſhould croſſe us in the way of our ſufferings, ſhould not we ſit down quiet without murmuring?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58996:89"/>
Certainly thou never kneweſt what it was to be humbled for thy manifold ſins, that art diſcontented at any adminiſtration of God towards thee.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Agravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>For thoſe men that are of little uſe in the world, for them to be diſcontented.</hi> If you have but a beaſt that you make much uſe of, you wil feed it well, but if you have but litttle uſe of him then you turn him into the commons, little proviſion ſerves his turn becauſe you make not uſe of him: If we liv'd ſo as to be exceeding uſeful to God and his Church, we might expect that God would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come in in ſome encouraging way to us, but when our conſciences tell us, we live and do but little ſervice for God, what if God ſhould turn us upon the commons, yet we are fed according to our work? according to our imployment? why ſhould any creature be ſervicable to thee, who art ſo little ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to God? This one meditation would much help us, to think, I am diſcontent becauſe ſuch and ſuch creatures are not ſervicable to me, but why ſhould I expect that they ſhould be ſervicable to me when I am not ſervicable to God? And that's the Eighth Aggravation.</p>
               <p>A Ninth Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For us to be diſcontent at that time when God is about to humble us.</hi> It ſhould be the care of a Chriſtian, to obſerve what are Gods waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, what is God about to do with me at this time? Is God about to raiſe me, to comfort me? let me cloſe with Gods goodneſſe, and bleſſe his Name, let me joyn with the work of God, when he offers mercy to me to take the mercy he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. But again, Is God about to humble me? is God about to break my heart, and to bring my heart down to him? let me joyn with God in this work of his, this is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to walk with God. It is ſaid that <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God; walked with God, what's that? That is, To obſerve what is the work of God that God is now about, and to joyn with God in that work of his; ſo that according as God turns this way or that way the heart ſhould turn with Grd, and have ſutable workings unto the workings of God towards him. Now then, I am diſcontented and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring becauſe I am afflicted; Therefore thou art afflicted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58996:90"/>
becauſe God would humble thee, and the great deſign that God hath in afflicting of thee, is to break and humble thy heart; and wilt thou now maintain a ſpirit quite oppoſite to the work of God? for thee to murmur and be diſcontented is to reſiſt the work of God, God is doing thee good if thou could'ſt ſee it, now if he be pleaſed to ſanctifie thy affliction to break that hard heart of thine, and humble that proud ſpirit of thine, it would be the greateſt mercy that ever thou had'ſt in all thy life, now wilt thou yet ſtand out againſt God? it's even as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, well, the Lord is about to break me, and humble me, but he ſhall not; this is the language of thy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and thy diſcontentedneſſe, though thou dareſt not ſay ſo, but though thou ſayeſt not ſo in words, yet it is certainly the language of the temper of thy ſpirit, Oh conſider what an aggravation this is: I am diſcontented when God is about to work ſuch a work upon me as is exceedingly for my good, but yet I ſtand out againſt him and reſiſt him, and that's another aggravation.</p>
               <p>A tenth Aggravation of the ſin of murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>The more palpable and remarkable the hand of God appears to bring about an affliction, the greater is the ſin of murmuring and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content under an affliction.</hi> It's a great evil any time to murmur and be diſcontent, but though it be a ſin, when I ſee but an ordinary providence working for me not to ſubmit to that, but when I ſee an extraordinary providence working that's a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin, that is, when I ſee the Lord in ſome remarkable way working about ſuch an affliction beyond what any could have thought of, ſhall I reſiſt ſuch a remarkable hand of God, ſhall I ſtand out againſt God when I ſee God doth expreſſe his wil in ſuch a remarkable manner that he would have me to be in ſuch a condition? indeed before we ſee the will of God apparent we may deſire to avoid an affliction, and may uſe means for it, but now when we ſee God expreſſing his will from heaven in a manner beyond ordinary and more remarkably, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is fit for us to fall down and ſubmit to him, and not to oppoſe when God comes with a mighty ſtream againſt us, it's our beſt way to fall down before him and not to reſiſt; for as it is an argument of a mans diſobedience, when there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58996:90"/>
a command againſt a ſin but when God reveals his command in a terrible way, the more ſolemn the command of God is, the greater is the ſin in breaking that command; ſo the more remarkable the hand of God is in bringing an affliction upon us, the greater is the ſin for us to murmur and be diſcontented. Then God expects that we ſhould fall down when he (as it were) ſpeaks from Heaven to thee by name and ſaith, well, I wil have this ſpirit of thine down, do not you ſee that my hand is ſtretched out, my eyes are upon you, my thoughts are upon you, and I muſt have that proud ſpirit of thine down? Oh then it's fit for the creature to yeeld and ſubmit unto him. When you ſpeak in an ordinary manner to your ſervants, or children, you expect they ſhould regard what you ſay, but when you make them ſtand ſtill by you and you ſpeak to them in a more ſolemn way, then if they ſhould diſregard what you ſay, you are very impatient: So certainly God cannot take it well when ever he doth appeare from Heaven in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable way to bring an affliction, if then we do not ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p>The eleventh aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>To be diſcontented though God hath been exerciſing of us long under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet ſtill to remain diſcontented.</hi> For a man or woman at firſt when an affliction befals them to have a murmuring heart then it's an evil, but to have a murmuring heart when God hath been a long time exerciſing them with affliction it's more evil. Though an heifer at firſt when the yoke is put upon him he wrigles up and down and will not be quiet, but if after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monthes or yeers it ſhall not draw quietly, the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would rather feed it fat and prepare it for the butcher than be troubled any longer with it: So though the Lord was content to paſſe by that diſcontented ſpirit of thine at firſt, yet God having a long time kept the yoke upon thee, thou haſt bin under his afflicting hand (it may be) divers yeers; and yet thou remain diſcontent ſtill; it were juſt with God that he ſhould bear thy murmuring no longer, and that thy diſcontent under the affliction ſhould be but a preparation to thy deſtruction. So you ſee when a man or woman hath been long exerciſed with afflictions and yet are diſcontent, that's an aggravation of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58996:91"/>
ſin: Mark that text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent is joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it yeeldeth the peacable fruit of righteouſneſs unto them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> It's true, our afflictions are not joyous but grievous, though at firſt when our affliction comes it is very grievous, but yet (ſaith the text) afterwards it yeeldeth the peacable fruit of righteouſneſs to thoſe that are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; when thou haſt been a long time in the School of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou art a very dullard in Chriſts School if thou haſt not learned this Contentment, <hi>I have learned</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) in every ſtate therewith to be content: Paul</hi> had learned this leſſon quickly, thou haſt been a learning many yeers, perhaps thou mayeſt ſay as <hi>Heman</hi> did, <hi>That thou art afflicted from thy youth up,</hi> in the 88. <hi>Pſal.</hi> Oh it's a very evil thing if being exerciſed long with afflictions you are not yet contented: The eye in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a man is as tender a part as any part that a mans body hath, but yet the eye is able to continue in and bear a great deal of cold, becauſe it is more uſed to it; ſo thoſe that are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to afflictions, thoſe that God exerciſes much with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (though they have tender ſpirits otherwiſe) yet they ſhould have learned contentedneſſe by this time. A new cart may creek and make a noiſe, but after the uſe of it a while it will not do ſo: So when thou wert firſt a Chriſtian and newly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the work of Chriſt, perhaps thou makeſt a noiſe and canſt not bear affliction: but art thou an old Chiſtian and yet wilt thou be a murmuring Chriſtian? Oh that's a ſhame for any that are ancient profeſſors, that have been a long time in the School of Jeſus Chriſt to have murmuring and diſcontented ſpirits. And thus you have had Eleven Aggravations of this ſin of murmuring and diſcontent.</p>
               <p>But now my brethren becauſe this diſcontented humour is a very tough humour, and it is very hard to work upon, there's none that are diſcontented but will have ſomething to ſay for their diſcontent, I ſhall therefore deſire to take away what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diſcontented heart hath to ſay for himſelf.</p>

                  <head>The Pleas of a diſcontented heart.</head>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>Saith one that is diſcontented, It is not diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the ſence of my condition, I hope you would have me ſenſible of my condition: perhaps when God takes away a friend or ſome other comfort they are inordinatly ſorrowful, and wringing their hands as if they were undone, and let any one but ſpeak to them,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Would you not have me ſenſible of my affliction? And thus many would hide their ſinful murmuring under Gods hand with this pretence, that it is but ſenſibleneſs of their affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Firſt, there is no ſence of any affliction that will hinder the ſenſe of Gods mercies, nay the more we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our afflictions if it be in a gracious manner, the more ſenſible we will be of Gods mercy, but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy affliction as it takes away the ſenſe of all thy mercies; Oh this is ſinful diſcontent, this is not to be ſenſible of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God would have thee, but it is to be ſenſible in a wicked way, you go beyond your bounds: By this rule you may come to know when your ſorrows and troubles for your afflictions goes beyond the bounds, we may be ſorrowful when God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, but Oh! that I might know when my ſorrow goes beyond the bounds of it; truly thou mayeſt know it by this, doth the ſence of thy afflictions take away the ſenſe of thy mercies? If it doth then it goes beyond the bounds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it were but a bare ſence of an affliction it would not hinder thee in the duties of thy condition, the right ſence of our afflictions will never hinder us in the performance of the duties of our condition, but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as thou art made unfit for the performance of the duties of the condition that God hath put thee in, ſurely it's more then meer ſence of thy affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it were but meer ſence of thy affliction, yet then thou couldeſt in this thy condition bleſſe God for the mercies that others have, but thy diſcontentedneſſe uſually breeds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie at it, when any one is diſcontented with their condition, they have an envious ſpirit at the conditions of thoſe that are delivered from what afflictions they bear, certainly then it's

                  <head>The Second Plea.</head>
                  <p>But wil a diſcontented heart ſay, <hi>I am not ſo much troubled with my afflictions, but it is for my ſin rather than my affliction, and I hope you wil give leave that we ſhould be troubled and diſcontented with our ſin, and were it not for ſin that I ſee in my ſelf I ſhould not be ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as I am, Oh! it is ſin that is heavy upon me, and it's that that troubles me more than my afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deceive not thine own heart, there is a very great deceit in this, there's many people that when Gods hand is out againſt them they will ſay, they are troubled for their ſin, but the truth is, it's the affliction that doth trouble them rather than their ſin, their heart doth exceedingly deceive them in this very thing: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They were never troubled for their ſin before this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction came; but you will ſay, It's true, I was not before, for my proſperity blinded me, but now God hath opened mine eyes by afflictions: Hath he ſo?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then thy great care will be rather for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thy ſin, than thy affliction, art thou more ſolicitous about the taking away thy ſin, than the taking away of thine affliction?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be thy ſin that troubles thee, if God ſhould take away thy afflictions, yet except thy ſin be taken away, and thy heart be better, this would not content thee, thou couldeſt not be ſatisfied: but we ſee it ordinarily, that if God removes their afflictions there's no more trouble for their ſin. Oh! many do bely themſelves in this, in ſaying, that they are ſo troubled for their ſin, and eſpecially thoſe that are ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they are in danger to miſcarry, and to make away themſelves, there's not one in ten thouſand that are in ſuch a condition as this is, but it is afflictions rather than ſin that puts them to it; indeed you lay all upon this, as if it were the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58996:92"/>
work of the word or the ſpirit of bondage: I remember I heard not long ſince of a Divine that being judicious, and uſed to ſuch kind of things, there came a man to him migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily troubled for his ſin, and he could not tell what to do, he was ready to deſpaire, the Divine looks upon him, ſaith he, are you not in debt? he confeſt that he was; and at length the Miniſter began to find it out, that that was his trouble ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his ſin, and ſo was a means to help him that way, that his Creditors ſhould not come upon him, and then the man was pretty quiet, and would not make away himſelf any longer, for it is a uſual thing, that if any thing befals a man that doth croſſe him, Oh then it's their ſin that doth trouble them. Sometimes it is thus with ſervants, if their Governors croſſe them, then they are vext and fre<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, If thou beeſt troubled for thy ſin, then it will be thy great care not to ſin in thy trouble; not by thy trouble to increaſe thy ſin, but thou art troubled in ſuch a way as the truth is thou doeſt increaſe thy ſin in thy trouble, and ſince thou ſayeſt thou wert troubled for thy ſin thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more ſin than thou dideſt before.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, if it be thy ſin that troubles thee, then thou haſt the more need to ſubmit to Gods hand; <hi>and accept of the puniſhment of thine iniquity,</hi> as it is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. There's no ſuch conſideration to take away murmuring, as to look upon my ſin ae the cauſe of my affliction.</p>

                  <head>The Third Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh ſaith another, I find my Affliction is ſuch that God withdraws himſelf from me in mine Affliction, that is that that troubles me, and can any body be quiet then, can any body be ſatisfied with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58996:93"/>
when the Lord ſhall withdraw himſelf? Were my Affliction ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, yet if I find not God withdrawing himſelf from me I hope I could be content with any Affliction, but I cannot find the preſence of God with me in this Affliction, as ſome times I have found; and it is that that troubles me, and makes me to be in ſuch a condition as I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to that I anſwer thus, Firſt, it is a very evil thing for men and women upon every Affliction to conclude that God is departed from them, it may be when it comes to be examined there is no other reaſon why thou thinkeſt that God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and departed, but becauſe he doth afflict thee, now for thee to make ſuch a concluſion, that every time God laies an Affliction upon thee he is departed; this is a ſinful diſtemper of thy heart, and is very diſhonourable to God, and grievous to his Spirit. In the 17. of <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. verſe, you may ſee how God was diſpleaſed there with ſuch a kind of diſtemper as this is, <hi>And he called the name of the place</hi> Maſſah <hi>and</hi> Meribah <hi>becauſe of the chiding of the Children of Iſrael, and becauſe they tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord amongſt us or not?</hi> Mark, they did murmur becauſe they were brought into Afflictions, but ſee what the Text ſaith, therefore the place was called <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> becauſe they tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord amonſt us or not? This was to tempt God, ſometimes we are afraid God is departed from us, and it was meerly becauſe we are afflicted, I beſeech you obſerve that Scripture, God cals it a tempting of him when he afflicts any, for them to conclude and ſay that God is departed from them. If a child ſhould cry out of his Father, and ſay that his Father is turned to be an enemy to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth correct him, this would be taken ill, I beſeech you conſider of this one place, it may be of very great uſe to you, that you may not be ready to think that God is departed becauſe you are afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God be departed, the greateſt ſign of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting is becauſe you are ſo diſquiet, you make your diſquiet be the fruit of Gods departing, and if it comes to be examined your diſquiet is the cauſe of Gods departing from you, if you could but cure your diſquiet, if you could but quiet your own hearts and get them into a better frame of contentedneſs under Gods hand in afflicting of you, then you would find Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58996:93"/>
with you, will you be thus diſquiet till God comes again to you? your diſquiet drives him from you, and you can never expect Gods coming to manifeſt himſelf comfortably to your ſouls, till you have gotten your hearts quiet under your affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and therefore here you ſee how croſly you reaſon, you reaſon, I am diſquiet becauſe God is gone, when the truth is God is gone becauſe thou art diſquiet; reaſon but the other way, Oh my diſquiet hath driven God from me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ever I would have the preſence of God to come again to me, let my heart be quiet under the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doeſt thou find God departing from thee in thine affliction? wilt thou therefore depart from God too? is this thy help? Can'ſt thou help thy ſelf that way? Becauſe God is gone wilt thou go too? Do I indeed feel God departing from me? It may be it is ſo, it may be God for thy tryal is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a little from thee, and is it ſo indeed? what unwiſe courſe do I take? I commit further ſin and ſo I go further off from God, what a caſe am I in? God goes from me, and I from God: If the child ſees the mother going from it, it's not for the child to ſay, my mother is gon yonder &amp; I wil go the other way, no, but the child goes crying after the mother; and ſo ſhould the ſoul ſay, I ſee the Lord is withdrawing his preſence from me, and now it is beſt for me to make after the Lord with all my might, and I am ſure this murmuring humour is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after God, but by this I go further and further off from God, and what a diſtance is there like to be between God and me within a little while? Theſe are ſome of the reaſonings and pleas of a murmuring and diſcontented heart: there are many others that we ſhall meet withal, and indeavour to ſpeak to your hearts in them, that ſo this tough humour of diſcontent may (as it were) be cut with the Word and ſoftened with the Word, that ſo it may paſſe away: for that's the way of Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians when they meet with a body that hath any tough humour then they give that that hath a peircing quality, when there is a tough humour that ſtops the water that it cannot paſſe, they give that that hath a peircing quality that may make paſſage for it; and ſo thou haſt need of ſuch things that are piercing to make way through this tough humour that is in the ſpirits of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW there are many Pleas and reaſonings yet remain, for there's a great deal of do with a diſcontented murmuring heart. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I find that the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies [<hi>to lodge, to abide</hi>] it ſignifies to <hi>murmur,</hi> they uſe one word for both, for murmuring is a diſtemper that doth lodge in men, where it gets in once it lodgeth abideth and continues, and therefore that we may unlodge it and get it out, we will labour to ſhew what are the further reaſonings of a diſcontented heart.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Me thinks I could be content with Gods hand</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ſo far as I ſee the hand of God in a thing I can be content: but when men deal ſo unreaſonably and unjuſtly with me I know not how to bear it, I can bear it that I ſhould be in Gods hands, but not in the hands of men: my friends or acquaintance when they deal ſo unrighteouſly with me, Oh this goes very hard unto me, that I know not how to bear it from men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the taking away of this reaſoning, firſt, Though they be men that bring this croſſe upon you, yet they are Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, God hath a hand in it, and they can go no further
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58996:94"/>
then God would have them go. This was that that quieted <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſt him, (ſaith he) God hath a hand in it, though <hi>Shimei</hi> be a baſe wicked man yet I look beyond him to God. So, is there any of your friends that deal injuriouſly with you, and croſſe with you, look up to God and ſee that man but as an inſtrument in Gods hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If this be your trouble that men do ſo wrong you, you are rather to turn your hearts to pity them than to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or be diſcontented: For the truth is, if you be wronged by other men, you have the better of it, for it is better to bear wrong than to do wrong a great deal, if they wrong you your heart cannot ſubmit; you are in a better condition than they, becauſe it's better to bear than do wrong. I remember it is ſaid of <hi>Socrates</hi> that being very patient when wrong was done to him, they asked him how he came to be ſo, ſaith he, If I meet with a man in the ſtreet that is a diſeaſed man, ſhall I be vexed &amp; fretted with him becauſe he is diſeaſed? thoſe that wrong me I look upon them as diſeaſed men and therefore pity them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though you meet with hard dealings from men; yet you meet mith nothing but kind good and righteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings from God: when you meet with unrighteous dealings from them, ſet one againſt the other. And that's for the anſwer to the fourth Plea.</p>

               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>A Fifth Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but that affliction that comes upon me is an affliction that I never lookt for, I never thought to have met with ſuch an affliction, and that is that I know not how to bear, that is that which makes my heart ſo diſquiet becauſe it was altogether unlookt for and unexpected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the anſwer of this, firſt, it is thy weakneſſe and folly that thou dideſt not look for it and expect it, In <hi>Acts,</hi> 20.22, 23. ſee what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concerning himſelf, <hi>And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit unto</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there, ſave that the Holy-Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> It's true ſaith he, I know not the particular affliction that may befal me, but this I know that the Spirit of God witneſſeth that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58996:95"/>
ſhall abide me every where, I look for nothing elſe but bonds and afflictions whereſoever go; ſo a Chriſtian ſhould do, he ſhould look for afflictions whereſoever he is, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he ſhould look to meet with afflictions, and therefore if any affliction ſhould befall him, though indeed he could not fore-ſee the particular evil, yet he ſhould think, this is no more than I lookt for in the general. Therefore no affliction ſhould come unexpectedly to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond anſwer I would give is this, Is it unexpected? then the leſſe proviſion thou madeſt for it before it came, the more careful ſhouldeſt thou be to ſanctifie Gods Name in it now it is come: it is in this caſe of afflictions as in mercies, many times mercy comes unexpected (and that might be a third anſwer) to you, ſet one againſt the other, I have many mercies that I never lookt for as well as afflictions that I never lookt for, why ſhould not one rejoyce me as well as the other diſturbs me? As it is in mercies, when they come unexpected, the leſſe preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was in me for receiving mercy, the more need I have to be careful, now to give God the glory of the mercy, &amp; to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods Name in the enjoyment of the mercy; Oh ſo it ſhould be with us now, we have had mercies this ſummer that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expected and therefore we were not prepared for them, now we ſhould be ſo much the more careful to give God the glory of them: ſo when afflictions come that we did not expect, then it ſeems we laid not in for them before hand, we had need be the more careful to ſanctifie Gods Name in them, we ſhould have ſpent ſome pains before to prepare for afflictions and we did not, then take ſo much the more pains to ſanctifie God in this affliction now. And that's a fift reaſoning.</p>

                  <head>The Sixth Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh! but it is very great, mine affliction it is exceeding great ſaith one, and how ever you ſay, we muſt be contented, it's true, you may ſay ſo that feel not ſuch great afflictions, but if you felt my affliction that I feel you would think it hard to bear and be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Let it be as great an affliction as it will, it <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> not ſo great as thy ſin, <hi>He hath puniſhed thee leſſe than thy ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:58996:95"/>Secondly, It might have bin a great deal more, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have bin in Hell: And it is (as I remember) <hi>Bernards</hi> ſpeech, (ſaith he) <hi>It is an eaſier matter to be oppreſt than periſh.</hi> Thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt have been in Hell, and therefore the greatneſs of the thing ſhould not make thee murmur, grant it be great.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may be it's the greater becauſe thy heart doth ſo murmur: for ſhackles upon a mans legs, if his legs be ſore it will pain him the more, if the ſhoulder be ſore the burden is the greater; it is becauſe thy heart is ſo unſound that thy affliction is great unto thee. And that's the ſixt reaſoning.</p>

               <div n="7" type="part">
                  <head>A Seventh Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But howſoever you may leſſen my affliction, yet I am ſure it is far greater than the afflictions of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be it is thy diſcontent that makes it greater, when (indeed) it is not ſo in its ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it were greater than others: why is thy eye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil becauſe the eye of God is good? why ſhouldeſt thou be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented the more becauſe God is gracious to others?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is thy affliction greater than others? then in this thou haſt an opportunity to honour God more than others; ſo thou ſhouldeſt conſider, Doth God afflict me more than other men? God gives me an opportunitie in this to honour him in this affliction more than other men? to exerciſe more grace than other men, let me labour to do it then.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If all afflictions were laid upon a heap together: It is an notable expreſſion of <hi>Solon</hi> that wiſe Heathen (ſaith he,) Suppoſe all the afflictions that are in the world were laid upon a heap, and every man ſhould come and take a proportion of thoſe afflictions, every one equally, there is ſcarſe any man but would rather ſay, let me have the afflictions that I had before or elſe he were like to come to a greater ſhare, a greater affliction if ſo be he ſhould equally ſhare with all the world: Now for you that are poor, (that are not in extremity of poverty) if all the riches in the world were laid together, and you ſhould have an equal ſhare, you would be poorer; but take all afflictions and ſorrows whatſoever, if all the ſorrows in the world were laid
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58996:96"/>
together in a heap, and you had but an equal ſhare of them, your portion would be rather more than it is now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And therefore do not complain, that it is more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo as to murmur becauſe of that.</p>

               <div n="8" type="part">
                  <head>An Eighth Plea.</head>
                  <p>Another reaſoning that murmuring hearts have is this, <hi>They think that if the affliction were any other than it is, then they would be more contented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, You muſt know that we are not to chooſe our own rod that God ſhall beat us with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be if it were any other than it is, it were not ſo fit for thee as this is, it may be therefore God chooſes it becauſe it is the moſt croſſe to thee, as ſeeing it moſt ſutable for the purging out of that humour that is in thee. If a patient comes to take phiſick and finds himſelf ſick by it, ſhall he ſay, Oh! if it were any other potion I could bear it, it may be if it were any other than it is it would not fit thy diſeaſe; yea if it did not work as it doth it would not fit thy diſeaſe: ſo when thou ſaieſt of an affliction, if it were any other than it is thou couldeſt bear it, do but anſwer thy ſelf with this, it may be if it were any other than it is it would not be fit for me, it would not hit right to that ſinful humour that there is in my ſoul, and therefore God ſees this to be the fitteſt and the moſt ſutable for me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Know that this is the excellency of grace in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be fitted for any condition, not only to ſay, if it were this or that, but if it be any. As now, a Marriner if he hath skil he would not ſay, if it were any other wind but this, if the wind did blow in any point but this, I could tell how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage my ſhip, I could ſhew skil in other points but not in this; would not Marriners laugh at ſuch a one? it would be a ſhame for him to ſay that he hath skill in any other points but this: So it ſhould be a ſhame for a Chriſtian to ſay that he hath skill in any other affliction but this: a Chriſtian ſhould be able to mannage his ſhip if the wind blow any way; to guide his ſoul any way.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt anſwer is this, Know that the Lord hath
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58996:96"/>
rewards and crowns for all graces, and for the honouring them in all conditions. It may be in ſuch a way as thou thinkeſt thou couldeſt honour God, God hath a crown for that, and God hath another crown to ſet upon the heads of thoſe that honour him in ſuch a way as this is, yea he hath ſeveral ſorts of crowns (as I may ſo ſay) in Heaven, and thoſe crowns he muſt put upon ſome bodies head, and therefore he exerciſes thee in variety of conditions, that ſo thou mightſt have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rewards and crowns that God hath to reward and crown thoſe that are faithful in ſeveral conditions.</p>

               <div n="9" type="part">
                  <head>A Ninth Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but the condition that God hath put me in makes me to be unſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and this troubles me; it's true, if it were only an affliction and trouble to my ſelf it were not ſo much, but I am put into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this affliction as I am unſervicable, and am like to do God no further ſervice, God puts me into a mean eſtate, and what good can I do? and how burdenſome is my life to me becauſe I can do no ſervice for God! and this is grievous to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed if it he true that this is thy great greife, it is a good ſign, If thou canſt say as in the preſence of God, above all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions here in this world to be laid aſide &amp; not to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice of God, I account that the greateſt Affliction: I had rather bear any trouble in the world ſo I might do more ſervice, then to be freed from trouble and to be laid aſide and do little ſervice: Canſt thou ſay ſo? It is a good ſign of grace for a man to account afflictions to be great becauſe he can do the Lord but little ſervice. Few men account that no affliction at all.</p>
                  <p>But yet there may be a temptation in this. To murmur at Gods diſpoſe when your calling is low and mean and you can do little ſervice, this is many times a temptation to thoſe that are poor, thoſe that are ſervants and thoſe that are of weak parts and are fain to work hard to provide bread for their families, it's many times a greivous burden to them to think, ſuch men the Lord uſes in publick ſervice, and I live in an obſcure way, and to what purpoſe is my life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:58996:97"/>Firſt, To help againſt this temptation that thou mayeſt not murmur againſt this condition, Do but conſider though thy condition be low and mean, yet thou art in the Body, thou art a member of the Body though thou beeſt but a mean mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the toe and the finger hath it's uſe in the body, though it be not the eye, though it be not the head, or the heart yet it hath it's uſe in the body. And it is an excellent expreſſion that I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath about this, (ſaith he) It is better to be the meaneſt member in the Body, than to be the higheſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and more excellent and cut off from the Body, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a little ſprig in the tree joyned to the Root, than to be an arme cut off from the Root. Now other men that have but common gifts in the world, that are not members of Jeſus Chriſt, (indeed) they ſeem to have more excellency than thoſe that are godly, that are in a mean condition, mean parts, mean callings, but they are not of the Body, they are not joyn'd to the Root, and therefore their condition is worſe. As a great arme of a tree when it is cut off it hath a great many leaves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and it ſeems a great deal more glorious than thoſe little ſprigs that are upon the tree, but that little ſprig is in a better condition, why? Becauſe joyned to the tree and hath ſap from the Root and flouriſheth, but the other will wither and die within a while: So it is with the men of the world, they be but like great boughs cut off from the tree, though they have excellent parts, and have great eſtates and pomp and glory in the world, they have no union with Jeſus Chriſt the Root: But now others that live in a poor condition, a poor trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a poor ſervant, a poor labouring-man that labours for his family everyday, yet he being godly, (ſaith he) though I have but little for the preſent, little glory, little credit, little comfort yet I am joyned to the Body, and there I have ſupply and that that will feed me with comfort, bleſſing, and mercy to all eternity: So all that are in a poor condition in this world if they be godly, do but think of that; though thou beeſt mean yet thou art in the Body, and joyned to the Root, thou art joyned to the principal of comfort, good, bleſſing, and mercy that will hold out to eternity, when thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of glorious pompious men in the world ſhall wither and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58996:97"/>
periſh everlaſtingly, and therefore be not troubled at thy mean condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though thou haſt but a mean calling in this world, and ſo art not regarded as a man of uſe in the world, yet if thou beeſt a Chriſtian God hath called thee to a higher calling, thy general calling it is a high calling, though thy particular calling be but low and mean: And for that you have a place in the Chapter before my text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>: So that every Chriſtian hath a high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, God hath called him to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing that he hath call'd any creature to that he hath made, the Angels in Heaven have not a higher calling than thou haſt. Thou that perhaps ſpendeſt thy time in a poor buſineſſe, in the meaneſt calling, if thou beeſt a dung-raker, to rake channels, or cleanſe places of filth or any other thing in the world that is the meaneſt that can be conceived of, thy general calling as a Chriſtian doth advance thee higher than any particular calling can advance any man in the world; others indeed that are cal'd to mannage the Affairs of the State, they are in a high calling, or Miniſters they are in a high calling, but thine in ſome reſpect is higher. A poor ſervant that muſt be ſcraping all day about poor mean things, many times may have ſuch a temptation as this is, Oh what a poor condition hath God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to! will God have regard to ſuch a one that is in ſuch a poor low place as I am? Oh yes, Chriſt hath regard to the meaneſt member, as a man hath as true regard to the toe if it be in pain, and will tender that as truly and verily as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member; ſo Chriſt hath regard to his loweſt and meaneſt ones.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou art in a high calling though thy outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be low in reſpect of men, yet in reſpect of God thou art in the ſame calling with the Angels in Heaven, and in ſome degree cal'd to that that is higher, for the Scripture ſaith, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come to underſtand the myſterie of the Goſpel by the Church; thou that art a Chriſtian in that general calling of thine, thou art joyned with Principalities and Powers, and with Angels, in the greateſt work that God hath called any
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58996:98"/>
creature to, and therefore let that comfort thee in this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thy calling is low and mean, yet be not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, for thou haſt a principle within thee (if thou beeſt a godly man or woman) of Grace that doth raiſe thy loweſt actions to be higher in Gods eſteem, than all the brave glorious actions that are done in the world; the principle of faith doth it, for any man or woman to go on in obedience to God in a way of faith in the calling that God hath ſet them, (I ſay doing this through a principle of faith) it doth raiſe this action, and makes it a more glorious action than all the glorious victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than all their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and glorious pomp that they had in all their conqueſts; it was not ſo glorious as for thee to do the loweſt action out of faith. For, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of a poor Milk-maid, and yet being a Beleever, and doth it in faith, he compares that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the glorious actions of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and makes that a great deal more eminent and glorious in the eyes of God, therefore faith raiſes thy works that are but mean, raiſes them to be very glorious.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and the truth is, there is more obedience to ſubmit to God in a low calling, than to ſubmit to him in a higher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for it's cleer obedience, meer obedience that makes thee go on in a low calling, but there may be much ſelf-love that makes men go on in a higher calling, for there's riches, credit and account in the world, and rewards comes in by that, which doth not in the other, to go on quietly in a low calling is more obedience to God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Know further in the laſt place, there is like to be more reward: For the Lord when he comes to reward, he doth not come to examine what the work hath been that men and women have been exerciſed in, but what their faithfulneſſe hath been, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant</hi> ſaith the Lord, he doth not ſay, wel done good ſervant for thou haſt bin faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me in publick works, ruling Cities and States, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Kingdoms, and therefore thou ſhalt be rewarded, no, but <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant</hi>; now thou mayeſt be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in little as well as others are in more, by going on and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy daies labour, when thou getteſt but a couple of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58996:98"/>
to maintain thy family, thou mayeſt be as faithful in this as thoſe are that rules a Kingdom; now God looks to a mans faithfulneſſe, and thou mayeſt have as great a reward for thy faithfulneſſe that art a poor ſervant in the Kitchin all the day, as another that ſits upon the Throne all day, and as great a Crown of glory thou mayeſt have at the day of judgement, as a King that ſits upon the Throne, that hath ruled for God upon his Throne; yea, thy faithfulneſſe may be rewarded by God with as great glory, as a King that hath ſwaid his Scepter for God; becauſe I ſay the Lord doth not ſo much look at the work that is done, as at the faithfulneſſe of our hearts in doing it, then why ſhould not every one of us go on comfortably and cheerfully in our low condition, for why may not I be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as well as another? it's true, I cannot come to be as rich a man and as honourable as others; but I may be as faithful as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other man, that every one of you may conclude with your ſelves: what doth let but that you that are the pooreſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt may be as faithful as the greateſt, yea you may have as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a crown in Heaven, and therefore go on comfortably and chearfully in your way.</p>

               <div n="10" type="part">
                  <head>A Tenth Plea.</head>
                  <p>There's another reaſoning that ſome may have and that is this. <hi>Oh I could bear much affliction in ſome other way but this is very grievous to me, the unſetledneſs of my condition, though my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were but low yet if it were in a ſetled way I could be content, but it is ſo unconſtant, and ſo unſetled, that I can never know what to truſt to, but am toſt up and down in the world in an unſetled condition, and this is hard to be content with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to that I anſwer, Firſt, that the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in his ſetled eſtate is vanity,</hi> in <hi>Pſalme,</hi> 36.5. your books have it, Every man at his <hi>beſt eſtate</hi> is vanity, the word is his <hi>ſetled eſtate</hi>; you think if you were but ſetled, Oh then you could be content, but the truth is, man in his ſetled eſtate is vanity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer thus, that perhaps God ſees it is better for thee to live in a continual dependance upon him, and not to

know what thy condition ſhal be one the morrow, then for thee to have a more ſetled condition in reſpect of the comforts of the creature; do but remember that we ſpake of before, that Chriſt doth not teach you to pray, Lord, give me enough that wil ſerve me for two or three years, but, <hi>this day our dayly bread</hi>; to teach us we muſt live upon God in a dependent condition eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day for daily bread. Here was the difference that is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable between the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> that depended upon God for the watering of it with ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers from Heaven, but <hi>Egypt</hi> had a conſtant way of watering the country, that did not ſo much depend upon Heaven for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but upon the river <hi>Nylus,</hi> which did at ſome certain time overflow the country: and they knowing that the watering of their country did depend upon that river and not upon Heaven they grew more proud: And therefore the Scripture, to expreſs <hi>Pharoah's</hi> pride, brings him in ſaying, <hi>The River is mine</hi>: he could order the river as he pleaſed, for it was his: <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a country which was to depend upon God, though they had rain at one time, yet they knew not whether they ſhould have it at another time, and liv'd alwaies in a dependance upon God not knowing what ſhould become of them: Now God thought this to be a better land for his people than <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this is given as one reaſon among others for it, becauſe the Lord lookt upon this, as more ſutable to the ſtate of his people that were to live by faith, to be continually depending upon Heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Himſelf, and not to have a conſtant ſetled way in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their outward dependance: and we find it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that when thoſe that are godly live in the greateſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, and have no ſetled comings-in from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they do exerciſe faith more, and are in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſouls than before. Oh! many times it fals out that the worſe thy outward eſtate is the better thy ſoul is, and the better thy outward eſtate is the worſe thy ſoul is. We reade in <hi>Ezra,</hi> 4.13. the objection that the enemies had againſt the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> building of the wall of the Citie: their writing to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> againſt them, ſaith, <hi>Be it known unto the King, that if the City be builded, and the wals ſet up again, then they wil not pay toll, tribute, and cuſtome, and ſo thou ſhalt endamage the revenue of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58996:99"/>
Kings.</hi> If the wall be built (ſay thy) then they will refuſe to pay toll, tribute and cuſtome to the King: that is thus, ſo long as they live in ſuch a condition, where they have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance wholly upon the King, and lie at the Kings mercy, that is, they are in no City that hath walls built, but the King may come upon them when he will, ſo long they will pay cuſtom to the King, but if once they come to build a wall, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, and have not their dependance upon the King as before, then they will deny paying toll, tribute, and cuſtom. So it is thus for all the world between God and mens ſouls, when a ſoul lives in way of meer dependance upon God, that ſenſibly he ſees God hath him at advantage every moment, Oh then ſuch a ſoul will pay toll and cuſtome, that ſoul exerciſes faith, and begs every day his dayly bread; but if God hedges that man about with an eſtate, with proſperity, perhaps he hath an inheritance befallen him, perhaps he hath a conſtant office that brings in ſo much yeerly to him duly paid, this man is not ſo ſenſible now of his dependance upon God, he begins now to pay leſſe toll and cuſtom to God than before, God hath leſſe ſervice from this man now than before. God ſees it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his people to live in a depending condition: we are very loth in reſpect of God to be dependant, we would be all inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants this way, we would be of our ſelves, and have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Lord, but God ſees it better for us to live in a depending condition.</p>
                  <p>Further, This may be thy comfort, though for outward things thou art mightily unſetled, yet for the great things of thy ſoul and eternal eſtate, there thou art ſetled, there thou haſt a ſetled way, a conſtant way of fetching ſupply, <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace,</hi> thou haſt there abundance of treaſure to go to, and fetch all that thou ſtandeſt in need of; and obſerve it, that now thy condition is more ſetled in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace than it was in the covenant of works; in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works there God gave man a ſtock to trade with, but he put it in his own hand, ſo that he might trade, and get or loſe; but now in the Covenant of grace God makes ſure, the ſtock is kept in the hand of Chriſt, and we muſt go to him for ſupply continually, for Chriſt keeps the ſtock; perhaps
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58996:100"/>
we may trifle away ſomwhat in our trading, but God takes that care ſtill we ſtall never ſpend the ſtock: As a man when his Son breaks, having ſquandered away his ſtock that he gave him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, afterwards he puts his ſtock into a friends hand, and ſaith he, you ſhall keep the ſtock and it ſhall not be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo we are in a more ſetled condition in reſpect of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate then <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocencie; therefore let that comfort us in all our unſetled conditions in the matters of the world.</p>

                  <head>A Eleventh Plea.</head>
                  <p>But yet there's another reaſoning that many murmuring hearts think to feed their humour withal, (ſay they) <hi>If I never had bin in a better condition then I could bear this affliction, if God had alwaies kept me in ſo low a condition I could be content, Oh but there was a time that I proſpered more, and I had things at more full hand, and therefore now it is harder to me to be brought low; as in theſe times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a man that had five or ſix hundred a yeer, but now hath had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a great while, if that man had not bin born to ſo much, or never had proſpered in any higher degree than now he is in, this affliction had bin leſs, perhaps he hath ſome mony and friends to live upon, but if he had never bin in a better condition he would not have accounted it ſo great a matter to have been without it now. This many times is our greateſt wound, that once we were in a better condition; and this is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing for us to murmur upon this ground of any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, Is thy eye evil becauſe God hath been good to thee heretofore? It's an ill thing for us to have our eye evil becauſe God is good to others, but to look upon our condition with an evil eye now, becauſe God was once good to us; hath God done thee any wrong becauſe he was formerly more good to thee than he was to others?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou didſt heretofore more proſper, did God heretofore give thee more proſperity? it was to prepare thee for afflictions, we ſhould look at all our outward proſperity as a preparation to afflictions, if thou hadſt done ſo then it would not have bin ſo difficult for thee to have indured affliction now; when thou hadſt a great eſtate, yet if thou hadſt made uſe of this mercy of God to prepare thee for thy afflicted eſtate, then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58996:100"/>
the change of thy eſtate would not be ſo greivous. That every Chriſtian ſhould do: have I an eſtate now? I ſhould prepare for poverty, have I health now? I ſhould prepare for ſickneſs, have I liberty? let me prepare my ſelf for impriſonment? what know I what God may call me to? have I comfort and peace now in my conſcience, doth God ſhine upon me? while I have this let me prepare for Gods withdrawing from me: am I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from temptations? let me prepare now for the time of temptations; If thou wouldeſt do ſo, the change of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not be ſo greivous to thee: Marriners that are in a calme will prepare for ſtorms, would they ſay, if we never had calms we would bear ſtorms? but now we have had calms ſo many yeers or weeks together, this is greivous: In thy calme thou art to prepare for ſtorms, and the ſtorme would be leſſe, thou ſhouldeſt reaſon quite contrary and ſay, Now I am in an afflicted condition, Oh but bleſſed be God <hi>I was in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition,</hi> and bleſſed be God that he was a forehand with me in the waies of his mercy, this one conſideration may help murmuring hearts. Doſt thou murmur becauſe once thou wert better? know God was beforehand with thee in the waies of mercy, thou ſhouldeſt rather think thus, I have lived for theſe many yeers (forty yeers perhaps or more) in a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition, I have liv'd in health, and peace, and plenty, what though the remaining part of my time have ſome ſorrow and affliction? The Lord hath granted to me a comfortable ſunſhine all the day long till towards evening, and what if at ſeven or eight a clock at night it begins to rain? let me thank God I have had ſo fair weather all day. You that are going a voyage, if you have a comfortable wind, and very fair for many months together, what if you have a little ſtorm when you are within ſight of land, will you murmur and repine? Oh no, but rather bleſſe God that you have had ſuch a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyage ſo long: Oh this conſideration would help us all; If it were ſo that now God ſhould ſay, well, you ſhall never ſee comfortable day more for outward things in this world, Oh then you have cauſe to fall down and bleſſe Gods Name that you have had ſo many comfortable daies: Now you reaſon quite contrary, whereas you ſhould bleſſe God that you have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58996:101"/>
had ſo much comfort, you make what you have had before to be an aggravation of your afflictions now, and ſo murmur and are diſcontented. That which God gave you before, upon what terms did you hold it? did you hold it ſo as you have in your writings, <hi>To have and to hold for ever,</hi> God gives no ſuch thing, God gives to no man (I ſay) any thing but grace to run upon that tenour, there's no ſuch thing in all Gods writings for any outward comforts, <hi>To have and to hold for you and your heirs</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for grace he doth give it to your ſelves, <hi>to have and to hold for ever,</hi> though not for every one that comes out of your loines to have and to hold for ever; God doth not give any outward thing ſo upon no ſuch tenour as that is; if God gives me an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of himſelf, and faith, and humility, and love, and patience, and ſuch graces of his Spirit he gives them me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, If he gives me Himſelf and his Chriſt, and his promiſe, and his Covenant, he gives me them for ever, what am I therefore that the Sun ſhould alwaies ſhine upon me, that I muſt have fair weather all my daies? that which God gives to me he gave it to me as a pledge of his love, let me return it to him as a pledge of my obedience, there's all the reaſon in the world for it, all that a godly man receives from God he receives it as a pledge of Gods love to him, therefore when he comes into an afflicted condition, ſaith God, Return to me as a pledge for your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that that you had from me as a pledge of my love; we ſhould cheerfully come in to God and bleſſe God that we have any thing to render unto him as a pledg of our obedience, and ſay, Oh it is thy love O Lord that hath given us any thing, that doth enable us to render a pledge of our obedience to thee. When God cals for thy eſtate or any comforts that thou haſt, God cals for it as a pledge of thy obedience to him.</p>

                  <head>A Twelfth Plea.</head>
                  <p>Another reaſoning of a murmuring heart is this. <hi>Oh but after I have taken a great deal of pains for ſuch a comfort, yet then I am croſt in it, after a great deal of labour and pains that I have taken now to be croſt, Oh this goes very hard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt I anſwer, The greater croſſe, the more obedience and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:58996:101"/>Secondly, When thou did'ſt take a great deal of pains, was it not with ſubmiſſion to God? Did'ſt thou take pains with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that thou muſt have ſuch a thing when thou laboureſt for it? Then know that thou laboureſt not as a Chriſtian, but if thou did'ſt labour and take pains, was it not with reſignation to God, Lord I am taking pains in the way of my calling, but with ſubmiſſion, I depend wholly upon thee for ſucceſſe and a bleſſing; And what was it that thou did'ſt aime at in thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? was it not that thou mighteſt walk with God in the place that God had ſet thee? A Chriſtian ſhould do ſo in his outward calling, I am diligent in my outward calling, but it is, that I might obey God in it; it's true, I do it that I might provide for my family, but the chief thing that I aime at is, That I might yeild obedience to God in the way that God hath ſet me: Now if God cals thee to another condition to obey him in though it be by ſuffering, thou wilt do it if thy heart be right.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There will be the more teſtimony of thy love to God, if ſo be thou ſhalt now yeeld up thy ſelf to God in that that coſt thee dear, ſhall I offer that to God (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) that coſt me nothing? thy outward comforts hath coſt thee much, and thou haſt taken much pains to obtain them, and now if thou canſt ſubmit to God in the want of them, (I ſay) in this thy love is more ſhown that thou canſt offer that to God that coſt thee dear. Now theſe are the principal reaſonings of a diſcontented heart.</p>

                  <head>A Thirteenth Plea.</head>
                  <p>There's one Plea more that may be nam'd, and that is this, ſaith ſome, <hi>Though I confeſs my affliction is ſomwhat hard, and I feel ſome trouble within me, yet I thank God I break not out in diſcontented waies to the diſhonour of God, I keep in although I have much ado with my own heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh! do not ſatisfie your ſelves with that, for the diſtempers of your hearts, and their ſinful workings are as words before God. <hi>My ſoul be ſilent to God</hi>: That we ſpake of in the begining

                  <p>We ſhould conſider (in all our wants and inclinations to diſcontent) <hi>The greatneſſe of the mercies that we have, and the meaneſſe of the things that we want.</hi> The things we want, (if we be godly) they are things of very ſmall moment in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the things we have, and the things we have are things of very great moment; for the moſt part that that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are diſcontent and murmur for the want of, it is becauſe they have not ſuch things as reprobates have, or may have; why ſhould'ſt thou be troubled ſo much for the want of that that a man or woman may have &amp; yet be a reprobate, as that thy eſtate is not ſo great, thy health not ſo perfect, thy credit not ſo much, thou mayeſt have all thoſe things and yet be a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; now wilt thou be diſcontent for that that a reprobate may have?

If God will take away my eſtate, and make me poor, if God will take away my life, hack me in pieces, put me in priſon, whatſoever he doth, yet I ſhall not ſuffer more for God than the creature doth for me, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am infinitly more bound to God than the creature is to me, and there is not ſo much difference between me and the creature as between me and God: ſuch conſiderations as theſe wrought the heart of that Martyr to contentedneſs in his ſufferings; and every time the creature is upon your trenchers you may think, What! doth God make the creature ſuffer for my uſe? not only for my nouriſhment, but for my delight; what am I then in reſpect of the infinit God?</p>

                  <p>Yea laſtly, Conſider all the experience that you have had of Gods doing good unto you in the want of many comforts. When God croſſes you, have you never had experience of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good in afflictions, it's true, when a Miniſter only tels men that God will work good out of their afflictions, they hear them ſpeak, and think they ſpeak like good men, but they feel little or no good, they feel nothing but pain; but when we cannot only ſay to you that God hath ſaid he will
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58996:106"/>
work good out of your afflictions, but we can ſay to you, that you your ſelves have found it ſo by experience, that God hath made former afflictions to be great benefits to you, and that you would not have been without them, or without the good that came by them for a world; ſuch experiences wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly quiet the heart and work it to contentment: therfore think thus with thy ſelf, Lord, why may not this affliction work as great a good upon mee as afflictions have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Perhaps you may find many other conſiderations beſides in your own meditations, theſe are the principal ones that I have thought upon: I'le one add one word more to this, of one that once was a great merchant and trades-man, and it happened one a time that he ſuffered ſhip-rack, and ſaith he, I never made a better voyage and ſail'd better than at that time that I ſuffered ſhip-rack: this was a ſtrangs ſpeech (his name war <hi>Zeno</hi>) that he ſhould never make a better voyage: it would be a ſtrang parradox to you that are marriners, to ſay, that thats a good voyage when you ſuffer ſhip-rack: but he meant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he got ſo much good by it, God was pleaſed to bleſſe it ſo far to him that he gained ſo much unto his ſoul by it, ſo much ſoul-riches that he made account it was the beſt voyage that ever he had: and truly, ſometimes it is ſo, yea, to you that are godly I make no queſtion but you find it ſo, that your worſt voyages have proved your beſt, when you have met with the greateſt croſſes in a voyage, God hath been pleaſed to turn them to a greater good to you in ſome other way. It is true, we may not deſire croſſes that they may be turned to other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; but when God in his providence doth ſo order things, that you meet with ill voyages, you may expect that God will turn them to a greater good, and thoſe that have been exerciſed in the waies of godlineſſe any long time, I make no queſtion but they have abundance of experiences that they have gain'd by them: You know ſometimes it's better to be in a little ſhip, for they have advantage of greater ones in ſtorms many times, in a ſtorm a little ſhip can thruſt into a ſhallow place and ſo be ſafe, but your great ſhips cannot, they muſt be abroad and toſt up and down in the ſtorm and tempeſt, and ſo many times ſplit againſt the rocks. And ſo it may be God ſees there is a

ſtorme a coming, and if thou beeſt in thy great ſhip thou maiſt be ſplit upon rocks and ſands, God therefore doth put thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a leſſer veſſel that thou mayeſt be more ſafe. We wil lay aſide the ſpeaking of thoſe conſiderations now, but I would not have you lay them aſide and put them out of your thoughts, but labour (thoſe eſpecially that moſt concern you) to make uſe of them in the needful time, when you find any diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit to ariſe in you.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing that I intended for this exerciſe, It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding directions what to do for the helping of our hearts to Contentment. For as for any further conſiderations we have prevented the ſpeaking largly of them, becauſe we have opened the moſt things in ſhewing what the leſſons are that Chriſt teaches men, when he brings them into his School, to teach them this Art. I ſay there we have ſpoken of the ſpecial things that are moſt conſiderable for the helping of us to this grace of Contentment.

                  <p>The firſt is this, All the rules and helps in the world will do us little good except we get a good temper within in our hearts; you can never make a ſhip go ſteady with propping of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, you know there muſt be ballaſt within the ſhip, that muſt make it go ſteady: And ſo there is nothing without us that can keep our hearts in a ſteady conſtant way but that that is within us, grace is within the ſoul and that will do it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If you would get a contented life, do not gripe too much of the world, do not take in more of the buſineſſe of the world than God calls you to, be not greedy of taking in a great deal of the world, for if a man will go among thorns when he may go in a plainer way, there is no reaſon that this

man ſhould complain that he is prickt with them; thou goeſt among thorns, is it thy way? muſt you of neceſſity go among them? then it's another matter, but if thou wilt electively chuſe that way when thou mayeſt go another, then thou haſt no cauſe to complain; ſo for men and women that will put themſelves upon things of the world that they need not, then no mervail though they be prickt, and meet with that that doth diſquiet them? for ſuch is the nature of all things here in the world, that every thing hath ſome prick or other in it, we are like to meet with diſappointments, and diſcontentments in every thing we meddle with, and therefore thoſe that have leaſt to do in the world, (that is, except God cals them to it, we muſt put in that) they are like to meet with many things that will diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent tehm.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58996:107"/>
the rule of the word in it, then let come what will come God he is to take care of me there. It was a ſpech of a Heathen (ſaith he) if thou wilt ſubject all things to thy ſelf, do thou ſubject thy ſelfe to reaſon, and by that thou wilt make all things to be under thee; I may adde a little more to it, if you will ſubject all things under you, ſubject your ſelfe to God, and then the truth is all things are under you; It hath been that that many times we have hinted, the reaſon why many of our Gentry have been ſo malignant among us is, becauſe they are willing to be ſlaves themſelves under ſome above them at Court, ſo they may keep their neighbours under to be ſlaves to them: for you know anyman heretofore that was great at the Court, he could cruſh any country man that he was angry withal. If there were an Arbitrary-government, then all thoſe that would be willing to be vaſſals and ſlaves to the Prince, they can make all others vaſſals and ſlaves to them. Now be thou willing to be a vaſſal to God, to be abſolutely under Gods command, and then I ſay all things in the world are under thee, <hi>All are yours</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Life and death,</hi> every thing is yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods: All things in the world are ſervicable to that man or woman that is ſervicable to God. It is a mighty commendations of Gods ſervice, be thou willing to be ſervicable to God and God makes all things in the world to be thy ſervants, for ſo they are. You will ſay, how are they my ſervants, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them? They are ſervants in this, that God doth order them all to work for thy good, there's nothing in the world but (ſaith God) it ſhall work for thy good, and be ſervicable to thee, if thou wilt be ſervicable to me; who would not be now Gods ſervant? Subject thy ſelf to God, and all things ſhall be ſubjected to thee. Now ſo long as we keep within our bounds we are under protection, but if once we break our bounds we muſt expect it ſhould be with us as it is with the deer in the Park; while the deer keeps within the pale, there is no dogs come upon them, but they can feed quietly, but let the deer be got without the pale, and then every dog in the country will be hunting after them; ſo it is with men, let men and women keep within the bounds of the command of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58996:108"/>
God, of the rule that God hath ſet them in his word, and then they are protected by God, and they may go about their buſineſſe with peace and never be troubled for any thing, but caſt all their care upon God, God provides for them, but if they wil go beyond the pale, if they will paſs their bounds then they may expect to meet with troubles, and afflictions, and diſcontent; and therefore that is a fourth direction. Walk by rule.</p>

                  <p>A fift rule is this, <hi>Exerciſe much faith, that is the way for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs.</hi> After thou haſt done with all conſiderations that reaſon may ſuggeſt to thee, if thou findeſt that theſe do not do it, Oh then call for grace of faith, a man may go very far with the uſe of reaſon alone to help him to contentment, but when reaſon is at a non-plus then ſet faith a work. It was a ſpeech of the reverend Divine maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> that God made ſo inſtrumental in his time, the life of faith (ſaith he) it is a true life indeed, the only life. Exerciſe faith not only in that promiſe that all ſhall work together for good to them that fear God, but likewiſe exerciſe faith in God himſelf, as well as in his word, in the Attributes of God. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Socrates</hi> a Heathen, (ſaith he) ſince God is ſo careful for you, what need you be careful for any thing your ſelves? It was a ſtrange ſpeech of a Heathen.</p>
                  <p>Oh Chriſtian! if thou haſt any faith, in the time of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty think thus, this is the time that God cals for the exerciſe of faith, what canſt thou do with thy faith if thou canſt not quiet thy heart in diſcontent. It was the ſpeech of one <hi>Theodoſius</hi> that had been a King, and afterwards was brought to ſuch a low condition to get his living by being a School-maſter, one comes and asks him, What have you got by your Phyloſophy from <hi>Plato</hi> and others? what have I got (ſaith he) I have got this, that though my condition be changed from ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſo low, yet I have got this, I can be content. So what doeſt thou get by being a Beleever, a Chriſtian? what canſt thou do by thy faith?

to God in peace, faith can do this. Therefore when reaſon can go no higher, let faith get upon the ſhoulders of reaſon and ſay, I ſee land though reaſon cannot ſee it, I ſee good that will come out of all this evil.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe faith in thy often reſignation of thy ſelf to God, in giving of thy ſelf up to God and his waies, the more thou doſt in a beleeving way ſurrender up thy ſelf to God, the more quiet and peace wilt thou have; that's the fift thing.</p>

                  <p>A ſeventh rule is, <hi>Do not promiſe to your ſelves too much before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, do not make account of too great things</hi>: It is good for us to take hold very low and not think to pitch too high, do not ſoar too high in your thoughts beforehand, to think, oh if I had this and this, and imagine great matters to your ſelves, but be as good <hi>Jacob,</hi> you know he was a man that lived a very content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life in a mean condition, (ſaith he) <hi>Lord if I may but have cloaths to put on, and meat to eat</hi>; he lookt no higher, he was content with that: ſo if we would not pitch our thoughts high and think that we might have what others have, ſo much, and ſo much, when we meet with diſappointments we would not be ſo much troubled: and ſo <hi>Paul, If we have but meat and drink and cloathing, let us be therewith content</hi>; he did not ſoar too high aloft, thoſe that look at high things in the world they meet with diſappointments and ſo they come to be diſcontent; be as high as you will in Spiritual meditations, God gives liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there to any one of you to be as high as you will, above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but for your outward eſtate God would not have you aim at high things, <hi>Seekeſt thou great things</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Baruch</hi>) <hi>ſeek them not, you ſhall have your life for a prey.</hi> In theſe times eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, it were a very great evil for any to aim at great things, <hi>Seek them not,</hi> be willing to take hold low, &amp; to creep low, and if God doth raiſe thee thou ſhalt have cauſe to bleſſe him, but if thou ſhouldeſt not be raiſed there would not be much trouble, one that creeps low cannot fall far, but it is thoſe that are on high whoſe fall doth bruiſe them moſt; that is a good rule, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not your ſelves great matters, neither aime at any great things in the world.</p>

As it is very obſervable in thoſe ſouldiers that came to break the bones of Chriſt, they brake the legs of one that was crucified with him, and of the other, but when they came to Chriſt they found he was dead, and ſo they did not break his legs, there was a providence in it, to fulfil a Propheſie, but becauſe they found he was dead they did not break his bones. Let Afflictions and trouble find thee with a mortified heart to the world and they will not break thy bones; the bones of thoſe that are broken by croſſes &amp; afflictions are thoſe that are alive to the world, that are not dead to the world; but one that hath a mortified heart and dead to the world, no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or troubles will break the bones of ſuch a one, that is, they will not be very grievous or painful to ſuch a one as is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the world: This I fear is a myſtery and riddle to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for one to be dead to the world, to be mortified to the world. Now it is not my work to open to you what Mortification is, or death to the world is, but only thus, to have our hearts ſo taken off from the things of the world, as to uſe them as if one uſed them not, not to make account that our lives, our comforts, our happineſſe doth conſiſt in theſe things, they are things that are of another nature that our happineſſe doth conſiſt in, and we may be happy without theſe, this is a kind of deadneſſe to the world.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58996:110"/>
alwaies upon the ſore; and ſo men and women their thoughts are alwaies upon their afflictions, when they awake in the night their thoughts are upon their afflictions, and when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with others (nay it may be when they are praying to God) they are thinking of their afflictions. Oh! no mervail though you live a diſcontented life, if your thoughts be alwaies poring upon ſuch things, you ſhould rather labour to have your thoughts upon thoſe things that may comfort you: You ſhall have many that if you propound any rule to them to do them good, they take it well while they are with you, and thank you for it, but when they are gone they ſoon forget it. It is very obſervable of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that when his wife died in child-birth, his wife called the child <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> that is, a ſon of ſorrows; now <hi>Jacob,</hi> he thought with himſelf, if I ſhould call this child <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> every time that I name him it will put me in mind of the death of my dear wife, and of that affliction, and that will be a continued affliction to me, therefore I will not have my child have that name; and ſo the text ſaith, that <hi>Jacob</hi> called his name <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that was, the ſon of my right hand: now this is to ſhew us thus much, that when afflictions befals us we ſhould not give way to have our thoughts continually upon them, but rather upon thoſe things that may ſtir up our thankfulneſs to God for mercies. It it the ſimilitude of <hi>Baſil,</hi> a learned man, faith he, It is in this caſe as it is with men and women that have ſore eyes, now it's not fit for thoſe to be alwaies looking upon the fire, or upon the beams of the Sun; no (ſaith he) one that hath ſore eyes muſt get things that are ſutable to him, and ſuch objects as are fit for one that hath ſuch weak eyes, therefore they will get green colours, as that being a more eaſie colour and better for weak eyes, and they will hang green ſarſnet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes becauſe it is more ſutable to them: So weak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits it's the very ſame, a man or woman that hath a weak ſpirit, they muſt not be looking upon the fire of their afflictions, upon thoſe things that deject, that caſt them down, but they are to be looking rather upon that which may be ſutable for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and helping of them, they ſhould be conſidering of thoſe things rather than the other. It will be of very great uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to you if you do lay it to heart, not to be poring alwaies upon afflictions, but upon mercies.</p>

                  <p>I beſeech you obſerve this though you ſhould forget many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Make a good interpretation of Gods waies towards you,</hi> if there can be any good interpretation made of Gods waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, make it. Ye think it much if you have a friend that ſhould alwaies make bad interpretations of your waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, you would take that ill: If you ſhould converſe with people that you cannot ſpeak a word in their hearing but they are ready to make an ill interpretation of it, and take it in an ill ſenſe, you would think their company to be very tedious to you; it is very tedious to the Spirit of God when we <hi>make</hi> ſuch ill interpretations of his waies towards us. If God deals with us otherwiſe than we would have him, if there can be any ſenſe worſe than other made of it we will be ſure to make it; as thus, when an affliction doth befal you, there may be many good ſenſes made of Gods works towards you, you ſhould think thus, it may be God intends only to try me by this, it may be God ſaw my heart too much ſet upon the Creature, and ſo intends to ſhew me what there is in my heart, it may be that God ſaw that if my eſtate did continue I ſhould fall into ſin, that the better my eſtate were the worſe my ſoul would be, it may be God intended only to exerciſe ſome grace, it may be God intends to prepare me for ſome great work which he hath for me, thus you ſhould reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But we on the contrary make bad interpretations of Gods thus dealing with us, and ſay, God doth not mean this, ſurely the Lord means by this to manifeſt his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt me, and this is but a furtherance of further evils that he intends towards me: Juſt as they did in the wilderneſſe; <hi>God hath brought us hither to ſlay us.</hi> This is is the worſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation that poſſibly you can make of Gods waies, Oh why will you make theſe worſt interpretations when there may be better? In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. when the Scripture ſpeaks of love (ſaith the text) <hi>Love thinketh no evil.</hi> Love is of that nature that if there may be ten interpretations made of a thing if nine of them be naught and one good, Love will take that which is good
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58996:111"/>
and leave the other nine; and ſo though there might be ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations preſented to thee concerning Gods waies towards thee, and if but one be good and nine naught, thou ſhouldeſt take that one that is good and leave the other nine. I beſeech you conſider, God doth not deal by you as you deal with him, ſhould God make the worſt interpretation of all your waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as you do of his towards you it would be very ill with you, God is pleaſed to manifeſt his love thus to us, to make the beſt interpretations of what we do, and therefore it is, that God doth put a ſenſe upon the actions of his people that one would think could hardly be, as thus, God is pleaſed to cal thoſe perfect that have but any uprightneſſe of heart in them, he accounteth them perfect, <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect</hi>; uprightneſſe in Gods ſenſe is perfection. Now alas when we look into our own hearts we can ſcarce ſee any good at all there, and yet God is pleſed to make ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as to ſay, it is perfect: When we look into our own hearts we can ſee nothing but uncleanneſſe, God, he calls you his Saints, he calls the meaneſt Chriſtian that hath the leaſt grace under the greateſt corruption, his Saint; you ſay, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Saints here, but yet in Gods eſteem we are Saints: You know the uſual title the holy Ghoſt gives (in ſeveral of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles) to thoſe that had any grace, any uprightneſs, is, <hi>To the Saints</hi> in ſuch a place; you ſee what an interpretation God puts upon them, they are Saints to him, and ſo I might name in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other particulars, God makes the beſt interpretation of things, if there be abundance of evil and a little good, God rather paſſes by the evil and takes notice of the good: That ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have made uſe of, which is a very obſervable placs in <hi>Peter,</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah, Sarah</hi> had a ſpeech to her husband in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 18.12. ſhe called her husband lord, but there was but that one good word in an ill ſpeech, it was an unbeleeving ſpeech, but yet when the Apoſtle mentions that ſpeech in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. the holy Ghoſt leaves all the ill, and commends her for calling her husband lord, for putting a reverend title upon her husband; thus how graciouſly doth God deal with us? If there be but one good word among a great many ill, what an interpretation God makes! ſo ſhould we do, if there be but any
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58996:111"/>
one good interpretation that we can make of a thing we ſhould rather make uſe of the good one than of the ill; Oh my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (I would I could now ſpeak only to ſuch as are godly) retain good thoughts of God, take heed of judging God to be a hard maſter, make good interpretations of his waies, and that's a ſpecial means to help you to Contentment in all your courſes.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58996:112"/>
mannifeſt to people that they ſhould never be in want any more, but I have been now preaching unto you that that comes to as much, that that countervails this, that which is in effect all one. Is it not almoſt all one, never to be in want, or never to be without Contentment? that man or woman that is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contented ſpirit, truly, can never be ſaid to want much, Oh! the Word holds forth a way full of comfort and peace to the people of God even in this world, you may live happy lives in the mid'ſt of all the ſtorms and tempeſts in the world, there is an Ark that you may come into, and no men in the world may live ſuch comfortable, cheerful, and contented lives as the Saints of God: Oh that we had learn'd this leſſon: I have been many Sermons about this leſſon of Contentment, but I am affraid that you will be longer in learning of it than I have been preaching of it; it is a harder thing to learn it than it is to ſpeak or preach of it. (I remember) I have read of one man reading of that place in the 39. <hi>Pſalm, I will take heed that I offend not with my tongue</hi>: ſaith he, I have been theſe 38. yeers a learning this leſſon and have not learned it thorowly. The truth is, there are many (I am affraid) that have been profeſſors neer eight and thirty yeers have hardly learn'd this leſſon, it were a good leſſon for young profeſſors to begin to learn this betimes: But now, this leſſon of Chriſtian Contentment it is as hard, and perhaps you may be many yeers in learning it: I am affraid there be ſome Chriſtians that have not yet learned, <hi>Not to offend groſly with their tongues:</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>All a mans Religion is vain, if he cannot bridle his tongue</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe that make any profeſſion of godlineſs, one would think they ſhould quickly learn this leſſon, ſuch a leſſon that except learned, it makes all their Religion vain: But for this leſſon of Chriſtian Contentment it may take up more time to learn, and there's many that are learning it all the daies of their lives and yet are not Proficients; but God forbid that it ſhould be ſaid of any of us concerning this leſſon, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of Widows in <hi>Timothy, That they were ever learning, and never came to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Oh let us not be ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this leſſon of Contentment and yet never come to have skill in it. You would think it much if you had uſed the Sea twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

years, and yet to have attain'd to no skill in your art of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, you will ſay, I have uſed the Sea 20. or 30. yeers and I hope I may know by this time what belongs to Sea; Oh that you would but ſay ſo in reſpect of the Art of Chriſtianity!

Brought to theſe ſtraits! theſe extremities! ſuch a perplexity as we are now in? would to God we had bin in <hi>Egypt</hi>: this was the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſpirits, they would rather be under vile bondage, than endure any hazard, then be put to any ſtraits and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: It is the baſeneſs of the ſpirits of many at this day amongſt us, becauſe they ſee that thoſe waies that have bin taken by the Parliament brings ſome troubleſom difficulties, ſome ſtraits, they cry out of the times, I would to God we were, as we were before, we were well enough before, we were quiet enough before, we never knew what ſuch ſtirs as theſe meant before, now we are brought into theſe perplexities, I, this they have brought us into; &amp; thus they are ready to murmur &amp; repine. Oh unthankful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy generation! men, women of vile ſpirits that ſhall do ſo. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſpeaking unto his ſouldiers, The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian hath this expreſſion of him. It is the part of a true valiant man, either to live honourably, or die honourably, one of them; but that is the part of a baſe coward, rather to live baſely than to die honourably, rather to be under any baſe ſervitude, than to be in any hazard of their lives, though perhaps their lives may be ſaved too. I remember <hi>Philo</hi> tels us, even of women, (for in theſe times, the publik cauſe of the Kingdom, ſuffers exceedingly much by the timorouſneſs of the ſpirits of women) that being in danger of their enemies, of being brought into bondage by them, they took their children and threw them into the rivers, with theſe words, You ſhall not ſerve, we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee you die than be ſlaves. I commend not that fact that it was wel done, but to ſhew what a ſpirit the heathen women had
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58996:115"/>
to ſee their children die rather than have them bondſlaves: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what were our lives worth? were they worth having if we return to our bondage again? The utmoſt of the danger is, <hi>our lives,</hi> the killing of our bodies, yet we hope God will preſerve them too, but ſuppoſe the worſt, it is but <hi>death</hi>; but if our lives ſhould not be hazarded now, and if through baſe cowardice, we ſhould decline the Cauſe of God, ſurely our lives would not be worth taking up, the living after that manner we are like to live, in that bondage unto theſe Cavalliers, notorious wretches, blaſphemers of God himſelf, that would make our lives worth very little, nay your children perhaps to be brought up in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and to hold a candle to a maſſe-Prieſt at the Altar; that may be the imployment of your children, if ſo be that they ſhould live: But theſe people being now in this extremity, and manifeſting ſo much paſſion, being in a diſtemper; <hi>Moſes</hi> as the Captain of the Lord comes to the people, and ſpeaks bravely to them, incouraging of them, ſaith <hi>Moſes, Fear not, but ſtand ſtil, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord: ſtand ſtill,</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>ſtate,</hi> it ſignifies to ſettle and compoſe, to be in a ſetled condition; it is a reflect word upon our ſelves, ſo the <hi>Learned know,</hi> that it is to work upon our ſelves, to form, ſignifies ſo, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, Do you work upon your own hearts, to get your hearts to <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> work upon your hearts to do that, work arguments upon your ſpirits, and never leave working until you have wrought your hearts into ſuch a frame, as that you may <hi>ſtand ſtil,</hi> &amp; be quiet: At firſt even the deareſt ſervants of God wil find their hearts to ſhake in time of hazards and extremities, but when they come to work upon their ſpirits, to bring argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to lay to their hearts, there they get ſome advantage, that their hearts grow quiet quickly: For that we have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table text in the example of <hi>David,</hi> in the 62. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> there, in the 1, and 2. verſes) <hi>Truly my Soul waiteth upon God, from him cometh my ſalvation, hee onely is my Rock and my Salvation, he is my defence, I ſhall not greatly be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; Mark, he begins to exerciſe Faith, and he ſaies, he ſhall not <hi>greatly</hi> be moved, as if he ſhould have ſaid, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I cannot ſay, but that my heart is ſomewhat ſtirred, I am ſomewhat afraid, and I feel ſome working in my ſpirit,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58996:115"/>
but I hope I ſhall not greatly be moved; he fals a working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart more, and conſiders of his innocencie; and of the miſchievous device of the ungodly; <hi>how long will ye imagine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe againſt a man, ye ſhall be ſlain all of you</hi>; then again in the 5. verſe; <hi>My ſoul waite thou onely upon God, for my expectation is from him, he only is my Rock</hi>: And then he repeats the words again, after he had been rubbing upon his heart the ſame meditation, then he fetches in the words again, that he had in the 2. verſe; <hi>He only is my Rock and my ſalvation</hi>; but mark now, what advantage he gets of himſelf, in the 6. verſe, <hi>He only is my Rock and my ſalvation, and my defence, I ſhall not be moved</hi>; before, he is my Rock, my ſalvation, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I ſhall not <hi>greatly be moved,</hi> but after he had been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king further upon his own heart, then he gains and ſaies, now he is my Rock, and my ſalvation, and my defence, I ſhall <hi>not be moved</hi>; I have overcome theſe diſtracting fears, I have got the advantage and the victory, bleſſed be God I have overcome them, God is my ſalvation, and my glory; now he begins to glory and triumph after he had wrought upon himſelf; So that he in this did indeed ſtand ſtill in this phraſe, by working upon his own heart, though he was ſtirred a little at firſt, yet he got the victory: So indeed not to be moved, the 70. turn this word, ſtand ſtill <hi>ſtete</hi> only, but yet the notes upon it, they ſay it is read likewiſe <hi>ſtetite,</hi> that is, a ſtanding faſt, <hi>ſtand faſt,</hi> it is a word, taken from ſouldiers in their ranks; ſouldiers that are in their ranks when they apprehend a danger, they muſt not go out of their way, becauſe of the danger, it is as much as their lives are worth, to go out of the way, but they muſt ſtand, they muſt <hi>ſtand ſtille,</hi> though there be never ſuch danger, yet they muſt <hi>ſtand ſtill in their ranks</hi>: that is the meaning of the word: I ſhall open more what the meaning of the holy Ghoſt is by and by, what kind of <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> this ſhould be; but thus for the word, it is ſuch a <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> as the ſouldiers have in their ranks, not to go out of their ranks for fear. The word is uſed in Scripture divers times for, <hi>ſtanding faſt,</hi> as in the 1 of <hi>Philiphians,</hi> 27. That you <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in one ſpirit; now the word <hi>faſt,</hi> is not in the Greek Text, but only the other word in the Greek Text; and ſo you
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58996:116"/>
have the ſame word in the other Scriptures; in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 16.13. <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith, Stetite,</hi> it is only two words in the Greek, as it is in the Engliſh, <hi>ſtand faſt</hi>; ſo that this <hi>ſtand,</hi> it is not only a ſtanding, but a ſtanding faſt, ſtand ſtill in your ranks, faſt, be not in a hurry up and down, and be not in a confuſion: If upon danger ſouldiers ſhould preſently be in a confuſion in the Army, what would become of them? and ſo the truth is, in a City, in any place, where there is any danger, if people grow to a confuſion, they are gone, they are loſt, you muſt ſtand ſtill in your ranks, <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi>; There are ſeveral <hi>ſtand-ſtils,</hi> ſome very vile and naught, and others very good: there is firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>A ſtand-ſtill out of amazement,</hi> When a man through fear is at a ſtand, and dears not ſtir any further; now this cannot be meant in the text; for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fear not,</hi> but <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> therefore it is not a ſtanding ſtill out of fear, becauſe I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>There is a ſtand-ſtill, out of ignorance</hi>; Becauſe I do not know which way to take; and this is not in the text neither: Thus many in our time, they ſtand ſtill, they plead ignorance; they ſtand ſtill, they will be of no ſide, and they plead ignorance, they know not what to do; they ſay, they know not what to do, one ſaith one thing, and another ſaith another thing, the King commands one thing, and the Parliament another, they know not what to do; to go againſt the King, is it not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? and ſo they ſtand ſtill becauſe they plead ignorance, &amp; their conſciences are not informed. It hath bin the work of divers Miniſters, that have hazarded themſelves in this, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to you the Counſel of God, and to ſet your conſciences at liberty; divers things I have ſpoken in this place, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly men do blinde their own eyes, and are willing to ſtand ſtill, to plead ignorance, after ſo much light revealed: It is ſtrange that any rational man ſhould ſpeak of rebellion now, when as we know, that the King himſelfe ſent aid to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers,</hi> and that (we know) in the caſe of their liberties, and Religion; they took up armes to defend themſelves againſt their own King, &amp; he ſent help to them, ſurely he did not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf take them to be rebels, &amp; <hi>King James</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Byron</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:58996:116"/>
that enveighs againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi>; he doth ſtand to juſtifie what the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> did, even <hi>King James</hi> himſelfe in that book of his, in his anſwer to <hi>Byron</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we muſt acknowledge all the Proteſtant Churches in the world to be Rebels, if it be Rebellion, meerly to take up armes. Know we not that our own King hath matched his Daughter to the young Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now we know the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> is the General of the States in their fields, as the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is the General of our forces here; and their buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of Spain (it was their praiſe) to defend their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Religion, and ſtill they maintain the ſame quarel, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> he is their General, and undertakes it: We deſire nothing but the maintainance of our Liberty and of our Religion, though things be not gone ſo far yet, as to take <hi>our eſtates,</hi> yet the Cauſe that they began withal, it is our Cauſe, and what the General was there, the ſame in a kind (there is no great difference) here; and certainly if it were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, our King would never have match'd his Daughter unto the Son of ſuch a Rebel; if it ſhould be Rebellion meerly to take up Arms to defend Religion, and to defend the Liberties of the Countrey that are according unto Laws; yea, we know further, that the King himſelf hath acknowledged our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Scots, to be loving ſubjects, to be his loyal ſubjects, do we more than they? do we more in our cauſe? nay, have we done ſo much in our cauſe, as they have done? how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was it there in their Kingdom, and ſhall it be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they are loving ſubjects doing ſo much, and we be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rebels? ſurely no man can plead, to ſtand ſtill through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance upon that ground.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a third <hi>ſtand-ſtill,</hi> and the truth is, though it be not through Ignorance, it is though a worſe principle, and that is of <hi>Neuteralizing</hi>; that is, when men though they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed well enough, yet they ſtand ſtill to ſee which will be the ſtrongeſt ſide, and are loth to appear yet, they know not which ſide will moſt prevail, but they have ſuch a principle in their ſpirits, to go to the ſtrongeſt ſide, which way ſoever it be, only they will ſtand ſtill till it appear: My brethren, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we can admit of no Neuters in theſe times; the times
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58996:117"/>
are grown to a greater height, than that any ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Neuter, either for us or againſt us; whatſoever is not for us at this time, now coming to this ſtraight, may well be concluded to be againſt us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a fourth wicked <hi>ſtand-ſtill,</hi> and that is out <hi>of ſullenneſſe of ſpirit</hi>; and that is more particular, and that is of many men and women, eſpecially that are in ſome troubles of conſcience, and when they are ſeeking of God, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming duties that God requires of them, and do not find that encouragement that their hearts deſire, they leave off all, and have no mind to do any thing, but even ſtand ſtill and die, and will even ſink in a ſullen diſcouragement, and go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leave off their work, leave off duty, what ſhould I go on in doing duty, for I get no good by it, I am never a whit the better? and ſo they ſtand ſtill out of a ſullen diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Devil himſelfe is the moſt diſcouraged Spirit in the world, and yet he is the proudeſt Spirit in the world; and this ſtanding ſtill out of diſcouragement, may come out of pride, and ſtoutneſſe of heart, though you think it is out of Humility.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a ſluggiſh <hi>ſtanding ſtill,</hi> and that is ſinful and wicked, when people ſtand ſtill <hi>becauſe they are idle, and are loth to venture themſelves, or to put themſelves to trouble, to go forward in any work, this work is tedious</hi>; and thus the ſluggard he ſtands ſtill, and is ready to catch at any Argument, that may plead for his ſtanding ſtill: My brethren this is not that ſtand ſtill here, that we ſhould ſtand ſtill and do nothing, and be ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards; no, but the <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> here is, after we have gone on, and done to the utmoſt that we are able, that then we ſhould <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and commit the work to God, as if we had done nothing at all; there is the <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi>: I ſhall ſpeak of more preſently; As that worthy Divine ſaid, he would labour to preach, as if he expected no aſſiſtance, and then he would expect aſſiſtance, as if he had not labour'd at all; So Warriors and people in danger, they ſhould prepare in the uſe of all means, as if they expected no further help, and then they ſhould expect help from God, as if they had uſed no means at all; ſo we muſt uſe means: As that brave ſpeech of <hi>Joab, Come let us play the</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:58996:117"/>
men, let us fight for our Cities, and the people of our God, and then let God do what ſeemeth him good; then he would ſtand ſtill, and look for his ſalvation of God; a ſpeech even of <hi>Joab</hi> himſelfe, not then a ſluggiſh ſtand ſtill, it is no hindrance at all to any preparations that may be uſed: therefore all theſe are naught.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is <hi>an obediential ſtand-ſtill</hi>; that is, for the hearts of men and women to ſtand ſtill, to wait, to know further of Gods mind, what God revealeth, our hearts are willing to yeeld unto, and we will liſten to hear what the mind of God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, what God would have us to do; to ſtand ſtill, to hearken to what the Lord would have us to do, with hearts reſign'd up to him, and reſolved to walk accordingly to it; this is good, and that is ſomewhat of it, but that is not all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is a <hi>ſtand-ſtill</hi> out of <hi>faith; a beleeving ſtandſtill</hi>; and that is when (though in the greateſt extremity) I having uſed what means I can for helping me, yet I ſee my ſelf wrapped up in extremity, I will now exerciſe Faith. Firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To quiet my heart</hi>; to get out of my ſpirit thoſe diſtracting thoughts of that hurry and tumult that there is in the heart, and to get all ſilenced, all murmurings, all diſtractions, all gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of ſpirit; and upproar that many times is in the hearts of men and women in time of danger; ſo by faith I come to quiet theſe, and to get my heart to be ſtill, to be ſtill within me; Be ſtill O my ſoul; and therefore the Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the waiting upon God out of Faith by a word of ſilence, in the 62. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> at the beginning, and verſe 5. <hi>My ſoul waits upon God, it is ſilenced,</hi> ſo the Hebrew word ſignifies, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a <hi>ſilence</hi> in God: there is many times in the hearts of men and women (when they apprehend any danger) a great deal of hurrying and noiſe in their hearts, all is in a combuſtion in their hearts; it is a grievous thing to ſee a Citie all in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, and in a tumult; there are many men and womens hearts, in as great a tumult upon apprehenſion of danger, as many times a whole City is, there is a riſing in their hearts, and a mighty noiſe there: Sometimes they keep (it may be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick exigencies) their tongues ſilent, but their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58996:118"/>
hearts boyle within them: but your hearts muſt be ſilent, you muſt cry to your heart, be ſilent there; my heart is now in a mutinie, and a great deal of ſtir, cry ſilence to your hearts, that your hearts and thoughts may be compoſed; that is the meaning of the word, that there ſhould be a ſetled compoſed frame of ſpirit in the hearts of men and women, in the times of extremity: that is the firſt. Secondly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is out of Faith, there <hi>ſhould be a keeping our ſtations till God cals us out</hi>; not to run up and down this way and that way, and to think of nothing but of ſhifting courſes, to ſhift for our ſelves: As in time of danger (I verily beleeve) if we could look into the thoughts of many men and women, they ſcarce have any thought but meerly of ſhifting their place or houſe; they think to ſhift for themſelves: Now we ſhould not buſie our thoughts ſo much about ſhifting, as about quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts in beleeving: For (my brethren) in times of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of danger, God calleth for Courage more than diſcretion; though it's true, Diſcretion is not excluded, yet that is not that explicite and ſpecial work that is called for in times of danger; I mean diſcretion to ſhift for your ſelves; but diſcretion ſo far as may improve courage: the main work that God now cals for at this time, it is Courage and Diſcretion, and Prudence only ſo far as to mannage Courage, and to drive it on further, and to improve it, not to abate it, that is not the Diſcretion certainly that now is called for, but to keep our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, In time of danger may we not fly? muſt men keep their ſtations? is it not lawful to avoid danger and to fly? Then we ſhall accuſe many of our brethren, that heretofore have fled in time of danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> (My Brethren) you are to know, that the caſe now is far different from the caſe that was heretofore; the caſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore was eſpecially (for the preſent) directed againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, not againſt the generall, though there were plots againſt the general, but the hazard and the danger was againſt ſuch, and ſuch particular men, as eſpecially your Miniſters that were moſt faithful and conſcionable, they were the fore-front, they did bear the brunt, and it was aimed eſpecially againſt them;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58996:118"/>
now the caſe is far different when the aime of the Adverſary is againſt particulars, and not againſt the godly in general; when it is againſt particulars there may be all lawful means, by an avoyding and flying: when it is againſt the godly in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral then every one ſhould ſtand ſtill, and keep in their waies and ſtations, to come in, and adde what ſtrength they can to the publick cauſe; and certainly thoſe that ſhall ſhift then, and think to fly then, God may juſtly meet with them; as we reade of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah</hi> the Prieſt he flies in publick time of danger, and he was ſent for, and catched, and put to death; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſtaies, and is ſaved: But when the caſe is the danger of particular perſons, then it is nothing againſt this text, to fly in any lawful way; many people will cry out againſt flying by a lawful way in times of danger, becauſe they think they may ſhift from flying themſelves; and if others that are in danger ſhould not do ſo, they would be far enough from helping and aſſiſting them in extremities, and yet they will be crying out againſt it; <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> I remember hath this anſwer to it; It is juſt for all the world in this caſe, as a man that hath a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſickneſſe upon him, and the Phyſicians tell him, there is no way but by taking ſuch ſtrong Phyſick, or by cutting off a leg, or a limb, now he comes and pleads, I will not ſo diſtruſt God, and be ſo impatient of my preſent pain, as to take ſuch a courſe to help me, I'le rather continue patient and quiet, and endure my preſent pain, and truſt in God, rather than put my ſelf to any ſuch hazard; now is this man more patient, than another man that will take ſuch ſtrong Phyſick or have a member cut off? is it through the ſtrength of his patience? no, it is rather through the weakneſſe of his ſpirit, becauſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a certain great pain and hazard, and while he goes on in the uſe of ordinary means, he hath a leſſer pain, with hope that he may be delivered from a greater, and preſerved himſelf. So this is the Objection againſt flying in particular danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the flying is a certain great ſuffering, they that have fled, have found it ſo: now others will rather ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to endure a little uncertain ſuffering, than to go upon a certain great ſuffering; and that is the very ground. But that this is not againſt Faith at all, to fly in danger, when it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58996:119"/>
aimed at particulars, I'le give you but a Scripture or two for that to cleer it, that it is not againſt Faith, It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable (we might ſpend a great deal of our time in this caſe here, but I have done with it) in the 10. of <hi>Matthew, When they perſecute you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>in this Citie, fly into another:</hi> he ſpeaks of particular perſecution of this or that body, and not of a whole Kingdom: now flee (ſay they!) we will be more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and truſt in God, and not be afraid, have we not a good cauſe, and is not God with us? this would argue too much fear; Mark, in the next words Chriſt ſpeaks after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them liberty, and commanded them to flie; (ſaith he) fear them not therefore (though it is the next thing he ſpeaks of in the 28. verſe) <hi>and fear not them that can kill the body:</hi> you ſee theſe two can well ſtand together, that there is not fear of them that can kill the body, and yet there is a flying; and ſo Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf flies in the 12. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> when he did but hear what <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> did to <hi>John,</hi> when Jeſus knew it (that was when the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> ſought him, when he knew it) he did withdraw himſelfe, in the 12, and 13. verſes, <hi>And when Jeſus heard of it, be departed thence, &amp;c.</hi> When he heard but what was done to <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt withdrew himſelf and went away: Therefore it may ſtand with faith, ſo to avoid danger in particular Caſes: But now when perſecution is general, we are to <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> and not avoid our ſtation.</p>
            <p>The third thing in this <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> of faith is, <hi>The looking up for the Salvation of God,</hi> the expecting a good iſſue one way or other; I know not how Salvation wil come, but that there will be Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation one way or other, that my ſoul reſts upon; I <hi>ſtand not ſtill</hi> out of ſtoutneſs of ſpirit, or becauſe I think I have means enough to reſiſt, whether I have means or no, when I am put into the greateſt extremitie, yet I can <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and look for Salvation. What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and look for the Salvation of the Lord? what talk you of Salvation (might they ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi>) when there is nothing but diſtruction before us? True, if you look before you, behind you, and without you, and within your ſelves there is nothing but diſtruction, yet look up to Heaven and there is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of the Lord.</hi> I have done no more than the meer openning of the text, and what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58996:119"/>
in it: There are theſe 4. <hi>Doctrinal Concluſions</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Doct. <hi>That when God is in a way of mercy and ſalvation to his people, he doth many times bring them into great ſtraights,</hi> even then when he is in a way <hi>of Salvation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Doct. <hi>That in time of theſe great ſtraights,</hi> even <hi>the people of God are ſubject to have their hearts to be overwhelmed with trouble, diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fears, and to be diſquieted.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Doct. <hi>That it is our duty to ſtand ſtill, keep quiet, and look for Gods Salvation in the time of the greateſt ſtraights.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>When God is in a way of ſalvation, yet he may and doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times bring his people into very great ſtaits.</hi> Truly, this ſtraight in the text is exceeding remarkable: but I'le ſhew you further, how when God was about to ſave this people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Egyption bondage, (which is the work God hath now to do with us to ſave us out of the Egyptian bondage that we were in, and that we were going further into,) after they were delivered from this ſtraight, from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt; yet in the 15. Chap. you ſhall find, (the very next Chapter;) after they were come out of the Sea, they preſently wanted water to drink, yea, the waters were bitter that they could not drink them (ſaith the text 15. verſ.) <hi>The waters were bitter, they could not drink them,</hi> they were ready to periſh for want of water: As ſoon as ever they were delivered out of that ſtrait, mark the 16. Chap. they were in another as bad as that, there you ſhall find they want bread, and were ready to ſtarve for hunger; in Chap. 16.2, 3. <hi>And all the Aſſembly were ready to be killed for hunger</hi> (the text ſaith:) well, <hi>Moſes</hi> cries to God, and God delivered them out of that ſtraight too: In the next Chap. they were in as great a ſtraight too: <hi>They pitched at</hi> Rephidim, <hi>and there they had no water to drink again</hi>: I might go through the ſtory, and ſhew you in the wilderneſſe, what great ſtraights God put them in, and yet God was working ſalvation for them. When they come to poſſeſſe the land, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wil not go thorow the ſtory the time wil not permit) they have Jordan to paſſe over without any bridge, whether the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58996:120"/>
bridges were cut down, or whether there were none, I cannot tell; but it was more danger to paſſe over the bridges (if there were any) becauſe at that time (the text ſaith) it was <hi>that Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan flowed over all his banks</hi>: ſo then it was at the worſt time that could be, when the banks of Jordan were all overflowed, yet God delivered them out of that ſtraight; When they were got o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there I might ſhew you many other ſtraights, but I ſhall mention only one, that was this: The firſt enemy the people of God fought with all in <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were diſcomfited, they were beaten back at the firſt battel that ever they fought, when they came to ſet upon the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to fight with the adverſary, there the adverſary comes out, and gets the day and makes them fly before them, that was at the fight at <hi>Ai, They fled before the men of Ai,</hi> upon this <hi>Joſhua</hi> fell down upon the ground; Why Lord! What are we come to this? After all theſe ſtraights that we come now to fight with the people of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they at the very firſt blow have the day, and make us fly before them? now all the people will come out againſt us. If ſo be people have ſuch diſtracting fears now, ſuppoſe there ſhould be a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of both Armies, and you ſhould hear that one Army flies before another, that our men fly before thoſe that come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, before the Cavelliers, what a fear and diſtraction would there be then? yet ſo it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though God was coming in with ſuch a mighty hand to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and to poſſeſſe them of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet at the very firſt blow, they had the worſt, and the people overcame them: It would take a mighty deal of time to ſhew you the ſtraights that <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Joſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> werein, I'le only give you a word or two about <hi>David,</hi> becauſe it may be a very great help to poor troubled ſpirits in time of ſtraights; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> he was in ſuch ſtraights ſometimes, that he profeſſes himſelf <hi>even overwhelmed, Pſal.</hi> 61. and the beginning: You ſhall find <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. <hi>He could not ſpeak.</hi> Many poor ſouls are in greivous afflictions, and when we put them to go and open their hearts to God and men, Oh I cannot ſpeak (ſay they) <hi>David</hi> was in ſuch ſtraights that he could not ſpeak, yea <hi>he could not ſo much as look up, Pſal.</hi> 40.12. not ſo much as look up to God, grievous ſtraights that he was in. And the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their other
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58996:120"/>
Captivity, there were mountains before them; what ſtraights did God put them into? When they were come forth of <hi>Babilon,</hi> In <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. <hi>What art thou O great mountain, that art before them?</hi> But examples will be needleſs to illuſtrate the thing, it is ſo cleer, that thus was Gods dealing with his people. As with wicked men, when God is in a way of wrath againſt the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he many times ſuffers them to proſper in the higheſt way, with the moſt flouriſhing proſperity that ever they had in their lives: So when he is in a way of ſalvation of his Saints, he lets them be in the loweſt ebb that ever they were in in al their lives: As in <hi>Job,</hi> 20. ſaith the text there at the 5. verſe, <hi>In the fulneſs of his ſufficiency be ſhall be in ſtraights.</hi> In the fulneſs of his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; what a phraſe is here! A wicked man ſhall be in ſtraits when he is full, when he hath ſufficient (as he thinks,) in the fulneſs of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraights: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, a godly man in his greateſt ſtraights, he hath a fulneſs of ſufficiency; I will ſhew you that cleer, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt</hi>: We have a fulneſs of Conſolation, when we have a fulneſs of Suffering; yea, not only abound, but do <hi>ſuper abound,</hi> for ſo the word is; in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulations</hi>: We are brought into tribulation, into great ſtraights, and I have a fulneſs fil'd with comfort, and exceeding joyful, more than abundantly-joyful; ſo the word ſignifies: there is abounding in the other text, but here is a <hi>ſuper</hi> added to it, a <hi>ſuper</hi>-abounding, more than joyfull, not in times of proſperity only: Carnall hearts never know how to rejoyce but in times of proſperity, when they can eat, and drink, and play, then they can be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the Saints know how to joy, how to be fil'd with joy, how to abound in joy, and how to be exceedingly abounding in joy when they are in tribulation: Thus, as wicked men are in ſtraights in their ſufficiencies; ſo godly men when God is in a way of comfort, they may be in a way of great affliction, and the reaſon of it may be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe God will humble his people, when he is in a way of ſalvation</hi>: when God intends the greateſt good to his people, and to raiſe them the higheſt, he is very careful to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58996:121"/>
keep them very low; that hath alwaies bin the manner of Gods adminiſtrations: You ſee the reaſon of the peoples having ſtraights in the wilderneſs, it was from hence, in the 8. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> there God gives the reaſon, in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt remember all the way, which the Lord thy God led thee theſe fourty years in the wilderneſs,</hi> to what end? why were they ſo long in the wilderneſſe? it was (ſaith the text) <hi>to humble them</hi>; I brought thee into the wilderneſs, and it was to humble thee: Doth God (my brethren) bring us into ſtraights, now in theſe times? Certainly he is in a way of ſalvation for <hi>England,</hi> he is in a way of ſalvation to do us good in the latter end, but yet he is bringing us into ſtraights, Oh! we may thank the pride of our ſpirits, we have not been brought low enough to this very day: There hath been (indeed) ſome humiliation of ſome of the people of God, in faſting and praying, they have humbled their ſouls; but yet though there hath been humble expreſſions, yet not humble hearts; for after thoſe times they have had (many of them) exceeding froward ſpirits, and that argues apparantly, their hearts are not humbled and broken, when their ſpirits after daies of humiliation, ſtill ſhould be froward and pettiſh as before: But eſpecially for the generallity of the Kingdom, how far are we from being an humbled people! we are not yet capable of what mercy God intendeth for us, in this regard, becauſe we are not humbled; Oh the exceding pettiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, envie, and pride (and worſe a great deal) not only in many people of the Land, but even in thoſe that are godly and gracious! how are the ſpirits of men, of one brother op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to another! that becauſe there is ſome difference in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch and ſuch a thing; O they could be content (many of them) to have them rid out of the Land, and if God did not prevent (whereas the perſecution by Biſhops is now at an end) who knows (except God humble their hearts more) whether many of Gods dear ſervants, that do but differ in ſome point of judgement, might not meet with a great deale of ſufferings, even from thoſe that are godly, and that is the worſt ſuffering, better a thouſand times ſuffer from wicked men, it is not ſo hard to the ſpirits of godly men to ſuffer from never ſo many Biſhops, and wicked men, as to ſuffer from one godly man:
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58996:121"/>
Oh! there wants that charity and tenderneſs of ſpirit one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another that ſhould be; we are not yet humbled and brought upon our knees, and therefore it is juſt with God to lay us upon our backs a while, or that we ſhould even be with our faces upon the ground, &amp; confounded in our own thoughts before that great Salvation comes that God intendeth for us. That's the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> God brings to ſtraights, <hi>becauſe he takes much delight in the Exerciſe of faith.</hi> (My beloved) Faith, it is a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace, it is one of the moſt glorious things that ever God enabled any creature to do, and eſpecially now, when there is ſo much guilt upon them; it is a more glorious work than <hi>Adam</hi> perform'd in Innocency, For a poor creature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve upon God, for his good here; and in the midſt of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities to rely upon him, it is a moſt glorious work, and God is exceedingly delighted in it, and therfore the Scripture calleth Faith, <hi>Precious Faith,</hi> in the beginning of the 2 Epiſtle of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>: now God loves the acting of precious things; God loves to ſee the actings of all his creatures, every creature active in his way; but when God hath put ſuch a precious grace as faith into the heart; Oh! how God doth delight to ſee the acting of that precious Faith: and therfore it hath been the way of God to go quite croſſe, after the Lord hath made a promiſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſalvation, he goes ſeemingly croſſe, only to exerciſe Faith; I think I have told you ſometimes of that to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that there were but two promiſes made to him, firſt, That the Country that God would give him, ſhould flow with milk and honey: and ſecondly, His ſeed ſhould be as the ſtars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and mark what way God goes to bring this about, aſſoon as ever he gets into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he was ready to ſtarve there; is this the country that flows with milk and honey? and then for the other, His ſeed ſhould be as the ſtars of Heaven; he ſtayed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers before he had a child, &amp; <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſtayed forty yeers before he had a child; and yet his ſeed ſhould be great; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be killed too: and then there was another thing exerciſed his faith, he would give him the Land, and yet notwithſtanding, during his life, he muſt not poſſeſſe one foot of the Land, but only a burying-place, and what was the reaſon of all this? It
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58996:122"/>
was to exerciſe his faith; and the promiſe God makes to his Son Chriſt, <hi>I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion</hi>; yet Chriſt muſt not have a hole to hide his head in, he hath not ſo much as the foxes and the birds have to hide his head in. Thus the way of God is, to ſeem to go quite contrary, that he might draw forth that glorious work of faith he ſo much delights in, and becauſe this is the only time of exerciſing this precious grace, and there ſhall be no ſuch faith in Heaven exerciſed as this is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God (becauſe he will have as much as may be of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this faith) though he be in a way of ſalvation, he brings his people into ſtraights.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reaſ. <hi>Becauſe the Lord delights ſo much in the prayers of his people, that he might draw out their prayers:</hi> Oh! the voice is ſweet, the voice of prayer it is very melodious in the ears of God: It's true, God delights in a praiſing voice too, but here in this world, rather in prayer, why? becauſe God ſhall have a praiſing voice to all eternity, Gods Saints ſhall be praiſing him to all eternity, but they ſhall not be praying to him to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; now God delighting ſo much in the praying voice of his Saints, and he knowing he ſhall have a great deal of praiſe from his people when they are delivered from great troubles, no marvel he doth exerciſe his people: that which pleaſes God more than Heaven and Earth is, the exerciſe of the faith and the prayers of his people, they are the moſt pleaſing things to God in all the world, and therefore he brings into ſtraights.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reaſ. <hi>Becauſe God would diſcover wicked men:</hi> Before he brings his great ſalvation, he would diſcover thoſe that are vile and wicked, that they ſhould not partake of that great ſalvation: As in our times, we know how God in every ſtraight we have been in hath made ſome uſeful diſcovery to us, it hath been a diſcovering time, of many that we have known to be vile and naught, that we did not know before: <hi>Luke,</hi> 2.35. (you know the place) <hi>A ſword ſhall pierce thorow thy ſoul,</hi> why? <hi>that the thoughts of many may be diſcovered</hi>: there ſhall be great afflictions and troubles, and the end I aim at is, to diſcover the thoughts of many: How have mens thoughts been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by plots? when God was bringing his people into <hi>Canaan</hi>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:58996:122"/>
he would not have a rebellious generation come in among them; and all the trouble they had in the wilderneſſe, it was by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a baſe and vile generation, that you have plain in <hi>Num.</hi> 11. when they were in ſuch a diſtreſſed condition, and in a murmuring and a vexing way, mark the 4. verſe, <hi>The mixt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that was among them fell a luſting</hi>: They diſturbed all the hoſt of God: And certainly if men ſhould not be diſcovered, more than they are, if God ſhould come to ſet up a full refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt us herein England, to bring us to that Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an we deſire, we ſhould be ſo troubled with a mixt multitude, the mixt multitude would ſo vex and trouble the Church of God, that they ſhould ſcarce ever have peace among themſelves; and therefore God in mercy will diſcover them beforehand, before Canaan comes he will diſcover this mixt multitude.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Rea.</hi> God will bring them into ſtraits, becauſe he might give occaſion to the Adverſary to vent his malice to the utmoſt, and to ripen his ſin that it may be ripe to the full, before God comes to deliver us; that they may be gathered together to be a great ſacrifice to the Lord, therefore Gods people are brought to ſuch ſtraights; that if they will blaſpheme, they ſhal blaſpheme to the full. In our times now, the more ſtraights we are brought into, the greater are the blaſphemies of the wicked, and if God ſhould bring us into more ſtraights, and give them the better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, I beleeve there will be that horrible blaſphemy in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that never was in any place in the world, the heavens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did hear, nor the earth never did bear ſuch blaſphemies, and blaſphemers, as there would be, if God ſhould but deliver up his people in any degree to the hands of their enemies; we know not, but for the ripenning of their ſins, and that ſo they may come to be remarkable for Gods vengance on them here in this world, God may give them power over his people, and bring his people yet into greater ſtraights. And then the laſt reaſon is,</p>
            <p n="6">(6. Reaſ) <hi>Becauſe the work of Jeſus Chriſt will more appear at the laſt, the greater the ſtraight is</hi>; And therefore in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>He will build up the City even in troubleſome times.</hi> Every one can build in quiet times, but in troubled times Chriſt will build up the City: <hi>And he rules in the midſt of his enemies:</hi> Chriſt loves to rule
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58996:123"/>
in the midſt of his enemies, that ſo his rule may be the more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Is it ſo with us? <hi>Take heed then that we have not our hearts ſinck, becauſe of ſtraights</hi>: Let us not ſay, why is it thus with us? If God be in a way of mercy, why deals he thus with us? and preſently be ready to conclude againſt the waies of God; certainly all is gone, God is gone, ſurely whatſoever the hopes and confidences of ſuch and ſuch were, we ſee all is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, all their hopes are undone. God forbid there ſhould be ſuch an unbeleeving heart in any of you, or ſuch murmuring and repining ſpeeches among any of you, whatſoever ſtraight you are brought into!</p>
            <p n="2">2 Doct. <hi>In theſe ſtraights, Gods people are mightily troubled.</hi> It was ſo here, in every ſtraight they repin'd, and were in a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and eſpecially at this time; <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi>) what mean you to do? They were all in a confuſion; and as it was there, ſo it is many times in many of Gods Saints. As the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man <hi>Heman,</hi> that made that 88. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> you ſhall find in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he was diſtracted; and yet though <hi>Heman</hi> was one of the wiſeſt men upon the earth, for ſo you ſhall find it in the 1. of <hi>Kings,</hi> (where the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of wiſe men) in 4.31. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>did exceed the wiſedom of all in</hi> Egypt, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>he was wiſer than all men, than</hi> Heman, and yet <hi>Heman</hi> was in woful perplexity, when he was brought into ſtraights. And in the 8. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> It was the ſame caſe there, that ſeems to be ours now; Oh there was <hi>a Confederacy, a Confederacy,</hi> and many people did joyn together againſt Gods ſervants, and upon that (the text ſaith) in the 11. verſe, <hi>The Lord ſpake to me with a ſtrong hand, and inſtructed me that I ſhould not walk in the way of this people ſaying, ſay ye not, A Confederacy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay, A Confederacy, neither fear ye their fear.</hi> Mark, God was fain to ſpeak to the Prophet with a ſtrong hand, that he ſhould not be ſo troubled, as other people were in the time of their fears. Yea we ſhall find, that many of Gods Saints, that he hath delivered in a moſt glorious way, yet at ſome other times they have been too ſecure, their hearts have bin all in a confuſion, and were not able to ſtand before the difficulties that they met withal: And for that you have a famous example, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 19. of <hi>Elijah</hi>; if
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58996:123"/>
you reade the 18. Chap. you may ſee what a Spirit <hi>Elijah</hi> had, he would appear before <hi>Ahab, As the Lord of hoſts lives, before whom I ſtand, I will ſurely ſhew my ſelf to him, to day,</hi> (to <hi>Ahab:</hi>) and he did ſhew himſelf to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and tels him, it was he and his people, that troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael, No</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>It is thou, and thy fathers houſe that troubleth Iſrael</hi>: And then he comes and gets the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> together, and gets fire from heaven, to conſume the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and deſtroies all the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi>: and gets rain from heaven to rain upon the earth: What an excellent Spirit had <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> in the 18 Chapter? Yet in the 19. Chapter, <hi>Jezabel</hi> did but threaten <hi>Elijah,</hi> and he takes himſelf to his heels, and runs away at the threatning of wicked <hi>Jezabel</hi>; though he had ſuch a brave Spirit in the former Chapter: So it is truly with many men, at ſome time their courage makes their adverſaries afraid, and at other times, their cowardice makes their friends aſhamed; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been ſo, they have been a terror to their adverſaries one day, and a ſhame to their friends another day.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe we have much fleſh ſtill in the beſt of us all, and we are much led by ſence</hi>; and becauſe we are not throughly skilful in the waies of God, becauſe the fear of God is ſo weak in us, therefore it is that the fear of man is ſo ſtrong, and therefore we know ſo little of Gods ſecrets; the ſecrets of God are with them that fear him, did we fear God more we ſhould know his ſecret waies, and not be ſo much troubled.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe there is a great deal of guilt reſts in the beſt,</hi> and that will make any one afraid; where there is much guiltineſs in their hearts, it is exceeding troubleſome to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 3. <hi>Becauſe they are too to confident in the fleſh, they are too to confident in themſelves,</hi> Thence it is that God withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from them; and at what time they are afraid, they cannot truſt in God, as <hi>David</hi> (it is an admirable ſweet text) profeſſes of himſelf, <hi>That at what time he was afraid, he would truſt in God:</hi> There is many a man that for the preſent thinks he can truſt in God, but he cannot do it at that time when he is afraid: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3. <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in the Lord.</hi> When your paſſion comes, then you make no uſe of your faith, to truſt in God: As now, many a man or woman can be meek &amp;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58996:124"/>
quiet, till they have a temptation, but when your paſſion is up, can you be meek then? and riſe then, and beat it down with the contrary grace? So when the paſſion of your fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles come up, can you then truſt in God? I, that is ſomewhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; but becauſe we truſt ſo much in our ſelves, therefore when the time cometh we ſhould truſt in God, God withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from us, and we are moſt afraid.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This is that we ſhould lay our hands upon our hearts, and charge our ſouls for, and be aſhamed for before the Lord: Never a one here but hath cauſe to lay his hand upon his heart and ſay, Oh that I, that have had ſo much experience of God, of his waies of helping and delivering me, out of ſix troubles and ſeven, and yet the Lord knows upon any new trouble I am to ſeek as much as ever, and in any hurly-burly in as great diſtemper of fear as ever; be aſhamed of this before the Lord. It is true, Gods people may be ſo, and you are ſo, therefore be aſhamed of it, and labour to prepare for ſuch times; thoſe that are troubled with fainting fits, uſe to carry their bottle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua-vitae</hi> about with them; ſo you that have been diſquieted in times of trouble, lay up ſomewhat that may help in thoſe times. Though a candle light will ſerve to carry in a yard in calme weather, yet it muſt be a torch, a great light that muſt ſerve when the wind blows; ſo a little may ſerve now, but a great deal muſt be laid up for times of extremity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Lay up encouraging Promiſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Lay up encouraging experiences, that may help you againſt ſuch times of fainting and trouble.</p>

But then, if it be ſo with the Saints and Gods own people, that when they are in ſtraights, they are ſo ready to be troubled with diſtracting fears &amp; cares, what ſhal become of the wicked and ungodly then? when they come in ſtraights, how muſt their hearts ſink in horror, becauſe all their ſtraights are no other, but the beginning of eternal ſtraights? preſent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows making away to eternal ſorrows, the way of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from preſent ſtraights is, by being brought into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtraights: many women with child have ſtrong pains in their child birth, yet when they think they ſhall be delivered, they have joy in ſtead of ſorrow; but a woman that is with child,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58996:124"/>
and is only reprieved becauſe ſhe is with child, till ſhe be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though ſhe have a great deal of trouble and pain before ſhe be delivered, ſhe deſires not to be rid of it, becauſe then ſhe knows ſhe ſhall come to greater, to be hang'd, and if ſhe could live ſeven yeers together and never be delivered, ſhe could be content with the trouble, becauſe when that is gone, greater comes: So wicked and ungodly men that are in great ſtraights for the preſent, may well be content with them, becauſe when they are gone, greater will come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doct. <hi>In the time of theſe ſtraights, it is our duty, to ſtand ſtil and look for Gods ſalvation, to quiet our ſpirits, and look up to God.</hi>

if he ſhould have ſaid, go on right in the way, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; by difficulties, by extremities, ſeck not any ſhifting way, be not backſliding, but ſtand to your tackling and work God hath ſet you about, for the Lord hath created a new thing; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſay, there was never the like ſtraight we are in; well, God hath ſuch mercy as he never ſhewed the like before; God hath created a new thing; many cry out in their ſtraights, O my affliction, and my ſtraitght is ſuch as never was in the world! well, gratifie them ſo; (as many times, we muſt needs gratifie diſtemper'd ſpirits, when they cry out of the greatneſs of their ſtraights) yet is there no comfort for them to ſtay them? yes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. <hi>It was never known ſince the beginning of the world, what God hath laid up for them that wait for him</hi>: Do but wait for him, and there was never ſuch mercy ſhown in the world, as God hath laid up for thee; ſo that come let us grant it, that there was never the like of that affliction that thou art under, yet there is reaſon enough for thee to wait, and look for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God, in ſuch a way, in ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give ſome reaſons of that part of the doctrine, that we are to ſtand ſtill, and be quiet: for by our ſtanding ſtill, and our quieting our hearts in our ſtraights,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reaſ, <hi>We are fit to look to the Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, and Power of God</hi>; we are not able to ſee Gods Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, and Power, nor to make uſe of it, <hi>except we get our ſpirits to be quiet:</hi> firſt get them quiet, and then we can look up to God, <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and know that I am God,</hi> there is a God in Heaven that can help and ſuccour, in time of great ſtraights and extremities, but for all this, people are in a hurly-burly, and their ſpirits are diſtemper'd, and they are wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their hands, and crying, they cannot know that God is God, they can have no uſe of all the power and goodneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, and mercy of God. Firſt get your hearts ſtill and quiet in your Families, and in your own ſpirits, and then you ſhall know that God is God: God will not appear till firſt you be ſtill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reaſ. <hi>We are not able to make uſe of our own Graces, till we be quiet and ſtill</hi>; If God have beſtowed Graces when we are in a hurly-burly, we have no uſe of them at all; therefore
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58996:125"/>
ſaith the text, <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 4. <hi>Stand in awe, ſin not, commune with your own hearts upon your beds, and be ſtill</hi>: Commune with your own hearts: you have ſomewhat (perhaps) in your own hearts that may quiet you; commune with your own hearts, and be ſtill; you are not fit to commune with your own hearts till you get them quiet; firſt be quiet, and then commune: (Oh! my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) A man or woman of a ſtaid, ſound, quiet, and ſtill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hath a mighty advantage of all paſſionate ſpirits; there are many of you, that are paſſionate at all other times, and that is the reaſon that in ſuch great extremities, you are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd with paſſion; you are ſo over-rul'd with your paſſion of anger at other times, and out of Gods juſt judgment, you are over-rul'd with the paſſion of Fear now: But if at other times you would labour to keep in your ſpirits, God would help you now.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe without this ſtilneſs, and quietneſs, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not manifeſt that ſubjection to God we owe him; for then there is a great deal of ſin, and pride, and ſtoutneſs committed againſt God; and therefore in that fourth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the old Latine hath it <hi>My ſoul be silent</hi>; my ſoul is ſubject to God; the ſubjection of our ſouls to God, depends much upon this Quieting of our hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Our reverence of God depends much upon it: and therfore in this 4. <hi>Pſalm, Stand in aw and ſin not, commune with your own heart, and be ſtill</hi>: for us to behave our ſelves in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as many people do, throwing out their hands, and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and keeping ſuch a ſtir as they do; this ſhows there is not in their hearts that reverence they owe to God; <hi>ſtand in awe</hi>; If your hearts were poſſeſſ'd with Gods fear, you would not keep ſuch a ſtir as you do in times of great danger.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> This makes people unfit to liſten to any thing that is ſpoken to them; let any thing be ſpoken to them, that is of any uſe, they eannor hear it, nor make uſe of it; as we reade of the people of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 6.9. when <hi>Moses</hi> came to tell them of their deliverance, the text ſaith, <hi>He ſpake to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but they hearkned not to him:</hi> why? <hi>for anguiſh of ſpirit</hi>: How many in trouble of conſcience, and in other times of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, have their ſpirits in ſuch anguiſh, that they never hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58996:126"/>
to any thing that is delivered to them; and therefore they come with the ſame objection over and over again, a hundred times in caſes of conſcience.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Without this Quietneſs of ſpirit, you are mighty hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of others, and you daunt and diſcourage the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and many times the cauſe miſcarries meerly upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of the hearts of men and women in time of danger; therefore you muſt be quiet, and look up to God for ſalvation; for Faith hath this excellency, that it is able to bring life out of death, light out of darkneſs; it hath a kind of creating ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; as God himſelf brings one contrary out of another, ſo faith hath ſuch a kind of working, if faith be of the right ſtamp, a genuine faith, it hath a mighty power in times of extremity to behold Gods ſalvation, and make uſe of it: I'le give you one example of the uſe of faith in times of extremity; and that is of <hi>David,</hi> when he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> and when he was in the Cave; mark, <hi>Be merciful to me O God, be merciful to me, for my ſoul truſteth in thee, yea, in the ſhadow of thy wings will I make my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</hi> What was the ſhadow of Gods wings? poor <hi>David</hi> was got into the ſhadow of the Cave, and the Sun did not ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but he looked upon himſelf in the Cave, as under the ſhadow of Gods wings: You poor people that live it may be in Cellers, and in poor dark holes and Lanes, the Sun ſcarce ſhines upon you in a year, yet if you be godly, you are under Gods wings by faith.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſpeak to the Second part of the Doctrine that we are to expect Salvation from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> did fly from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and yet what confidence had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (in that caſe) in God? reade but that third <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and you'l ſee confidence enough in <hi>David,</hi> and yet flying too: Divers grounds and reaſons I ſhall give for this, why we muſt look up to God, as well as be ſtill:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea.</hi> Hereby we ſanctifie Gods Name; <hi>Fear ye not their fear, but ſanctifie God in your hearts</hi> (ſaith the text.) You ſanctifie not God elſe: I ſuppoſe many of you would be loth to be guilty of ſwearing, and taking Gods Name in vain in that kind, but by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58996:126"/>
your diſtracting thoughts, and unbeſeeming carriage in times of danger, you take Gods Name in vain, you break the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rea.</hi> This ſhews the beauty and excellency of Faith, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee what thy ſervant can do</hi>: So now, there is a great deal of talk of faith in the world, let us ſee now what it can do; the truth of love is, when I can love God for himſelf without his gifts; ſo when I can beleeve in God without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, I ſhew the excellency of my faith, when I can truſt in God meerly upon his word; as I love God meerly for himſelf, when my faith taks Gods ſingle bond without any ſecurity, that is the excellency of Faith; when I would have outward helps and aſſurances, there I call for ſureties: So Chriſtians when they muſt needs have outward helps, and former experiences, they call to God for ſureties, as if they would not truſt God upon his ſimple bond; that's the excellency of faith to truſt God upon his ſingle bond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rea.</hi> When we look up to God for ſalvation, we engage God in our cauſe; God owns not the cauſe till then, and then he owns it: Now how happy were we, if thus we could do in al our particular and private ſtraights, <hi>ſtand ſtill and look up to God for help and for ſalvation</hi>: It's true, you cry out and complain, I have loſt a dear husband, and a dear friend, never man loſt ſuch a friend, and theſe great ſtraights I am brought into; but loſe not the quiet of thy heart too, take heed of that, that is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſs than any loſs thou canſt have in this world. I remember I have read of a Phyloſopher that had this expreſſion, (ſaith he) If the gods would grant to me my deſire, and bid me ask what I would have, I would ask of them this thing, that I might have the compoſed ſpirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that I might have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Socrates</hi> had; for it is obſerved of him, that he did ſcarce change his countenance upon any thing that befell him, he was alwaies in a quiet compoſed frame, (and yet a Heathen;) How much more ſhould a Chriſtian ſay; If God would give me my asking, I would ask nothing but that; for indeed there is a great deal of glory and excellency in a compoſed ſpirit: this is worthy of the Goſpel; therefore mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Only let your converſation be as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58996:127"/>
whether I come to ſee you, or be abſent from you, I may hear of your affairs and that you ſtand faſt in one ſpirit</hi>: This is to walk worthy of the Goſpel, to ſtand faſt in one ſpirit: and obſerve this, that except we do ſtand faſt, and quiet our hearts, we loſe every thing that ſhould help us: when we are in a hurly-burly in our ſpirits to get ſome help, alas, we loſe all our help: Therefore in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Let the peace of God keep your hearts,</hi> the word in the Original is, <hi>Guard your hearts</hi>; The peace of God in your hearts, muſt be the beſt guard of your hearts in the time of danger, now becauſe you would avoid trouble, you put away your guard, what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this? the caſting away the peace of God, is the caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of your guard, therefore keep that in your hearts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you loſe; yea, it's our Arms, mark, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. what is the Arms of a Chriſtian? firſt, <hi>The girdle of truth,</hi> fear diſſolves the heart, and makes a man he cannot gird himſelf: When he is in fear, his heart is melted, and he hath little uſe of his truth, the girdle is looſed then; In the text, there is the helmet of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but in fear hope is gone; there is the breſtplate of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but in fear, a man hath no uſe of his righteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, nor no uſe of the ſword of the Spirit, he can uſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in times of ſuch diſtracting fears, therefore loſe not your Arms: It is very obſervable, in the 6. of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> how the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſtill cals upon us to ſtand, verſe 10. <hi>My brethren be ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> and not only ſtrong, <hi>But ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> and ſtrong in the <hi>might of the Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whol armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand</hi>; then again, in the 13. verſe, <hi>Wherefore take ye all the whol armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand the evil one, and having done all, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſtand</hi>: Though perhaps, you have overcome at one time, yet ſtill look to your own hearts, when you have done all, <hi>ſtand,</hi> four times we are called upon <hi>to ſtand,</hi> nothing, what a great advantage we have by ſtanding; It's true, our afflictions are great, and the ſoul ſaith, <hi>The Lord is my portion</hi>: perhaps temptations and afflictions ſay otherwiſe, but the ſoul ſaith, <hi>The Lord is my portion</hi>; and it is good for a man to ſay, what ſhall I that am ſo full of ſin, yet not be willing to have ſome trouble, but be ſo full of fears upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trouble that befals me? why ſhould not I yeild to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential will as well as to his commanding will? how know
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58996:127"/>
I, but that God may have glorious ends, to work out of theſe extremities and troubles I am in? why ſhould I not give up my ſelf to God, to have his will upon me? and hath not God heretofore delivered me from great ſtraights and extremities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the wrath of God himſelf, and from his juſtice? grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and other manner of ſtraights than thoſe I am now in; and if I beleeve not in God now, but be diſquieted, perhaps theſe ſtraights may be to bring me to greater ſtraights; what if theſe ſtraights of affliction ſhould bring me to greater ſtraights? and it's juſt with God to leave me to fall into the ſtraights of ſin, that cannot bear the ſtraights of afflictions, therefore let me ſtand ſtil and look up to Gods ſalvation; Let us be ſo affected with our ſtraights as to carry us up to God in prayer: pray as much as ye can, but ſtill keep your hearts in a quiet frame; and if your prayers be right, they will be to you, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, they were the leeches of his cares; <hi>Luther</hi> had a great many corrupt cares, (as in a corrupt body, there is much corrupt blood) but now his prayers were the leeches to ſuck out his cares: when you are diſtemper'd, go to prayer, and then examine what a deal of corrupt blood hath my prayers ſuckt out of my heart? As <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> when ſhe had been at prayer, ſhe lookt no more ſad. There are many things I thought to have given you, to ſlay your hearts in time of extremities: <hi>Peace ſhall be to that man, that hath his heart ſtayed on God, and bleſſed is that man that ſtayeth his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God</hi>: and if ever people had cauſe to ſtay their hearts upon God, certainly we have at this day, for we have God with us; Therefore it's unworthy of a Chriſtian to have a diſtempered ſpirit. I remember I have read of the Romans, that when <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> was juſt before them, yet they bought and ſold their ground as they did at other times; they were ſo quiet in their hearts. It was a ſpeech that <hi>Antigonor</hi> had, when ſome were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the multitude that came againſt him, (ſay they) So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are coming againſt us, ſaith he, How many do you reckon me for? So may we ſay, we hear of ſo many thouſands coming againſt us; But how many do you reckon Jeſus Chriſt for? How many reckon you him for, that is the Captain of all our Hoſts: Have not prayers been ſent up to God? Why diſpiſe you the prayers of the Saints of God, as if there were nothing in their
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58996:128"/>
prayers? Is not Gods Name engaged in all this buſineſſe? Oh therfore <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> and be not afraid: And eſpecially let me ſpeak a word to you, that are of timorious and fearful ſpirits, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.4. <hi>Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Fear not</hi>: Do not excuſe your ſelves in this, that you are of a timorious nature; (ſaith God) <hi>Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Fear not</hi>: And eſpecially mark what the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks to women, In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they muſt cloath themſelves with a meek and quiet ſpirit,</hi> (that is in the 4. verſe) <hi>which is in the ſight of God of great price,</hi> and in the 6. verſe, <hi>And as</hi> Sarah <hi>obeyed</hi> Abraham, <hi>and called him Lord, whoſe daughters ye are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid of any amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: What ſhould be the meaning of that, that woman muſt be the daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> upon theſe terms? Thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> was brought into ſtraights many times, and carried from his own Country; now <hi>Sarah</hi> if ſhe had been of ſuch a ſpirit as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women are, Oh how would <hi>Sarah</hi> have hindered her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Abraham</hi> in every ſtraight he was brought into? and have ſaid, Husband, why go we from our own Country, and our friends, and ſo are brought into ſuch ſtraights? pray husband go back again, and venture not your ſelf thus and thus: but it ſeems ſhe was of a gracious ſpirit, and quieted her ſelf in God, and was not afraid with amazement: If you would approve your ſelv's the daughters of <hi>Sarah,</hi> do ye ſo, when God cals your husbands to any ſervice, though it be with ſome hazard, do not you hang about their necks, and wring your hands, and ſay, I beſeech you husband conſider what will become of me and my children, will you leave me now? Take heed, you are not the daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> at ſuch a time, if you hinder your husbands at ſuch a time as this is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doct. <hi>That the ſight of ſalvation after ſtraights, will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing.</hi> If we be brought into ſtraights, that that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming will pay for all, there is enough to ſatisfie; let us not be troubled at greater ſtraights, than yet we have; Suppoſe blood ſhould be ſhed (beloved) God hath ſuch mercy for England, that ſhall pay for all the blood of his Saints that ſhall be ſhed; and the blood of his people, is a precious thing: Every drop of the blood of his people is very precious; and the Adverſary ſhal be accomptable for every drop; God will value it, and there
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58996:128"/>
ſhall be a valuable conſideration given for every drop of blood; and the more difficulties we have in obtaining that mercy God is about to give us, the mercy ſhall be the greater: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11. <hi>O thou afflicted and toſt with tempeſts, thy foundations ſhal be laid with Saphires, and with precious ſtones.</hi> If we be afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, and the blood of Gods people go for it; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelves with this; The more precious blood that is ſhed in this buſineſs, the greater mercy is to come, for God will have a valuable conſideration for all the blood of his Saints.</p>
