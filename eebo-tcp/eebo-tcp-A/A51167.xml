            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat <hi>Truth muſt not be utter'd at all Times,</hi> nor to all Perſons; and that is the reaſon, I ſuppoſe, why Men of late publiſh their Sentiments in <hi>Maſquerade.</hi> We have already ſeen the Parables of the <hi>Bear-bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the <hi>Magpies;</hi> now give me leave to preſent you with that of the <hi>Shark</hi> and the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Pond,</hi> ſince after Four-footed Beaſts, and Birds, Fiſh comes next in courſe.</p>
            <p>There was a Time, when the <hi>ſcaly Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> of the Ocean were divided into ſeveral Empires, Kingdoms, Commonwealths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; each <hi>watry Nation</hi> being ſubject to their reſpective Sovereigns, even as 'tis here on the <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the reſt, the <hi>Shark</hi> reign'd over the <hi>Gudgeons;</hi> he a voracious, cruel; tyrannical Fiſh; they ſilly, tame, weak, deſpicable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, <hi>cut out for Slavery and Contempt.</hi> This <hi>Shark,</hi> or King of the <hi>Gudgeons,</hi> was the worſt of all his Race; for he wou'd enter into Leagues with other <hi>Royal Fiſhes,</hi> his Neighbours, only to render them the more ſecure, whilſt he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs'd up huge Treaſures by Oppreſſion of his Subjects, and rais'd great Armies, with deſign, to ruſh ſuddenly upon his Friends and Allyes to bring them into Contribution and Slavery.</p>
            <p>He had one potent Neighbour, who was an <hi>Emperor among the Fiſh,</hi> and had many Princes ſubject to him. The <hi>Shark</hi> bore a great ſpight to this <hi>Imperial Fiſh,</hi> and often invaded his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and made great Havock and Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among his Subjects; for he would come on the ſuddain, (as 'tis the nature of that ſly Fiſh,) and <hi>ſnap off a whole Limb,</hi> or Branch of the Empire, together, at a Mouthfull; and this at ſuch time as they were all in Peace, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dream'd of any ſuch Uſage. And to ſhew that he abſolutely deſign'd the total Ruin of the <hi>Imperial Fiſh,</hi> and all his Dependants, the <hi>Shark</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Whale,</hi> a mighty Fiſh; and who had the largeſt Dominions, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Armies, and richeſt Treaſury of any <hi>Royal Fiſh</hi> in the Ocean: A proud Fiſh alſo, proud as <hi>Lucifer;</hi> for diſdaining all Earthly Emblems, he wore the <hi>Moon for his Creſt,</hi> and ſtyl'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Shadow of God.</hi> To this terrible <hi>Whale,</hi> I ſay, the <hi>Shark</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors, and made private Leagues with him, againſt the <hi>Imperial

Fiſh,</hi> perſuading him to ſend Armies to invade the Imperial Territories. Thus whilſt the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Fiſh</hi> was buried on one ſide, in defending himſelf and his Empire againſt the Incurſions of the <hi>Whale,</hi> the <hi>Shark</hi> takes the Opportunity; and breaking all his Treaties of Peace, leaps ſuddainly into the Bowels of the Empire, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, murthering and deſolating all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Shark,</hi> not content thus to ruin the <hi>Imperial Fiſh,</hi> ſets upon another King among the <hi>Scaly Nations,</hi> that was a near Relation, Friend and Allye of the <hi>Imperial Fiſh:</hi> He ſends Armies, and invades the Territories of this King alſo, who was called the <hi>Sea-Bull;</hi> lays waſte his Dominions, leads his Subjects into Captivity, and does him all the Miſchief that his Malice, Ambition, Covetouſneſs and Pride could prompt him to.</p>

               </gap> and Depopulations were committed by the <hi>Shark,</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> and their Armies, ſo that the Sea was dyed red with Blood.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting, it ſo fell out, that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> was made King over the <hi>Whitings, Salmons, Maykrills, Pikes,</hi> and other Fiſh; having by various cunning Trains, and wheadling Artifices, perſuaded that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſort of Fiſh, that he was a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and no <hi>Crocodile;</hi> and having made them large Promiſes, confirming them alſo with an Oath, that they ſhould enjoy their ancient, native Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty in all things. So that the poor <hi>Whitings,</hi> deluded by theſe fair Words, and the inſinuating Stories of the <hi>Maykrills,</hi> and over power'd by the <hi>Salmons, Pikes, Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Eels,</hi> and other Fiſh, were contented that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> ſhould reign over them.</p>
            <p>But in proceſs of Time the <hi>Crocodile</hi> began to appear in his naked Colours, and not only broke his Word with the <hi>Whitings,</hi> but alſo ſtretch'd forth his Tail to the <hi>Maykrills,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd upon their Privileges. He alſo made a private League with the <hi>Shark,</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> and the <hi>Allegators</hi> of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> which gave great Suſpicion to his own Subjects, as well as to the neighbouring Princes and States among the Fiſh. Great were the Diſcontents of the <hi>Maykrills,</hi> the <hi>Whitings,</hi> and other Fiſh under the <hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Dominion: They found they were miſtaken in their King, who now prov'd a <hi>real Crocodile,</hi> a Fiſh of Prey, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impos'd on his Subjects ſuch Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ers, as plainly tended to enſlave both them and their Poſterity. This made them cabal, and lay their Heads together how to ſave themſelves from imminent Ruin: So at length it was agreed upon, among the <hi>Maykrills, Salmons, Pikes, Eels,</hi> and other Fiſh under the <hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Dominion, to remonſtrate their Caſe to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and invite him to come and deliver them from the <hi>Crocodile's Tyranny;</hi> for indeed, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> had a kind of Title to the Government of the <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, &amp;c.</hi> being deſcended of the Blood of their ancient Kings. So the <hi>Dolphin</hi> makes prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go againſt the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> being aſſiſted by the Commonwealth of <hi>Herrings,</hi> among whom this Prince kept his Court. In a Word, Upon the firſt Approach of the <hi>Royal Dolphin,</hi> with his Army of <hi>Herrings,</hi> the <hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects deſerted him, and joyn'd the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſo that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> was forc'd to ſwim away, and take Sanctuary with the <hi>Shark.</hi>

               </gap> of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> was quickly ſpread through the Scaly Nations, and all rejoyc'd at the good Succeſs of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who was ſoon choſen King of the <hi>Whitings, Maykrils, Salmons,</hi> &amp;c. Then Ambaſſadors were ſent from all Parts to congratulate his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the <hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Throne, and to enter into League with Him, againſt the <hi>Shark, the Whale, the Crocodile,</hi> and the Allegators of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Armies were raiſed on all ſides, and many fierce Battels were fought between them: The <hi>Dolphin</hi> was look'd upon as the great Protector and Deliverer of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Fiſh, from the cruel Oppreſſions and Encroachments of the <hi>Whale</hi> and the <hi>Shark.</hi> But in regard the <hi>Maykrills</hi> (who were chiefly inſtrumental in bringing the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to the Crown) proved treacherous, and held a private Correſpondence with the <hi>Shark</hi> and the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> other Meaſures were taken by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Fiſh, the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> the Commonwealth of Herrings, the Sea-Bull, and the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated Fiſh. And becauſe they could not entruſt their ſecret Counſels to any <hi>Ambaſſador</hi>'s Envoys, or Agents, without manifeſt danger of Diſcovery; therefore they all reſolved to meet together in Perſon, appointing the <hi>Herring-Pond</hi> to be the place of their Rendezvouz.</p>
            <p>In the mean while it was thought convenient for the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to ſend an Ambaſſador to the <hi>Whale,</hi> in Quality of a Mediator for Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Whale</hi> and the Imperial Fiſh. When the <hi>Shark</hi> heard of this, he order'd his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at the <hi>Whale</hi>'s Court to oppoſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s Ambaſſador with all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61901:2"/>
his might; but all his Rhetorick proved ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, for the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s Ambaſſador was kindly receiv'd by the <hi>Whale,</hi> and his Overtures of Peace were hearkned to, which gave great Encouragement to the <hi>Confederated Fiſh</hi> to hope, That an Accomodation might be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Imperial Fiſh and the <hi>Whale,</hi> whereby the former would be in a better Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to make War upon the <hi>Shark,</hi> his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neighbour and old Enemy.</p>
            <p>Well, the Time came, when the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Sovereigns of the Fiſh were to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; great Preparations were made to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>ſo Royal and Illuſtrious a Congreſs;</hi> and eſpecially to welcom the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to the <hi>Herring-Pond,</hi> who was made Guarrantee of this <hi>Princely League.</hi> In fine, they meet at the Time and Place appointed, not without great danger of the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s Life or Liberty, who as he was ſwimming to the place of Rendezvouz hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be benighted, and <hi>ſtuck his Fins</hi> faſt on a Shelf of Ice, ſo that he could not diſengage Himſelf in leſs than 18 Hours time, whereby he was liable to have been ſtarv'd to Death with Hunger and Cold, and likewiſe to have been kill'd or taken Priſoner by any of the <hi>Shark</hi>'s Scouts, who uſed to lie in wait in thoſe parts. But <hi>Neptune</hi> and Heaven were kinder to him, and next Day he happily got rid of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora, and arrived ſafe at the <hi>Herring-Pond,</hi> to the inexpreſſible Joy and Satisfaction of all the Fiſh in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> the <hi>Shark</hi> finding all Things to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well to the Confederated Fiſhes, and that he himſelf was like to be caught in a Net, they having ſurrounded Him with Armies on all Hands, and having made a fair Step towards the concluding of a Peace with the <hi>Whale;</hi> conſidering theſe things, I ſay, he ſent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the Congreſs at the <hi>Herring-Pond,</hi> with ſpecious Pretences, and inſinuating Whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, in order to an Accomodation.

            <p>Monſieur <hi>Gudgeon</hi> the Shark's Embaſſador, having thus delivered his <hi>Maſters Laſt Will and Teſtament</hi> to the Princes and Lords of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,</hi> was order'd to withdraw, whilſt they conſulted about an Anſwer. There needed no great Deliberation in an Affair, which they were all provided for; wherefore after ſome time taken for <hi>Form's ſake,</hi> the Shark's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor was call'd in again, and the <hi>Speaker of the Congreſs</hi> told him in the Name of the Princes and States there aſſembled together. That the <hi>Shark,</hi> the ſaid Ambaſſador's Maſter, had ſo often broke his Word, violated his Promiſes and Oaths, that they were all unanimouſly reſolved never to treat with him again, but to take thoſe meaſures as ſhou'd ſeem moſt expedient to themſelves without giving him any <hi>farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Reaſon or Anſwer.</hi>

            <p>Away ſwims poor Pilgarlick the <hi>Gudgeon</hi> with this ſhort Reply to his Maſter the <hi>Shark,</hi> who found himſelf <hi>caught in a Trap,</hi> and knew not which way to eſcape. He flutterr'd and flounc'd from one ſide of his Trap to another, like a <hi>Captive Mouſe;</hi> but all in vain, for the <hi>Herrings,</hi> the <hi>Whitings,</hi> the <hi>Salmons,</hi> the <hi>Flounders</hi> and innumerable other ſort of Fiſh had beſieg'd him and hem'd him in, reſolving every one to have a touch at his old Jacket before long. What the Iſſue was, you ſhall hear, as ſoon as I receive the Intelligence from <hi>Neptune's Courrier.</hi> In the mean while expect the Parable of the <hi>Top-Knots.</hi>
