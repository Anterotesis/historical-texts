            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FOR
ABROGATING
THE
TEST.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>TEST</hi> imposed upon all
Members of Parliament, <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
30. 1678. ought (I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive) to be repeal'd
for these <hi>Reasons;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because it doth not
only diminish, but utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the natural <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and turns
the <hi>Birth-right</hi> of the English <hi>Nobility</hi> into a
<hi>precarious</hi> Title: So that what was in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages only forfeited by <hi>Treason,</hi> is now at
the mercy of every <hi>Faction</hi> or every <hi>Passion</hi> in
Parliament. And therefore how useful soever
the <hi>Test</hi> might have been in its season, it some
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55847:3"/>
time must prove a very ill Precedent against the
<hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Peerage;</hi> for if it may be allow'd in
any Case, there is no Case in which it may not
be <hi>imposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore I remember that in the First
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi>-Test, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1673, the
<hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Peerage</hi> are [indeed according to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Custom] secur'd by Proviso.</hi> Provided
always, That neither this Act, nor any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein contained, shall extend, be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or interpreted any ways to hurt or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the Peérage of any Péer of this Realm,
or to take away any right, power, privilege
or profit, which any person [being a Péer of
this Realm] hath or ought to enjoy by reason
of his Péerage, either in time of Parliament
or otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the Year 1675. when this Test or Oath
of</hi> Loyalty <hi>was brought into the House of Peers,</hi>
That it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever
to take up Arms against the King, and by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
against his Person, <hi>it</hi> was vehemently <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against as a Breach of Privilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No body could except against the <hi>Matter</hi> of
the Test it self, much less the Nobility, who had
generally taken it upon the Account of their
several Trusts in the Militia. So that the only
Debate was, Whether the very <hi>Proposal</hi> of it,
as a <hi>Qualification</hi> for a <hi>Right</hi> to sit in Parliament,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55847:3"/>
were not a <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>fundamental Right</hi> of
<hi>Peerage?</hi> And after some Debates upon the Point
of <hi>Peerage</hi> it was, without ever entring into the
Merits of the Cause it self, thrown out by an
<hi>unanimous</hi> Vote of the House, <hi>April</hi> 21. 1675. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the putting of the Question, this PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTATION
is entred.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A Bill to prevent the Dangers which may arise
from Persons disaffected to the Government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The House resolv'd into a Committee to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, and being resum'd, the Question was
put, Whether this Bill does so far <hi>intrench</hi>
upon the <hi>Privileges</hi> of this House, as it ought
therefore to be cast out? It was at first resolved
in the Negative with this Memorandum, That
<hi>before</hi> the putting the abovesaid Question, these
Lords following desired Leave to enter their
<hi>Dissents,</hi> if the Question was carried in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
and accordingly did enter their <hi>Dissents,
as followeth.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We, whose Names are underwritten, being
Peers of this Realm, do according to our <hi>Rights,</hi>
and the <hi>ancient Usage of Parliaments,</hi> declare,
That the Question having been put, Whether the
Bill, entituled <hi>An Act to prevent the Dangers
which may arise from Persons disaffected to
the Government,</hi> does so far entrench upon the
Privileges of this House, that it ought therefore
to be cast out, it being resolved in the Negative,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55847:4"/>
We do humbly conceive, That <hi>any Bill</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
an Oath upon the Peers with a Penalty, as
this doth, That upon the refusal of that Oath
they shall be made <hi>uncapable of sitting</hi> and
<hi>voting</hi> in this House: As it is a thing <hi>unpresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented</hi>
in former Times, so is it in our humble
Opinion the highest <hi>Invasion</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> and
<hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Peerage</hi> that possibly may be,
and most destructive of the <hi>Freedom</hi> which they
ought to enjoy as <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because the Privilege of Sitting and Voting
in Parliament is an Honour they have by <hi>Birth;</hi>
and a Right so <hi>inherent</hi> in 'em, and <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
from 'em, as that nothing can take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but what by the Law of the Land must
withal take away their <hi>Lives,</hi> and corrupt their
<hi>Blood;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Names of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing Peers to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 23. are to be seen in the Journal Book.</note> upon which Ground, We do here enter
our <hi>Dissent</hi> from that <hi>Vote</hi> and our <hi>Protestation</hi>
against it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>QVAERE,</hi> How many of those Noble
Lords voted for the Test in 1678. and then,
whether if they have preserved their Rights of
Peerage, they have preserv'd its Honour too?</p>
            <p>But the Debate was kept up many Days,
till at last, <hi>April</hi> 30. 1675. it came to this Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
            <p>It was at last resolved, <hi>That no Oath shall
by this Bill be imposed;</hi> and pass'd into a general
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55847:4"/>
Order by the whole House, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi>
as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Order'd by the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in Parliament assembled, That no Oath shall
be imposed by any Bill or otherwise, upon the
Peers with a Penalty in case of Refusal to lose
their Places and Votes in Parliament, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Debates therein; and that this Order be
added to the standing Orders of this House.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ought to be repealed, because of
its dishonourable <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Original;</hi> it being
the First-born of <hi>Oats</hi>'s <hi>Plot,</hi> and brought forth
on purpose to give <hi>Credit</hi> and Reputation to the
<hi>Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I should think that when the Villainy of
that is so fully laid open to the World, it should
not a little concern the Honour of the Nation,
but very much concern the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi>
of the House of <hi>Peers,</hi> to deface so great a
Monument erected by themselves in honour of
so gross an <hi>Imposture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Shame enough to the present Age to
have given any publick Credit to so enormous a
Cheat, and the greatest Kindness it can do it self,
is to destroy, as much as may be, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of Acts done by the Government to abett it.</p>
            <p>What will Posterity judge of the present No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
to see such an <hi>unpresidented</hi> Law, not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55847:5"/>
only enacted upon so foul an Occasion; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Discovery of the Cheat, asserted with
Heat and Zeal, though to the <hi>Subversion</hi> of their
own <hi>fundamental Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Roman Catholick Peers</hi> have suffered
severely enough already by their own honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
House's giving Credit to so dull an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture:
And I think it is the least Compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they can in Honour make them, <hi>only to
restore</hi> 'em to their natural Rights.</p>
            <p>What will foreign Nations and future Ages
think of the Injustice and Barbarity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Peerage, to suffer <hi>English</hi> Noblemen to be
stript of the <hi>greatest Privilege</hi> of their <hi>Birth-right</hi>
by so unheard of a Villainy? And when it is in
their Power to see their <hi>injur'd Peers</hi> redressed,
that they should not only suffer 'em to be so
basely robb'd of their Peerage, but should for
ever establish and ratify the <hi>Fraud</hi> by Authority
and force of Law.</p>
            <p>This wou'd be an eternal National Reproach,
and such a Blot upon the House of Peers, that no
length of Time cou'd wear away; nothing but
the Universal Conflagration could destroy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ought to be repealed, because of
the <hi>incompetent Authority</hi> by which the Law was
enacted: It is a Law of an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Nature,
made without the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55847:5"/>
to the Practice of the Christian World in all
Ages, and indeed to our Saviours own Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
who setled all Power of Government, and
especially the <hi>Legislative</hi> (which is the highest
Act of it) upon the Officers of his own Kingdom;
so that for any other Order of Men, to assume
the Exercise of any such Authority to themselves,
is no less than to depose him from his Throne,
by <hi>disowning, neglecting,</hi> and <hi>affronting</hi> his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
to his <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Power of making Decrees concerning
Divine Verities, is the very <hi>Foundation</hi> upon
which the whole Fabrick of the Christian Church
hath hitherto stood, and is to stand to the End
of the World. For if it be once taken away, as
here it is, there is no <hi>peculiar Government</hi> left to
the Church it self, and without <hi>Government</hi> there
can be no Society, or <hi>Band</hi> of Union; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that, there remains nothing but Confusion:
So dangerous a Trespass is it for the <hi>Temporal
Powers</hi> to entrench upon this sacred <hi>Prerogative</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Civil Power</hi> may restrain the Exercise of it,
as they shall judge meet for the Ends of <hi>Peace,</hi> and
the Interest of the Common-Wealth, and punish
it too, at their own Discretion, if it shall any
way presume to <hi>entrench</hi> upon the <hi>Power of the
State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' it may prevent or correct <hi>Abuses,</hi> yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55847:6"/>
it cannot usurp the Power it self without manifest
<hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy;</hi> in short, this is such a
daring <hi>Invasion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s own <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
that nothing more imports Christian Kings and
Governours, than to be wary and cautious how
they lay Hands upon it.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be pleaded this Law was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to by the <hi>Bishops</hi> (to their Shame) in the
House of Lords. For First, it being an <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical</hi>
Law, it ought to have been antecedently
enacted by them, without any <hi>Lay-concurrence;</hi>
and when they had first decreed it by their <hi>own
proper Authority,</hi> Then, and not before then, was
it lawful for the Parliament to take it into their
Consideration, and as they judged fit, to abett
it with temporal Penalties.</p>
            <p>Which Practice (as I have before mentioned)
was ever most religiously observed by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings and Princes, and never before viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but by Apostates and <hi>Rebel</hi> Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, The Bishops sit not in the
House of Lords as <hi>Bishops,</hi> but as <hi>Temporal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi>
and so act not there by virtue of any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
derived from our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> but from the
meer <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> And if they
themselves should pretend to exercise any Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Authority in that Place, they would most
scandalously betray, and as much as in 'em
lyes, destroy the very <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55847:6"/>
and profanely <hi>pawn</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> to the <hi>Lord:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that lastly by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Power</hi> is setled in <hi>Convocation;</hi> so
that to Enact any thing of that Nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>their Consent,</hi> is to <hi>betray</hi> the <hi>Rights</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as by <hi>Law established</hi> in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> in
<hi>General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ought to be repealed because of
the <hi>uncertainty</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> of the Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Declaration</hi> it self; as,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is no Transubstantiation in
the Sacrament of our Saviour's Body and Blood.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, <hi>That the Invocation of Saints and
the Mother of God is Idolatry:</hi> Both which Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are by this Law to be solemnly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
in the Presence of God professed, testifyed,
and declared, which in Conscience is the same
thing with a <hi>formal Oath,</hi> whatever it is in Law.</p>
            <p>Now to oblige the whole Nobility of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to swear to the Truth of such <hi>abstruse</hi> and
<hi>uncertain</hi> Propositions, which they neither <hi>do</hi> nor
<hi>can,</hi> nor indeed <hi>ought</hi> to understand, and this
upon Penalty of forfeiting the Privileges of their
<hi>Birth-right,</hi> is such a monstrous and inhumane
Piece of Barbarity as could never have enter'd
into the Thoughts of any Man, but the <hi>infamous
Author</hi> of it, neither into his (as malicious as his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55847:7"/>
Nature was) but in his fierce Pursuit of Princely
Blood; for that was the only Design of all his
Actions after the starting of the <hi>Otesian</hi> Villainy
(of which this Test was the first <hi>Sacrament)</hi> to
pursue and hunt down the Heir of the Crown,
which all the World knows, and is now satisfied,
he sought by numberless Perjuries, tho' by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than this Test, by which he stript his
<hi>Royal Highness</hi> of the Guards of his most faithful
Friends; and when he was left alone, it was an
easy matter to come to his Person, and in him
to the <hi>Monarchy;</hi> so that the very next thing that
followed immediately upon it, was the <hi>black Bill</hi>
of <hi>Exclusion:</hi> And next to that it was the very
Master-piece of little <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Wickedness.
But to return to my Argument.</p>
            <p>What is meant by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is a thing
altogether <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> especially to
the Persons chiefly concerned, the <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry</hi> of the Kingdom: It is a Word and a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
chiefly handled by the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicians</hi>
Skill, in whose Writings is the least
part of a Gentlemans Education, their Learning
is more polite and practicable in the civil Affairs
of Humane Life, to understand the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> the Practice
of <hi>Martial</hi> Discipline, and the Examples of great
Men in former Ages, and by them to square their
own Actions in their respective Stations, and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55847:7"/>
like; but for the Wars between <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Aquinas,</hi> the <hi>Nominalists</hi> and the <hi>Realists,</hi> and
the several Common-wealths in the <hi>Metaphysical</hi>
World, they are not more beyond than they are
below their Knowledge, and yet these numberless
Sects of Disputers do not quarrel and differ
more about any one thing, than the Notion of
<hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How unreasonable a thing then is it, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it upon the Nobility and Gentry of a whole
Nation under Forfeiture of all their <hi>Share in the
Government,</hi> to abjure a thing that is morally <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
for them to <hi>understand?</hi> This seems too
bold and profane an Affront to Almighty God,
in whose Presence the Protestation is made; and
only declares that Men will swear any thing,
they know not what, before the great Searcher
of Hearts, rather than lose any worldly Interest:
And I dare appeal to the Honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses, if (when they consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
with themselves) they have any <hi>distinct
Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> in their minds of the thing they
here so solemnly renounce. I fansie if every
Man were obliged to give his own account of it,
whatever Transubstantiation may be, it would
certainly be <hi>Babel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two <hi>Fathers</hi> or rather <hi>Mid-wifes</hi> of the
first Transubstantiation <hi>Test,</hi> in the Year 1673.
were the two famous <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Oxon,</hi> who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55847:8"/>
brought it forth without so much as consulting
their learned <hi>Vniversity.</hi> How much the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
Burgess understood, I can only guess;
but I am very apt to believe, that his Brother,
the <hi>Alderman,</hi> (if the Tryal were made) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so much as pronounce the word, much less
hammer out the Notion. In short, there seems
to be but a <hi>prophane Levity</hi> in the whole matter,
and a shameless abuse put upon <hi>God</hi> and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to carry on the wicked designs of a Rebel
Faction, as the Event hath proved.</p>
            <p>But for the true state of this Matter, I find
my self obliged to give a brief historical Account
of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of this <hi>Controversie of
Transubstantiation;</hi> which when I have done, the
result and summ of the account will be, that
there is no one thing in which Christendom
more both <hi>agrees</hi> and <hi>disagrees.</hi> All parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the <hi>thing,</hi> and differ in the <hi>manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the History will branch it self into
Two parts:</p>
            <p>I. As the Matter is stated in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As it hath been determined in the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
Churches.</p>
            <p>Where the first part will sub-divide it self
into Two other branches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> account of the thing;
that is, the Authoritative Definitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55847:8"/>
of the Church about it. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>Scholastical</hi> account, or the various
Disputes of the School-men among themselves in
their Cells and Cloysters, none of which were
ever vouched by the Authority of the Church:
And when I have represented the whole matter
of Fact, I may safely leave it to the Honour and
Wisdom of the Nation to judge, whether of
all things in the World <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be
not the unfittest thing in it to set up for a <hi>State
TEST?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first place then it is evident to all Men,
that are but ordinarily conversant in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Learning, That the ancient Fathers, from
Age to Age asserted the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in very high and expressive terms. The
Greeks stiled it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And the Latins agreeable with the Greeks,
<hi>Conversion, Transmutation, Transformation, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,
Transelementation,</hi> and at length, <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation:</hi>
By all which they expressed nothing
more nor less than the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial Presence</hi>
in the Eucharist.</p>
            <p>But to represent their Assertions at large, would
require much too long a Discourse for this short
Essay. And therefore I shall only give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it from the time that it first became a
Controversie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55847:9"/>
And the first Man that made it a publick
Dispute, was <hi>Berengarius,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
in the Eleventh Century, about the Year
1047, who pleaded in his own behalf, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a learned Man, <hi>Iohannes Scotus Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi>
who passed without Censure in the Ninth
Century; but, to pass him by, it is certain, that
<hi>Berengarius</hi> publickly denyed the Doctrine of
the <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Substantial Presence</hi> of the Body
and Blood of Christ, and resolved the whole
Mystery into a mere <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> for this
he is condemned of Heresie in the Year 1050,
in a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth;
and in the same Year, in a Synod at <hi>Verselles,</hi> and
another at <hi>Paris;</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Victor</hi> the
Second, in the Year 1055. Upon which <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi>
in a Council held at <hi>Tours,</hi> in the same
Year, submitted, and solemnly recanted his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>But soon relapsing, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second,
summons a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> of 113 Bishops,
in the Year 1059, where <hi>Berengarius</hi> abjures
his Opinion in this form, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That he Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizes
that Opinion, that asserts, That the
Bread and Wine, after the Consecration upon the
Altar, is</hi> only a Sacrament, <hi>and not the</hi> true
Body <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>of our Lord Iesus Christ; and
that it is not</hi> sensibly handled, <hi>and</hi> broke <hi>by
the Priest's</hi> hands, <hi>and so</hi> eaten <hi>by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55847:9"/>
And this declaration he seals with
an <hi>Oath</hi> to the <hi>blessed Trinity</hi> upon the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the Death of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or
rather of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First of <hi>France,</hi> a
vehement Enemy of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Doctrine,
(who therefore had summoned the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
several French Councils against him)
<hi>Berengarius</hi> returns to his old Principles, and
publickly justifies them, in writing, to the World.
For which he is censured by several Provincial
Councils.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, succeeding in
the Apostolick See, calls a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> in
the Year 1078, in which <hi>Berengarius</hi> abjures
again, much after the same form with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
abjuration. But Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> (not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the same general Confession, of the
<hi>substantial Presence,</hi> that he had already eluded)
in a second Council, held the Year following,
he imposes this <hi>From of Recantation</hi> upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I <hi>Berengarius</hi> believe in my Heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
with my Mouth, That the things upon the
Altar, by virtue of Prayer and Consecration, are
changed into the true and <hi>proper Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>
of Christ, and are the <hi>true Body</hi> of Christ, that
was <hi>born</hi> of a Virgin, and <hi>sacrificed</hi> upon the
<hi>Cross,</hi> for the Salvation of the World, and that
<hi>sits</hi> at the right hand of the Father; and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55847:10"/>
true <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ that was <hi>shed</hi> out of his
side, not only as a <hi>sacramental Sign,</hi> but in
<hi>propriety</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of <hi>Substance.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is indeed a pretty bold Assertion of the
<hi>substantial Presence;</hi> but as to the <hi>Modus</hi> of it,
it is evident, that he durst not venture to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi>
it, as himself declares in his <hi>Commentaries
upon the Gospels,</hi> where after having recited se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Opinions about it, he concludes, <q>
                  <hi>But
these several surmises I shall not pursue, it is
enough that the</hi> substance <hi>of the Bread and
Wine are</hi> converted <hi>into the</hi> substance <hi>of the
Body and Blood of Christ; but as to the</hi> Modus
<hi>of the Conversion, I am not ashamed to confess
my Ignorance.</hi>
               </q> And so ended this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
at that time; <hi>Berengarius</hi> ever after living
peaceably; and about Eight Years after dying
in the Communion of the Church.</p>
            <p>But about this time <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Philosophy</hi> was
brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as it was
translated into the Arabick Tongue by <hi>Averroes,
Avicenna</hi> and others, and out of them translated
into Latin; for the Greek Language was at
that time utterly lost in those Western parts of
the World. This being then a mighty novelty,
the School-men, that were the only pretenders to
Learning at that time, embraced it with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and implicit Faith, supposing it the very
<hi>Gospel</hi> of all Philosophick Knowledge; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55847:10"/>
therefore set themselves to <hi>mix</hi> and <hi>blend</hi> it with
the Doctrines of the Christian Schools; and by
its Rules and Maxims to Explain all the Articles
of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>Among the rest, he had one very odd Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
singular to himself, from all the other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
of <hi>Greece, viz.</hi> That every <hi>substance</hi> was
compounded of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form;</hi> and that these
two were <hi>really distinct</hi> from one another; and
then that the <hi>quantity</hi> of every Body was really
distinct from the <hi>substance</hi> of it, and so <hi>distinct</hi> as
to be <hi>separable</hi> from it: And lastly, That all other
<hi>Qualities, Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Predicaments</hi> were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not in the <hi>Substance,</hi> but in the <hi>Quantity;</hi> and
therefore in all change of Affairs ever fol'owed
its Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Now the Catholick Church having in <hi>all</hi>
Ages asserted the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial Presence;</hi>
Oh, say they (to shew their deep new Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
That is to be understood in the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
way, by separating the <hi>Form</hi> of the Bread
from the <hi>Matter;</hi> but chiefly by separating the
<hi>inward Substance</hi> of Bread, from its <hi>outward
Quantity,</hi> and its <hi>retinue of Qualities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Rise of <hi>Philosophick</hi> or <hi>Scholastick
Transubstantiation,</hi> that the <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
of the Bread are pared off from all the
<hi>Substance,</hi> and shaped and moulded a-new, so
as to cover an humane Body: And after this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55847:11"/>
they run into an infinite Variety of Disputes
and Hypotheses among themselves; so that till
the Last Age, it hath been the chief entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all pretenders to Philosophy in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rupertus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Dentsch,</hi> a Village upon
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> lying on the other side of the River,
against the City of <hi>Cologne,</hi> a Man of great
reputation for Learning in that Age, makes out
the Philosophy of the Thing, <hi>by the Vnion of
the</hi> Word, <hi>or</hi> Divine Nature, <hi>that is</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
<hi>with the Bread and Wine; and it is that
Vnity</hi> (he says) <hi>that makes it one Body with
that in Heaven: And withal, that it is as easie
for our Saviour to assume, or unite himself to one
as the other; and when that is done, they are both
one body; because they are both his Body.</hi> This
was fine and curious, but not <hi>Aristotelian</hi> enough
for that Age; in which that Philosophy was set
up as the Standard of humane Wisdom, by the
<hi>Beaux Esprits:</hi> Among these, <hi>Petrus Abelardus</hi>
gain'd a mighty Name and Reputation for his
skill in these new found Philosophick Curiosities,
tho' otherwise a Man versed (much beyond
the Genius of that Age) in Polite Learning;
but being of a proud and assuming Nature, he
soon drew upon himself the Envy of the less
Learned Monks; which cost him a long scene
of Troubles, as he hath elegantly described
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55847:11"/>
them, in his Book of his own Persecutions.</p>
            <p>But among many other singularities to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the separation of the <hi>matter</hi> from the <hi>form,</hi>
and the <hi>substance</hi> from the <hi>accidents</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar he is forced to make use
of this shift, That upon the Separation of the
Substance, the Accidents that cannot subsist of
themselves, are supported by the Air.</p>
            <p>But then comes <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. dist. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1140.
Grand Master of the Sentences, and Father of the
next race of School-men, who indeed proves the
<hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial Presence</hi> out of the Ancients;
particularly St. <hi>Austin</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> but
when he comes to explain the <hi>manner</hi> of it,
whether it be a <hi>formal</hi> or <hi>material</hi> change;
whether the <hi>substance</hi> of the Bread and Wine
be reduced into its <hi>first matter,</hi> or into <hi>nothing,</hi>
and the like, his conclusion is, <hi>definire non suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio:</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>I presume not to determine; and therefore
quitting these uncertain things, this I certainly
know from Authorities,</hi> viz. <hi>That the</hi> substance
of the Bread and Wine, are converted <hi>into the</hi>
substance <hi>of the Body and Blood of Christ; but
as for the</hi> manner <hi>of the Conversion, we are not
ashamed to confess our Ignorance.</hi>
               </q> But if you
inquire in what <hi>subject</hi> the <hi>Accidents</hi> subsist, he
answers problematically <hi>(mihi videtur)</hi> that they
<hi>subsist</hi> without any <hi>subject</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:55847:12"/>
But it was agreed in all Schools, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
became of the <hi>Substance</hi> the <hi>Accidents</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained:
And that all outward Operations
terminated there; and that only <hi>they</hi> were brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and eaten.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi>
some were for its permanency <hi>with</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Body and Blood, some for its
<hi>Annihilation,</hi> some for <hi>physical Conversion.</hi> But
then these Curiosites were kept in the Schools,
where witty Men, for want of more useful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
entertained and amused themselves,
with these fine subtleties of thought: But then
they were confined within the Schools and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
admitted so much as to ask the Authority
of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the next Age comes that young and active
Pope, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, who succeeded to the
See, <hi>Anno</hi> 1198. in the Thirty seventh Year of
of his Age, having been made Cardinal in the
Twenty ninth.</p>
            <p>In the Eighteenth Year of his Reign he sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
the famous <hi>Fourth,</hi> or great Council of
<hi>Lateran,</hi> at which were present above 400 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Metropolitans and Patriarchs, besides
Embassadors from all Princes in Christendom,
for recovery of the Holy Land, Extirpation of
Heresies, and for Reformation of the Church.
In this Council the Word <hi>Transubstantiate</hi> is first
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55847:12"/>
used in a Decree of the Church, to express the
<hi>real</hi> or <hi>substantial Presence</hi> of the Body and
Blood of Christ in the Sacrament, under the
species of Bread and Wine: Where, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
against the heresie of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> who
denied the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> it is Enacted, <q>That
the Body <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>of Christ, are</hi> really <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under the species of Bread and Wine: The
Bread being</hi> Transubstantiated <hi>into the Body,
and the Wine into the Blood, by the Power of
God.</hi>
               </q> But though the Council used the word
to Express the Mystery, they did not so much
as <hi>define</hi> its <hi>signification,</hi> much less the <hi>nature</hi> of
the thing. It was a word that at that time (it
seems) was in <hi>fashion,</hi> having been made use
of by some of the more Polite Writers of the
Age.</p>
            <p>Some give the honour of the Invention to <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasius
Radbertus,</hi> some to <hi>Petrus Blesensis,</hi> and
some to others; but being a word in Vogue
among learned Men, the Council made use of
it as a Term of Art, instead of the old word,
<hi>Transelementation,</hi> that had hitherto kept its pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
among both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is pity the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy of this Canon is
lost, whereas all the <hi>rest</hi> are preserved: For if
we had the <hi>Greek</hi> word that answered to the
<hi>Latin,</hi> it might have given us some more light
into the thing. However, this was all that was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55847:13"/>
defined by <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, or by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lateran;</hi> for it is much disputed by
learned Men, who was the <hi>Author</hi> of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
many contending that they were drawn
up after the Council, because they often quote,
and appeal to its Decrees.</p>
            <p>This is the chief Argument of the Learned
and the Loyal <hi>William Barclay,</hi> and others against
them. But if these learned Men had considered
a little further, and looked back to the Third
Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> they would have found all
the Canons cited in <hi>this</hi> extant in <hi>that:</hi> So that
only some Canons of the Third Council, are
revived and ratified in this Fourth: And after
the clearing of this Objection, I can see no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
material Exception against them.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; this word having gain'd the
Authority of so great a Council, and being put
into the Decretals of the Church, by <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Ninth, in honor of his Uncle <hi>Innocent</hi> the
Third, it soon gained universal usage among
the Latins, and was adopted into the Catalogue
of <hi>School Terms;</hi> and was there hammer'd into
a Thousand <hi>shapes</hi> and <hi>forms,</hi> by those Masters
of Subtlety: And upon it St. <hi>Thomas of Aquin</hi>
erects a new Kingdom of his own, against the
old <hi>Lombardian</hi> Empire; but long he had not
Reigned, when <hi>Scotus,</hi> our subtle Country-man,
set up against him. And whatever St. <hi>Thomas
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55847:13"/>
of Aquin</hi> asserted, for that reason only, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
him; so that they two became the
very <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> of the Schools, almost
all the great Masters of Disputation from
that time, fighting under one of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and what intelligible Philosophy both
parties vented about the <hi>Substantial</hi> o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Presence,</hi> upon supposition of the real
difference between <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form, Substance</hi>
and <hi>Accidents,</hi> would be both too nice and too
tedious to recite; only in general the <hi>Thomists</hi>
maintain the <hi>Transmutation</hi> of the Elements; the
<hi>Scotists,</hi> the <hi>Annihilation;</hi> and they proceed to
abstract so long, till they could not only sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Matter and Form, and Accidents of the
Bread from one another, but the <hi>Paneity</hi> or Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness
it self from them all, and founded a new
<hi>Vtopian</hi> World of Metaphysick and Specifick
Entities and Abstracts.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have, as briefly as I can, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the <hi>Scholastick History</hi> of this Argument;
in which the Authority of the Church is not at all
concerned; having gone no farther than to assign
or appropriate a Word to signifie such a thing;
but all along declaring the Thing it self to be
beyond the compass of a Definition. I know
'tis commonly said, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
hath presumed to define the <hi>Modus;</hi> and learned
Men (I know not by what fatal over-sight)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55847:14"/>
take it up on trust one from another; and
the Definition is generally given in these Terms:
That,</p>
            <p>Transubstantiation is wrought by the <hi>Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of the <hi>substance</hi> of the Bread and Wine,
the <hi>Accidents</hi> remaining: To the which Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
succeeds the Body and Blood of Christ,
under the Accidents of Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>So the Bishops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
it; so Mr. <hi>Alix,</hi> and the Writers of his
Church, and not only so but contrary to the sence
of all other Churches, they confound the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
with <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as this learned Man
hath done through his whole Disputation upon
it, using the very words promiscuously (as indeed
all the modern Followers of <hi>Calvin</hi> do) and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same absurdities upon both, and imputing
the first Invention of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
the Second, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, in their
Decrees against <hi>Berengarius.</hi> But I cannot but
wonder how so many learned Men should with
so much assurance fansie to themselves such a
Definition in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, of the <hi>Modus</hi> of
Transubstantiation, by the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of the
<hi>Substance,</hi> and the <hi>Permanency</hi> of the <hi>Accidents,</hi>
when the Fathers of that Council were so far
from any such Design, That they design'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more carefully, than to avoid all Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Definitions. The subtil Disputes about
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55847:14"/>
the <hi>Modus existendi</hi> (as they termed it) between
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi> in that Council
are described at large by Father <hi>Paolo</hi> himself in
the Fourth Book of his History. But withal, he
says, they were extreamly Displeasing and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to the Fathers, but most of all to the NUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIO
himself; and therefore it was resolved in a
General Congregation to determine the Matter
in as few and general Terms as possible, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
neither Party, and avoid Contentions; and
when, notwithstanding this Decree, they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
new Disputes, they are check'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bishop of <hi>Bitunto,</hi> who was one of the chief
Compilers of the Canons, telling them they came
thither to condemn Heresies, not to define Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick
Niceties. And accordingly in the very
First Chapter of the <hi>13th.</hi> Session, in which this
Article was defined, when they determined the
Real Presence; they at the same time declare
the <hi>Existendi Ratio</hi> to be ineffable; and in the
<hi>4th.</hi> Chapter, where <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is decreed,
the Canon runs thus: That,</p>
            <p>
               <q>By the Consecration of the Bread and Wine,
there is a <hi>Conversion</hi> of the whole Substance
of the Bread into the Substance of the Body of
Christ, and of the whole Substance of the Wine
into the Substance of his Blood, which Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is fitly and properly called by the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church;</q> 
               <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55847:15"/>
In all which the Council only appropriates
the Word <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to express the <hi>Real
Presence,</hi> which it had before determined in the
First Chapter, not to be after a <hi>natural</hi> way of
Existence, as Christ sits at the right Hand of
God, but <hi>Sacramental,</hi> after an <hi>ineffable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho here some peevishly object, the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the Council with it self, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that the thing is <hi>inexpressible</hi> and yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates
a word to <hi>express</hi> it: Whereas all
Christendom knows that the <hi>Procession</hi> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Word from the Father is Ineffable, and
yet is expressed by the Word <hi>Generation;</hi>
and that the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the divine and humane
Nature is ineffable, and yet is called the
<hi>Hypostatical Vnion;</hi> and that the <hi>Vnity</hi> in the
<hi>Trinity</hi> is ineffable, and yet is expressed by the
Word <hi>Consubstantial:</hi> So that this Council seems
to have defin'd no more than the Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> did in the Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity,
in expressing the Unity of the Three Persons by
the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Distinction, by the
Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which amounted to no more
than this, That as it is certain from the Holy
Scriptures that in the Unity of the God-head
there is a Trinity, so the Holy Fathers to avoid
the Niceties of contentious Men, such as <hi>Arius</hi>
was, determine that for the Time to come the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55847:15"/>
Mystery shall be expressed by the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but as for any Philosophical Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Mystery, the Church never presum'd
to define it, and this is the <hi>Definition</hi> of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> that there
is a <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Substances</hi> under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or Appearances of Bread and Wine, which
the Church hath thought convenient to express
by the Word <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet tho the Council approve the Word,
yet it does not impose it, it only declares it to
be <hi>convenient,</hi> but no where says 'tis <hi>necessary.</hi>
And as for the Term <hi>Conversion,</hi> it is much older
than the Word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> familiarly used
by the Ancient Fathers; and so is the Word
<hi>Species:</hi> I know indeed it is usual with School-men
and Protestant Writers to translate the
Words under <hi>Species of Bread and Wine,</hi> by
these Words, under the <hi>Accidents of Bread and
Wine,</hi> as particularly the late Bishops of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Winchester</hi> have done. But this is to
impose Philosophick Niceties upon the Decrees
of the Church.</p>
            <p>And tho perhaps all the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
believed the Reality of the New substantial
Presence under the Old Accidents, yet they had
more Temper and Discretion than to Authorise
it by conciliar Determination, and therefore use
only the Word <hi>Species</hi> (and no other Word is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55847:16"/>
used by <hi>Nicolas</hi> II, <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, and <hi>Innocent</hi>
III, that are thought the Three great Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the Argument of the <hi>Real Presence)</hi>
that properly signifies Appearance, but nothing of
Physical or Natural Reality, so that tho the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
under the Species be <hi>real,</hi> yet as the
Council hath defined it, it is not <hi>Natural</hi> but
<hi>Sacramental,</hi> which <hi>Sacramental Real Presence</hi> they
express by the Word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and
recommend the Propriety of the Word to the
Acceptance of Christendom.</p>
            <p>This is the short History of the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where, as far as
I can discern, the <hi>thing</hi> it self hath been own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all Ages of the Church, the <hi>Modus</hi> of
it never defined, but in the Schools, and
tho they have fansied Thousand Definitions
to themselves, their Metaphysicks were never
admitted into the Church. And so I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give an Account of it, as it hath been
defin'd in the Protestant Churches, where we
shall find much the same <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Discord</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> as in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first we must begin with the famous
<hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> that was drawn up by
<hi>Melancthon,</hi> and in the Year 1530 presented to
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, by several Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi>
as a Declaration of the Faith of the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55847:16"/>
and as the only true standard of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>The Confesion consists of Two parts.
<list>
                  <item>I. What Doctrines themselves taught.</item>
                  <item>II. What Abuses they desired to be reformed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the later, the Emperor undertook to
procure a General Council.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the former, particularly this Article of
the</hi> Presence in the Sacrament, <hi>they have publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in two several forms: In the</hi> Latin <hi>Edition
it is worded thus:</hi> 
               <q>Concerning the Lords Supper,
we teach, That the Body and Blood of Christ are
there <hi>present indeed,</hi> and are <hi>distributed</hi> to the
Receivers at the Lords Supper; and <hi>condemn</hi>
those that teach otherwise.</q> 
               <hi>In the</hi> German <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is worded thus:</hi> 
               <q>Concerning the Lords
Supper we teach, That the <hi>true Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>
of Christ are <hi>truly present</hi> in the Supper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>species</hi> of Bread and Wine, and are there
<hi>distributed</hi> and <hi>received.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>And in an Apology
written by the</hi> same <hi>hand, and published the
Year following, it is thus expressed:</hi> 
               <q>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That in the Supper of our Lord, the Body
and Blood of Christ are <hi>really</hi> and <hi>substantially</hi>
present, and are Exhibited indeed <hi>with</hi> those
things, that are seen, the Bread and Wine. This
belief our Divines constantly maintain, and we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55847:17"/>
find, not only the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath asserted
the <hi>Corporeal Presence,</hi> but that the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church hath anciently, as well as at this time, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the same;</q> as appears by their <hi>Canon Missae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same Author Explains himself more
at large in his Epistle to</hi> Fredericus Myconius.
<q>I send you <hi>(says he)</hi> the passages out of the
Ancients, concerning the Lord's Supper, to prove,
that they held the same with us; namely,
That the Body and Blood of our Lord are there
<hi>present indeed.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>And after divers Citations
he concludes,</hi> 
               <q>That seeing this is the <hi>express
Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>constant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> I cannot conceive how,
by the name of the Body of Christ, should only be
understood the <hi>sign</hi> of an <hi>absent Body;</hi> for though
the Word of God frequently makes use of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,
yet there is a great difference to be made
between <hi>Historical Relations,</hi> and <hi>Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi>
In the first, matters transacted among
Men, and visible to the Sence are related; and
here we are allow'd, and often forced to speak
figuratively: But if in Divine Precepts, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
concerning the Nature or the Will of
God, we should take the same liberty, wise Men
cannot but fore-see the Mischiefs that would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
follow. There would be no certainty
of any Article of Faith.</q> 
               <hi>And he gives an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the Precept of</hi> Circumcision <hi>to</hi> Abraham:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55847:17"/>
That upon those Terms the good Patriarch might
have argued with himself, That God never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to impose a thing so seemingly absurd, as the
words sound; and that therefore the Precept is to
be understood only of a Figurative or Metaphorical
Circumcision; the Circumcision of our Lusts. <hi>So
far this Learned Reformer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Authority of <hi>Melancthon</hi> weighs
more with us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as
the learned Dr. <hi>St.</hi> very well observes) that in
the settlement of our Reformation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conference,</hi> P. 119.</note> there was no
such regard had to <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> as to
<hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whose Learning and
Moderation were in greater Esteem here, than
the fiery spirits of the other; and yet few Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have asserted the <hi>Substantial</hi> and <hi>Corporeal
Presence</hi> in higher terms than this <hi>moderate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former;</hi>
and though he may sometimes have
varied in Forms of Speech, he continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and immovable in the substance of the same
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For in the Confession of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches
(at the Compiling of which he was chief Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant)
drawn up in the Year 1551, to have been
presented to the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> a <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>substantial Presence</hi> is asserted, during the time of
Ministration. <q>
                  <hi>We teach</hi> (say they) <hi>That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are Divine Institutions; and that the
things themselves</hi> out of the use <hi>desing'd are no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55847:18"/>
Sacraments; but</hi> in the use, <hi>Christ is verily
and</hi> substantially <hi>present; and the Body and
Blood of Christ are indeed taken by the Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There seems to have been one singular Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Confession, That the Real and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Presence lasts no longer than the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
but that is nothing to our Argument,
as long as a <hi>substantial Presence</hi> is asserted.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1536 an Assembly of the Divines
of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession on one side, and the
Divines of <hi>Vpper Germany</hi> on the other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd
at <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> by the procurement and
mediation of <hi>Bucer,</hi> who undertook to moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
between both parties; where they agreed
in this form of Confession. <q>
                  <hi>We believe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the words of</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>That the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
consists of two things, one Earthly the other
Heavenly; and therefore believe and teach, That
the Body and Blood of Christ are truly and</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
<hi>exhibited and received with the Bread
and Wine.</hi>
               </q> This is subscribed by the chief
Divines of both Parties, and approved by the
<hi>Helvetian</hi> Ministers themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bohemian Waldenses</hi> in their Confession
of Faith presented to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of the
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> declare expressly, That
the Bread and Wine, are the very Body and
Blood of Christ; and that Christ is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55847:18"/>
with his <hi>Natural Body,</hi> but by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of Existence than at the Right-hand
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Greek <hi>Form of Consecration, this
Prayer was used:</hi> Make this Bread the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Body of thy Christ; and that which is in
this Cup, the precious Blood of thy Christ,
<hi>changing</hi> them by thy Holy Spirit; <hi>which words
are taken out of the Liturgies of St.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom
<hi>and St.</hi> Basil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Ieremias <hi>the Learned</hi> Patriarch of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
<hi>in his Declaration of the Faith of
the</hi> Greek <hi>Church in Answer to the</hi> Lutheran
<hi>Divines, affirms</hi> That the Catholick Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
that after the Consecration the Bread is
<hi>changed</hi> into the very Body of Christ, and
the Wine into the very Blood, by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Year 1570. was held a Council in</hi>
Poland <hi>of the Divines of the</hi> Ausburg, <hi>the</hi>
Helvetian, <hi>and the</hi> Bohemian <hi>Confessions, in
which they agreed in this Declaration.</hi> As
to that unhappy Controversie of the Supper of our
Lord, We agree in the Sence of the Words,
as they are rightly understood by the Fathers,
particularly by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who affirms that the
Mystery consists of two things, one Earthly, and
another Heavenly. Neither do we affirm, that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55847:19"/>
Elements and Signs are meer naked and empty Things
signified to Believers.</p>
            <p>But to speak more clearly and distinctly, we
agree that we believe and confess the <hi>substantial
Presence</hi> of Christ is <hi>not only signified</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
but is <hi>really held forth, distributed and
exhibited,</hi> the Symbols being joined with the
thing it self, and not <hi>meerly naked,</hi> according
to the <hi>nature of Sacraments. This Confession
was confirmed at several times, by several fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Synods in the same Kingdom, at</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow
1573. <hi>at</hi> Peterkaw 1578. <hi>at</hi> Walhoff
1583.</p>
            <p>The First Man that opposed the real and
substantial Presence was <hi>Carolostadius,</hi> Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> of whom the candid and
ingenious <hi>Melancthon</hi> gives this Character: That
he was a furious Man, void both of Wit,
Learning, and common Sence, not capable of
any Act of Civility or good Manners; so far
from any appearances of Piety, that there
are most manifest Footsteps of his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He condemns all the Civil Laws of the
heathen Nations, as Unlawful, and would now
have all Nations governed by the judicial
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and embrac'd the whole Doctrine
of the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He sets up the Controversie about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against <hi>Luther,</hi> meerly out of Envy and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55847:19"/>
Emulation, not out of any Sence of Religion,
and much more to the same Purpose: The
Truth of all which (he says) a great part of
<hi>Germany</hi> both can and will attest. Tho the
greatest Proof of his Levity is his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
when all that Disorder and Schism that
he made in the Church, of which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
himself a Member, was founded upon no
better Bottom than this slender Nicety, That
when our Saviour said this is my Body, he
pointed not to the Bread but to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in this he is vehemently opposed by
his Master</hi> Luther, <hi>in behalf of a</hi> true Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Presence, <hi>especially in his Book</hi> Contra Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestes
Prophetas seu Fanaticos; <hi>wherein he lays
down this Assertion,</hi> 
               <q>That by the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Pronoun <hi>hoc,</hi> Christ is declared to be
<hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>carnally present with</hi> his Body in
the Supper, and that <hi>the Communication of
the Body of Christ,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks,
is to eat the Body of Christ in the Bread,
neither is that <hi>Communication Spiritual only</hi>
but <hi>Corporeal,</hi> as it is in the personal Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ: So we are to conceive of the
Sacrament, in which the Bread and the Body
make up one thing, and after an <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
manner, which no Reason can Fathom,
become one Essence or Mass, from whence, as Man
becomes God, so the Bread becomes the Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55847:20"/>
               <hi>And in a Sermon preached by him the
same Year at</hi> Wirtemberg, <hi>against the</hi> Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian
Hereticks, <hi>as he calls them:</hi> 
               <q>The Devil
opposes us by his <hi>Fanatick Emissaries</hi> in the
<hi>Blaspheming</hi> the Supper of our Lord, that
dream the Bread and Wine are there only
given as a Sign or Symbol of our Christian
Profession, nor will allow that the Body and
Blood of Christ are there present themselves,
tho the Words are express and perspicuous:
<hi>Take,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>eat, this is my Body. In this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
he was engaged all his Life, against</hi>
Carolostadius, <hi>and other</hi> Apostates <hi>from the</hi>
Ausburg <hi>Confession, giving them no better
Titles than of</hi> Fanaticks, Hereticks, Betrayers
of Christ, Blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
of the World.</p>
            <p>And in his last Book against the <hi>Divines</hi>
of <hi>Lovain</hi> in the Year 1545, the Year before
his Death, he makes this solemn Declaration.
<q>
                  <hi>We seriously believe the</hi> Zuinglians, <hi>and all</hi>
Sacramentarians, <hi>that deny the Body and Blood
of Christ to be received</hi> Ore carnali, <hi>in the
Blessed Sacrament, to be</hi> Hereticks, <hi>and no
Members of the Church of Christ:</hi>
               </q> So that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
it is evident, That the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the
true <hi>Old</hi> Protestants, both in their publick
Confessions and private Writings, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
asserted the <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55847:20"/>
Presence,</hi> as they use the Words promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches, <hi>Grotius</hi> hath
observed very truly, That the <hi>Calvinists</hi> express
themselves in a quite different Language, in
their <hi>Confessions,</hi> from what they do in their
<hi>Disputations,</hi> where they declare themselves
more frankly. In their Confessions they tell
you, That the Body and Blood of Christ, are
taken <hi>Really, Substantially, Essentially;</hi> but when
you come to Discourse'em closer, the whole Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is <hi>Spiritual, without Substance,</hi> only with a
<hi>signifying Mystery;</hi> and all the <hi>reality</hi> is turned
into a receiving by <hi>Faith;</hi> which, says he, is
a perfect contradiction to the Doctrine of the
whole Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>So they declare in the Conference at <hi>Presburg</hi>
with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> That in the Sacrament,
Christ indeed gives the Substance of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood by the working of the Holy
Ghost.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Luther</hi> signify'd to <hi>Bucer,</hi> his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
of the Divines of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> and <hi>Bazil,</hi>
as if they believed nothing to be present in the
Sacrament, but the Bread and Wine. <hi>Bucer</hi>
returns this Answer, in the name, and with
the consent of all his Brethren; <q>
                  <hi>This is their
Faith and Doctrine concerning the Sacrament,
That in it, by the Institution and Power of our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55847:21"/>
Lord, his</hi> true Body <hi>and his</hi> true Blood <hi>are
indeed</hi> exhibited, given <hi>and</hi> taken, <hi>together
with the visible Signs of Bread and Wine (as
his own Words declare.) This is the Doctrine
not only of</hi> Zuinglius, <hi>and</hi> Oecolampadius, <hi>but
the Divines of</hi> Upper Germany <hi>have declared
the same, in their publick Confessions and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So that the Difference is rather about the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of the Absence and Presence,</q> than about
the Presence or Absence <hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Reformed</hi> French Church <hi>in the
year 1557. declare themselves much after the
same manner, to a Synod of Reform'd</hi> German
<hi>Divines, held at</hi> Wormes. We confess that in
the Supper of our Lord, not only all the Benefits
of Christ, but the very <hi>Substance of the Son of
Man,</hi> the <hi>very Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>very Blood</hi> that he
<hi>shed</hi> for us, to be there <hi>not meerly signify'd,</hi> or
<hi>Symbolically, Typically,</hi> or <hi>Figuratively,</hi> as a
Memorial of a thing absent, but truly held forth,
exhibited and offered to be received, together with
the Symbols, that are by no means to be thought
naked, which by virtue of God's Promise, <hi>always</hi>
have the thing it self truly and certainly conjoin'd
with them, whether they are given to the <hi>good</hi> or
to the <hi>bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what need of more Witnesses, when</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
<hi>himself, the very</hi> Vrim <hi>and</hi> Thummim <hi>of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55847:21"/>
the</hi> Calvinian <hi>Churches, declares his Sence in
these express Words.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Institut. Book 4. cap. 17. Sect. 11.</note> 
               <q>I affirm that Christ is
indeed given by the Symbols of Bread and
Wine, and by consequence his Body and Blood,
in which he fulfilled all Righteousness for our
Iustification, and as by that, we were ingrafted
into his Body, so by this are we made <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his Substance,</hi> by Virtue of it we feel
the Communication of all good Things to our
selves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But as to the <hi>Modus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 32.</note> if any Man inquire of
me, I am not ashamed to confess that the <hi>Mystery</hi>
is too sublime for my Wit to comprehend, or to
express; and to speak freely, I rather feel than
understand it, and therefore here without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
I embrace the Truth of God, in which I
am sure I may safely acquisce. He affirms that
his <hi>Flesh</hi> is the <hi>Food</hi> of my Soul, and his <hi>Blood</hi>
the <hi>Drink.</hi> It is to these Aliments that I offer
my Soul to be nourished. He commands me in
his Holy Supper, under the Symbols of Bread
and Wine to take, eat, and drink, his Body
and Blood, and therefore I doubt not but he
gives it.</q> 
               <hi>Here, besides the express Words
themselves, if there be so much</hi> Mystery <hi>in the
thing as he affirms, there is much more than
meer</hi> Figure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in another Passage he thus expresses
himself.</hi> 
               <q>That God doth not trifle in <hi>vain Signs,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55847:22"/>
but does in good earnest perform what is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Symbols, <hi>viz.</hi> the Communication
of his Body and Blood, and that the Figure
conjoined with the <hi>Reality,</hi> is represented by the
Bread, and the Body of Christ is offered and
exhibited with it, the true Substance is given
us, the <hi>Reality</hi> conjoined with the <hi>Sign,</hi> so that
we are made Partakers of the <hi>Substance</hi> of the
Body and Blood.</q> 
               <hi>This is express enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet in his Book <hi>de Coena Domini,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his Sence much more fully.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If notwithstanding <hi>(saith he)</hi> it be enquired
whether the Bread be the Body, and the Wine
the Blood of Christ; I answer, that the Bread
and Wine are the visible Signs that represent the
Body and Blood, and that the Name of the
Body and Blood is given to them, because they
are the Instruments by which our Lord Iesus
Christ is given to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This form of Speech is very agreeable to the
thing it self, for seeing the Communion that we
have in the Body of Christ is not to be seen
with our Eyes, nor comprehended by our Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
yet 'tis there <hi>manifestly exposed to
our Eye-sight;</hi> of which we have a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Example in the same case: When it pleased
God that the Holy Ghost should appear at the
Baptism of Christ he was pleased to represent it
under the appearance of a <hi>Dove;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55847:22"/>
                  <hi>Baptist,</hi> giving an Account of the Transaction,
only relates that he saw the Holy Ghost descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so that if we consider rightly we shall find
that he saw nothing but the <hi>Dove,</hi> for the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Holy Ghost is invisible: But he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Vision not to be a <hi>vain Apparition,</hi> but
a certain <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Holy Ghost
represented to him in that manner, that he was
able to bear the Representation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The same thing is to be said in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour's Body and Blood, That it is a
Spiritual <hi>Mystery,</hi> neither to be beheld with
<hi>Eyes,</hi> nor comprehended with <hi>humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
and therefore is represented by Figures
and Sings, that (as the weakness of our Nature
requires) fall under our Senses, so as 'tis not a
<hi>bare</hi> and <hi>simple Figure,</hi> but conjoin'd with its
<hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Substance:</hi> Therefore the Bread is
properly called the Body, when it doth not only
represent it, but also brings it to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And therefore we will readily grant, That the
Name of the Body of Christ may be transferr'd
to the Bread, because it is the Sacrament and
Emblem of it; but then we must add, that the
Sacrament is by no means to be separated from
the Substance and Reality.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And that they might not be confounded, it is
not only convenient, but altogether necessary, to
distinguish between them, but intolerably absurd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55847:23"/>
to divide one from the other. Wherefore when we
see the visible Sign what it represents, we ought
to reflect from whom it is given us, for the
Bread is given as a Representation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ, and we are commanded to eat
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is given, I say, by God, who is infallible
Truth, and then if God <hi>cannot deceive</hi> nor <hi>lye,</hi>
it follows that He in <hi>reality gives</hi> whatever is
there <hi>represented:</hi> And therefore it is necessary
that we <hi>really receive</hi> the Body and Blood of
Christ, seeing the <hi>Communion</hi> of both is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For to what purpose should he command us
to eat the Bread and drink the Wine, as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Body and Blood, if without some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Reality we only received the Bread and
Wine? Would he not <hi>vainly</hi> and <hi>absurdly</hi> have
instituted this Mystery, and as we <hi>Frenchmen</hi>
say, <hi>by false Representations?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Therefore we must acknowledge that if God
gives us a true Representation in the Supper,
that the <hi>invisible Substance</hi> of the Sacrament is
joined with the <hi>visible Signs,</hi> and as the Bread
is distributed <hi>by hand, so</hi> the Body of Christ is
communicated to us to be Partakers of it. This
certainly, if there were nothing else, ought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to satisfy us, when by it we understand,
that in the Supper of our Lord, Christ gives us
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55847:23"/>
the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Substance</hi> of his Body and
Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Calvin:</hi> And I think it is as high a
Declaration of the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> Presence,
as I have met with in any Author whatsoever.
And if in any other Passages the great <hi>Dictator</hi>
may have been pleased to contradict himself, that
is, the old <hi>Dictatorian Prerogative</hi> of that Sect,
as well as the old <hi>Romans,</hi> That whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
they made, however <hi>inconsistent,</hi> they were
always <hi>Authentick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doth <hi>Beza</hi> at all fall short of his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Master in the Point of <hi>substantial Presence:</hi>
In his Book against <hi>Westfalus</hi> a Sacramentarian,
<hi>de Coena Domini.</hi> He declares freely that the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or grammatical Sence of our Saviour's
Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> cannot be preserved
without <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and that there is no
Medium between <hi>Transubstantiantion</hi> and a <hi>meer
Figure:</hi> And yet the whole Design of the Book
is to prove the <hi>real</hi> Presence in the Sacrament,
in opposition to the <hi>Figurative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Year 1561, The Protestant
Churches of <hi>France</hi> held a Synod at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and
the Year following at <hi>Nimes,</hi> in both which <hi>Beza</hi>
sat as President, where the <hi>substantial Presence</hi>
was maintain'd, and defin'd with great Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
against the Innovators (as they were then
esteemed;) for when <hi>Morellus</hi> mov'd to have the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55847:24"/>
Word <hi>Substance</hi> taken out of their Confession of
Faith, <hi>Beza</hi> and the Synod, not without some
Indignation, decree against them.</p>
            <p>This Decree <hi>Beza</hi> declares in his Epistle to
the Ministers of <hi>Zurick,</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi>
1572, to extend to the Protestants of <hi>France</hi>
only, least they who were <hi>Zuinglians</hi> should take
Offence at it as a Censure particularly designed
against themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the highest Declaration of the</hi> French
<hi>Protestants is that sent by their Embassadors to
the</hi> German <hi>Divines assembled at</hi> Wormes Anno
1557. <hi>in which Business</hi> Beza <hi>was chief Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
We confess, <hi>say they,</hi> that in the Supper of
our Lord, not only all the Benefits of Christ, but
the very <hi>Substance of the Son of Man,</hi> the very
<hi>real Flesh,</hi> the very Blood that he shed for us,
not <hi>only</hi> to be signified or <hi>Symbolically, Typical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or <hi>Figuratively</hi> to be proposed as the Memorial
of a thing absent, but to be truly represented, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited</hi>
and <hi>offered</hi> to be received; the Symbols by
no means to be thought naked, being annexed, which
because of the Promise and Engagement of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have the <hi>thing</hi> it self truly and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd,
whether given to the Good or to the Bad.</p>
            <p>But these Civilities and Condescentions were
made in their low Ebbs of Fortune: For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they could flatter themselves with any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Interest, no Accommodations would
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55847:24"/>
serve their Turn. Thus at the famous Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at <hi>Poissy,</hi> before <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, <hi>Anno
1561,</hi> where they supposed themselves warm,
and powerful enough, by the Favour of the
Queen-Mother (who supported them for her
own Ends of State) and some great Ministers of
State, who (by the way) soon after proved
Rebels, I mean <hi>Coligny</hi> and his Faction; <hi>Beza,</hi>
who was the chief Manager in behalf of the
Protestants, runs high in his Demands. <q>
                  <hi>As
to the Eucharist,</hi> says he, <hi>the Body of Christ is
as far distant from it, as the highest Heaven
from the Earth: For our selves and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are upon the Earth, but Christ's Flesh is
in Heaven so glorified, that it hath not lost the
Nature, but the Infirmity of a Body. So that we
are Partakers of his Body and Blood only after a</hi>
spiritual <hi>way, or by</hi> Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Boldness highly offended the Queen;
and therefore he afterwards endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself by Palliations and softning Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but after all, to avoid farther Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is hardly pressed to it by the Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> whether they would stand to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of <hi>Ausburg. Beza</hi> demurs and consults
<hi>Calvin; Calvin</hi> defies it, and commands him to
protest against it. Upon which Occasion <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
a plain Protestant, in his History makes
this Remark upon the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Honesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55847:25"/>
               <q>Heretofore <hi>(says he)</hi> when Peace was granted
to the Protestants in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
put in their Claim to their Share in it, because
they own'd the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession <hi>(and it was
subscrib'd by</hi> Calvin <hi>himself)</hi> notwithstanding
that at the same time they held contradictory
Opinions. But in the Conference at <hi>Poissy,</hi> when
they presumed that they had Strength and Force
enough to defend their own Doctrines, they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession, <hi>when it was
offered them by the Cardinal of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>to
subscribe as the only Article of Pacification.</hi>
And yet after this, when they had not obtained
their Ends, they again in affront to their own
Consciences, cry up the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession <hi>as
their only Standard of Faith,</hi> not that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it, but under that false Guise to impose
<hi>Calvinism</hi> upon the plain meaning <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
               </q>
So far the Historian, though the matter of Fact
is its own best Proof.</p>
            <p>This is the short Account of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in all foreign Churches. All Parties of
Christendom agree in the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
even the <hi>Calvinists</hi> themselves, who, tho
they sometimes attempted to deny it, had not
Confidence enought to be steady to their own
Opinion, but were often forced to submit it to
the consent of Christendom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55847:25"/>
From all these Premises it is evident, that no
one thing in the World is more unfit to be set
up for a Test than <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> seeing all
Parties agree in the <hi>thing,</hi> tho not in the <hi>Word,</hi>
and yet tho they do, they again disagree in
numberless Speculations about it, and when they
have done, all Parties unanimously agree that
the <hi>Modus</hi> is a thing utterly unknown and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.
So that take it one way <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
as to the thing it self, or the <hi>real Presence,</hi> the
Test is a <hi>Defiance</hi> to all <hi>Christendom;</hi> take it the
other way, as to the <hi>Modus,</hi> it is nothing at all
but only imposing an <hi>unintelligible Thing</hi> upon the
Wisdom and Honour of a Nation under the
severest Penalties.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> she agrees
with the Tradition of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church both
<hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> in asserting the <hi>Certainty</hi>
of the <hi>real Presence,</hi> and the <hi>Vncertainty</hi> of the
<hi>Manner</hi> of it; tho the true account of it hath
been miserably perplexed, and disturbed by the
oblique Practices of the Sacramentarians.</p>
            <p>The first Account we have of it is in our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<hi>Church-Historian</hi> out of Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s
famous invisible <hi>Manuscript,</hi> whereby as he
had before made Archibishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> a meer <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastian</hi>
as to <hi>Discipline,</hi> so now here he makes him
a meer <hi>Sacramentarian</hi> as to <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55847:26"/>
A Committee of selected Bishops and Divines
being appointed in the First Year of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
for examining and reforming the Offices
of the Church. The First, because <hi>most materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
Point, was the Eucharist, concerning which
all things were put into certain Quaeries, to
which every Commissioner gave in his Answer
in Writing. And to the Question concerning
the Eucharist, <hi>What is the Oblation and Sacrifice
of Christ in the Mass? Cranmer</hi>'s Answer is,</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Oblation and Sacrifice of Christ in the
Mass is not so called, because Christ indeed is
there Offered and Sacrificed by the Priest and
the People, (for that was done but once by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the Cross) but it so call'd, because it
is a Memory and Representation of that very true
Sacrifice and Immolation, which before was made
upon the Cross.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is pure <hi>Zuinglianism,</hi> and in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, it is asserted by Six Bishops in a
Body.</p>
            <p>I think it is the Presentation of the very Body
and Blood of Christ, being <hi>really present</hi> in the
Sacrament, which Presentation the Priest makes
at the Mass in the name of the Church, unto God
the Father, and in Memory of Christ's Passion, and
Death upon the Cross, with Thanksgiving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and devout Prayer, that all Christian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and namely they who spiritually join with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55847:26"/>
the Priest in the said Oblation, and of whom
he makes special Remembrance, may attain the
Benefit of the said Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to these agree the several Answers of</hi>
Carlisle, <hi>and</hi> Coventry, <hi>and</hi> Litchfield, <hi>by which
(as the Historian well observes)</hi> the Reader
will perceive how generally the Bishops were addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the old Superstition, and how few did agree
in all things with <hi>Cranmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Old Superstition</hi> that he finds in
this passage, is nothing but the true <hi>Old Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>real Presence,</hi> in opposition
to meer Figure and Representation, which is
all that is here asserted by the Bishops.</p>
            <p>But this is the bold practice of this bold Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to make <hi>Cranmer</hi> the Standard of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi>
and this <hi>unknown</hi> Manuscript the
Standard of <hi>Cranmer's Opinions;</hi> and these two
grand <hi>Forgeries</hi> concerning no Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the meer Commemorative Presence in
the Eucharist, are the two grand singularities of
his History; and the main things that gave it
popular Vogue and Reputation with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and were these two blind Stories, and the
Reasons depending upon them retrench'd, it
would be like the shaving of <hi>Samson</hi>'s Hair,
and destroy all the strength peculiar to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55847:27"/>
The Design was apparently laid before the
Work was undertaken, that industriously warps
all things into <hi>Irenical</hi> and <hi>Erastian</hi> Principles,
and the vain Man seems to have been flattered
by his Patrons into all that Pains to give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to their Errors.</p>
            <p>And here lay the Fondness for the <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steetian
Manuscript,</hi> that it so frankly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asserted Erastian and Sacramentarian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as the Bottom of the Reformation. But if
such an <hi>unprov'd</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable</hi> piece of Paper,
without any certain Conveyance or Tradition,
without any Notice of so publick a Transaction
in any contemporary Writer, without any other
Evidence of its being genuine, than that it was
put providentially into the Hands of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> when
he wrote his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> must be set up for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Record, against all the Records of the
Churches, our great Historian would be well
advis'd to employ his Pains in writing Lampoons
upon the present Princes of <hi>Christendom</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
his own) which he delights in most, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the worst thing that himself can do,
than collecting the Records of former times.
For the First will require Time and Postage to
pursue his Malice, but the Second is easily trac'd
in the Chimney Corner.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would desire these Gentlemen
either to give a better Account of the Descent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55847:27"/>
and Genealogy of the Paper, than that it came to
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by Miracle; or else to give it less Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, a new Office for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Service
was drawn up in the same Year
by the Bishops, in compiling of which <hi>Cranmer</hi> had
the chief hand, and by his great Power over-ruled
the rest at Pleasure; in this Service he retains the
old Form of Words used in the ancient <hi>Missals,</hi>
when there was no <hi>Zuinglianism</hi> or Doctrine of
figurative Presence in the Christian World, and
the real Presence was universally believed as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the very Words of Distribution.</p>
            <p>The Body of our Lord Iesus Christ
which was given for thée, preserve thy Body
and Soul unto everlasting Life. <hi>And</hi> the
Blood of our Lord Iesus Christ which was
shed for thée, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Form prescribed in the First Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> and agreeable to this
are the King's own Injunctions published at the
same time, where the Eucharist is call'd the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
of the <hi>very Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, by
which Form of Words they then expressed the
real Presence as <hi>oppos'd</hi> to <hi>Zuinglianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Liturgy being thus established, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
abetted by Act of Parliament, for some time
kept up its Authority in the Church against all
Opposition; though it was soon encountred with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55847:28"/>
Enemies enough both at Home and abroad out
of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Quarters.</p>
            <p>At the end of the Year ensuing <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a
rank Sacramentarian, came over, and after much
Conversation with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> he was plac'd <hi>Regius
Professor</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he soon raised Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
about the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> and <hi>Sacramentarian</hi>
Doctrines.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Bucer,</hi> that prudent and moderate Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
came not till some time after, though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the same time: And so either came too
late or departed too soon; for as he came over in
<hi>Iune</hi> so he dy'd in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> so that tho he were
a great Assertor of the <hi>real Presence</hi> (as our
<hi>Church-Historian</hi> himself often observes) he had
not a Season to sow his Doctrine, and <hi>Martyr</hi>
reigning alone, and being a furious Bigott in his
Principles, it is no wonder if <hi>Zuinglianism</hi> spread
with so much Authority.</p>
            <p>But the most fatal Blow to the Reformation
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was given by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s
Correspondence with the <hi>Protector,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with <hi>Dudley,</hi> taking upon him to <hi>censure,
expunge, reform, impose,</hi> at his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
the Malignity of whose Influence first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it self in the Ceremonial War against
a Cap and a Tippet, but soon wrought into the
Vitals of the Reformation, especially, as to the
Liturgy and the Eucharist; both which must be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55847:28"/>
removed to give way to the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Errors.</p>
            <p>This Alteration was made in the <hi>5th.</hi> Year of
the Kings Reign, tho precisely when, and by
what Persons,<note place="margin">Pag. 166.</note> is utterly unknown, only it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
by our Church-Historian to have followed
immediately after the Consecration of <hi>Hooper.
When</hi> (as he observes) the Bishops being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
addicted to the <hi>Purity of Religion,</hi> spent most
of this Year in preparing Articles which should
contain the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
Among which the <hi>29th.</hi> condemns the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as the new Liturgy, to which they are
annexed, had before almost run it up to the
Charge of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>For they were not content to abolish the old
Missal Form of Distribution. <hi>The Body of our
Lord Iesus Christ which was given for thee,
preserve thy Body and Soul unto everlasting
Life. Take and eat this,</hi> &amp;c. But instead of
it appoint this <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Form, <hi>Take and eat this
<hi>(without any mention of the Body and Blood of Christ)</hi>
in remembrance that Christ died for thée.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Neither were these Innovators (whoever
they were) satisfied with the Alteration of the
old Form; but add a fierce Declaration to
bar the Doctrine of Real and Essential Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is ordered in this Office of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Lord's Supper, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55847:29"/>
should receive the same Kneeling (which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is well meant for a signification of our humble
and grateful acknowledgment of the benefits of Christ
therein, given to all worthy Receivers, and for
avoiding such Prophanation and Disorder in the
Holy Communion, as might otherwise ensue.) Yet
least the same Kneeling should by any Persons, either
out of Ignorance and Infirmity, or out of Malice
and Obstinacy be misconstrued and deprav'd, it is
here declared that no Adoration is intended, or ought
to be done unto any real or essential Presence of
Christ's natural Flesh and Blood, for the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bread and Wine remain still in their very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Substances, and therefore may not be ador'd,
(for that were Idolatry to be abhorr'd by all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Christians) and the natural Body and Blood of
our Saviour Christ are in Heaven, and not here.
It being against the Truth of Christ's natural Body,
to be at one time in more places than one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas a body of Articles was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
at the same time, it is declared in the</hi> 29th.
<hi>Article,</hi> That since the very being of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth require, That the Body of one and the
same Man, cannot be at one and the same time in
many places, but of necessity must be in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and determinate place; therefore the Body of
Christ cannot be present in many different places at
the same time. And since as the Holy Scriptures
testifie Christ hath been taken up into Heaven, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55847:29"/>
there is to abide till the end of the World, it becomes
not any of the Faithful to believe or profess, that
there is a real or corporeal Presence (as they Phrase
it) of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.</p>
            <p>This Declaration, though it seem'd to be aim'd
with a particular Malice against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
and their peculiar manner of Asserting and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the real Presence, yet it strikes at the
general Doctrine it self, held in all Churches.
And as these were the great Alterations made at
that time; so who were the Authors and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of'em is so utterly unknown to Historians,
that they are not so much as able to conjecture.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> would ascribe it either to the
Convocation it self, or some Committee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it. But this is the officious Kindness of the
good Man to help out the poor oppressed Church
at that time, at a dead Lift, having no Record or
Authority for his Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor</hi> Burnet <hi>has often heard it said, That the
Articles were fram'd by</hi> Cranmer <hi>and</hi> Ridley. But
whoever told him so, knew no more than himself;
I am sure it is the meanest Trade in an Historian
to stoop to Hear-says.</p>
            <p>All that can be conjectured of it, is, That it
was done at that unhappy time when <hi>Dudley</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
all, who when he form'd his great and
ambitious Designs, first (as the Historian Remarks)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55847:30"/>
endeavoured to make himself Popular; and to
this end, among other Arts, he made himself
Head and Patron of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Faction, and
entertain'd the Establish'd Church with Neglect
and Contempt; and therefore I find not Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Matters referr'd to the advice of the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Ecclesiastical Order,</hi> but were either Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by Himself, and his Agents in private, or
some <hi>incompetent Lay-Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to this matter of the New Liturgy and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
there is no Record but an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which they are Impos'd and Authoriz'd.</hi>
               <q>Whereas there hath been a very Godly Order set
forth by the Authority of Parliament for Common-Prayer,<note place="margin">Anno 5to. &amp; 6to. Edw. 6ti.</note>
and Administration of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be used in the Mother Tongue within
this Church of <hi>England,</hi> agreeable to the Word of
God, and the Primitive Church, very comfortable
to all good People, desiring to live in Christian
Conversation, and most profitable to the Estate of
this Realm; upon the which, the Mercy, Favour,
and Blessing of Almighty God is in no wise so
readily and plenteously pour'd, as by Common-Prayers,
due using of the Sacraments, and often
Preaching of the Gospel with the Devotion of the
Hearers; and yet this notwithstanding a great

as well for the more plain and manifest

of the said Order or Common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in some places, where it is necessary
to make the same Prayer and fashion of

Christian People to the true honouring of

to be faithfully and godly
perused, explained, and made fully perfect,

            <p>In this new Office, beside the forementioned
alterations in the Liturgy it self, there was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55847:32"/>
in the Rubrick, the Abolition of <hi>Copes</hi> and
<hi>Hoods;</hi> neither is it altogether unobservable,
that at this time <hi>Hopkins</hi> his Psalms broke in
upon the service of the Church.</p>
            <p>But in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Reign, when the Reformation was setled in that
State, in which it ever after continued, that new
Declaration of the Second Liturgy of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
was rejected, together with the <hi>29th.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and the First old Form of Distribution
was restored. And thats a clear Declaration of
the Sence of this Church for a real and essential
Presence, when it was so particularly concern'd
to have all Bars against it remov'd. And from
that time forward, the most eminent Divines in
it, were successively from Age to Age the most
Assertors of it.</p>
            <p>It were in vain to recite the numberless Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
to that Purpose, it having been so often
done by other Hands. A List of the Names of

            <p>To this Catalogue variety of other Writers
might be added, but either here are Witnesses
enough, or there never can be. Neither need I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their Testimonies, when they are so vugarly
known, and have been so frequently recited.</p>
            <p>I shall content my self with the Two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
the most learned and reverend Prelates <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
and <hi>Andrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First wrote his <hi>Diallacticon</hi> concerning the
Truth, Nature and Substance of the Body and
Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. A Book much
approved and often commended by <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animad. Cass. Artic. 10. in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad. Riveti. Votum pro Pace Art. 10. Rivet. Apol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dicuss.</note> (tho
he knew not the Author) as the best Discourse
upon the Argument, and the most proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to restore the Peace of the Christian Church
in that Point, which he further says was for that
purpose translated into <hi>French</hi> by a reformed
Divine, by the Advice of his Brethren. I have
not the Book by me, but the Design and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Assertion is to prove (as Dr. <hi>Cosins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
it) that the Eucharist is <hi>not only a Figure</hi>
of the Body of our Lord, but contains in it the
<hi>Verity, Nature</hi> and <hi>Substance;</hi> and therefore that
these Terms ought not to be exploded, because
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55847:33"/>
the Ancients generally used them in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
upon this Argument.</p>
            <p>But Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Passage, though grown
Vulgar and Thread-bare, by being so continually
quoted, best deserves our Observation, because
by that means it is made not only a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his own Sence, but of all that followed
him in it, and that is of almost all the learned
Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from that time. The Passage is in his
Answer to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in these Words.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal is not ignorant, except wilfully,
that Christ hath said, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now
about the <hi>Object</hi> we are both agreed; all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
is about the <hi>Modus.</hi> We firmly believe
that it is the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, but after what <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
it is made to be so, there is not a Word extant
in the Gospel, and therefore we reject it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Matter of Faith. We will, if you please,
place it among the Decrees of the Schools; but by
no means among the Articles of Religion. What
<hi>Durandus</hi> said of old, we approve of. <hi>We hear
the Word, feel the Effect, know not the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
believe the Presence.</hi> And so we believe
the Presence too, and that real no less than your
selves: Only we define nothing rashly of its <hi>Modus,</hi>
neither do we curiously inquire into it; no more than
how the Blood of Christ cleanseth us in our Baptism;
no more than how in the Incarnation of Christ the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55847:33"/>
Humane Nature is united to the Divine. We rank
it in the Order of <hi>Mysteries</hi> (and indeed the whole
Eucharist it self is nothing but <hi>Mystery)</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
beside, ought to be consumed by Fire, that is
as the Fathers elegantly express it, to be ador'd by
Faith, not examined by Reason.</p>
            <p>This was his State of the Controversie, that
was then perus'd and approv'd of by King <hi>Iames,</hi>
and ever after retained by the Divines of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> down to the Rebellion and
Subversion of Church and State, and then it was
carried into Banishment with its Confessors. For
whilst his late Majesty resided at <hi>Cologn,</hi> it was
there commonly objected, in his own Presence, by
the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines against the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
That all its Members were meer <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Sacramentarians,</hi> that believed only an
imaginary Presence.</p>
            <p>Upon this Dr. <hi>Cosins,</hi> who was then Dean of
the Chapel Royal, by his Majesties Command
writes a Discourse to vindicate the Church of
<hi>England</hi> from that Calumny, and to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of its Sence concerning the true and real
Presence; in which he declares himself to the
same purpose with all the forementioned Authors,
all along vehemently asserting the true reality of
the Presence, and still declaring the <hi>Modus</hi> to be
ineffable, unsearchable, above our Senses, and
above our Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55847:34"/>
So that still all Parties are agreed in the thing
it self, were it not for that one mistaken Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not only
defin'd the <hi>Matter,</hi> but the <hi>Manner,</hi> which she is
so far from pretending to attempt, that before
she proceeded to decree any thing about it, she
declar'd that it was so <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> that it
was not capable of being defin'd, as we see all
Christendom hath done beside.</p>
            <p>Now after all this I leave it to the common
Sence and Ingenuity of Mankind, whether any
thing can be more barbarous and profane than to
make the renouncing of a Mystery, so unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
receiv'd, <hi>a State TEST.</hi> And that is
my present Concernment about it, not as a Point
of Divinity, but as turned into a Point of
State.</p>
            <p>Thus far proceeded the Old Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which as it was banished, so it was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Crown. But by reason of the long
Interval of Twenty Years between the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Restitution, there arose a new Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Divines that <hi>knew not</hi> Joseph. These Men
underhand deserted and undermined the Old
Church, as it stood upon <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Principles,</hi> and instead of it crected a New
Church of their own Contrivance, consisting
partly of <hi>Independency,</hi> partly of <hi>Erastianism,</hi>
with the <hi>Independent,</hi> leaving no standing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55847:34"/>
in the Christian Church over private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but leaving every Man to the arbitrary
Choice of his own Communion; with <hi>Erastus</hi>
allowing no Jurisdiction to the Christian
Church, but what is derived from the Civil
Magistrate.</p>
            <p>These Principles being Pleasing to the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
of the People, these Men soon grew
popular, and soon had the Confidence to call
themselves the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But the
principal Object of their Zeal was the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Popery, and the only Measure of Truth,
with them, was Opposition to the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore they assum'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Management of that great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
War.</p>
            <p>And as they managed it upon new Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or indeed, none at all (never writing for
our Church, but only against that Church) so
they advanced new Arguments to represent the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Odious as possible, to the
People. Among these the Two most frightful
Topicks, were <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
One was a very hard Word, and the other a
very ugly one. These Two Words, they
made the Two great Kettle-drums to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Guards. They were continually beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them with all their Force, and
whenever they found themselves at any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55847:35"/>
with an Enemy (as they often were
by pressing too far, for they never thought
they did enough in the Cause) by making a
Noise upon these Two loud Engines, they
could at pleasure drown the Dispute.</p>
            <p>Now, ever since this Alteration of the State
of the War between the Two Churches, we
hear little or nothing at all of the <hi>real Presence</hi>
in the Cause, but it is become as great a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the <hi>(i.e. their)</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> as
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it self, but the whole matter
is resolved into a meer Sacramental Figure and
Representation, and a Participation only of the
Benefits of the Body and Blood of Christ by
Faith.</p>
            <p>I know not any one Writer of that Party of
Men that hath ever own'd any higher Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but on the contrary they state all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
about the Eucharist upon <hi>Sacramentarian
Principles,</hi> and with them to assert the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of the Presence of our Saviour's Body
and Blood in the Sacrament, as naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
it self into <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as that does
into <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the main Argument insisted upon by
them, is the natural <hi>Impossibility</hi> of the thing
it self to the Divine <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> which beside
the prophane Boldness of prescribing Measures
to God's Attributes in a Mystery that they do
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55847:35"/>
not comprehend; 'tis, as appears by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
a Defiance to the Practice of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
who have ever acknowledged an <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible</hi>
Mystery, not <hi>subject</hi> to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> but to be imbraced
purely upon the Authority of a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>And therefore that ought to be the only
matter of Dispute. For if it be a Divine
Revelation (as all Christendom hath hitherto
believed) that determines the Case without
any further Enquiry; and if any Man will
not be satisfied with that Authority, he makes
very Bold with his Maker. And Men of
those Principles would no doubt, make admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Work with the Definitions of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith by the Four first general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>
            <p>But to let their new way of Arguing pass,
it is these Men that first set up Sacramentarian
Principles in this Church, and then blew them
into the Parliament House, raising there, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Session, continual Tumults about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and it is to their Caballing with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that we owe these new and unpresiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>TESTS.</hi> Perhaps to have their own
Decrees and Writings established by Law, and
imposed upon the whole Nation as <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:55847:36"/>
In short, if they own a <hi>real Presence,</hi> we
see from the Premises how little the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
is between that and <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as
it is truly and ingeniously understood by all
<hi>reformed Churches.</hi> If they do not, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the Doctrine both of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the Church <hi>Catholick,</hi> and then if
they own only a <hi>figurative Presence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (and it is
plain they own <hi>no other)</hi> they stand condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Heresie</hi> by almost all Churches in the
Christian World; and if this be the thing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be set up (as it certainly is by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and Contrivers of it) by renouncing
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> then the Result and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Law is under this Pretence to
bring a new <hi>Heresy by Law</hi> into the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet upon this Foot I find the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
stands at this present Day between the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi> on one
part, and little <hi>Iulian</hi> in the Back-shop with
his Dragoons on the other part: The Bishop
establishes the <hi>Real</hi> Presence in Opposition to
the <hi>Figurative;</hi> His Answerer turns the whole
Mystery into meer Type and Figure, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a figurative Interpretation of the Words
of Institution, and yet confesses it at the same
time to be somewhat <hi>more than a Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55847:36"/>
To this it is reply'd, I would gladly know
what that is, which is not the thing it self, but yet
is <hi>more than</hi> a meer <hi>Figure</hi> of it: To this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That the Presence is Spiritual, but yet
Real; but how a Corporeal Substance should
have a real Spiritual Presence, is a thing that
requires more Philosophy to clear it up than
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or in the Words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himself: <hi>We suppose it to be a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
that Body should have any Existence,
but what alone is proper to a Body that is Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is their last Resolution of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
that a true real Presence is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and so I think is a real spiritual Presence
of a bodily Substance.</p>
            <p>This Scent the whole Chace follows, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
agree in this Cry, That there is no
Presence, but either <hi>meerly Figurative,</hi> and that
shuts out all <hi>Reality,</hi> and is <hi>universally</hi> condemned
by all the Reformation; or <hi>meerly Spiritual,</hi> (i.e.)
the present Effects and Benefits of the <hi>absent</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood of Christ, which hath been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
equally cashiered by all other Reformed
Churches, as the other grand Scandal of <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>London</hi> Answerer to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses:
There can be no real Presence, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Figuratively in the Elements, or Spiritually
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55847:37"/>
in the Souls of those who worthily receive them.<note place="margin">Answer to <hi>T. C.</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, p. 66.</note>
               <hi>So Dr.</hi> St.</p>
            <p>All which the Doctrine of our Church implies
by this Phrase, is only a <hi>real Presence</hi> of Christ's
<hi>invisible Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> so in and with the
Elements, as by the faithful receiving of them
to convey real and spiritual Effects to the Souls of
Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oxford</hi> Answerer to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Discourses
allows no other <hi>real Presence</hi> but the <hi>virtual</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that is the meer Effect.</p>
            <p>So the popular Author of the Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> makes no <hi>Medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the meer <hi>figurative Presence</hi> and <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
so that all other Presence, that is
not meerly Figurative, comes under the Notion
of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the gentlest Character he is pleased to
give of this</hi> Monsieur, <hi>is this, That</hi> the Business of
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not a Controversie of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
against Scripture, or of Reason against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but of downright Impudence against the plain
meaning of the Scripture, and all the Sence and
Reason of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>But besides the intolerable Rudeness of the
Charge against all the Learned Men of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the worst of <hi>Sots</hi> and <hi>Ideots,</hi>
if there be no middle real Presence between
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and the <hi>Figure,</hi> he hath cast
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55847:37"/>
all the Protestant Churches into the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of <hi>Sots</hi> and <hi>Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But howsoever rash and preposterous it may
be for Presons that believe the real Presence to
abjure the Word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> ye to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
any part of Divine Worship in the
Christian Church to be in its own Nature <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
is inhumane and barbarous.</p>
            <p>IDOLATRY <hi>is a Stabbing and Cut-throat
Word, its least Punishment is the greatest that
can be, both Death and Damnation; and good
Reason too, when the Crime is no less than
renouncing the true God that made Heaven
and Earth. Thus Exod.</hi> 22. 20. He that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
unto any God, save unto the Lord or Iehovah
only, he shall be utterly destroyed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6.
If thy Brother the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or
thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Bosom, or thy
Friend which is as thine own Soul, entice thee secretly,
saying, Let us go and serve other Gods (which thou
hast not known, thou nor thy Fathers) namely of the
Gods of the People which are round about you, nigh
unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of
the Earth unto the other: Thou shalt not consent
unto him, nor hearken unto him: Neither shall thine
Eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
shalt thou conceal him. But thou shalt surely kill
him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him
to Death, and afterward the Hand of all the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55847:38"/>
People. And thou shalt stone him with Stones,
that he die: Because he hath sought to thrust thee
away from the Lord thy God which brought thee
out of the Land of Egypt, from the House of
Bondage.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Crime,</hi> and this the <hi>Punishment</hi>
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Sentence was so severely
Executed, that for the setting up the <hi>golden
Calf,</hi> or <hi>Symbol of the Sun,</hi> that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
Worship'd, as the supreme Deity, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in its proper place, Three thousand of the
Ring-leaders, were put to the Sword by the
Command of <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32. 27. And for this
Reason it pleased God to destroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
from off the Face of the Earth, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Divine Worship to false and created Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in Defiance to the Eternal Creator of
it.</p>
            <p>So black a Crime as this, that is no less than
renouncing God is not lightly to be charged
upon any Party of Christians, not only because
of the foulness of the Calumny, but the barbarous
Consequences that may follow upon it, to invite
and warrant the Rabble, when ever Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
favours, to destroy the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and
their <hi>Images,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to destroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and their Idols.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:55847:38"/>
But before so bloody an Indictment be preferr'd
against the greatest part of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing ought to be very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
<hi>The Charge is too big for a Scolding Word.</hi>
And how inconsistent soever <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be with
Salvation, I fear so uncharitable a Calumny (if it
prove one) can be of no less damnable Consequence.
It is a piece of Inhumanity, that out-does the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageness
of the <hi>Canibals</hi> themselves, and damns
at once both Body and Soul.</p>
            <p>And yet after all, we have no other ground for
the bold Conceit, than the crude and rash Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of some popular Divines, who have no other
Measures of Truth or Zeal, but Hatred to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and therefore never spare for hard Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Church, and run up all Objections
against it into nothing less than Atheism and
Blasphemy, of which <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>But if they would lay aside their indecent Heats,
and soberly enquire into the Nature and Original
of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> they would be as much ashamed of
the Ignorance of their Accusations, as they ought
to be of its Malice. And therefore I shall set
down a plain and brief Account of that Argument,
that when we understand the easie, obvious, and
natural Notion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it will for ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Vanity of these Men's Fanatique Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
I pray God there be nothing worse at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55847:39"/>
bottom, seeing it has ever been set up as the
Standard against Monarchy.</p>
            <p>It is a Subject that hath entertained the most
able Pens in the World, but I shall not presume
or pretend to be so learned, but shall confine all
my Knowledge to the Word of God, chiefly to
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Writings, for there it is fully and
clearly stated, the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law being enacted pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Opposition to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now nothing can
be more obvious, than that the Notion of it there
is neither more nor less than this: <hi>The Worship of
the Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars,
or any other visible and corporeal Deity, as the Supreme
God, so as to exclude all Sense and Apprehension of a
spiritual and invisible Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This evidently appears both by the Almighties
several Revelations that he made of himself to
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to preserve them from it,
and from the several Characters and Descriptions,
that himself hath upon numberless occasions made
of it.</p>
            <p>Most learned Men would trace its Original
from before the Flood, but they follow their
Chase without any Scent, as generally all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
do, when they pursue into the first Source
and Original of things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iewish Robbies</hi> (that are of too late a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pretend to any Authority in such Antient
Matters; for as they lived not above Six Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55847:39"/>
us, so they had no other Records than what
we have, the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets)
derive its Original from the Age of <hi>Enos;</hi> but as
their Conjecture is founded upon an ambiguous
Word, so it is contradicted by the State of the
World at that time; for by reason of the long
Lives of the Patriarchs from the Creation to the
Flood, it is not easie to conceive, That the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and Tradition of the late Creation of the
World should be worn out in so short a time,
<hi>Enos</hi> being <hi>Adams</hi>'s Granchild, and living in the
same Age with him for some Hundred Years.</p>
            <p>But the plain Demonstration that there was no
such Impiety before the Flood, is, that <hi>Moses,</hi>
when he reckons up the Causes that provok'd God
to bring that Judgment upon the World, makes
no mention of the Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> of which, if
they had been Guilty, as it is a Sin of the first
Magnitude, so it would have held the first place
in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>Others make <hi>Cham</hi> the Father of this Monster,
as they do of all other Crimes, but for no other
Reason beside his ill Name.</p>
            <p>Others derive it from the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi>
which they will have to have been built for an
Altar to the Sun, after the Custom of after-times,
when they Worshiped him upon High Towers
for Altars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55847:40"/>
               <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and his Followers, find deep Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was born
in <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> that is, say they, the
Country of the Antient <hi>ZABII,</hi> the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and for that reason he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
out of his own Country to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the True God.</p>
            <p>But this Dream of the <hi>ZABII</hi> is so modern,
and so void of the Authority of any Antient
Record, that it proves it self a fond Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
Tho in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time (and that was
many Centuries after the Flood) we meet with
the first Traces of this Apostacy: For that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Discovery that God was pleased to
make of himself as <hi>Supreme Lord of all things,</hi> was
made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Opposition to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of
his own Country, <hi>i.e. Chaldea,</hi> who seemed to have
been the first Founders of it, and for that reason
God commanded him <hi>to leave his Country,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 1.</note> his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
               <hi>and his Fathers House, and sojourn in the Land
of</hi> Canaan, where the Tradition of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the True God seems to have been much
better preserved. So that tho there were some
Decays from the true Old Religion, yet they
were as yet very far from an Universal Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55847:40"/>
That the Plague was then broke out in <hi>Chaldea,</hi>
is evident from the words of <hi>Ioshua, (24. 2.)
Your Fathers dwelt on the other side the River in old
time, even</hi> Terah <hi>the Father of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the
Father of</hi> Nachor, <hi>and they serv'd strange Gods.</hi> But
when <hi>Abraham</hi> came into <hi>Canaan;</hi> I find no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
that the Customs of his Country had pass'd
the River, but on the contrary evident Instances
of their Knowledge of the true God, as Creator
of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>What can be more plain than the Story of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,
Priest of the most High God</hi> (a Term
appropriate in Scripture to the Supreme Deity)
in his blessing <hi>Abraham. Blessed be</hi> Abraham <hi>of the
most High God, Creator of Heaven and Earth.</hi> And
when God consumed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with
Fire from Heaven, <hi>Idolatry</hi> is no where reckoned
among the Causes and Provocations of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and unusual Judgment; and had it been
one of their <hi>crying Sins,</hi> it would have been
the loudest, and so never have been omitted
by the Sacred Historian. And when <hi>Isaac</hi> was
forced by Famine into the Country of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines,
Abimelech</hi> their King entred into a Solemn
and Religious Covenant with him of mutual
Defence and Offence, upon this Inducement, that
he was <hi>the Blessed of the Lord,</hi> or the peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of <hi>Iehovah;</hi> so that as long as himself
and <hi>Isaac</hi> were of a side, the Supreme Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55847:41"/>
mediate Providence would be engaged in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>The first plain Intimation we find of it in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi>
is in the History of <hi>Iacob,</hi> after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> where, upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from that City by God's especial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he builds an Altar at <hi>Bethel</hi> to God, and
commands his Family to put away their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <hi>Strange Gods.</hi> And from this time we read
of nothing of this Nature till the Deliverance of
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after they had
been deteined there Four Hundred and Thirty
Years, according to the Hebrew, or Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Fifteen according to the <hi>Seventy,</hi> the
greatest part of which time was spent in Slavery
and Bondage.</p>
            <p>But at, and after their Deliverance, we hear
of nothing else but Cautions against <hi>Idolatry</hi> or
Worship of Strange Gods, as if in that long
Tract of Time and Misery, they had lost the
Tradition of the God of their Ancestors, and
by long conversation with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> had
taken up their Masters Religion together with
their Burdens; and it was scarce possible to be
otherwise for men in their poor condition, after
so long a Tract of Time, than to take up the
Religion in publick Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55847:41"/>
Long custom and conversation naturally inures
Men to the Manners of the Country, but Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
breaks Men to them: And what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from miserable People, who spent all their
days in carrying of Clay, gathering Straw, making
Bricks, and all Offices of Servility, than that
they should serve their Masters Gods, as well as
their Masters themselves? And that this was
their case, is evident from the whole Series of the
Story.</p>
            <p>The first Discovery that the Almighty made of
himself, was to <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Burning Bush,
where he tells us,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I am the God of thy Fathers,
the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God
of</hi> Jacob: But this seems to be a New Language
to <hi>Moses;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> For he replys, <hi>When I come unto the</hi>
Children of Israel, <hi>and shall say unto them, the God
of your Fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall
say to me, what is his Name</hi> (or what God is he)
<hi>what shall I say unto them?</hi> To this he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to answer, <hi>I am that I am hath sent
you;</hi> that is, the only self existent Being, that
is, the only Supreme Deity, and God of your
Fathers: And for the truth and demonstration of
this, he refers both him and them to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miracles.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Moses</hi> was discouraged by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the People,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> because of their severe
Usage, the Almighty gives him encouragement
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55847:42"/>
upon this powerful Motive, <hi>I am</hi> Jehovah, or <hi>I
am the Lord, who will deliver you with a</hi> strong Hand,
or <hi>stretched out Arm,</hi> i.e. <hi>I am that Omnipotent, self-existent
Being;</hi> and that shall be the proof of it,
the great Miracles that I will work for your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
            <p>And at the time of their Deliveranee he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
institutes the Passover, not only as a
Memorial of the Thing, but as I shall prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
the strongest Bar against Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But as soon as they sat down at the Foot of
Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> which was their first place of Rest,
God's first Care was to make further provision
against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> where after a fearful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Representation of his Presence, he gives the
Ten Commandments, whereof the Four First
are directly levell'd against Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He enjoyns the worship of Himself,
who by his Almighty Power had delivered them
from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage.</p>
            <p>In the next place, He forbids them the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of all Idols, <hi>i. e.</hi> as himself describes them,
<hi>The likeness,</hi> or similitude, <hi>of any thing that is in
Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Water
under the Earth.</hi> A plain and indeed logical Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
this, that Idolatry is giving the Worship
of the Supreme God, to any created corporeal or
visible Deity, or any thing that can be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an Image, which nothing but coporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55847:42"/>
can, and to suppose such a Being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Deity, is the only true and proper <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho there may seem to be two sorts of it:
First, either to Worship a material and created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Supreme Deity: Or Secondly, to ascribe
any corporeal Form or Shape to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet in the Result, both are but one; for
to ascribe unto the Supreme God any corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Form, is the same thing as to Worship a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Being, for so is every corporeal Substance.</p>
            <p>This is, I say, the true and only Notion of
<hi>Idolatry:</hi> And all the Strange Gods mentioned in
the Scripture, are only some most glorious Pieces
of the visible Creation, as I shall prove at large
from undeniable Testimonies. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it was, that the very Angels, by whom this
Affair was immediately transacted, never made
any appearance in any visible Shape, but only in
a <hi>Cloud,</hi> or in a <hi>Glory,</hi> to prevent the very <hi>Peril of
Idolatry;</hi> and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> in his dying and
farewel Speech, reminds them over and over, that
<hi>at Horeb they heard the Voice of God, but saw no Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi>
with this Application to them, <hi>lest you
corrupt your selves,</hi> i. e. by believing that there can
be any Similitude of the Supreme Godhead. And
as this is the literal and plain Sense of the two
first Commandments, so it seems to be the only
Design of the Third and Fourth: For the English
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55847:43"/>
of the Third, if it were rightly translated, runs
thus; <hi>Thou shalt not give the Name of the Lord thy
God to a Vanity or Idol;</hi> and so the <hi>Septuagint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it: For the Word Vanity and Idol are Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
in Scripture, because an Idol is a vain
and empty Thing that represents nothing; for
when it is set up as the Symbol and Image of a
Deity that is no Deity, it is the Image of nothing,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> defines it. So that it is not the meer
Image it self that is the Idol, but the Image as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
a false God, tho it be only a Symbol,
and not a Picture of him, as most of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Images were, of the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the <hi>Calf,</hi> and
the <hi>Ram.</hi> These are the Vanities or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of False Gods in Use, at that time, among
the Neighbour Nations, that seem to be here
properly interdicted in this Commandment.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Fourth</hi> Commandment, it is the
very Sacrament of the Worship of the true God,
the Creator of Heaven and Earth, in opposition
to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or the Worship of his Creatures,
and therefore is prescribed, as it were, as the
Holy Day of the Creation, continually to mind
the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the God that they Worship, was
the God that made the World, and all the Gods
that their Neighbours worshiped, particularly
the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> his Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55847:43"/>
This then being set up as the great Festival, of
the Creator of Heaven and Earth, from hence
it was that the Precept of not Worshiping of
Idols, and Keeping the Sabbath, are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
coupled together in Scripture; and that
the Breach of the Sabbath is punished in the
same manner as <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>But I shall treat of this more largely when I
come to a Review. At present I have only given
a narrow Prospect of the whole matter, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a full and open View of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> History,
it will appear in full and undeniable Evidence, by
these Two Considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If we consider the great Propensity of
the <hi>Israelites</hi> to renounce the Worship of the One
True Invisible God, and to return to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Worship of Idol Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we consider that these Gods were
nothing else but the Heavenly Bodies, and that
the <hi>Sun</hi> was worshiped as the Supreme De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
            <p>As to the first, their continual Revolts, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
against that Almighty God, of whose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they had had so much Experience, could proceed
from nothing less than the most inveterate and
invincible Prejudices. Their whole History from
their first Deliverance to their last Captivity, is
nothing but a perpetual Series of Disloyalty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the God of <hi>Israel, to play the Harlot</hi> (as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55847:44"/>
the Scripture expresses it) <hi>or commit Fornication
with the Idols of the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 78. We have an acurate Epitome of this
whole History, the Miracles that God wrought for
them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Wilderness, in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
notwithstanding all which, as they made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Attempts of Rebellion, so they at last sunk
into an universal Apostacy, <hi>v. 58. Provoking him to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with their High Places, and moving him to Iealousie
with their Graven Images;</hi> so that at length he gave
them up into the Hands of their Enemies: And
first the Ten Tribes were lead away Captive, and
not long after the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
follows in the same Psalm, <hi>God was wroth,
and greatly abhorred Israel, so that he forsook the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of Shiloh, the Tent which he placed among
Men, and delivered his Strength into Captivity, and
his Glory</hi> (that was the Symbol of his Divine
Presence) <hi>into the Enemies hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Trace a few Particulars. The first
Opportunity they could gain in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
after the miraculous Deliverance out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Absence of <hi>Moses,</hi> they set up and
worshiped the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> a Form of Worship
they were accustomed to in <hi>Egypt:</hi> what this Idol
was, is variously disputed by Learned Men; some
will have it to have been made in Imitation of
the <hi>Cherubin,</hi> when as yet God had made no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of them. Others, and almost all the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55847:44"/>
learn'd, will have it to have been the Idol of
<hi>Apis,</hi> or <hi>Serapis,</hi> or <hi>Osyris,</hi> whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
worshiped by that Symbol; and that it was the
same Idol, is certain; but I take it to be much
more antient, for as yet we find not any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of Divine Worship given to Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
That Folly is of a much younger Date,
and seems to have been brought in purely by the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Vanity, to derive the Originals of all
Nations from Themselves, and to People Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with their own Country-men.</p>
            <p>Thus they tell us, that this <hi>Apis</hi> was King
of the <hi>Argives,</hi> natural Son to King <hi>Iupiter</hi> by
<hi>Niobe,</hi> who marrying <hi>Isis,</hi> left his Kingdom, and
went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> who teaching the Barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Civility, and the Art of dressing Vines and
Agriculture, He was by common consent chosen
their King; and after he had Reign'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Wisdom and Mercy, to the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the Nation, when he dyed, they
deify'd him, and worshiped him under the Image
of a <hi>Calf</hi> or <hi>Ox,</hi> all which is pure <hi>Grecian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Egypt</hi> had been a famous Nation many
Hundred Ages, before any of the <hi>Grecian Deities</hi>
were born: It was a flourishing Kingdom in the
days of <hi>Abraham:</hi> I am sure they knew how to
dress their Vines, and plow their Fields, before
there was any such Nation as <hi>Greece,</hi> or any of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55847:45"/>
its Cantons known by any Records: There was
no News of them till the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and that
is the thing objected by all Writers to the
<hi>Greeks</hi> both before and since Christianity, that
their remotest Antiquity is meer Novelty in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and is confest, by their
own best and most antient Writers; at least in
these Antient Times, there were no Men nor
Women Deities, Gods or Goddesses.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Greeks</hi> had stollen their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Eastern Nations, in requital they
furnished them with Gods of their own, and
clapt the Heads of one of their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
upon every antient Idol, thereby gaining
Reputation of Antiquity, both to their Nation
and Religion, as if they had been as antient as
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Oriental</hi> Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Thus they fasten this old Idol of the Golden
Calf upon King <hi>Apis,</hi> whereas if there ever were
any such Man (for the <hi>Greeks</hi> have neither Faith nor
Knowledge enough to be believ'd one Word in any
matter of Antiquity, either of their own, or
other Nations) he was born many Ages after this
Idol had been Famous in the World: And in that
unknown Interval of which there are no Historical
Records, and therefore the whole Story of him,
as well as of all the other <hi>Grecian</hi> Gods, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Fable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55847:45"/>
And much more probable it is, that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
were so far from bringing a God <hi>Apis</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
that they carried the very word thence: <hi>Apis</hi>
being the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Word to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a <hi>Calf,</hi> or a <hi>Bullock,</hi> and so it is rendred by the
<hi>Septuagint. Ieremiah</hi> 46. 15. in the Prophetick
Burthen against <hi>Egypt,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Why are thy valiant Men swept away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Calf can be nothing else than an
Old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idol, or Symbol of some Deity, that
they had been accustomed to Worship. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinking themselves betray'd or deserted by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
after Forty Days Absence, <hi>(as for this Moses, the
Man that brought us up out of the Land of Egypt, we
wot not what is become of him)</hi> they force <hi>Aaron</hi> to
restore to them the Symbols of their Old Gods to
go before them, instead of this new God, that
now seem'd to have deserted them, and to those
they ascribe their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and
this is the first chearful Act of Devotion, that
they seem to have perform'd since their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
For as for all their Worship of the True
God, especially at the Delivery of the Law, it
seems to be forc'd and uneasie, to which they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55847:46"/>
were rather over-aw'd by dreadful Appearances,
than inclin'd by their own Choice.</p>
            <p>And the Solemn Sacrifice that was made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after, was the Act of <hi>Moses,</hi> rather
than the People, who rather seem'd Spectators,
than Actors; and therefore as soon as they thought
themselves quit of him (which was immediately
after) they set up their Idol, and were transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Devotions towards it, to a Degree of
madness <hi>They rose up early in the Morning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and
offered Burnt-Offerings, and brought Peace-Offerings,
and the People sat down to eat and drink, and rose up
to play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Solemnity had been endear'd to them by
Custom and Education, and there could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ground of their great Joy, than that they
were restored to the Exercise of their former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Worship of their Old Gods, of
which the <hi>Calf</hi> was one of the most eminent
Symbols, so that when they say that was the
God that deliver'd them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their
meaning is, the God of which That was the
<hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Representation,</hi> according to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of those Times,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 30.</note> and indeed of the whole
Old Testament, to give the Name of the <hi>Deity</hi>
to the <hi>Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at that time we find no other mention
of any other Deities, than the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Heavenly
Bodies;</hi> so that this <hi>Calf</hi> could be the Symbol of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55847:46"/>
no other Gods than the Sun, and therefore was
ever reckoned among their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their <hi>holy
Animals,</hi> as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest and Antiquary
<hi>Manetho</hi> informs us, of which <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Taurus</hi>
were the chiefest, and both of them consecrated
in honour of the <hi>Sun,</hi> being the two first Signs
in the Heavens; but the Festival of <hi>Aries</hi> was
the most Solemn, when the Sun entring into
that Sign, began the Joyful New Year. In Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were commanded
to cut the Throat of the Paschal Ram upon that
very Day, with all the Ceremonies of Contempt,
as shall appear more afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This invincible Obstinacy in their Old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
notwithstanding the mighty Works God
had wrought for their Deliverance, is severely
upbraided to them long after by God himself to
his Prophet</hi> Amos,<note place="margin">Chap. 25, 26.</note> Have ye offered unto me Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Offerings in the Wilderness Forty Years, O
House of Israel? But ye have born the Tabernacle
of your <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the Star of your God <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,</hi>
and their Images which ye made to your
selves.</p>
            <p>This is a plain Description of their great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
to the Worship of the True God in
the Wilderness, when God declares, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
they never Worshiped him at all, but
stuck close to their old God <hi>Moloch,</hi> which is but
a Synonymous Word for the God <hi>Baal,</hi> i. e. the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55847:47"/>
Sun, and therefore they are promiscuously us'd
in Scripture to express one and the same Deity.
Thus <hi>Ieremy, 19. 5. They have built the High
Places of Baal to burn their Sons in the Fire for
Burnt Offerings unto Baal.</hi> But Chapter the 32. <hi>v.</hi>
35. the same Crime is thus express, <hi>They built the
High Places of Baal to cause their Sons and Daughters
to pass through the Fire unto Moloch;</hi> by which it is
undeniably evident, that they were but Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Terms for one and the same God; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are Words of the same Signification,
denoting Supreme or Kingly Power, and so were
appropriated by them to the Sun, as Sovereign
Lord of the Universe.</p>
            <p>This strange Inclination of the <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
or the Worship of <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> is so
vehemently upbraided to them in the Scripture, as
shews it to have been inveterate and impetuous
beyond Example: So God himself upbraids it to
them, that when he did such mighty things for
them in their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and only
required them to renounce the Idols of <hi>Egypt, Yet
they rebelled against me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and would not hearken to me;
They cast not away the Abomination of their Eyes, nor
the Idols of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when</hi> Ioshua <hi>had setled them in the Holy
Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 14.</note> 
               <hi>he forewarns them to serve the True God
sincerely,</hi> and to put away the Gods which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
served on the other side the Flood, and in <hi>Egypt.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55847:47"/>
By which it appears, they had not yet parted
with their Old Gods: but the next Generation
made a total Revolt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 2. 11.</note> and the Children of Israel
did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served <hi>Baalim,</hi>
and they forsook the Lord God of their Fathers, which
brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and followed
other Gods, of the Gods of the People that are round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and bowed themselves unto them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the Lord to Anger, and they forsook the Lord, and
serv'd <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashteroth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This whole Book is nothing else but a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of their Sin by Idolatry, their Punishment
by Captivity, their Repentance by imploring of
the Mercy of the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>till at last after so
many Relapses, they are thus answered by God in
their Addresses and Supplications unto him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 10. 10.</note> And
the Children of Israel cryed unto the Lord, saying; We
have sinned against thee, both because we have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our God, and also served <hi>Baalim:</hi> And the Lord
said unto the Children of Israel, did not I deliver you
from the Egyptians, from the Ammorites, from the
Children of Ammon, from the Philistins? Also the
Zidonians and the Amalekites and Maonites did oppress
you, and you cry'd to me, and I delivered you out of
their hand, yet you have forsaken me, and served other
Gods, wherefore I will deliver you no more: go and cry
unto the Gods that ye have chosen, let them deliver you
in the time of your Tribulations. <hi>But upon their
Reformation they are delivered, and as soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55847:48"/>
of which a Train of Instances are to be
seen in that Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here it may be observ'd all along that the
Scripture Notion of</hi> Idolatry <hi>is</hi> renouncing <hi>and</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the True God, <hi>to Worship</hi> other Gods, <hi>or</hi>
Baalim, <hi>that is,</hi> Idols <hi>of the</hi> Sun, <hi>whom they
commonly call'd the</hi> King of Heaven. <hi>And so they
sin on, till God suffered his own</hi> Ark <hi>(the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of his own Presence) to be carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:
They apply themselves to</hi> Samuel <hi>to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for them;</hi> Samuel <hi>returns them the old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that God himself had often made,</hi> If ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the Lord with all your Hearts,<note place="margin">Sam. 7. 3, 4.</note> then put away
the strange Gods, and <hi>Ashteroth</hi> from among you, and
prepare your Hearts unto the Lord, and serve him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and he will deliver you out of the Hands of the
Philistins: Then the Children of Israel put away
<hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashteroth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> and served the Lord only.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Samuel</hi> at the resigning of his Government,
upon the Election of <hi>Saul,</hi> upbraids them with
their continual Ingratitude against the Lord their
God, from their first Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
to that very Day, <hi>in for saking the Lord to serve Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim.</hi>
So plain is the practical Notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi>
through the whole Sacred History.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Under the pious Reigns of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon
<hi>the Sin of Idolatry was competently well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd,
till the Dotage of</hi> Solomon, <hi>when his
Wives and Concubines turn'd away his Heart after
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55847:48"/>
other Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 11. 4, 5.</note> So that Solomon went after <hi>Ashteroth</hi> the
Goddess of the Zidonians, and after <hi>Milcom</hi> the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Ammonites. <hi>But the great Revolt
was made by</hi> Ieroboam, <hi>upon the Division of the
Kingdom, tho rather upon a</hi> Political <hi>than</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Account.</hi> Ieroboam said in his Heart,<note place="margin">1 King. 12. 16.</note> now shall
the Kingdom return to the House of David, if this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
go up to do Sacrifice in the House of the Lord at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;
<hi>whereupon he makes two Calves of
Gold, and said to the People,</hi> It is too much for you
to go up to Ierusalem, behold thy Gods, O Israel, which
brought thee up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was only an Artifice to oblige the People to
himself by restoring to them their old Egyptian
Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some will have these Calves to have been set
up in Imitation of</hi> Solomon<hi>'s</hi> Cherubin, <hi>but this is
fully confuted by the learned</hi> Visorius. If Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
saith he,<note place="margin">Vide Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> p. 773.</note> by his Calves design'd to imitate the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Religion of his Country, I pray you when he took
these counterfeit <hi>Cherubs,</hi> why not also the <hi>Ark,</hi> the
<hi>Propitiatory,</hi> the Seat of God, where the Divine
Majesty appear'd most conspicuously in giving of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>Temple?</hi> Why if they
were made only in imitation of the Cherubs, why did
he not call them by their own Name, by which they
were known to the People, when that would have been
a more easie way to deceive them? Why did he not
take the Priests of the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> why did
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55847:49"/>
he banish them out of his Kingdom, why did not the
People comply for three whole Years, if it had been
an Imitation of their Old Religion under <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon?</hi>
Why if they were nothing but <hi>Cherubins,</hi>
are they so often in Scripture styled other Gods? Why
should he Sacrifice to them, when in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
no Sacrifices were offered to the <hi>Cherubim?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is plain that these Calves were set up
by him as Idols or Symbols of a new or separate
Religion from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and tho he
took up the old Egyptian Idol for his Foundation,
yet he seem'd to have erected a Motley Religion
upon it, like that of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> of old, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to invite the People of all Nations into his
Kingdom, where every Man worshiped his own
God; and partly by diversity of Religion, more
effectually to divide his own Kingdom from that
of the Line of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho not long after <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and the Tribe of
<hi>Iudah</hi> revolt from the Worship of the true God
(as the Scripture aggravates it) <hi>above all that their
Fathers had done.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 14. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And from this time Idolatry, or the Worship
of <hi>Baal,</hi> was the prevailing Religion in both
Kingdoms, tho sometimes check'd by the Piety
of reforming Princes. But it spread so fast, that
<hi>Elijah</hi> thought himself left alone, tho for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
God informed him, that he had the small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55847:49"/>
of 7000 in <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 14, 18.</note> 
               <hi>all the Knees which have
not bowed unto Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Infection soon became universal, and
tho God Almighty sent his Prophets from time to
time to reclaim them, yet all in vain, they still
continued to worship the <hi>Host of Heaven,</hi> and serve
<hi>Baal,</hi> till finding them irreclaimable, he first
delivered the Ten Tribes into the hands of <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneser,</hi>
King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> where they continue in
Captivity to this Day,<note place="margin">2 King. 17.</note> and are a lost Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Piety of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>at that time for a
while repriev'd the Tribe of</hi> Iudah: <hi>But his Son</hi>
Manasseh <hi>built up again the High Places, which</hi>
Hezekiah <hi>his Father had destroyed,</hi> and he rear'd up
Altars for Baal, and worshiped all the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and served them: <hi>Upon this God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
denounces their Destruction.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> Because, <hi>saith
he,</hi> they have ever done that which was evil in my
sight, and have provoked me to Anger since the Day
their Fathers came forth out of Egypt, unto this Day;
or because they have forsaken me,<note place="margin">Cap. 22. 17.</note> and burnt Incense un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other Gods, that they might provoke me to Anger
with all the work of their Hands; therefore my wrath
shall be kindled against them, and shall not be quenched.
<hi>But the Execution of the Sentence is suspended
during the pious Reign of his Son</hi> Iosiah;<note place="margin">2 King. 25.</note> 
               <hi>but
as soon as he is gathered to his Fathers,</hi> Ierusalem
<hi>and the Temple are destroyed by</hi> Nebuchadnezzar,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55847:50"/>
               <hi>and King</hi> Zedekiah <hi>with all his People are carried
Captive into</hi> Babylon.</p>
            <p>This is a compendious History of the old
Jewish Idolatry, and I think a sufficient Proof both
of their strange Inclination to it, to the highest
degree of Madness, and wherein it plainly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
their forsaking the <hi>true invisible God,</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>created</hi> Deities; than which nothing is more
evident through the whole Series of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this Evidence I might add a more ample
Proof out of the Writings of the Prophets, that
are almost wholly imployed upon this Subject.
But I must not be too tedious, and therefore I
shall only observe, that they generally express the
greatness of this Folly under the Figure of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable
Lust. Thus</hi> Ezekiel <hi>the</hi> 23d. <hi>God
describes it to the Prophet under this Scheme.</hi>
Son of man, there were two Women, the Daughters of
one Mother, and they committed Whoredoms in Egypt,
they committed Whoredoms in their Youth; there were
their Breasts pressed, and there they bruised the Teats
of their Virginity; and the Names of them were <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
the Elder, and <hi>Aholibah</hi> her Sister, and they were
mine, and they bare Sons and Daughters; <hi>Samaria</hi>
is <hi>Ahola,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem Aholibah;</hi> and <hi>Ahola</hi>
played the Harlot when she was mine, and she doted <hi>(or
run mad)</hi> for her Lovers, the Assyrians her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
with all their Idols she defiled her self, neither
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55847:50"/>
left she her Whoredoms brought from Egypt; for in her
Youth <hi>('tis in the Hebrew) before she was ripe of
Age,</hi> they lay with her, and they bruis'd the Breasts
of her Virginity, and poured their Whoredom upon her;
wherefore I have delivered her into the Hand of her
Lovers, into the Hand of the Assyrians, upon whom
she doted, <hi>and after whom she ran mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same is repeated of her Sister <hi>Aholibah,</hi>
who for her incorrigible Adulteries is delivered
into the hands of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> nothing can be
expressed with greater vehemence than this, that
is compared to the utmost lewdness of Female
Lust; and nothing more evident, than that this
Lewdness consisted in deserting the true invisible
God, to worship the false Deities of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
particularly the Gods of the <hi>Egyptians,
Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that is my Second Head of Discourse, that
the Gods that they worshiped at that time were
nothing but the Heavenly Bodies, or the Sun, as
the Supreme Deity. This is evident enough
from what hath already been discoursed,</hi> Idolatry
<hi>in general being every where described in Scripture
by the Worship of the</hi> Host of Heaven, <hi>or</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies. <hi>Thus</hi> Deut. 4. 19. Lest thou lift up
thine Eyes to Heaven, and when thou seest the <hi>Sun</hi>
and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> even all the Host of
Heaven, shouldst be driven <hi>(tempted)</hi> to worship them,
which the Lord thy God created for the use and benefit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55847:51"/>
of all Nations under the whole Heaven. <hi>So</hi> Chap. 17.
v. 2, 3. If there be found any among you that have
wrought Wickedness in the sight of the Lord your God in
transgressing his Covenant, and hath gone and served
other Gods, and worshiped them, either the Sun, or
Moon, or any of the Host of Heaven, ye shall stone
him to Death, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 16. They left all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of the Lord their God, and made them Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Images, two Calves, and made a Grove, and
worshiped all the Host of Heaven, and served Baal.
<hi>So</hi> Manasseh <hi>erected</hi> Altars to Ball, and worshiped
the Host of Heaven, <hi>chap. 21. 3. So</hi> Iosiah, <hi>when
he destroyed Idolatry,</hi> brought out the Vessels of the
Host of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Jews, when after their return from
Captivity, they would enter their solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
against Idolatry, they do it in this form—</hi>
Thou even Thou art Lord alone, <hi>thou hast</hi> made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Heaven of Heavens, with all their Host, <hi>&amp;c.
Nehemiah 9. 6. So Jeremiah</hi> 19. 13. Ierusalem
and Iudah shall be destroyed because they have burned
Incense unto all the Host of Heaven, and have poured out
Drink Offerings unto other Gods. <hi>So Zephaniah 1.
5. God threatens to destroy the</hi> Worshipers of Baal,
and of the Host of Heaven: <hi>And lastly, St.</hi> Stephen
<hi>in his last Speech upbraiding the Jews with
their Idolatry, says, that</hi> God gave them up to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Host of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:55847:51"/>
               <hi>So evident is the Practical</hi> Notion <hi>of</hi> Idolatry,
<hi>through the whole Series of Scripture, that it
was the worshiping the Heavenly Bodies as the</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Deities, <hi>or as</hi> Iob <hi>emphatically expresses it,</hi>
Chap. 31. ver. 26. If I beheld the Sun when it shin'd, or
the Moon walking in brightness, and my Heart hath
been secretly enticed, or my Mouth hath kissed my Hand,
this also were an Iniquity to be punished by the Iudge,
for I should have denyed the most High God.</p>
            <p>What can be more plain than this Definition
of Idolatry, that it is the Worship of the <hi>Sun</hi>
and <hi>Moon,</hi> because it would have excluded the
Worship due only to the most <hi>High God?</hi> And
the very Word, that we commonly translate <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
in general, signifies properly Images of the
<hi>Sun.</hi> Thus <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. 30. God threatens them
<hi>I will destroy your Images,</hi> as we translate it; but
in the Hebrew your <hi>Chamanim,</hi> i.e. Images of the
<hi>Sun.</hi> So the second of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> chap. 34. <hi>v.</hi> 7.
And so it is set sometimes in the Margent even in
the English Translation <hi>[or Sun Images]</hi> as <hi>Isaiah</hi>
17. 8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>And so all learned Men of all Nations, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
ever understood the old Notion of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
till this last Age, when Folly and Passion
cast it at any thing that peevish Men were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with.<note place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3.</note> So <hi>Rabbi Maimon,</hi> the most learned
and judicious of the Jewish Doctors, discourses
at large, that the antient Idolatry was nothing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55847:52"/>
but the Religion of the Eastern Nations, who
acnowledge no other Deities but the Stars,
among whom the Sun was supreme, in <hi>Opposition</hi>
to which false Principle, he says, God enacted the
<hi>Law of Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the sense of all the other old Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Nations, as may be seen at large in <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s
Collections of their several Opinions in his First
and Third Book of the <hi>Preparation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
where he proves, that the antient Heathens
worshiped only the <hi>Stars,</hi> without any Notion
of <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Demons.</hi> The same is attested by
all the Historians; by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> of the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> by <hi>Herodotus</hi> of the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Iustin</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
of the <hi>Germans;</hi> so <hi>Macrobius,</hi> in his first
Book <hi>Saturnal,</hi> proves it of all the antient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
that it was the Worship of the Sun as
the supreme Deity. So in the antient Hymn to
<hi>Iupiter</hi> ascribed to <hi>Orpheus,</hi> it is the Sun only that
is all along adored.</p>
            <p>In short, so all learned Men interpret all the
several Idols that we read of in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
particularly those two learned Protestants,
Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in his learned Book <hi>De Diis Syris;</hi>
and <hi>Gerard Vossius, de Idololatria,</hi> proves all the Idols
mentioned in Scripture to have been only so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
several Appellations of the Sun, whom the
antient Idolaters believ'd to have been the supreme
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55847:52"/>
God and Creator of the World, as <hi>Baal, Baal
Peor, Bel, Moloch, Dagon, Baalzebub Mythras,</hi>
&amp;c. In a Word, the whole Nation of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
that agree in nothing else, are unanimous
here; tho indeed the thing is so evident in all the
Accounts, Histories and Descriptions of the
Antient Idolatry, that it is to me the greatest
astonishment in the World, that Men should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to any other purpose.</p>
            <p>I know there was another sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
afterward, the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi>
but I find no such Practice in the Scriptures, but
take it to have been much more modern, and a
meer Invention of the vain and lying <hi>Greeks;</hi> but
whensoever it came in, it was grafted upon
the old Stock, of giving the Worship of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, not only to <hi>created,</hi> but to <hi>mortal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it were easie to wander into a large Field
of Mythologick Mystery; but besides that, I take all
Mythology to be much more Fable than the literal
Fable it self: I have resolved to confine my self
to the Information of the Holy Scriptures, from
whence, as we have the most infallible Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that can be had, so in this case we can have no
other, all other Writings whatsoever being by
some Thousands of Years too modern to give any
Account from their own Knowledge of those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Times.</p>

And for a more acurate account of this, I shall
refer the Reader to that admirable Book of Dr.
<hi>Spencers,</hi> concerning the Jewish Laws and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of them, in which he proves every Minute
Circumstance of the ritual and ceremonial Law
to have been enacted only for the prevention of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Sun-Worship.</hi> There any Gentleman
that delights in antient Learning, may have his
glut of Pleasure and Satisfaction; for beside the
great Compass and Variety of polite Literature,
he hath brought Wit, Sense, Reason and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
into the <hi>Synagogue.</hi> I will only exemplifie
the thing in some few Particulars.</p>
            <p>The first is the Institution of some Rites pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to God's own Worship, both as a Bar to
preserve them from any other Worship, in which
those Rites were not us'd, and as an Obligation to
bind them the faster to their Duty to himself;
among these the chiefest are <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> which he instituted, as it were, the <hi>two
Sacraments</hi> of the Jewish Religion, or the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Creator of Heaven and Earth, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them from their Neighbour Nations,
who Worship only his Creatures.</p>
            <p>With Circumcision God sign'd his Covenant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was the first Revelation
of himself against Idolatry, and the Foundation of
the whole <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, which was seal'd to, by
this sacred Rite of Circumcision; so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55847:53"/>
it, they were esteemed no better than <hi>Idolaters,</hi>
and an <hi>uncircumcised Man</hi> signifies no less than an
<hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reason is expresly given by God himself
at the first Institution of it in his Covenant with
<hi>Abraham:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7, 10.</note> 
               <hi>I will establish my Covenant between thee
and me, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations
for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto Thee,
and to thy seed after thee. This is my Covenant which
ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after
thee, every Male Child among you shall be Circumcised.
And you shall circumcise the Flesh of your Fore-skin,
and it shall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt you and
me; and therefore the uncircumcised shall be cut off
from his People, as having broken my Covenant,</hi> i.e.
renounced the true Religion, which is, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
observes, not reasonably to be understood of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
but of Men grown to Years of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whose Parents had neglected that Office in
their Infancy, and therefore if they did not supply
that Defect, when they came to Age, it was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as renouncing the Worship of the true
God, of which this was the first Sacrament or
Ceremony of Admission into the Jewish Church,
which alone profess'd it, and that is the Reason of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Assertion,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Every Man that is circumcised,
is a Debtor to do the whole Law,</hi> i.e. he that willingly
and knowingly undergoes this initiating Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
by Vertue of that he obliges himself to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55847:54"/>
Observation of the whole <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, and all
things commanded in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for this Reason no Proselyte was admitted
to the Paschal Festival, the most sacred Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Jewish Religion, without Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 48.</note>
When a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and
will keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his Males
be circumcised, and then let him come near, and keep it,
and he shall be as one that is born in the Land; for no
uncircumcised Person shall eat thereof.</p>
            <p>This seems to be the meaning of that Passage,
<hi>Ioshua</hi> 5. 9. when God commanded <hi>Ioshua</hi> to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise
all the People, that were born in the
Wilderness, and that indeed is all then living;
for those that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were dead, and
when <hi>Ioshua</hi> had done it, <hi>God tells him, This day
have I rolled away the Reproach of</hi> Egypt <hi>from off you;</hi>
the Reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> was their Idolatry, which
they had now renounced by the Sacrament of
Circumcision. And accordingly in the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> to abolish the Jewish
Religion,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. v. 15, 48, 60 61.</note> and establish Idolatry, the Jews are
commanded to leave their Children uncircumcis'd;
and the Apostates endeavoured to blot out the
Marks of their Circumcisioni; and certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that had taken care to circumcise their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>were put to Death, and the Infants hanged about
their Necks.</hi> That was the distinctive Mark
through all Ages between a Worshiper of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55847:54"/>
true God and an Idolater. So that it was the
same thing, not to be circumcised, and to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statise
to Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The second, and indeed the greatest Bar of all
against Idolatry, was the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
in memory of Gods Creation of the whole visible
World, and for that reason this Doctrine of the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> was reputed as fundamental an Article
in the Jewish Church, as the Doctrine of the
<hi>Cross</hi> in the Christian, because all other Articles
of their Religion depended upon the belief of
their God's Creation of the World.</p>
            <p>And therefore when God had given <hi>Moses</hi> a
compleat Body of Laws for his own Worship,
he ratifies, and as it were comprises them all in a
vehement and reiterated pressing that one Law of
the Sabbath, <hi>Exod. 31. v.</hi> 12. to the end of the
Chapter. And after the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had
committed Idolatry in worshiping the Golden
Calf, for which God had for some time cast them
off, he is at last prevailed upon by <hi>Moses</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his Covenant with them upon a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
First, That they worship none of the
<hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> nor ever use any of
their <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And then that they be
more careful to observe the <hi>Passover</hi> and the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
Exod.</hi> 34. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55847:55"/>
And the Observation of the Sabbath is again
enforced in the very beginning of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the Bond and Epitome of the whole Law,
<hi>And Moses gathered all the Congregation of the Children
of Israel together, and said unto them, these are the words
which the Lord hath commanded that ye should do
them, Six days shall work be done, but on the Seventh
day, there shall be to you a Holy day, a Sabbath of rest
to the Lord, whosoever doth work therein shall be put to
death;</hi> As if the Sabbath alone were the whole
Law, according to that Saying of the <hi>Talmud,
Whosoever denies the Sabbath, denies the whole Law.</hi>
Because that's an Acknowledgment of the Creator
of the World, as the Author of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law.
And for that reason the Almighty upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
styles himself in Scripture, <hi>Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth,</hi> which we (improperly enough)
translate <hi>Possessor</hi> of Heaven and Earth; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the History of the Creation it self, and the
whole Pentateuch, seem to have been written on
purpose to prevent Idolatry, or the Worship of
Created Beings; and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> doth not set
down the Creation of the Universe in gross, but
of every part by it self, particularly of the Sun,
Moon, and Stars. And that is in it self a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Security against giving them that were
meer Creatures, the Worship that is only due to
the Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55847:55"/>
And this seems to be the reason of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
form of words in the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, for
in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the seventh day;</hi> As if he had said, be sure
that you be particularly mindful of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Sabbath above all others, for it is a
Day dedicated to the Eternal Memory of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and therefore enjoyn'd to be observ'd every
Seventh Day, that it may continually bring to
mind that great work, and never suffer it to decay
out of thy Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And from hence it is that the Precepts of not
worshiping Idols, and observing the Sabbath, are
so frequently coupled together in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as if they were inseparable.</hi> Exod. 23. 12,
13. Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh
day thou shalt rest, and make no mention of the Names
of other Gods, neither let them be heard out of thy
mouth. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 34. Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, I
am Iehovah your God; turn ye not unto Idols, nor make
to your selves molten Gods: I am the Lord your
God. <hi>Levit. 26. 1, 2.</hi> Ye shall make ye no Idols, ye shall
keep my Sabbaths. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 18, 20. Walk ye not in
the statutes of your Fathers, nor defile your selves
with your Idols, and hollow my Sabbaths that are for a
sign between you and me, that you may know that I am
Iehovah your God; for their hearts went after their
Idols: <hi>so</hi> v. 24. they polluted my Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55847:56"/>
And as these Commands are so frequently joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, so is the violation of them, as if
they could not be parted, <hi>Ezek. 20. 16. They pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their Fathers
Idols.</hi> And King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when he set up Idolatry,
he in Contempt turn'd the <hi>Covert for the Sabbath out
of the House of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 16. 18.</note> 1 Mac. 1. 44. <hi>And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the People consented to the command of the King,
and sacrificed to Idols, and prophaned the Sabbath.</hi> So
necessary was it for the observation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and the Worship of the true God, to run
the same Fate, or stand and fall together; because
the Sabbath was instituted in memory of the
Creation of the World by the true God; and
therefore the belief and observation of it, was an
open Defyance to all Idolatry, as the Psalmist
joyns them together,<note place="margin">Psal. 96. 5.</note> 
               <hi>All the Gods of the Heathens
are Idols: But the Lord made the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is the distinctive Character that God
hath given between himself, the only true God,
and the Heathen Idols or Vanities;</hi> The Gods that
have not made the Heavens and the Earth shall perish
from the Earth,<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 11, 12.</note> and from under the Heavens. The
Lord hath made the Earth by his Power, he hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Universe by his Wisdom, and hath stretched
out the Heavens by his Discretion.</p>
            <p>Now the Observation of the Sabbath, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in honour of the invisible Creator of the
visible or material World, being the fundamental
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55847:56"/>
Article of Faith in the Jewish Church, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Idolatry, or giving the Worship of the
supreme Deity to created Beings, it is for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more frequently recited than any other Law,
and its Breach as severely punished as Idolatry it
self; the recital of this Command is almost half
of the Law and the Prophets, and the violation
of it certain Death, as a Crime of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Idolatry it self. So evident is it through
the whole Series of sacred History that the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was instituted in opposition to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
that the Idolatry it was opposed to, was the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of created Beings as the supreme uncreated
Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude this Argument, tho I designed
to confine my self to the Testimony of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, that is the only competent Witness
in the case; yet I find such a pregnant Passage cited
out of St.</hi> Cyril <hi>of</hi> Alexandria <hi>to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
with the Premises, from his own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Train of Scripture History, that it
were great pity to rob the Reader of so fair an
Authority,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 6. de fest. Pasch.</note> 
               <q>After the Israelites, <hi>(says he)</hi> left their
own Country to sojourn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in process of time
they lost all memory of their Ancestors, and descent
from the Line of <hi>Abraham;</hi> so that their antient
Customs being worn out by degrees, and the Religion of
their Forefathers disus'd, they were at length debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by conversation with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to Idolatry, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55847:57"/>
gave the worship of the supreme God to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
under him to the <hi>Heavens, Earth, Moon, Stars.</hi>
And therefore when God delivered them out of their
Egyptian Bondage, to bring them to the promised
Land, he peremptorily commands them to discard all
their <hi>Egyptian Errors;</hi> but because there was need
of an evident sign, by which they should, as it were,
be forced to confess, that Heaven was made by his
Almighty Power; and that the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, and all other Beings, were the works of his
hands, he commands the <hi>Festival</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
as a <hi>Memorial</hi> and <hi>Imitation</hi> of himself and his
work; and therefore they that devote themselves to
rest as their Creator rested, by that acknowledge, that
all other things were the product of his Power; and
that is the natural design of the Sabbath Rest, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them with a sense of the supreme Deity, or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
of all things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the second place, a very great and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law was enacted, purely
in opposition to the Old Heathen Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.
Here I omit the Idolatry of the <hi>Zabii,</hi>
so much of late insisted upon by learned Men,
because I find no antient Footsteps of any such
People in the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mahometan Arabic</hi> Writers are the first that
make any mention of them, and their Divinity (as
the <hi>Arabians</hi> describe it) is a meer Fanatick Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sody
of <hi>Chaldaism,</hi> or <hi>Astrologick Idolatry, Iudaism,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55847:57"/>
or the History of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> turned into <hi>Fables;
Gnosticism,</hi> or the Worship of <hi>Demons</hi> and <hi>Angels;
Pythagorism,</hi> or turning all things into Allegories,
and therefore must be of a much younger Date
than Christianity.</p>
            <p>The first time we read of them, is in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran,</hi>
and <hi>Mahomet</hi> gives them that name of <hi>Zabii,</hi>
because they lay Eastward from <hi>Arabia,</hi> for so the
Word signifies <hi>Easterlings:</hi> Or more probably
from a Fanatick Imitation of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that frequently and commonly styles the
Heathen Idolaters by the Title <hi>of the men of the
East,</hi> i.e. the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who were situated East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>Iudea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him we have no account of any such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as the <hi>Zabii,</hi> till about Eight Hundred Years
since. For the Prophet and his barbarous Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
as they conquered, destroyed all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Learning, till being setled in Peace and
Empire, (as is the manner of all Barbarians) they
betook themselves to the humour of Learning,
and translated Books out of other Languages, not
only <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> but of their Neighbour
Nations into their own Tongue.</p>
            <p>This is the most antient Account, after all the
noise that has been made of their extreme Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that we have of any <hi>Zabian</hi> Writers; so
that setting that Modern Nation aside, the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Rites were instituted in opposition to the more
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55847:58"/>
antient Idolatry of their Neighbour Nations, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> of whom
there was most danger by reason of their late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with the one, and their new conversation
with the other. And therefore against these God
arms them with a special Caution,<note place="margin">Lev. 18. 3.</note> 
               <hi>After the doings
of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do;
and after the doings of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>whether
I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in
their Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This contrariety of the Jews to the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of all other Nations is made use of by</hi> Haman
<hi>to King</hi> Ahasuerus <hi>to procure their Destruction;</hi>
Esther 3. 8. And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, there
is a certain People scattered abroad, and dispersed among
the People in all the Provinces of thy Kingdom, and
their Laws are divers from all People, neither keep
they the Kings Laws; and therefore it is not for
the King's Interest to suffer them. If it please the
King, let it be written that they may be destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is perpetually objected by</hi> Manetho <hi>the
Egyptian Priest against the Jews, that they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at nothing so much in the Rites of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as to affront and reflect Defiance upon the
Egyptian Devotion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. l. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And so</hi> Tacitus <hi>his account
of them is this;</hi> Moses ut sibi in posterum Iudaeorum
gentem firmaret, novos ritus contrariosque caeteris morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus
indidit; Prophana illis omnia, quae apud nos sacra;
rursum concessa apud illos, quae nobis incesta. <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55847:58"/>
that he might the better confirm the Iewish Nation to
himself, instituted new Rites, contrary to the customs
of the rest of Mankind; what is most sacred with us,
is most prophane with them; and what with us is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most abominable, is allowed to them as lawful and
innocent.</p>
            <p>This is the certain ground of that known uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
contempt and hatred of all other Nations
against the Jews: And so that Passage in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
cap. 12. ver. 9. is applyed by <hi>Grotius</hi> to
the Jews, <hi>Mine Heritage is unto me as a speckled
Bird; the Birds round about her are against her: Mine
Inheritance is become like a strange Bird, and is pursued
by all the Birds of the Field;</hi> As when a Bird of a
strange Colour, happens to consort with other
Birds, it is natural for them all to set upon it;
and this was the case of the Jews in reference to
all their Neighbour Nations.</p>
            <p>It were an endless work to recite all the Rites
peculiar to the Jews, and instituted in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Customs of their Neighbours, when
it is the only reason that runs through almost all
their Law, even to the boiling of a Kid or Lamb
in its Dams Milk; to the sowing of divers Seeds
together; plowing with an Ox and an Ass; wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Linsey Woolsey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I shall
only instance in two remarkable particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55847:59"/>
The Institution of the Passover; And the
Law against Sacrificing in High Places, both
which are enjoyn'd as most effectual Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The Passover was the first Law instituted
by God,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 3.</note> at, or upon their Deliverance out of
<hi>Egypt. In the Tenth day of this Month, they shall
take to them every Man a Lamb, a Male of the first
Year, according to the House of their Fathers.</hi> In
the Observation of this great Solemnity, as it is
there prescribed, every the most minute Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is an express defiance to the Egyptian Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
First, the Paschal Lamb must be a Male
a year old, that is, a <hi>young Ram;</hi> and that was
the greatest Affront that could be put upon the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> that held a <hi>Ram</hi> not only in religious
esteem, but the most Sacred of all their <hi>Holy Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>
in more antient times, as the Symbol of the
Sun entring the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> and beginning the
New Year: And afterwards of <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi>
whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> planted upon the Stock of the
Old Egyptian Idol of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Now upon the account of the Sacredness of
these Animals, they never offered any of their
Species in Sacrifice. And hence when <hi>Pharoah</hi>
bid <hi>Moses</hi> go Sacrifice to the Lord in the Land of
<hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 8. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> answers, that they dare not, <hi>Because
it would be an Abomination to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>so that
they would stone them;</hi> that is, it would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55847:59"/>
and open Affront to the Religion of the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> if they should offer in Sacrifice (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the custom of their Fore-fathers) those very
Animals that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had consecrated to the
Honour of their Gods. And for the same reason
they are commanded to Sacrifice the Passover with
a young <hi>Bullock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 2.</note> as well as a young <hi>Ram, out of
the Flock, or out of the Herd,</hi> as the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it. And when King <hi>Iosiah</hi> kept, after a
long intermission,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 7.</note> a most solemn Passover, besides
Lambs and Kids, he gave to the People 3000
Bullocks.</p>
            <p>Now next to a Ram the Bullock was the most
Sacred of all the Holy Animals, and therefore
made the second Sign in the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or later <hi>Egyptians,</hi> gave the
first Symbol to <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> their Supreme
God, they gave the second to <hi>Osyris,</hi> by them
commonly called <hi>Apis</hi> (not understanding that
that word only signifyed the Image, not the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
so that here <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Malice is not much in

They sacrifice a</hi> Ram <hi>in Affront to</hi> Ammon, <hi>and a</hi>
Bullock <hi>in Affront to</hi> Osyris. Beside, it must be a
Male, not a Female, because the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and
Heathens (who indeed generally followed the
Egyptian Customs, especially the <hi>Greeks)</hi> used on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Females in their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55847:60"/>
But the most observable circumstance in this
whole Solemnity, is the time of its Celebration;
the Lamb was to be solemnly set apart for the
Sacrifice on the Tenth Day of the Month,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 36</note> till
the Fourteenth, because on the Tenth Day,
on which the Sun entred the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> began
the great Festival of <hi>Aries,</hi> or the New Year;
so that beginning the Jewish Passover at the same
time, it was a manifest Triumph over the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Deity, by cutting the Throat of the poor
Beast, with as much Solemnity as the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
at that very time worship'd it.</p>
            <p>And for the same reason a Cow that was sacred
to <hi>Isis,</hi> or rather to some more antient Deity, I
suppose the <hi>Moon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 19.</note> was commanded to be driven out
of the Camp, and burnt as an unclean Beast;
and so because the <hi>Egyptians</hi> addressed their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to a Goat, as the Symbol of some Deity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the Sun in that Sign, God commanded
the Jews to make use chiefly of Goats in their
Expiatory Sacrifices, and particularly the Scape
Goat, laden with all the Sins, and all the Curses
of the People; and hence the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
strictly forbidden to Sacrifice to Goats,<note place="margin">Levit. 17. 7.</note> which
we translate Devils: <hi>And they shall no more offer
Sacrifice to Devils, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to Goats, after
whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a
Statute for ever unto them throughout their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55847:60"/>
But to return to the Paschal Ram, all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Institution carry a remarkable
significancy in them: Thus when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to besmear the Side-posts, and upper
Door-posts or Lintal of every House: What
could have been a more publick Contempt of
the Egyptian Religion, when by it they declared,
that the Almighty Power that had prov'd it self
by so many Miracles and Judgments, especially
this Last in the Death of the First-born, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to put all manner of contempt upon those
Creatures that were consecrated to the Worship
of their Gods, and to leave those Bloody Posts
to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as Monuments of their baffled
Deities?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And tho I have no Reverence to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Jewish Rabbies in the account of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, being not only very trifling, but very
modern Writers; yet there is cited an excellent
Passage out of</hi> R. Abraham Seba, <hi>that I cannot
omit to recite, not for its Authors sake, but
its own.</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> began the computation of
their Months from the time that the Sun entred Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
and this whole Month was celebrated with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Festival Solemnity, and was more sacred
than all the Months of the year beside. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
designing to set his People at as great a distance
as could be from the Customs of the Heathens, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to begin the year, not from the Full
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55847:61"/>
Moon, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, but from the first day
of the Month; and whereas the <hi>Egyptians</hi> spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Cattle, and durst not so much as eat
<hi>Rams</hi> Flesh, therefore they are commanded to kill,
roast, and eat it; so that whereas they offer Incense
to it, and perform their Solemn Devotions before it,
these are commanded in contempt to sprinkle the Blood
of this most Holy Animal upon the very Threshold
of their Houses.</q> 
               <hi>So far the Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again they are commanded not to eat the
Paschal Ram raw, in opposition to the Customs
of the antient and barbarous Heathen Nations,
who eat all their Sacrifices raw, especially at their
signing of Covenants and Treaties of Peace;
and that is the original Reason of the Command
to abstain from Blood.</p>
            <p>Then it is to be eaten in <hi>one House,</hi> not to be
eaten abroad in solemn Pomp and Procession, as
the Heathen Priests did their raw Sacrifices. Nor
<hi>a Bone of it to be broken,</hi> because the Heathen Priests
in their pretended holy Rage were wont to tear
their Sacrifices in pieces with their Teeth. The
<hi>Head with the Legs and Purtenance to be eaten,</hi> because
the Heathens only eat the <hi>Viscera,</hi> or Inwards, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it to remain till the morning,</hi> lest it should
be abus'd to superstitious uses, as the Heathens
did the Relicks of their Sacrifices, who sold them
to the People as a Charm against Diseases and ill
Luck.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55847:61"/>
All which circumstances are most particularly
remarkable in the <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> or great Festival
of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> stole out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
as well as all their other Superstitions, as the most
learned of them confess: And concerning the <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalia</hi>
in particular, <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us by whom
they were first brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Greece,
viz.</hi> the famous Physitian <hi>Melampus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the <hi>Passover was not to be sodden in Water,</hi>
becaue the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> always boil their
Sacrifices, especially to <hi>Horus</hi> or the <hi>Sun;</hi> and for
that reason it is, that this little circumstance is so
often urged, and so strictly observ'd. And this
is particularly objected by <hi>Manetho</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
against the Jews, that they were not content only
to destroy their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>their Consecrated Animals,</hi>
but consumed them by Fire, as it were burning
their Gods in Effigie.</p>
            <p>These are the great Reasons, why the Divine
Law-giver laid so much stress upon this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and all the circumstances belonging to it,
when it was the grand Diagnostick, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Character between the Worshipers of
the true God, and of created Deities.</p>
            <p>And therefore upon all Apostasies of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from their Religion, it was the Custom of their
pious Princes to recall them, by reviewing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
the Laws of the Paschal Festival. So <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
when he set himself to abolish all Relicks of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55847:62"/>
Idolatry, and establish the Worship of the true
God for ever: <hi>He commanded all the People, saying,
Keep the Passover unto the Lord your God, as it is
written in the Book of the Covenant. Surely there
was not holden such a Passover from the days of the
Iudges that Iudged Israel, nor of the Kings of Iudea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That was an undenyable Proof of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Reformation.</p>
            <p>The second Law enjoyn'd in opposition to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Egyptian Idolatry, is that against sacrificing upon
High Places, which were Egyptian Altars built
in the form of High Towers, that they might
make nearer approaches to the <hi>Sun</hi> in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And therefore God, on the contrary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the <hi>Israelites</hi> to sacrifice to himself upon a
low Altar of Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24, 26. without
steps or stairs; which Laws were given either
with, or immediately after the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as it seems of equal weight with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that to offer Sacrifices upon High Places, is
always represented in Scripture as a very high Act
of</hi> Idolatry; <hi>and to destroy the High Places in
Scripture as an eminent Act of</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>which must be understood of Towers,
not of Mountains, that are not so easily demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
So</hi> Levit. 26. 30. I will destroy your High
Places, and cut down your Images, <hi>[or Chamanim]</hi>
and cast your Carcases upon the Carcases of your Idols,
and my Soul shall abhor you. <hi>So</hi> Numbers 22. 41.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55847:62"/>
               <hi>Balack</hi> took <hi>Balaam</hi> and brought him up into the High
Places, <hi>or</hi> Pillars, <hi>as the Septuagint always render it
by</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <hi>Baal,</hi> that thence he might see the utmost
part of the People. <hi>So Numb.</hi> 33. 52. Ye shall drive
out all the Inhabitants of the Land before you, destroy all
their Pictures and Molten Images, and pluck down all
their High Places.</p>
            <p>In the Historical and Prophetick Writings, <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
is almost every where exprest by <hi>Sacrificing</hi> or
<hi>Worshiping in High Places.</hi> The Idol Priests are
styled <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>the High Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, says <hi>Herodotus,</hi> was the received Custom
of the antient Nations, and of this Nature were
the Egyptian Pyramids; and that which is still
standing is built in the form of an Altar, <hi>i.e.</hi> a four
square Plane, ten Cubits broad on every side, (not
as it is vulgarly suppos'd, a Point or Spire) to which
the Priest advanced by 250 Ascents, which <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi>
that viewed them above 2000 years ago,
says, were so many lesser Altars. But that the
Pyramids were supposed in the more polite Times,
to have been antient Altars, is evident from that
known Verse of <hi>Luca<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Votaque Pyramidum celsas solvuntur ad Aras.</q>
            <p>There are Monuments of this antient Custom
still remaining in the <hi>West Indies. Gage</hi> in his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
describes such a Tower in the middle of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55847:63"/>
great Temple at <hi>Mexico,</hi> of an 180 Ascents, where
their Priests offered all their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>In short, the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were so fond of
these High Altars, that some Princes, who would
have demolisht them as pieces of Idolatry, were
forced to persist for fear of popular Tumults and
Seditions.<note place="margin">1 King. 15. 14.</note> So <hi>Asa</hi> in his Reformation, when he
burnt their Idols, could not remove their High
Places.<note place="margin">1 King. 22. 43.</note> So <hi>Iehoash</hi> could do every thing, but remove
the High Places.<note place="margin">2 King. 12. 3.</note> So <hi>Amaziah</hi> was forced to leave
them behind him: so his Son <hi>Azariah:</hi> and when
they were demolished by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 14. 4.</note> and some of the
more pious Princes,<note place="margin">Chap. 15. 4.</note> they were ever first restored
at the Peoples return to <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And agreeable to what is here represented is the
Reason annexed to the Divine Law, <hi>lest ye disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
your nakedness;</hi> which words, tho they may
be literally taken, yet according to the Language
of Scripture in this matter, they have a much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
meaning, <hi>i.e.</hi> lest you commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with other Gods, and expose your shame and
nakedness by playing the Harlot upon your High
Places: These two things, <hi>Idolatry</hi> and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
being so frequently joyned together in Scripture,
as the same Crime.</p>
            <p>Thus far, to mention no more, it pleased God
to provide against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by enacting special
Laws in direct Opposition to the Heathen
Rites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:55847:63"/>
When God had casher'd the more rank and
notorious Acts of Heathen Worship, he retained
some of their more innocent Rites, especially those
that were derived from the antient Patriarchs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the later Corruptions were crept in, lest if
God had given a Law altogether new, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
all their Old Customs, People that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fond of the Usages of their Fore-fathers,
should rather have revolted to the Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
than submit themselves to such a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
Religion; and therefore out of condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their rudeness and weakness, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to retain several of their former
Rites and Ceremonies in his new Worship, that
by that Indulgence he might win them more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to embrace his new Institution.</p>
            <p>And this seems to be the <hi>Grammatical</hi> Sense of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expression,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 18.</note> 
               <hi>That God suffered their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Wilderness Forty Years,</hi> where the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>suffered,</hi> is taken from the Use or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Mothers or Nurses, that are forced to
humour and comply with the little Follies of
their Children by any way to please them.</p>
            <p>In allusion to this word, God was pleased to
express his Treatment of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
who knowing the weakness of their rude and
childish Understandings, permitted and indulged
them to enjoy not a few of their former Conceits
together with his own Divine Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55847:64"/>
And so <hi>Moses</hi> lets them know in his Farewel
Speech,<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 31.</note> 
               <hi>That the Lord had all along born with them, as a
Father doth with his Child.</hi> And so <hi>Grotius</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrases
that passage of St. <hi>Paul, When we were
Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>we were in Bondage under the Elements of
the World,</hi> i. e. says he, we were under subjection
to those Rites and Usages that were common to
us with the rest of the World, as <hi>Temples, Altars,
Sacrifices, New Moons,</hi> to which he might have
added, Oblations of <hi>First Fruits, Purifications, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival
Solemnities, Tabernacles, Dedication of Tenths,</hi>
the <hi>Ark;</hi> the <hi>Cherubim</hi> or <hi>Teraphim</hi> (for they are
promiscuously used in Scripture, and are of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
antient use:) These, and the like old Customs
were enjoyned the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> lest for want
of them they should relapse to <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because these Customs were common to
the Jews with the rest of the World, therefore
they are call'd the Elements of the World, and weak
and beggarly Elements, and carnal Ordinances,
that were impos'd and born with till the time of
Reformation, in the Apostolical Writings, when
they would beat down the value of the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Law.</p>
            <p>But to omit the rest, I shall only insist upon the
<hi>Cherubim,</hi> that God commanded to be placed over
the Ark,<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 18.</note> and all Divine Worship to be directed
towards them, <hi>And thou shalt make two Cherubims
of Gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the
two ends of the Mercy seat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55847:64"/>
That they were Statues or Images is out of
doubt by their Description, but of what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Form is matter of Controversie among learned
Men; tho what ever they were, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
it is enough that they were Images used
in the Worship of God, and then the use of
Images is not in it self <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Word originally and properly signifies
an</hi> Ox, <hi>is evident from</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>who uses the
Words promiscuously,</hi> Chap. 1. 10. <hi>As for the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Faces,</hi> They four had the Face of a
Man, and the face of a Lyon on the Right side, and they
four had the face of an <hi>Ox</hi> on the left side, they four
also had the face of an Eagle: <hi>but</hi> Chap. 10. 14. <hi>the
same things are thus described,</hi> And every one had
four faces; the first Face was the face of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub,
the second the face of a Man, the third of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the fourth of an Eagle <hi>And as an</hi> Ox <hi>or a</hi>
Cherub <hi>was used by the Antients as a Symbol of
Strength or Power, so thence came they to signifie
the thing it self; so God tells the King of</hi> Tyre,
<hi>that he was</hi> his anointed Cherub,<note place="margin">Ezek. 28. 14.</note> 
               <hi>i. e. that he had
made him great and powerful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence whenever God in Scripture is said to
sit upon, or dwell between the</hi> Cherubims, <hi>it is
when his</hi> Power <hi>particularly is represented. Thus
when the</hi> Israelites <hi>were defeated by the</hi> Philistins,
<hi>they agree at a Council of War to send for the
Ark of God to save them out of the hands of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55847:65"/>
their Enemies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 3, 4.</note> So the People sent to Shiloh, that
they might bring from thence the Ark of the Covenant
of the Lord of Hosts, who dwelleth between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims.
<hi>So King</hi> Hezekiah <hi>in his Distress calling
upon the Divine Protection and Deliverance from
his Enemy;</hi> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayed before the Lord,
and said,<note place="margin">2 King. 19. 15.</note> O Lord God of Israel, that dwellest between
the Cherubims, thou alone art God of all the Kingdoms
of the Earth. <hi>So Psal.</hi> 99. 1. The Lord reigneth, let
the People tremble; he sitteth between the Cherubims,
let the Earth be moved.</p>
            <p>And for this reason were these sacred Images
placed over the Ark, as the Symbols or Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,
to represent the Presence of the Divine
Majesty; so that as the <hi>Ark</hi> is styled God's <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool,</hi>
the <hi>Cherubims</hi> are called his <hi>Throne:</hi> And so
when the Ark and Cherubims were brought into
the Temple, this Anthem was sung: <hi>Lift up your
Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Doors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 78.</note> and the King of Glory shall come in: Who
is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, the Lord
strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle.</p>
            <p>In short, these Images were the most sacred
things in all the Jewish Religion; what they
were, I will not determine; some will have them
to have been Statues of Beautiful Youths (as they
are now vulgarly represented:) Others, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a young Bullock, from the synonymous sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the Words: But the<note n="*" place="margin">Grotius. <hi>Dr.</hi> Spencer. Villalpandus Bochartus.</note> most learned
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55847:65"/>
conclude them, as they suppose with good Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the Scriptures, not to have been any one
certain Form, but mixt of several Forms, in
which that of a Bullock had the biggest share;
but compounded of these four shapes, a Man's
Face, an Eagles Wings, a Lyons Back, an Oxes
or Bullocks Thighs and Feet. As they are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the fore cited Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 1. &amp; 10.
And to this no doubt St. <hi>Iohn</hi> alludes in his Vision
of the Four Beasts, <hi>Rev. 4. 6, 7. Round about the
Throne were four Beasts; and the first Beast was like
a Lyon, and the second like a Calf, and the third
had a face as a Man, and the fourth was like a flying
Eagle. And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy,
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Allusion, 'tis no doubt, to the representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the immediate Divine Presence in the Ark
by the Cherubims, that were made up of these
four Beasts, that were probably pitcht upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of that great preheminence that they hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Orders of Creatures. A Man for
Understanding, an Eagle for Swiftness, a Lyon
and a Bull for Strength.</p>
            <p>But what ever they were, they were sacred,
Images set up by God himself in the place of his
own Worship; and he was so far from forbidding
the use of Images in it, that he would not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped
without them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55847:66"/>
This is the true Account of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as it is
stated in the Scripture from the grand Design of
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, to restore the Worship of the
true invisible God, the Creator of Heaven and
Earth, in opposition to the Idols, or created Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Heathen World, and by all wise Arts
and Methods to keep them loyal to himself: And
this gives us the true <hi>Rationale</hi> of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law,
in which every particular Rite had some regard
to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So that the Breach of any one ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law was a degree of it; and to boil a Kid in
its Mothers Milk was <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as well as to offer
Sacrifice to the <hi>Sun,</hi> because the Heathens used
that form of Ceremony in the Worship of that
God.</p>
            <p>God did not think it sufficient for their security
to forbid them the Worship of this false God, but
every minute Circumstance that belonged to it,
lest by degrees they might be reconciled to it.
And therefore God calls himself upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
a <hi>jealous God,</hi> and oftentimes a <hi>jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
to let them know, that they must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoid Idolatry it self, but all the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and suspicions of it by Heathen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances.</p>
            <p>Now if we compare this antient Idolatry of
the Jews, with that of late charged by some men
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55847:66"/>
upon all Christians of the Roman Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I know not which will appear greatest, the
Malice or the Folly of the Charge. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of these three Heads.

            </p>
            <p>All which are represented to the People as
Crimes of the same Nature with the old Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But as to the first, the Use of Images in the
Worship of God, I cannot but admire at the
Confidence of these Men, to make so bold a
Charge against them in general,<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 22.</note> when the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Cherubim were commanded by God
himself.</p>
            <p>They were the most solemn and sacred part of
the Jewish Religion; and therefore, tho Images,
so far from Idolatry, that God made them the
<hi>Seat</hi> of his Presence, and from between them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
his Oracles; so that something more is
required to make <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than the <hi>use of Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Instance is so plain and obvious to every
Reader, there being nothing more remarkable
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55847:67"/>
in all the old Testament, than the Honour done
to the Cherubim, that 'tis a much greater Wonder
to me, that those Men, who advance the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Idolatry so groundlesly, can so slightly
rid themselves of so pregnant a Proof against it.</p>
            <p>It is objected,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St.</hi> of the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> I remember, by a learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
to the great Founder of this, and all
other <hi>Anticatholique,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Principles among us; but he turns it off
so carelesly, as if it were not worth his Notice.
<hi>First,</hi> That they only directed their Worship <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
the Images. Yea, they did so, as the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
of God's Presence, and that is to Worship
God by <hi>Images,</hi> or to give the same Signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to his <hi>Representations,</hi> as to <hi>Himself.</hi> And
therefore when <hi>David</hi> exhorts the People to give
Honour to the <hi>Ark,</hi> he says, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, bow
down to, or worship his <hi>Footstool, for It, or He, is
holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if so much outward Worship may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Images, as Symbols of the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
it is enough to justifie it. But however
the thing stands, the case of all Images is the same,
and a Roman Catholique may make the same
Plea for his Church, as this Author does for the
Jews; and if he accept it in one Case, he cannot
refuse it in another; or if he does, he will give
but little proof of his Integrity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:55847:67"/>
At least God was not so nice and metaphysical
in enacting his Laws, by distinguishing between
bowing <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>towards;</hi> or if these Gentlemen
say, he was, they must shew us where: But what
Authority do these Men assume to themselves,
when by the precarious use of these two little
Particles, they think to make the same Act the
Whitest, and the Blackest thing in the World,
<hi>towards</hi> an Image, 'tis innocent; <hi>to it,</hi> Idolatry?</p>
            <p>But let them take which they please (for they are
their own Carvers in all their own Controversies)
If it be no Idolatry to Worship towards an Image,
after all their Frights, they fairly give up the
Cause to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that requires no
more.</p>
            <p>But the second Reply is much more curious
and metaphysical, That the Cherubims were not
seen by the People, and adored but once a year
by the High Priest: Here then we distinguish
between the Idolatry of the <hi>Sight</hi> and the <hi>Mind;</hi>
an Image <hi>seen</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but if <hi>covered,</hi> 'tis <hi>none.</hi>
So that to adore the Host exposed, is <hi>Idolatry;</hi>
but in a Pix, 'tis <hi>none.</hi> What Rubbish is here to
stuff out so weighty an Argument!</p>
            <p>But if they did not <hi>see</hi> their Images in the Ark,
they knew them to be there, and of what Form
they were, being described to them by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in their Law. Upon these Terms it seems a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55847:68"/>
Blind Man can never be an Idolater; and if all
the Romanists would shut their Eyes at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Times, they would quit themselves of
this black Accusation.</p>
            <p>But the High Priest used this Solemnity only
once a year. If it were <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
once a year, as if done every day; and if
lawfully done but once a year, it was no <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
Its being seldom or frequent, makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
it is either always Idolatry, or it is never
so.</p>
            <p>And yet these little Pretences are the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of this great Argument; and when we have
loaded the greatest part of Christendom with the
foulest Crime in the World, we think to make
good the Accusation by such shameless Shifts and
Pretences as these; for in these Trifles, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
as to the Cherubim Images, ended; and yet
the Clamour of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is kept up as high as ever
to this very day.</p>
            <p>But what Images do the Roman Catholiques
worship? Do they worship any Image or Symbols
of <hi>False Gods,</hi> as the <hi>Supreuse Deities?</hi> If they
do not, then they are innocent of the <hi>worst</hi> part
of Idolatry. Or do they attempt to make a <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi>
of the <hi>true God,</hi> or <hi>uncreated Divine Nature?</hi>
That is the <hi>other</hi> part of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
knows no more; therefore however supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
they may be in their use of Images, yet they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55847:68"/>
cannot be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but upon one of
these two Accounts, which no Man was ever yet
so hardy as to charge upon that Church.</p>
            <p>Till therefore it be proved that they worship
Images of <hi>false Gods</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deities,</hi> or
that they worship the <hi>true God</hi> by <hi>Corporeal Images</hi>
and <hi>Representations</hi> of his Divine Nature, there
is no Footing for <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Christendom.</p>
            <p>As for the Adoration of the Host, when they
can prove 'tis given to it either as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of a
<hi>false God,</hi> or the <hi>Picture</hi> of the <hi>true one,</hi> howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
faulty it may be otherwise, it can be no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <p>And as for the Invocation of Saints, unless
they worship them as the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> the Charge
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is an idle Word, and the Adoration
it self that is given to them as Saints, is a direct
<hi>Protestation against Idolatry,</hi> because it supposes a
<hi>Superiour Deity,</hi> and that Supposition cuts off the
very being of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give an Account of their precarious
Notions of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and their more precarious
ways of proving it, would swell to Volumes;
and therefore at present I shall dismiss the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and shall only observe what a Barbarous
Thing it is to make the <hi>Lives, Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi>
of the English <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> to depend upon
such Trifles and Crudities, by remarking the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of and unparallel'd Penalties that are annexed
to so slender a Law, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:55847:69"/>

            <p>Here are all the Punishments that can be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Convict Recusancy it self, one would think, is
Punishment more than enough for any one Crime:</hi>
Abjuration of the Realm;<note place="margin">35 Eliz. ca. 1.</note> Returning without leave,

Forfeiture of Right of Patronage, Disabled
from any Practice or Office in Law, and finally disabled
to be Guardian, Executor or Administrator, and Legatee.</p>
            <p>This was thought the utmost Severity in the
Zealous days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but alass!
our Modern Zeal will not be confined to the
gentle Moderation of our Fore-fathers; but now
we must suffer all those, with many more, to
the loss of our <hi>Birth-rights,</hi> and all <hi>Benefits of Law,</hi>
for no higher Act of <hi>Recusancy,</hi> than not swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Truth of Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s <hi>Unlearned</hi> and <hi>Fanatique
Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> for that in reality is the bottom
of all this Mischief and Madness.</p>
            <p>And as it is advanced among us into so bloody a
Charge; I cannot but declare my utter Abhorrence
both of that, and its Abetters, as sworn Enemies
to the Peace of Christendom; and in the Result
of all, I find, <hi>That Idolatry made the Plot, and that
the Plot made Idolatry, and that the same Persons
made both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus begging Allowance for Humane Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
lesser Errors and Mistakes, which in so
much variety of Argument and Citation will
escape the greatest Care, I have declared my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Judgment of this unhappy Law, as I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
