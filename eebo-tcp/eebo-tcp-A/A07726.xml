            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

gentle reders, but
that if ye haue ben
conuersante in old
histories, &amp; so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
both howe
many moo prynces haue ben en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered
by treason of theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylyer
seruauntes, then by open
warre of theyr enemyes, and also
sene, what ende they come to, that
venture vpon so daungerous an
enterprise, ye woll thynke my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
not euyll employed, whiche
tendeth hole to this ende, that all
subiectes ones being brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hatred of treason, maye at the
laste fall in loue with their duetie,
and seke truly to serue, where god
hath appoynted theym so to doo.
For as the incommodyties, that
<pb facs="tcp:4511:3"/>
treason bryngeth into a common
welthe, be excedynge many, and
are ofte tymes the vtter vndoyng
of ryche and welthy realmes, so,
that kyngdome must nedes pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and flourishe, where all men
stryue, who may best do his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
best serue his countrey in that
god and his souerayne lorde hath
callyd hym vnto. We haue hadde
ofte experience, howe euylle they
spede, what infamye commeth to
them, what ende they make, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
at any tyme attempte treason
against their soueraigne lord and
kynge. These, whiche of late, lost
their honour, landes, and lyues,
are not the fyrste, that haue bene
moued with to many benefites, to
become traytours, no nor yet the
fyrst that came to shamfull death,
for soo foule an enterprise. They
<pb facs="tcp:4511:3"/>
haue companyons, which though
they be not able to goo cheeke by
cheke with them, yet they comme
nat farre behynde.</p>
            <p>¶Perennius, a man that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
wonderful many benefites
of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus themperour, where
as he sawe, but oone aboue hym,
thynkyng that he myght by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
brynge hym downe, and sette
vp hym selfe, trayterousely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
the deathe of Commodus,
his lorde and maker.</p>
            <p>¶Plautianus an nother, of all
men mooste bounde to Seuerus
the emperour, soughte also to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye
hym, not that euer he hadde
receyued any iniurie or displesure
at his handes, but that the blynd
desyre he hadde to the Empyre,
wrought moche more in him, than
coulde al themperours benefites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4511:4"/>
¶Seianus as moche bounde,
as any of thother two, euen vpon
lyke cause, thought to haue slayn
Tiberius themperour, his lorde
and mayster. But they came euen
to suche ende, as dydde the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
the lorde Montacute, and
suche other, as by their exaumple
teache all men, that be nat yet we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
of their lyues and honestie, to
be ware of treasone. Certaynely
who so wayeth, how hard a thing
it is, to enter with any manne in
treason, howe full of ieoperdies,
howe fewe there be, that a manne
maye truste, howe soone menne
maye be deceyued, takynge some
to beare them moch greatter loue,
than they do, howe no experience
can soo vtter one man his hart to
an nother, that in suche a case, he
may leaue lyfe in his handes, he
<pb facs="tcp:4511:4"/>
woll, I suppose, moche wonder,
to see any man, thoughe the fyne
for it, were but the losse of goodis,
so madde to venture vppon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Many chaunces make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whan it is kepte most secrete,
to appere. An harte, that stylle fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the stinge of treason, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
at one tyme or an other, make
the tonge and countenance part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his grefe.</p>
            <p>¶Lucilla, syster to Commodus
the Emperoure, hadde appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
oone Quintianus to slee her
brother. This traytour waited for
the Emperour at the entrynge in
to the Amphitheatre, and whenne
he sawe Comodus all moste come
to the place, where he intended to
haue slayne hym, his hande, his
tongue, his gesture, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
coulde suffre his harte to
<pb facs="tcp:4511:5"/>
be no lenger hyd. No, he hauinge
his dagger redy naked, cryed out,
before the Emperour camme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the strooke, <hi>This the Senate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the.</hi> Uppon whiche wordes, he
was taken, and Commodus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
hurt.</p>
            <p>¶Likewyse, Marcus Antonius
of Uolterra, was set to kyll Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Medices, and had so done,
but that he cried before, o traitour,
which voyce saued Laurence, and
disclosed as many as were of that
conspiracie.</p>
            <p>¶The same mornynge, that
Brutus, and the reste of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
hadde determyned to slee
Iulius Cesar, it so chaunced, that
Cesar commened a greatte space
with Gneius Popilius, oone of
those that had conspired his deth.
<pb facs="tcp:4511:5"/>
Brutus and many mo of his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions
were bye, and were caste
into suche a feare, that they wyste
neyther what to doo, ne what to
thynke. They all were a frayde,
lest Popilius had vttered the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
vnto Cesar, and wolde euen
there haue set vpon hym, sauinge
that they perceyued Cesar his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce
nothynge moued, ne his
colour any thyng altered. And yet
if Cesar had redde the letter, that
was delyuered hym, not halfe an
houre before his deathe, he hadde
knowen his enemyes counsel, and
myght haue broughte them all to
theyr confusion.</p>
            <p>¶The daye before, that Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinus
thoughte to haue slayne
Nero, he put an olde rustie dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
that hadde layne longe by
<pb facs="tcp:4511:6"/>
hym, to gryndynge. He made his
testamente, he made all his bonde
men free, he gaue euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a certayne somme of moneye, he
caused rollers to be made, to wrap
wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in, by which tokens Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichius
his seruaunt, gathered, he
wente about some naughty pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and so accused hym vnto the
emperoure. Sceuinus streyghte
confessed that his intente was to
haue slayne Nero.</p>
            <p>¶This I brynge in, not so moch
to shewe that treason woll out, as
to make men see, howe god pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
wyt and prudency from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyciouse
traytours. He hath done
so, where treason was intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenst
Nero, one of the worst pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that euer the worlde had, and
trowe traytours, he woll suffre
<pb facs="tcp:4511:6"/>
Henry the eyght, his chosen king,
a prynce that chyefelye aboue all
thinges, hath soughte and seketh,
to sette forthe his glorie, to restore

ye shall perceyue it, very vnlyke,
that any traytour here after maye

see who is his gracis protectour,
from what daungers, he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
hym, and therby gather an
assured affyaunce, that traytours
can but worke their owne confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
when so euer they seke to do

and can scarse be brought to leue

be great, and their offences many

they be not dangerous and coy of

as I sayde firste, our soueraigne

moche more cause to gyue God
thankes, than euer had king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,

I say moch more, what men were

Dauid hauynge cause to call for
helpe, and God by his promyse
bound to succour hym, coulde not
but fynde god good to hym. But
our moste fortunate kynge, was
in moste daunger, and in no feare
ne suspition of leste. Howe coulde
his grace suspecte them, whom of
all men he knewe hadde greattest
causes to loue hym, to desyre his

It is notable, that authors
wryte of kynge Lisymachus his
dogge, whiche neuer left his lord
and mayster, but was in all hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges,
in all warres, in all ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdies
at hande with him. At the
last when he saw his master deed,
and cast into the fyre, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of burial was then, the dogge
a gret whyle mornefully yowling
and lamentynge the deathe of his
mayster, caste hym selfe euen into
the fyre also, and there died by his
mayster. Pliny writeth, that Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
kynge of the Syracusans, had
a dogge, which did euen the same.
It is more notable, that wryters
leaue in memory of a Romaynes
<pb facs="tcp:4511:22"/>
dogge, whiche Romaine was put
to deathe when Titus Fabinus &amp;
his famylye were slayne. This
dogge wolde away from his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
for no strypes, for no whyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge,

and styll howled wonderfull mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyngely,
many of the Romaynes
standyng about &amp; moche meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
at the true faith &amp; harte that
that sorye worme bare vnto his

thought the dogge hungrye, one
of the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders by gaue him meate,
whiche he straighte caryed to his
maysters mouth, and left it there.
Shortly after the body being hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
into the floudde of Tyber, the
dogge lept in after, and gate hold
of his mayster, kepynge hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

If the lawes hadde prouyded no

examples ynough, to make men
teare such traytors, as thou arte

and suche his souerain lord? How
be it, if thou be as I surely thinke

For he that hath to dwelle where

What loste our fyrste father
Adam by his gay enterprise, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:4511:29"/>
thought to haue a fayre daye,
a merye tyme? What loste he for

an apple? a small thynge, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
all mankynd. He was in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
a place pleasaunt, beyonde
all pleasures, almoste all howres
talkynge with god almyghty, the
eatynge of an apple brought him,
that he durste not shewe his face.
God cryeth to hym: Adam where
arte thou? oute of what pleasure
haste thou put thy selfe? and in to
what myserye? I maye saye, O
Marques, where art thou? where
is the fayre day thou lokedest for?
where is thye garlande? Some
men perchaunce woll saye, they
haue suffered for theyr trespasse,
they shulde nowe be at rest. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
thynges are written not so

The raunsome of treason is
more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> losse of life and goodes.
Mens tonges and pennes, whan

to his mayster? was he not
bound aboue a great sort of men,
to loue the kinges welthe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to serue his maiestye with
all loyall harte and obeysaunce.
Myghte not this fonde or rather
detestable traytour, haue talked &amp;
dreamed of other thynges, then of
the kynges deathe, whiche oure
lord kepe of, euen as longe as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with his helpe may maintein
lyfe, and all other that wold other
wyse, to folowe Montacute and
<pb facs="tcp:4511:30"/>
his felowes? Myght not he haue
ben content with this world, and
the state he was nowe in, leauyng
his lewde prophecies of the world
to come of the tyme that shoulde
make hym &amp; his mery, if he might
tary it? he might, if god had not
ben as contente to leaue hym, as
he was desyrefull to flee god, and
to kepe downe his worde and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
For as goddes ioye is to
be with men, that take ioye of his
presence, so beinge lefte and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
though his desyre be to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,

This I dare say, if these men had

of goddis worde, they coulde
neuer haue fallen in to suche an
abhomynable sorte of treasons.
Who knoweth not how these, that
are now deed, howe the Marques
<pb facs="tcp:4511:31"/>
and Montacute abhorred not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all readynge of scripture, but al

whether Reynolde that traytour,

the sayinge is, they bothe
dyd well theyr partes. As for Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolde,
I am assured, he ceased not
to kepe his bretherne in errour,
which sent his mother word, that
if he knewe her to be of the same
<pb facs="tcp:4511:31"/>
opinion, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king is of, he wold
treade her vnder his fete, mother
his, as she was. What beast could
vse suche langage to his mother,
excepte he had vtterlye forgotten
the reuerence, that nature techeth
all creatures toward their paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?
what pestilent harte reigneth
in hym, that hath suche a rancour
to goddis worde, suche a stomake
ayenste the truthe? Thou, thou

Thou haste slaine thy brother, the

sayenge to theym that asked

I muste kepe one eare for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
that nowe is accused. Pole
hath redde moche, whiche thinge
dothe steye a man in errour, and
not help hym out of it, if he chaw
the sence of scripture, as he lyste,
and wrynge oute suche iuyce, as
his fantasy corrupted afore, there
nowe seketh. Saynte Paule had
readde moche, euen whan he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
Christis flocke, and of no
<pb facs="tcp:4511:33"/>
thynge so moche as of scripture.
You see men coulde neuer tourne
his hart. God hym selfe was fain
to put to his voyce, to stryke his
bodye blynde, and to enlyghten
ther with his soule. Saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
had redde moch, and was
very conuersant in the scriptures,
&amp; yet he was a great whyle in the
heresyes of the Manichees, and
thought that scripture was of his
syde. Many disputed with hym,
they all founde, that stubburnesse
dothe no where so moch hurte, as
whan it lyghteth vpon great wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
furnished with moch lerning.
Plato saith, smalle wyttes do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
moche hurt in a comon weale,
the great be they that do the great
hurte. The bysshoppe of Rome
thought Pole bothe of great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
and of great parentage, so
<pb facs="tcp:4511:34"/>
that euen polycie taughte hym a
ioly poynt of folye. The bysshop
thoughte to worke by him a feate
mete for oone in his place. Pole
cam somwhat to late into France,
at the laste commotion. If he had
comme in season, he wolde haue
playde an hardier part than Aske
dyd, he wolde surely haue ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
bothe his eyes, where Aske
ventured but one. He wolde haue
had not only a foote in their bote,
but in spite of Aske and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
wold haue ruled the sterne.
He came to late, great pite, he had
not putte Aske oute of his office.
Howe be it whan he sent Holland
with his message to Geffreye his
brother, that they shuld not sturre
while he came, he thought to be at
the begynnyng of the breakefast,
to the whiche the Marques was
<pb facs="tcp:4511:34"/>
bydding styl his gestes. He wold
haue brought in that mery world,
which his brother Montacute stil
loked for, euermore afrayde leste
he and his shoulde not tarye that
mery tyme. Why was he afrayde
trowe ye? he was no sycke man,
his yeres were not soo many, but
he moughte haue lyued for age a

chaunce as it nowe hath done, he
thought treson could not so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g be

God put it in your hedde to take

it were great pitie ye shoulde lyue

of our time, I take the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
of our soueraygne lordes opinion
in matters concerninge Religion,
to be euen the gretest. There was
no prynce in Christendome, but he
was farre liker to haue chaunged
then our soucrayne lorde, he was
theyr pyller, and bare them vppe a
great whyle: they gaue hym faire
titles for his so doinge, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
his name in al their writingis,
was it not a wonderfull worke of
god, to get his grace from them to
hym? To make hym theyr ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,
whom they had chosen for
theyr defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sour? I haue oft hidden
<pb facs="tcp:4511:36"/>
my countreye menne to marke the
procedynges of god, sythens this
change, with <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi>
his chosen lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in England,
and our onely lorde and heed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Christe and his father, I styll
say, as I haue sayde, who so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
howe tenderlye god preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his highnes, he is eyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge
blynde, or els he wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth
god to be ennemye to all
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that loue not his grace. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
he was callyd kynge, and
yet had ayenst all right and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
a ruler aboue hym, whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
enforced hym selfe to kepe
his hyghnesse, and all the reste of
his subiectes in seruitude, errour,
and idolatrie. God hathe made
him, as al his noble progenitours
of right ought to haue ben, a full
kyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, a ruler, and natru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:4511:37"/>
in his owne kyngedome, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were. God hath deliuered his
highnes from the bondage of the
byshoppe of Rome, his subiectes
from errors, his realme from the
foule sinne of idolatry. Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
a childe that the byshop of Rome
lefte here, with his monkes and
friers to be fostred, &amp; made stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
is takynge her leaue, wolde god
her passeport were made, and she
sente frome whens she came. But
she hath ben so cherished, so made
of in this realme, that lothe she is
to departe. She hath many fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and trustethe by the helpe of
them to be made denyzen, and soo
to chaunge her apparel, and to do
moche more hurt in parishe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer she dyd in cloisters.
But I truste, as god hath shewed
what hurte commeth of her and
<pb facs="tcp:4511:37"/>
hers, so he wyll prouide a way, to
see, that she and hers haue lesse to
do. The people begynne to know
what they that be curates oughte
to preache, and what they arbou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to folowe, and yet they do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne.
Wolde god some were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to take them forthe newe
lessons. They haue longe sithens
begon to knowe their duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
god, their obedience to their
prince, the loue they ow vnto their
neighbours, and yet they be styll
atte the begynninge. For yf they
were fully taught, but in these .iii.
poyntes, I dare promyse, my lyfe
to lye vppon it, the fruites of this
knowledge shuld be such, as wold
enforce all christian princis, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the steppes of oure noble
prince. I remember howe kynge
Iosaphat sente many of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb facs="tcp:4511:38"/>
with prechers, that is, trewe
setters oute of the worde of god,
throughe all Iurie, and howe all
the worlde feared his power, after
that god was preched in his king
dome. I truste as our moste pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente
kynge ceasseth nat to sende
his holsome and godly proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
abrode, that so one day men
shall be sent after them, to se what
effecte they take, what successe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of them, where they worke,
&amp; where they be ydle, where they
haue fre passage, and where they
be stopped. But leauyng newe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
whiche leade me to newe
purposes, I wol returne, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
that I toke in hande. This
laste sedition, besyde many other
commodities, that it wrought in
this realme, hathe made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in especial those where it
<pb facs="tcp:4511:38"/>
reigned moste, very glad to here,
very desyrefull to make amendes
to God and their Prince, for that
they offended bothe afore. I haue
herde dyuers men say, that three
or foure preachers may doo more
good in the northe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tray in two
or thre monethes, than hath bene
done in these southe parties, these
two or thre yeres, only bicause the
people be so redy to take what so
euer the preacher shall offer vnto
theym: soo that if the people be
naught styll, the faute is no more
theirs, for they wold fain be good.
They se god louith no rebellions,
no disobedience, if god had done
nothynge for the kynge, sythens
that tyme, was not that one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
inoughe, to bynde his grace,
and all theym that loue this his
realme, euermore to thynke vpon
<pb facs="tcp:4511:39"/>
goddis goodnes alwayes to giue
hym tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, and yet styl to thinke
thankes vngyuen? All bokes can
shewe, no suche sedition so quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
no suche rage soo peasibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged,
and yet at the fyrste, as al
men lyked the ende, soo was there
an other thyng, that men, whiche
fauour the peace and quietnes of
our countrey, thought somewhat
amysse. Menne were wonderfull
gladde, that harneys was put of,
and weapons layde downe, but
they were sorie, that the deceyuers
of the simple &amp; pore subiectis, had
after their pestilent pilgremages,
pardon. It is ofte to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
howe god prouided both for
the sorte deceyued, and also howe
vpon newe treason committed, he
wolde the ranke capitaynes, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gallowes, that trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb facs="tcp:4511:39"/>
muste come to shamefulle
deathe. And yet is there more, euen
concernynge the same matter, to
be marked. where as it plesed the
kyng of his clemency and tender
loue, that his grace beareth to the
lyfe of his subiectes, to satisfye
the rigor of the lawes, with a few
of their dethes, god hath this last
sommer by strange kinde of syck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
welle declared vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the northe, that he was
nat contented so fewe were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
where so many offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. And
as the sicknes plagued them sore,
so I thynke god pycked a greate
sorte in other countreys, suche as
he knew had hartes euyl inough,
thoughe their dedes were vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
It is not to be left vnspoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that a generall plague reignyng
in al the north, and in many other
<pb facs="tcp:4511:40"/>
parties of the realme, London, a
citie for the more parte yerely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
with great deathe, hadde in
maner no syckenesse in it. Lette
other menne laye the cause where
they thinke beste, I do surely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that as god punyshed them
for their treasons, soo he shewed
vnto the Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doners, that the way
to haue hym mercyfull and good
to theym, is that that they are in,
though not setled, yet a great part
of theym well entred. All be it we
be forgetfull, and haue styll nede
of some, to putte vs in mynde of
goddis goodnesse toward vs, yet
I woll not nowe speke of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
whiche he gaue this realme,
what ioye and comforte he sent to
all trewe englysshe men, whan he
sent vnto our soueraigne lord, his
dere and noble sonne, oure deere
<pb facs="tcp:4511:40"/>
and noble prince Edward. I trust
it nedith not, I trust there be none
of vs, either so blynde, that we see
not, howe moch Englande oweth
vnto god, for his byrth, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for such his towardnes,
as was neuer sene in chylde, by al
mens assent the lyke, either so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate,
but he herynge of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
princis growyng, and waxing
to a kynge, to the sceptre of this
his right inheritance, woll with al
his harte, desyre god both to kepe
hym longe frome the scepter, and
longer in it than euer was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before hym. I say, I wyl nat
speake of his grace, neither of the
goodnes of god powred vpon vs,
and all ours, by his byrthe. No, I
woll make as foule a chaunge as
euer ye sawe or herde of. I wolle
go from hym (whome the loue to
<pb facs="tcp:4511:41"/>
god and his father reserued) we
ought to loue, aboue all thynges,
and intreate of theym, whome, yf
they were alyue, all Englyshmen
ought aboue al creatures to hate.
And yet I wyl not so gladly talke
of theym, as of the goodnesse of
god shewid to vs by their occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
¶O lorde, in what danger hath
the kynges hyghnesse bene, these
xiii. or .xiiii. yeres? For euen al this
space, there haue ben in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
priuie chaumber, that frome
tyme to time haue not only vttred
the secretes of his counselle and
chamber, but also haue practised
with his most enemyes, and done
what they coulde to hynder his
graces godly procedynges? Was
it not a syngular prouydence of
god, that the Marques of Exet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
was put oute of the preuye
<pb facs="tcp:4511:41"/>
chaumber, vppon noo deserte, I
thynke at that tyme knowen, but
euen that god put it in the kinges
heed so to do? Is it nat to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled,
that he and Edward Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll,
a couple worthy all mennes
hatrede, a couple ioyned in trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
intentes, beinge soo longe
togither about his highnes owne
persone, dyd no more hurte? Is it
not more meruayle, that thone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
put out of the priuie chaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thother attempted nothinge?
Men that know not the goodnes
of god towarde his electe rulers,
may meruaile at al these thinges,
but let vs laude god for them all,
&amp; assure our selues, that god woll
not suffre a prince, whom he hath
chosen, to greatter affaires, than
grosse heedes can attayne vnto,
to be vyolated of his trayterous
<pb facs="tcp:4511:42"/>
subiectes. God hath ioyned with
the maiestie of a kynge, suche a
feare, that false hartes haue noo
power, to offre wrong to a prince,
thoughe all oportunities seme to
serue them: wherfore if we list to
meruail, let vs a litle while intrete
of the disclosyng of these tresons.</p>
            <p>Syr Geffry Pole was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
to the towre, neyther the kynges
hyghnes, nor any of the counsaile
suspectynge either the Marques,
eyther the lorde Montacute his
brother, or syr Edward Neuyll, of
any of al these thynges, that they
were founde giltie of. Geffrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
in the towre, hauynge his
breste full of wytnesses agaynste
him selfe, agaynste his brotherne,
ayenst the Marques, was brought
into such a thronge of thoughtes,
into suche a conflycte of pensiers,
<pb facs="tcp:4511:42"/>
that bloud and nature, workinge
on thone syde, god &amp; conscience on
thother, he was caried into suche
a perplexitie, that he coulde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condiscende to accuse his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his cousyn syr Edwarde Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll,
and hym selfe, chyefe of all,
endaungeryng all foure, with the
gylte of treason, nor yet vtterlye
withstande, the workynge of god
and his conscyence, within hym:
whiche ofte put in his mynde, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suffer them and hym selfe
to, bodely to be brought to death,
then to goo body and soule to the
deuyll. This motion ranne oft in
his heed, but the dyuell, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
aduersarye to goddis honour
and mans welthe, put in his fote,
and soo toste this wretched soule,
that of many euelles, he chose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the worste of all, which was a
<pb facs="tcp:4511:43"/>
ful purpose, to slee hym selfe. The
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of his death were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as the dyuel made them to the
shewe, his brother shulde liue stil,
theyr famylie continue in honour,
the lorde Marques shoulde haue
greate cause to loue all his bloud,
whiche hadde kylled hym selfe to
saue him, with many suche fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes,
as desperate menne fynde, to
helpe them to theyr ende. He was
fully perswaded to slee hym selfe.
Desperation hadde wroughte her
feate, nowe see howe oportunitie
made all thynges redye for hym,
his keper was absente, a knyfe at
hande vppon the table, he rysethe
out of his bed, &amp; taketh the knyfe,
and with full intente to dye, gaue
hym selfe a stabbe with the knyfe
vppon the breste. The deuyll lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
strength, where god hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:4511:43"/>
thinge to do, and can better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne
thynges, then brynge them
to effecte. The deuyll had played
his parte, nowe se howe god, as
he ofte dothe, tourned all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
hole worke, to his glory, and
Geffreyes saluation. The knyfe
was blunte, and so dyd perse: but
the wounde as god wolde, was
not mortall, and yet for as moche
as bloud came after the wounde,
Geffrey began at the last, to feare
god, to feare hel, to remember into
what case the deuyll had brought
hym, and then beganne to deteste
the slaughter of hym self, to wishe
he had opened al to gether, rather
then to haue loste his bodye and
soule after that sorte. He nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to caste, whiche waye he
mought apease the wrothe &amp; ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of god, redy as he thought
<pb facs="tcp:4511:44"/>
to hurle hym in to hell. He nowe
caste his counte after an nother
sort, drede of deathe whiche as he
thoughte wolde haue folowed the
wounde, beganne to teache him a
new lesson, his brother, his cosen,
syr Edwarde Neuylle, nowe wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as moche with hym as they
oughte to do, he sawe before hym
the losse of his soule, and thought
it moche better, they loste theyr he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
he sawe in what daunger he
shulde leaue his soueraygne lord,
whose benefyttes, beganne nowe
to muster before hym, and the vele
of malyce layde asyde, to tourne
his harte: he sawe the damages,
the slaughters, that myght come
to his countrey: he sawe it not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that god shuld be any thing
good to hym, whiche shulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
the destruction of soo many.
<pb facs="tcp:4511:44"/>
In so moche that nowe he, which
wolde haue dyed, to saue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
and cousyn, desyred life, for
no cause so moche, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might
brynge them to that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
and thervpon of his own
mynde, no man requirynge hym
to it, no manne thynkynge of any
suche thynge, he desyred to speake
with the lieutenant of the toure,
and after to speake with some of
the kinges priuie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, to whom
whan they came, he as a man styl
lokynge whan the wounde shuld
haue ended his lyfe, disclosed all
the hole treasons. Thus the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
subtyl prouision of the knife,
of his beinge alone, of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to abuse the knife to his
distruction, vtterlye deceiued the
dyuell, all his gynnes, al his craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
now being turned ayenst hym
<pb facs="tcp:4511:45"/>
selfe all the hurt that might haue
come to his aduersaries, god and
those that loue and seke his glory,
nowe redoundyng vpon his own
heed, wylle ye haue a sure token,
that this is the worke of god? ye
haue herde of the message, which
Reynold sent to his brethern, that
is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they in no wyse shulde sturre
vntyll his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. ye may know,
who was author of so godly a mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sage.
Who but the deuil, author of
al dissention, al rebellion, all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
could be either of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell with
him that sente suche a message, or
with theym that wolde kepe it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.
If he were thautor of it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
coulde he nat be the vtterer of it
also: his kyngedome must nedes
falle, if he fyght ayenst hym selfe.
God, god brought it to lyghte, as
one that hath taken vpon hym to
<pb facs="tcp:4511:45"/>
defende his trewe and faithfulle
ministre, kynge Henry the eight.
God hath disclosed all, vsynge su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
wayes, that all menne maye
knowe, it is onely he, that coulde
do suche a thinge. A man wolde
thynke it vnpossyble, that where
no force, no violence, no tourmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
are vsed, fleshe, bloudde, and
nature coulde suffer one brother
to brynge the other to his deathe.
Some woll say, he lacked no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
as longe as he had treson
waltrynge in his hart. A traitour
whether he be so taken or nat, can
lacke no scourginge, whan he is
moste alone. He hath his whyppe
in his bosom, and playeth the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour
him selfe for lacke of an
officer. I wol not say, but Geffrey
Pole, felt suche tormentes, no I
must nedes gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he was shreudly
<pb facs="tcp:4511:46"/>
scourged, that thought it an ease
to rydde hym selfe of it by dethe.</p>
            <p>They be of lyke no small peynes,
that make the pacient glad to slee
his body, and damne his soule for
the arrydance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yet as I
sayd, he had no outwarde torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
no racking, no manicles, no he
was put in fere of none of al these
peines, but enforced by god, as I
take it, and as he hym selfe sayde
at the barre it was, frankely vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not onely ayenste his brother
and cousyn, but ayenste suche, as
whan they came to the barre, gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them selfis giltie, without any
verdite of quest. But of these last,
I wyll nothing speake, all be it I
take them to be as worthy eternal
infamy as the fyrst, but great men
of byrth, bicause blode is disteined
by treson, &amp; their family taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4511:46"/>
them, ar those that ought to be set
forth in theyr colours. It is I saye
again, a wonder to se, one brother
bring an other (moche loue being
betwene them, and no cause of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred)
to his deathe. It were a won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
surely, if one had not taken the
matter in hande, whiche can when
him lust, bothe vanquishe nature,
and trede the deuyll with his hole
power vnder his fete. They two
kepte those treasons vnder locke
and key. God is and euer hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lorde of nature, conquerer of the
deuyll, and can compel both when
hym lusteth, to set forth his glory.
But nowe, where we see, whose
goodnes it is, that treasons are
knowen, and traytours made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye,
lette vs not forgette to gyue
hym thankes, that thus waketh,
and in maner wayteth, to saue vs
<pb facs="tcp:4511:47"/>
harmeles. Is it possible, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not forced, shoulde swere vppon a
boke, hym selfe to be a traytour,
hym selfe of al men to be most wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy
deathe. Syr Geffrey hath ofte
taken this othe, So hath Croftes
and Colyns also: the other, all the
tyme of theyr arraynement, stode
styffe, with castyng vp of eies and
handes, as though those thynges
had ben neuer herd of before, that
thenne were laide to theyr charge.
The Marques, of al the rest stack
hardest, and made as thoughe he
had ben very clere in many poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
yet in some he staggered, and
was very sory so to do, nowe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langyng
the kynges pardon, now
takynge benefytte of the acte, and
when al wolde not serue, he began
to charge Geffrey Pole with fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye,
with foly, and madnesse. It is
<pb facs="tcp:4511:47"/>
moche to be noted, what answere
Geffrey made to the Marques in
this poynte. Some men, saythe
Geffreye (as I here) laye to my
charge, that I shulde be out of my
wytte, and in a frensye. Trouth it
is, I was out of my wytte, and in
a great frenesy, when I fell with
theym in conference, to be a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
disobediente to god, false to
my prynce, and enemye to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
countraye. I was also out of
my wytte, and stryken with a sore
kynde of madnesse, when I chose
rather to kil my self, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to charge
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with such tresons, as I knewe
wolde coste them theyr lyues, if I
dyd vtter them. But our lorde be
thanked, god wrought better with
me, then I thought to haue doone
with my selfe. He hath saued my
soule at the leste. the knyfe wente
<pb facs="tcp:4511:48"/>
not so farre as I wolde haue had
it gone: his goodnes it is, that I
haue not slayne my selfe: his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye,
that I was delyuered frome
that frensye of kyllynge my selfe:
his worke, that I haue declared
my self, my brother, the Marques,
with the rest, to be traytours. And
where I thought, said Geffrey, ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
to haue putte my soule in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarde,
for the sauing of these men,
god I thanke hym, so wrought in
me, and so chaunged my mynde,
that if I had had tenne brothern,
yea tenne sonnes, I wolde rather
bringe them all to this perylle of
deathe, than leaue my countreye,
my souerayne lord, and myn own
soule in suche daunger, as they al
thre stode in, if I had kepte these
treasons secrete. Let vs, lette vs
dye, we be but a fewe, better we

haue accordynge to our desertes,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trei to be brought
to ruyne. O what a lorde is god,
whom can a traytour trust, whan
one brother is so desyrefull to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an others treason? yea whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
traytour hym selfe, no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
hym, vttreth his own tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
whom may we trust, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
our selues, desyre to disclose oure
selues? Treson can not lye longer
hyd, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while it ripeth, for yf it be
ones melowe, the sauour streight,
for the moste parte, bewrayeth the
howrde. Geffrey hath neuer bene
taken for any plesant or sage tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
his witte was wont to serue
his tong but so so. I dare say, they
that were the wisest of the kingis
moste honourable counsayle, dyd
moch wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der that day, to here him
tel his tale, and loked for nothyng
<pb facs="tcp:4511:49"/>
lesse, than that he shulde haue soo
handlyd him selfe. God is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayllous
god, he can make bothe
whan him lust, and whom he wol
eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wise, pithie. He can make
the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of the domme serue his
elect, whan his wyl is. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
was styffe at the barre, and
stode faste in denial of most thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
layd to his charge, yet in som
he foyled and staggerde, in suche
sorte, that all menne might see his
countenance, to auouch that, that
his tonge could nat without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
foltring deny. But at the scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde,
whan he sawe, mens othes,
with a multitude of wytnesses ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his sturdy denyall not to
saue his lyfe, he began eyther to
waye dyshonour lesse than he dyd
at the barre, or els to thynke, that
dishonour standith in doing trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously,
<pb facs="tcp:4511:49"/>
rather than in confessyng
of it, whan it is knowen to be so,
deathe at hande, taught him and
his felowes, to prouyde for the
safetie of their soules, and to leue
the regard of honour there on the
scaffolde with their bodies. They
dyd all thre acknowlege their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
towarde the kinge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred
all men that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to pray god to forgyue them.
They be gone, our lorde I truste,
which gaue them repentance, wol
also take theym to his mercy, and
yet saue their soules. The thinge
they feared, is come vppon them,
they might not tary the tyme, they
plowed treason, they sowed sedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
noo meruayle yf they reape
deathe. Wherefore let vs, whyche
in one houre, haue escaped so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sorowes, so present calamities,
<pb facs="tcp:4511:50"/>
so imminente mischeues, saye as
Iudith sayd, whan she retourned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with Holofernes his heed in her
lappe, Laude and praise be giuen
to the lord, that forsakest not them
that put their trust in the. Let him
be gloryfied for euer of vs, that
vncalled is thus preast and redye
to defend them that were nigh the
brinke of pardicion, and sawe it
not, vntyll he plucked them by the
sleue. Hitherto ye haue hard, how
traytrously these vnnatural trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, you haue sene how
the goodnes of god, as wel nowe,
as in many other thynges, hathe
preserued the kynges hyghnes, &amp;
brought his enemies to shameful
death, now this thinge remaineth
alone, what cause coulde moue
them, that were so moche bounde
to theyr lorde and mayster, to fall
<pb facs="tcp:4511:50"/>
into such horrible treasons. He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not I dare say that can finde
any iuste cause for any subiecte to
be a traytour to his soueraygne
lorde. And I am well assured, all
men that haue any spot of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
in them, wol thinke these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be taken for traytours, yf
they had but ones thoughte hurte
vnto his personne, of whom they
had receyued so many benefyttes.
There is no cause, &amp; yet me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
I fynd one, whiche although
it be not iuste, yet is it of suche
strength and efficacie, that it can
worke almoste no lesse then it dyd
in these. I say and thynke, who so
euer is of theyr opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in matters
of relygyon, that he can loue the
kynges hyghnes, noo better then
they dyd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is a papiste, an
enemye to goddis worde, he may
<pb facs="tcp:4511:51"/>
well lacke power, or stomacke, to
vtter treason, but he can not lacke
a trayterous hart. what so euer he
be, that thynketh the byshoppe of
Rome supreme hed of our church
of Englande, can neuer beare the
kynge suche an harte, as a trewe
subiecte oweth his souerain lord.
No, I saye more, he can in no case
loue his highnes, he can not chose
but be a traytour. It is to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
and lamented greatly, that
noble men woll thus fondely caste
them selues away, great wonder,
greater pitie, and greatest shame,
that they, hauing the word of god
in theyr owne tonge, woll not yet
lerne, what a kynge is, and what
a bysshop, what lordes owe vnto
thone, and what they may requyre
of thother. My purpose was to
haue handled a good sorte of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:4511:51"/>
whiche I haue gathered out
of the scripture, &amp; doctours both,
makynge for the mayntenance of
the kynges supremytye, and also
shakynge downe that arrogante
and vsurped power of the bisshop
of Rome. I had soo done, but that
I sawe this boke, some what with
the longest, and well perceyued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thother wold haue ben moch lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then this is. I haue differred
it for a while, but god wyllynge, I
woll as sone as I can, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
I owe vnto nobilitie, and the
rest my contrey men, followe that
whiche god wyll prycke me to,
thoughe feble wyt and weake po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
drawe neuer so fast backe. In
the meane season, I humblye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seche
all men, so to take these my
labours, that I maye with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
set vpon thother, whiche as
<pb facs="tcp:4511:52"/>
they woll be moche greatter, so my
truste is, they shall be moche more
profytable. They maye so be, and
shall so be, if it please hym, whiche
worketh all that well is wrought,
vnto whom be all honour, al glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
