            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>The foundation of this Law of Loyaltie, is laid in the conſcience of a Chriſtian man, not <hi>becauſe of wrath onely,</hi> but <hi>for conſcience ſake.</hi> The illation following on the premiſes, is my Text.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that thou haſt commaunded vs, we will do, and whither-ſoeuer thou ſendeſt vs, wee will goe: as wee obeyed Moſes in all things, ſo will we obey thee: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Ioſh.</hi> 1.16.17. So farre then, as GOD is with our Princes, and that their commaunds, bee no preiudice to the ſuperior ordinances of God: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſoule doth owe them ſubmiſſion, and muſt ſweare them their obedience: for whatſoeuer the perſon of the Prince is, <hi>the power is of God:</hi> euen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14112:4"/>
               <hi>Pilates</hi> power is of God, though hee armed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, by our Sauiours owne teſtimonie, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19 11. ſaying, <hi>Thou couldſt haue no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee, except it were giuen thee from aboue:</hi> therefore Chriſt ſubmitted himſelfe to that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, euen hee that could ſay, <hi>To mee is giuen all power in heauen and in earth, Matt.</hi> 28.18.</p>
            <p>Our gratious, ſoueraigne King, reading in the bloudy practiſes of his rebel-Popiſh-ſubiects, the danger of his owne royall perſon, &amp; of his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full poſteritie, hath with the moſt honourable Parliament deuiſed a <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> euen this oath of Allegeance (which is how tendered to vs of his Cleargie of this Dioceſſe) to diſtinguiſh betwixt his <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and his <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> betweene his faithfull, louing, and peaceable Proteſtants, and the tumultuous, factious, and Popiſh Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who deſire to ſee our <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> turned to duſt and aſhes. This Oath wil ſhew him who hath moſt diſciples in his kingdome: this <hi>Paul</hi> our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle that taught the <hi>Romans, omnis anima,</hi> let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſoule ſubmit; or <hi>Paul</hi> the fift that now tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all his <hi>Romiſh Catholiques,</hi> the Contradictorie to his doctrine. <hi>Non omnis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> let not euery ſoule be ſo obliged. I wonder at <hi>Burgeſe</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that being ſo oppoſite to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he would vſurpe his name, at his inveſtiture in the Papacie, except hee meant to ſet <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Palu, Romans</hi> againſt <hi>Romans,</hi> his <hi>Breues</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles; our Apoſtle caſt off a name vpon his conuerſion, that would become
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14112:5"/>
his Holineſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> much better.</p>
            <p>But concerning the power of <hi>Secular</hi> Princes, by this <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, and his vſurping Predeceſſors ſtrangely reſtrained to make their peace with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they doe thus vnderſtand my Text; <hi>They that reſiſt</hi>; that is, <hi>They of the Laity that reſiſt:</hi> for ſaith their Gloſſe, Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and Eccleſiaſticall cauſes are exempt.</p>
            <p>The quarrell is wel knowne between the Pope, and the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> for their iudiciall proceſſe purſued to the execution, and death of a ſowle malefactor of their Cleargie, and the Pope (if he had been ſtrong enough to reuenge ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell) would haue made it knowne much better. Therefore it concerneth his moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, to vnderſtand how his Cleargie affect his gouernement, and what ſubiection and Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they will performe to him: which ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, whether we follow the example of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> who in their purer, and Primitiue times <hi>gaue vnto Caeſar that which was Caeſars,</hi> or whether we reſiſt with the late <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> turning <hi>Caeſar</hi> all into Name, and diueſting him of all his Roialties.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Bernard epiſt.</hi> 42. to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Senona</hi> vrgeth that place of Saint <hi>Paul, omnis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Let euery ſoule be ſubiect:</hi> thus, <hi>Si omnis, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, quis vos excipit ab vniuerſitate? Si quis tentat excipere, conatur decipere.</hi> If euery ſoule muſt bee ſubiect, then yours, that is, thoſe perſons who are Eccleſiaſticall: who excepteth you when hee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14112:5"/>
nameth <hi>All?</hi> hee that aſſayes to except you (of the Church) goeth about to deceiue you.</p>
            <p>Therefore to ſort this Preface to the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the preſent hearing more properly, I learne of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> thus to limit to my ſelfe; <hi>they of the Cleargie, Eccleſiaſticall perſons, that reſiſt, ſhal receiue to themſelues damnation.</hi> And heerein wee haue our high Prieſt for an example, of whom S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Conditor Caeſaris non cunctatus eſt reddere cenſum Caeſari, exemplum enim dedit vobis, vt &amp; vos ita faciatis.</hi> He that made <hi>Caeſar,</hi> payed tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for therein he gaue enſample to you, (to you of the Cleargie) that you ſhould alſo doe the like: thus did Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> teach, who flouriſhed eleauen hundred yeares after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> interpreting this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> vpon this Chapter <hi>lib.</hi> 9. giueth a reaſon, why the Apoſtle in an Epiſtle to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Antiochia, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia, Acts</hi> 15.29 doth only admoniſh them to abſtaine <hi>from things ſacrificed to Idoles, from the ſtrangled, and from bloud,</hi> not adding any prohibition of adulterie, murther, theft, &amp;c. <hi>Superfluum videbatur, ea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina lege prohibere, quae ſufficienter humana lege plectuntur</hi>: It ſeemed to him more then needed by diuine decrees to inhibite thoſe things which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes did ſufficiently puniſh. His collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from hence is very notable, and ſorteth with my preſent Argument: <hi>Ex quo apparet, iudices mundi parte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maxima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei legis implere, omnia enim
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14112:6"/>

            <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great who ſate Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſixe hundred yeares after our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, knew no other, nor taught none other doctrine: for hereof, his Epiſtles giue good witneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour had made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That no olde Souldiers ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or receiued into anie of the Monaſteries, becauſe hee perceiued that many of them vſed this as a ſhift to ſhunne and eſcape from going to the warres, and hee was thereby likely to bee the worſe ſerued: ſuch power had that Chriſtian Emperour to decree in matters concerning the Church, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> then Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:14112:7"/>
grieued at this conſtitution of the Emperor, did not conuent the Emperour to his Conſiſtorie, drew not out againſt him the ſword of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, did not menace him with interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, depriuation, or any other ſhew of Papall iuriſdiction, but as an humble and duetifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, addreſſed to him his earneſt petition, by an Epiſtle, wherein he pleadeth for the Church, and as if it became him ill to conteſt with his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, hee bringeth in Chriſt Ieſus, thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulating with him. <hi>Ego te de notario comitem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubitorum, de comite Caeſarem de Caeſare imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, &amp; patrem imperatorum feci:</hi> In a word, I haue aduaunced thee from lowe to high degree; <hi>Sacerdotes meos tuae manni commiſi.</hi> I haue giuen thee charge and gouernement of my Prieſts, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtr. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 61.</p>
            <p>And to make his ſuite more poſſible, he wrote an earneſt Letter to <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Emperours Phyſician, to intreate him, who might beſt chuſe an opportune time, to ſollicite this requeſt, in which he complayneth, ſaying; <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 64. <hi>Valde mihi durum videtur, vt ab eius ſeruitio milites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibeat, qui dominari illum, non ſolum militibus, ſed etiam Sacerdotibus conceſsit.</hi> It ſeemeth hard to mee, that hee whom God hath made to rule, not only Souldiers, but Prieſts alſo, ſhould reſtraine Souldiers from doing ſeruice to that GOD: So making <hi>Theodorus</hi> his competitor to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for repeale of that Law.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt of that name, was ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14112:7"/>
farre from the preſent Antichriſtian pride of his ſucceſſor, as that he would not ſuffer the Title of Oecumenicall Biſhop to be put vpon him; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in following <hi>Pelagius</hi> his moſt worthy predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. He writ an angry reprehenſion to <hi>Eulogius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for ſtiling him <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhop,</hi> in an Epiſtle ſent to him: And when <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had vſurped that title, he wrot to him to rebuke him for it. And to <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, whoſe loue to him and the Church could haue affoorded him ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a title, he ſaid, whoſoeuer aſſumeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or admitteth of any ſuch title, <hi>Elatione ſua Antichriſtum praecurrit,</hi> he doth fore-runne Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in his pride. He calleth that title, <hi>Ne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ſtultum, ſuperbum vocabulum,</hi> a wicked, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and proud title.

            <p>He would haue ſtaid the pride of that Roman See at the firſt: for when in reſpect of the Empire ſeated at <hi>Rome,</hi> the chamber of that great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, there was giuen the firſt place in Councels to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>: the next ambition was to be chiefe Biſhop: and then to be vniuerſall ouer all the Church, as <hi>Hart</hi> ſaith, the Pope cannot be non reſident, for all the world is his Dioceſſe. and what was then left, but to intrude vpon the rights of temporall Princes, as in ſucceeding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14112:8"/>
times they did, and at this day doe? But we heare God promiſing, <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queenes thy nurces</hi>; not Biſhops, not Popes, and Prelates, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.23. Two proofes let mee but name, becauſe we haue them fully preſſed by moſt learned and iudicious Diuines, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the power of Princes ouer the Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, their inuention of generall Counſells, ſo <hi>Pighius</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Conſtantinus primus auth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And the Church ſtorie ſince Chriſt maketh it plaine, how Emperours and Kings in their ſeuerall dominions, haue both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Counſells, and ſate Preſidents, to order the meeting, to cenſure and puniſh offendours, to keepe them to the point that would digreſſe, and in their abſence to depute ſecular Iudges in their places, and at laſt to diſſolue their meeting at their pleaſure. Yea ſometimes the great Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made requeſt to the Emperour, as <hi>Leo</hi> for example, for the calling a Counſell in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie,</hi> and preuailed not. And laſtly, the Canons of Counſells were by the imperiall power ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and without that ſoueraigne approbation had no ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for Appeales, the Princes haue bin
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14112:8"/>
in the Church, the end of them all, euen in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſticall. More, <hi>Socrates</hi> reporteth <hi>libr.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. That many Biſhops differing in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinitie, Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour conuented them before himſelfe, hee tooke the ſeuerall Coppies of their Doctrines; and praying firſt to God to aſſiſt him, in that holy buſineſſe, that he might chooſe and maintaine his truth againſt all heretical opinions: after mature aduice, hee reſolued vpon the truth of Doctrine, and in the preſence of all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, hee tore in peeces all the reſt: and this truth he did not meaſure by the depth of his own iudgement, but by compariſon with that Canon of Faith, which both holy Scriptures, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Counſells had ſufficiently maintained. And this was in a matter meerely Eccleſiaſticall. And for Eccleſiaſticall perſons; the law of Appeales in our Land, when Popery paſſed for true religion, in the reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, had this Proceſſe, from the Archdeacon, to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, from the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe to the Archbiſhoppe of the Prouince, and from him to the King, which was the finall hearing and determination, beyond which there was no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouocation, but to leaue all to God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we determine, that our Cauſes and our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are all vaſſalles, and ſubiect to our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes; and the immunities and liberties which wee poſſeſſe, wee holde them of the indulgence, and gracious fauour of our moſt worthie, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

Princes, and our <hi>Salomon,</hi> our <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> requireth of his <hi>Cleargie,</hi> no vndue obedience, that the iudgement remaineth moſt iuſt. <hi>They that reſiſt</hi> (euen of the <hi>Cleargie) ſhall receiue vnto themſelues damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They reſiſt this power, who refuſe this Oath of Loyaltie to his moſt excellent Maieſtie, as all Popiſh Recuſants do, who ſet vp a demy-god, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his Paraſite fawneth, and faineth, <hi>De Pontif.</hi> 5.6. <hi>qui poteſt mutare, conferre, &amp; auferre principibus regna</hi>: who hath power to change, to giue, and take away Kingdomes from Princes.</p>
            <p>Our Soueraigne doth not ſet vp an Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to finde out Papiſts, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth to diſcouer Proteſtants: hee doth not make bare ſuſpition quarrell enough to apprehend, conuent, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, racke, and torture men, to force them to ſelfe-accuſation: hee onely deuiſeth to know ſheepe from goates, loyall ſubiects from hereticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells; he is the Image of that King of whom wee reade, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Ecce, rextuus venit tibi manſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etus:</hi> Thy King commeth to thee meeke, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.

Might not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes haue thought his anger iuſt, if it had drawne his Sword againſt all of that Religion, till none of them had beene left, and it had beene no more then the equitie of my Text, for they that reſiſt muſt receiue iudgement heere, by iuſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14112:9"/>
               <hi>who beare not the Sword in vaine,</hi> and heereafter damnation, by the Sentence of the great Iudge of Quicke and Dead. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thought this Sentence iuſt; for thus they ſay to <hi>Ioſhua;</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Whoſoeuer will rebell againſt thy Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, let him be put to death:</hi> And God gaue a fearefull example hereof in the rebellion of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi> The reaſon is giuen by the Almightie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this caſe of oppoſition to ſoueraigne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, why he taketh it ſo to heart: For hee ſaid to <hi>Samuel, They haue not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt me away, that I ſhould not raigne ouer them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In theſe caſes of reſiſting, GOD is moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for his owne Scepter of Rule is touched in them: For <hi>by mee Princes raigne,</hi> ſaith his Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therefore the vſurping pride of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtruggling and wraſtling with the Holy one of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> for the Scepter of Regiment, may now looke, that the cenſure of Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great then Biſhop, giuen vpon the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> ambition of the name of <hi>Oecumenicall,</hi> may turne into a propheſie of theſe times, and then <hi>Elatio tanto citius rumpitur, quanto magis inflatur.</hi> And we may all expect the breaking of <hi>the head of Leuiathan in the great waters. Dauid</hi> ſaid, <hi>they that hate thee haue lifted vp the head.</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon that place ſaith, <hi>Nec capita, ſed caput quando eo peruenturi ſunt, vt etiam illud caput habeant, quod extollitur ſuper omne quod dicitur Deus, &amp; quod colitur, quod Deus interficiet ſpiritu oris ſui:</hi> that is, he ſaith not their heads, but they ſhall lift vp the

head, ſeeing they ſhall come to that paſſe, that they ſhall haue that head <hi>which is lifted vp aboue all that is called God, or is worſhipped, which GOD ſhall deſtroy with the breath of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of my warning to this place, and the time limited to this ſhort Preface to a long buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are both impatient of prolixitie. Let mee therfore addreſſe my ſpeech to you my reuerend Brethren, in the holy Miniſtery of the word of God, to ſtirre you vp, not onely to expreſſe and approoue your owne vndoubted loyalty to your Soueraigne, by your oath publiquely giuen for the ſame, but further, to employ the vttermoſt of your wittes, and tongues, and pennes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſo many of our recuſant brethren, as are not frozen in their dregges of ſuperſtition, but led in blindeneſſe, for want of light, to the vnitie of our Church, and the obedience of our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: and withall, to ſtirre vp the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to zeale and feruour in the cauſe of God, to detect, and purſue recuſant Papiſts, and to lay them at the foote of our gracious Lord the King: For <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith right well; <hi>A King that ſitteth in the throne of Iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his eye, Prou.</hi> 20.8. or if they be ſo grounded in their diſloyalty, that they dread not the power of that Sword which hee beareth, and not in vaine: if they be ſo blinded with ſuperſtition, that they cannot ſee in the Maieſtie of Soueraigne gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ordinance, and Vicegerencle of God. <hi>A wiſe King</hi> (as a wiſe King ſaith) ſcattereth the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14112:10"/>
wicked, and <hi>maketh the wheele to turne ouer them: verſe</hi> 26. Our King hath <hi>Wiſedome like an Angell of God,</hi> to diſpute with them, and confute them: <hi>Euen a diuine Sentence is in the mouth of our King, Prouer.</hi> 16.19. He hath Iuſtice like the Deputy of of the moſt High, to puniſh them that are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, hee hath mercy like the Sonne of God, to manage Iuſtice, with moderation, and to pardon thoſe that offend, not of malitious and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate rebellion, but of ignorant and miſ-led ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. And his ſearch tending to the detection of Gods enemies, I wiſh my Text written by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Gods ſpirit, in the royall heart and hand of our moſt gracious Lord the King, that all his faithfull ſubiects may reade it in his practiſe; <hi>They which reſiſt, ſhall receiue to themſelues iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, what greater diſcouragement to our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, then this, to ſee the bold freedome of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant Papiſts, daring to affront our Church, to impugne our doctrine, to deſpiſe our Biſhops, to ſcorne our Miniſtery, and to pronounce; vs all damned to the ſecond death without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and all this with ſuch aſſurance, as if they had no law to contradict them, or no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to ſee the lawe executed vpon them. God himſelfe hath written a law againſt ſuch, in their bloud, and let Gods ſubordinate Deputies on earth from the King that ſitteth vpon the throne, to the loweſt Magiſtrate truſted with the Sword of Iuſtice, lay to heart the ſpeech of God by his Prophet to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14112:11"/>
let goe out of thy hand, a man whom I appointed to die, thy life ſhall goe for his life.</hi> Let this ſentence fall vpon the Kings enemies, and rather then one haire ſhould fall from the head of the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted for his remiſſenes herein to thoſe whom God hath appoynted to die: let his milke-white mercy be dyed into a crimoſin tincture of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Exurgat Deus, diſsipentur inimici.</hi> Let God ariſe, let his enemies be ſcattered. VVhat their mercy is, the <hi>day ſhall declare it,</hi> the fift of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember ſhall declare it to poſteritie, their vault, their powder, their barres of yron, their logges, and billets of wood, euen all their inſtruments of ſodaine and cruell death, which if men ſhould forgot, God would remember, for though men winke and ſleepe, the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeeth, and God the auenger will ariſe, and <hi>They that reſiſt ſhal receiue to themſelues condemnation.</hi> The Pope that abſolueth others, herein cannot be abſolued. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſealed <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, now liuing &amp; dying in his preſent Religion, to condemnation: and my Text is ſufficient proofe, that no <hi>Romiſh Catholique,</hi> liuing and dying in the obedience of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in diſloyal rebellion, and reſiſtance to their lawfull Soueraignes, can hope by the reuealed will of God to bee ſaued: for his ſinne is <hi>reſiſtance to Gods ordinance,</hi> which is flatte <hi>Theomachie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs all therefore be inſtant and earneſt in the maintenance of this truth: our tepidity and luke-warmeneſſe in religion maketh vs iuſtly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14112:11"/>
to reſemble the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which is threatned to be caſt out of Gods mouth. It is the cauſe of God, it is the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, the cauſe of the Church, the cauſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It is the cauſe of the ſupreame head of the Church and Common-wealth next vnder Ieſus Chriſt, our wiſe, learned, gracious, and peaceable <hi>Salomon.</hi> He is neither good Chriſtian, nor good ſubiect, that is not ſtowe, and confident, in ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and loyall a quarrell.</p>
            <p>I preſume I haue but ſpoken the thoughts and affections of all my reuerend and learned bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the holie Miniſterie; and I ſay no more but <hi>Amen.</hi> Let God ratifie and confirme it: euen ſo be it for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake: to whom with the Father and the holie Spirit, be giuen all glorie, and power, and dominion, now and euermore.
