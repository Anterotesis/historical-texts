            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AFter the Commiſſion read, and the Juries Impannelled, and their appearances Recorded, Six Priſoners were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, <hi>viz. Thomas White</hi> alias <hi>Whitebread,</hi> apprehended on the firſt diſcovery of the Plot, a little Lean very old man in mean Gray Cloaths, who was Provincial of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and ſhould have been, (had their Curſed Deſign hit) Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury; William Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> taken not above five Weeks ago near <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> an Ancient Tall man in Black Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with a Perriwig; a perſon though no good Orator, very Politick, and often mentioned in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Tryal and Letters as a grand Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of miſcheif; <hi>John Fenwick</hi> a middle-Aged man, ſome what Gentilely Dreſſed in a lightiſh Wig, and Gray Campaine Coat; <hi>John Gavern</hi> alias <hi>Gawen</hi> a Short well-ſet man in Gray Cloaths, and looking very plain and ordinary as a Country-man, but in truth a perſon of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite parts and Oratory, who mannaged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Defence on the behalf of his Fellow Priſoners with a great deal of Briskneſs, Subtilty and fine Language; <hi>Anthony Turner</hi> a perſon in Mean Habit, ſhort Perriwig; one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43722:2"/>
that ſaid little for himſelf; and <hi>James Corker,</hi> who preſenting a Petition, alledging that he had not his Witneſſes ready, was put off as to his Tryal till the next day; ſo that the Court at preſent proceeded only with the five firſt named.</p>
            <p>Their Tryal was very tedious, laſting from before nine a Clock in the Morning, to ſeven or Eight in the Evening; the particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we do not here pretend fully and exactly to relate, as well becauſe 'tis not to be done in a ſingle Sheet, as eſpecially for that we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there will ſhortly by the ſpecial care of Authority be a compleat and punctual Account publiſhed, to which we refer the more Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, only deſigning here to give a brief but true Narrative of the moſt obſervable points for the preſent ſatisfaction of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, that they may know what Juſtice was done them, and what in general was proved upon them.</p>
            <p>They were all five Charged in one Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpecially drawn for High Treaſon, and aggravated with all the moſt Horrid Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances immaginable. Firſt, that they Conſpired to Kill and Deſtroy His Sacred Majeſty, and this declared in a threefold Overt act, by Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43722:3"/>
               <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> (the firſt for fifteen hundred Pounds, the ſecond for thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Maſſes to Shoot or Stab him, by Hiring four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruffians to Murther His Majeſty at <hi>Windſor;</hi> by bribing <hi>Wakeman</hi> for fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds to Poyſon him. Secondly, To Subvert the Government, Extirpate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Introduce Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Jury were very Subſtantial Gentlemen, and they made Peremptory Challenges to all that had been on the Tryals of <hi>Coleman,</hi> or any others concerned in this Plot.</p>
            <p>Old Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> on their Arraignment inſiſted that they had formerly been brought to Tryal, and ought not to be twice put in Jeopardy of their Lives for the ſame Fact: But this vain pretence was refuted, by ſhewing that though they were once called to the Bar, yet the Jury was never Charged with them, and conſequently they were never in any ſuch Jeopardy; and beſides here was much new Matter in their Indictment, nor had they any Record to ſhew that they vvere ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Arraigned; vvith vvhich ſeeming to be ſatisfied, they (vvith the reſt) pleaded not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43722:3"/>
As to their Traiterous Deſign of Murthering the King, it was proved upon four of them: that at a general Conſult of Jeſuits <hi>24th. April</hi> 1678. they ſigned a Reſolution to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to Kill the King, and what reward they were to have. That four <hi>Iriſh</hi> men were to do the ſame Villanous Act at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and that Fourſcore Pounds were alotted them for that ſervice, and ſome ſmall Addition made by <hi>Coleman</hi> for Expedition. That <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi> were particularly and principally concerned in theſe Tranſactions, with ſeveral other Intrigues too tedious here to be ſpecified.</p>
            <p>It was further proved that <hi>Gavern</hi> had been appointed to mannage Affairs in and about <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and one of the Evidences (who had not before appeared againſt others, nor was Acquainted formerly with Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> ſo that his Teſtimony was wholly new, which he very Modeſtly and Judiciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered) Proved that the ſaid Priſoner had held Conſultations in the Countrey for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the King, and Subverting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was likewiſe confirmed by another; ſo that upon the whole matter there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43722:4"/>
were four Witneſſes againſt one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, three againſt another, and againſt all of them two each Crime, being all of the ſame nature and Horrid Intention of deſtroying the King, and Subverting the Government.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe a Letter produced, and proved by a very worthy Gentleman to have been taken amongſt <hi>Harcourts</hi> Papers, that purported to be a Summons to a Jeſuit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the ſaid Conſult or Congregation of that Society, on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April;</hi> in which were Directions to this effect, <hi>That they ſhould not come up before the day, nor appear much abroad in Town, for fear of a diſcovery of the Deſign, which its own nature required Secrecy:</hi> This Letter the ſaid <hi>Harcourt</hi> owned to have been written by a Friend of his, but would have avoided the true meaning thereof with a forc'd Interpretation, that ſuch Deſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing but chuſing an Officer of their Brotherhood: But the words could not with any tolerable ſenſe be capable of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: And therefore after all the fair Gloſſes they had put upon it, the ſame was referred to the conſideration of the Jury.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners made a great deal of ſtir, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43722:4"/>
had procured divers perſons from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and moſt of them young Popiſh Students there, to invalidate the Evidence of one of the Principal Evidences; But as they did not well agree in their Tale, but appeared to have been brought hither meerly to ſerve the Priſoners, ſo the ſame was utterly confuted by Corrobarating Evidence for the King. For whereas thoſe young Sophiſters (ready enough to aſſert any thing that their Superiours would ſuggeſt or have them to do) maintained that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at St <hi>Omers</hi> all along throughout <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678. and ſo could not be at the Conſult on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> He on the other ſide produced ſeveral Subſtantial Credible Witneſſes that ſaw him then in and about <hi>London,</hi> and particularly one Gentleman Swore, that on the firſt <hi>Monday</hi> in that <hi>May</hi> he Dined with him: Nay one that was himſelf a Papiſt, and ſuppoſed a Prieſt, Swore that he then ſaw him at <hi>Arundel</hi> Houſe: Nor were they more lucky in ſeveral other of their Allegations, which occaſioned ſometimes great Shouts from the people, to ſee how induſtriouſly, and yet how vainly they went about to Juſtify themſelves with pretences equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fooliſh and falſe.</p>
            <p>Never had Malefactors a more fair and equal Tryal, nor any Court of Juſtice more patience to hear and examine all that the Priſoners could alleadge for themſelves; nor was the method of proceeding leſs mild and and gentle. For whereas they might all have been dealt withall, and juſtly Condemned for Treaſon as Prieſts, that was not inſiſted on, ſo moderate are Proteſtants againſt puniſhing any meerly for being Prieſts, though that be moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably made Capital by our Laws; no cauſe have they therefore, or any of their Faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43722:5"/>
the Seas, to complain of harſh uſage or Clamour about Perſecution: It was not for their Religion they were tryed, but for their abominable Treaſons which were moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently made out againſt them.</p>
            <p>So that after a full hearing of all the Witneſſes they could produce, (though all Romaniſts, who yet were Impartially heard and received) and whatever they had to ſay for themſelves (which rather conſiſted in flouriſhes and little Captious Tricks of Subtilty, than any ſolid Defence to the matters they ſtood Charged with,) they were all moſt juſtly, and to the great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all unprejudiced Auditors, Convicted of the High Treaſon they were Indicted for.</p>
            <p>The next day came on Mr. <hi>Langborn</hi> the Counſellor, who ſhould have been Advocate-General to the Popiſh-Army: It was proved that the Commiſſions were lodg'd in his hands, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other horrid things that he was concern'd in; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that he was ſo curſedly zealous, That when he was told Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> would not accept 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to poiſon the King, but expected more: he ſaid, He was a pitiful narrow-Soul'd Fellow, that would inſiſt on Money for a Work that was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Cauſe; That any good Catholick ought to do it <hi>gratis.</hi> He brought a Regiment of young Seminaries from St. <hi>Omers.</hi> to prove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to have been there at the time he mentioned the Tranſactions to have been at <hi>London,</hi> but as they appear'd to come over only to help him and the reſt out in this pinch, ſo what they alledged was ſufficiently diſproved by the Oaths of divers Perſons of worth and credit. Whereupon after a long hearing of all his Pretenſions, he was convict: And the other five being brought down, they all received Sentence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter'd. And then the Court Adjourned till after the Term.</p>
