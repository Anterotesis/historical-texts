            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the indifferent Readers, be they Protestants, Papists, or neyther, I. R. Catholike Protestant, Professour of Iesus Christ, wisheth all wisdome, and all constancie to hold the trueth being found.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Readers whosoeuer, you shall vnderstand, that not many moneths ago, I, together with others in a search, found some good English bookes, and some two or three English Pamphlets of another stampe and nature, viz. A Popish Rosary of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and diuers Popish pictures in it, circled about with the forme of Beads, (as if all were the holyer, that comes within that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.) We found there amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other things also, a Toy in Rime, entituled, A proper new Ballad, wherein are certaine Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like questions (for so he termeth them) to the Protestant. These two, with an other note booke, written of like argument, I keep by me: and, onely of zeale to the trueth, and of loue to such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple soules, as might be snared with such petty bayts as this Ballad is, I haue taken a little paynes in answering the same as well as I could, being a man of small skill to meddle in greater matters. A Minister of the Citie told me of the same Ballad, before I met with this, and desired me to vndertake the answering of it, &amp; he would helpe me to it, but could not: and therefore till now, by this good occasion, I thought no more of it; although I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, there are many such Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlets, together with other like Romish wares, that are sent abroad among the common people, both Protestants and Papists in London and in the countrey, &amp; that, by certaine women Brokers and Pedlers (as of late in Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire there was) who with baskets on their armes, shal come and offer you other wares vnder a colour, and so sell you these, where they see and know any likelyhood to vtter them. God graunt, that all Magistrates may haue the spirit of Nehemias &amp; Zorobabel, to take and finde them out, and finding them, not to let them go, but to punish them according as the quality of their offence deserueth: for vnder the habit of such, many young
<pb facs="tcp:25073:3"/>
Iesuites, and olde Masse-priests range abroade, and drawe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them. But because I feare I may exceed the bounds of an Epistle, I will draw towards an end: onely I will shewe you how I haue dealt and ordered things in the answering hereof.</p>
            <p>First, I found it set to no certaine tune: but because it goeth most neere to the olde tune of <hi>Labandalashot,</hi> therefore I haue made, that all may be sung to that tune, if neede be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Authour of this Ballad, his skill seemed to me, to be as bad in Poetry, as in Diuinity, and therefore I am here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in driuen sometimes to adde and abbreuiate the Authours par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words, but I faile him not a iote for his owne sense and false meaning: let this bee considered of therefore of all men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Ballad-monger hath deuided his worke into 9. principall parts or heads: and I obserue them in a sort, as shall appeare by the figures set before euery part.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas the conclusion of the Ballad is long, I giue him leaue to goe it through, and then I followe him with mine answere all together, And so with my Epilogue, and a short song of Popery, made long agoe in scorne of Papists foolery, I end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Readers for further satisfaction in this poynt, to M. Crowly his booke, which is an answere in prose to the like questions, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1588.</p>

            <p>THus (good Readers) hauing postingly run ouer this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Rime, as a Priest doeth his Masse and Mattens, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath haste another way, I will come to an end. In this Pamphlet, you haue rather seene my loue and good will, then my wisdome or great skill: but (I trust) you that are well minded, will take the same in good part, (howsoeuer others doe) considering my chiefest purpose herein was, that the simple and ignorant might haue benefit thereby, whom Papists abuse by sending vnto them, such like trumpery, by Popish Pedlers, men and women. The which Pedlers are as ready to do the Papists seruice herein, as the women and merchants were, of whom we read, Ier. 7.16, to 20. &amp; 44.15, to 24. Reue. 18.11, 12, 13. Their Popes wares I call these things: Pardons, <hi>Agnus Deies,</hi> Beades, holy Candels, Paxes, Crosses, Crucifixes, with sundrie sorts of bookes; as Iesus Psalter, Ladies Psalter, Rosaries, &amp;c. which they preferre before the holy Bible and booke of God, and before Dauids Psalter or Psalmes, when yet these bookes of theirs, are most blasphemous and wicked, yea, bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, as is D. Loarts booke and others, in leauing out the second Commaundement, and making two of the last, to fill vp the number of ten.</p>
            <p>But more of this, at some other time, and vpon some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion, when I shall haue a little leysure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Papists some true Catholike questions. And so I end, beseeching God to blesse vs, our Queene and Realme, from all Popery, and Popish gouernment, now and for euer, Amen.</p>
