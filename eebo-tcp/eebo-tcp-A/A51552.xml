            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many curious Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Humane Wit, the communicating Conceptions by the Complication of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters is worthily accounted the most Ingenious, most Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and most Admirable, that an High-flown Fancy in its greatest Sublimity could have produced into the World.</p>
            <p>But who those lucky persons were that first invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, themselves and all other Authentick Authors have left Succession in ignorance of; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Memories have lost those due Celebrations that their Merits have justly deserved.</p>
            <p>Nor are we onely ignorant of the Persons that first invented Letters, but of the Time wherein they were first invented. And though smaller matters of great Antiquity stand recorded for the Information of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57827:4"/>
Posterity, yet no other certainty have we of the Time, than that they were invented before any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story was writ.</p>
            <p>All the light we have of its Original is among Fabulous Authors, who attribute it to several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and some of them no less than Gods; but their Authority being denied, their Say-so stands for no Proof.</p>
            <p>I might amplifie this Discourse by saying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the several Characters of other Nations; but they are largely handled by others, and are alien to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for my Intentions are onely to insist upon three sorts of Characters, which are commonly used in Print among us, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Italick,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Letters.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Originals of these three sorts of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters certainly known, but that we received the <hi>Roman</hi> Letters from the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Italick</hi> from the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> is that Character which is handed down to us from our Forefathers in their Records and other Manuscripts.</p>
            <p>How much Printing has improved the Regularity and Beauty of these Letters is visible by comparing Printed with Written Letters; but especially the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Printing of <hi>Holland,</hi> which does indeed of all others merit the greatest Applause, it being from the cutting of the Steel Punches to the pulling off at the Press managed with greater rCuiosity than hitherto any Nation hath performed it. Neither is it strange it should be so: For, if I may be pardoned for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion, I will say, There is one general Cause why they must, and several particular Reasons why they may, out-do all other Nations in this and other Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57827:4"/>
which will yield them a Profit. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cause is the Necessity of their Countrey, which forces them to deal by Whole-sale in all Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. And this Cause draws in the particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for by this means Manufactures are so improv'd, that most rare Artists flock thither as to a Market, where they are likely to find Trading. And it must necessarily follow, that where so many Curious Art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists meet, each, for his Profit, or Credit, or both, strives to out-do the other. And by this means Art must needs be more improved there, than in those Countries where the Emulation of a Competitor is no Spur to Perfection.</p>
            <p>I finding therefore that the <hi>Holland</hi> Letters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral are in most esteem, and particularly those that have been cut by the Hand of that Curious Artist <hi>Christofel van Dijck,</hi> and some very few others, have elected them for a Patern in <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italicks,</hi> and have given you those Proportions and Dimensions they observed. Even as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> did by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns; for he finding, that among the many sorts of Columns that were standing in his time, Five onely were most acceptable, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Tuscan, Dorick, Ionick, Corinthian,</hi> and <hi>Composite,</hi> surveyed their exact Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and called that Survey, <hi>The Rules of the Five Orders of Arthitecture:</hi> which Rules are followed to this day; but had else doubtless ere now been lost or at least corrupted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Capitals have already been treated of by <hi>Albert Durer</hi>; but he medled neither with the Small Letters nor <hi>Italicks.</hi> Nor were these Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in mode in his time; for he makes his Stem one tenth of the length, when-as now the Stem is made much fatter, for it is one sixth part of the length,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57827:5"/>
which does not onely adde a great Grace to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but renders it more easie to the Eyes in Reading, and more durable either for Inscriptions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
            <p>It is possible my Pains and Endeavours may lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Censure of Detracting <hi>Momes,</hi> who neither know, or are capable to learn the Excellency of Rule and Proportion; and account those Fantasticks that either prescribe or follow them: For, say they, what needs all this ado about Letters, when every Painter or Mason can make them well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these Directions? And if they are not so exact Print Hand, yet they may very well be read, and are as significant as if they were made by these Rules.</p>
            <p>In answer I may say, that every Carpenter can build a great Fabrick; but if he have not consulted the Rules of Architecture, it is very likely his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be preposterous, his several Offices unapt, and his whole Structure deficient, ungraceful, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. But since we all strive to make Columns and other Ornaments in Architecture by Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should be strong, beautiful, and graceful to the Eye, 'tis surely necessary that the Inscriptions (which are commonly placed in the Architrave or some other eminent place) should be likewise regular and beautiful, lest they disgrace both Builder and Building too.</p>
            <p>When the Stadhouse at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> was finishing, such was the Curiosity of the Lords that were the Overseers of the Building, that they offered <hi>C. van Dijck</hi> aforesaid 80 Pounds Sterling (as himself told me) onely for drawing in Paper the Names of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices that were to be painted over the Doors, for the Painter to paint by. Now had these Rules
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57827:5"/>
been published in that time, every Painter might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have done them as well as <hi>van Dijck</hi> himself. For where many Figures are made by the same Rules, every one shall be like every one, although they are made by several Hands. So that I hope no Artists will grudge either at the Rules or Price of the Book, since by it they may easily arrive to the same Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Letters, as he did who was worthily account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the best.</p>
            <p>But this I will say too, that though these Letters were doubtless first invented and contrived to be made with Rule and Compass, (and now doubtless somewhat debaucht from their original Invention) yet after an Artificer hath implanted these general Rules in his Memory, and used his Hand to the making of these Letters, he may be able to perform this Work very well without running over all these Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Besides, the very Draughts of the Letters will shew him what parts of a Letter must be fat or lean, streight or circular.</p>
            <p>Now before I begin with the particular Rules of each Letter, I think it fit to explain the Meaning of some Terms that will be convenient to be used in this Practice; and also to give you an account of the Method to be observed in the Making of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Among Letters some are <hi>Capitals,</hi> some are <hi>Small.</hi> The <hi>Capitals</hi> are the Great Letters, therefore called <hi>Capitals:</hi> as A, B, C, &amp;c. are <hi>Capitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Small</hi> are those Letters that in long Discourses follow the <hi>Capitals:</hi> as a, b, c, d, &amp;c. are <hi>Small Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Among the <hi>Small Letters</hi> some are <hi>Long,</hi> and some are <hi>Short.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57827:6"/>4. The <hi>Long</hi> are the <hi>Ascendents</hi> and <hi>Descendents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Short</hi> are those that stand between the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Foot-line,</hi> such are a, c, e, m, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All the <hi>Capitals</hi> are <hi>Ascendents,</hi> so called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they stand higher than the <hi>Head-line</hi> of the <hi>Short.</hi> And among the <hi>Small</hi> Letters some are <hi>Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> as b, d, h, i, k, l; these reach up to the <hi>Top-line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Descendents</hi> are those that stand lower than the <hi>Foot-line:</hi> such as are g, p, q, y; these reach down to the <hi>Bottom-line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Long</hi> are those that stand as high as the <hi>Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> and as low as the <hi>Descendents; viz.</hi> reach up to the <hi>Top</hi> and down to the <hi>Bottom-line:</hi> such as are <hi>J, Q, f, j, s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>Length</hi> is the Distance between the <hi>Top</hi> and <hi>Bottom-lines:</hi> as the Distance 0, 42 in Letter A is the <hi>Length.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The <hi>Head-line</hi> is the upper line that bounds the <hi>Short</hi> Letter: as Parallel 30 in <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and Parallel 33 in the <hi>English,</hi> is the <hi>Head-line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. The <hi>Foot-line</hi> is the lower line that bounds the Letter: as Parallel 12 in the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italicks,</hi> and Parallel 9 in the <hi>English,</hi> is the <hi>Foot-line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. The <hi>Top-line</hi> is the line that bounds the top of the <hi>Ascending</hi> Letters: as Parallel 42 is the <hi>Top-line.</hi>
            </p>

So that a <hi>Short</hi> Letter of <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italicks</hi> stands between Parallel 12 and Parallel 30, and in <hi>English</hi> between Parallel 9 and 33.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Stem</hi> and other <hi>Fat</hi> strokes of <hi>Capitals Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is 5 <hi>parts.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Stem</hi> and other <hi>Fat</hi> strokes of <hi>Small Roman</hi> is 3 ½ <hi>parts.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Stem</hi> of <hi>English Small Letters</hi> is 4 <hi>parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. If these Letters are made with a Pen, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule is to be observed, That in making them you begin where the Letter may be quickest made. As for Example, If you would make M, you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the <hi>bottom</hi> on the Left Hand; for then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving the Pen off the Paper you make the whole Letter at once, all but the <hi>Footings</hi> and <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,</hi> and then you will find the course and progress
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:57827:7"/>
of the Pen will make those strokes <hi>Lean</hi> which should be <hi>Lean,</hi> and those strokes <hi>Fat</hi> which should be <hi>Fat.</hi> For as the Pen goes upwards, its Nib strikes a <hi>Lean</hi> stroke; but as it comes down its Nib opens wider, and strikes a <hi>Fatter</hi> stroke. So that whatever Tool a Letter is made with, you are to consider it as made with a Pen, and to allow it its <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Lean</hi> strokes accordingly. But in this the Copies of the Letters themselves will more fully instruct you.</p>
               <p n="11">11. You must take special care that you allow the Letter its full length: for because none of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals but the Consonant J and Q are <hi>Descendents,</hi> you may be apt to think that in some cases, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is all Capitals, you may drive up the <hi>top</hi> of the under-line above the <hi>bottom</hi> of the line above it; yet if a Consonant J or Q should come in the matter, you must be forced to shorten it, and so lose its grace. But besides, the whole Inscription will not shew so fair and beautiful, as if this convenient Space be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And if any <hi>Ascending</hi> Letters should happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the J or Q, there would be no room for their Heads.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When I direct you to set off 1, 2, or 3 <hi>parts,</hi> &amp;c. you are to understand it for 1, 2, or 3 <hi>parts</hi> of the Erect line or the Parallel line.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Some Considerations to be had in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Inscriptions, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>If your Inscription be very short, and you have more room to draw it in than you need, you were best make your Letters in <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Italick Capitals,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you may allow to leave two <hi>Spaces</hi> between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57827:8"/>
Letter in the same word. But then you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to leave four Spaces at least between each word; for else there will not be distinction enough between Word and Word proportionable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between Letter and Letter. And you may allow 12 <hi>parts</hi> void between Line and Line, besides the 12 <hi>parts</hi> that are in all Capital Letters (except Q and J) void between the <hi>Foot</hi> and <hi>Bottom-lines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you have not too much room, you may leave but one <hi>Space</hi> between every Letter in a Word, and two or three <hi>Spaces</hi> between every Word.</p>
               <p>If your Inscription must be <hi>Capitals,</hi> and you are pinched for room, you may (but it is not so graceful) leave no <hi>Space</hi> between Letter and Letter; and then one or two <hi>Spaces</hi> between a Word will serve. This by Printers is called <hi>Getting in,</hi> or <hi>Setting close.</hi> But by no means you must put <hi>Spaces</hi> between Small Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the same Word; but you must put one or sometimes two between each Word.</p>
               <p>If your Inscription belong, you were best use the <hi>Small Roman</hi> Letters, because they are much thinner, and are indeed more easily read, and more familiar than <hi>Capitals.</hi> But you must be sure to use a <hi>Capital</hi> Letter in the beginning, and in all Proper Names ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Persons or Places, and many times of things if they bear <hi>emphasis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remember also, if your Inscription be <hi>Roman,</hi> and the Names of Persons or Places fall in, you must make the Names <hi>Italick</hi> Letters, beginning them with a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital</hi> Letter, and sometimes as you would dignifie a Person or Place make the whole Name in <hi>Capital</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>If your Inscription be <hi>Italick,</hi> the Proper Names must be <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57827:8"/>If your Inscription be <hi>Latine,</hi> the small <hi>Roman</hi> is the proper Letter for it; but the Proper Names must be <hi>Italick,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Italick Capitals,</hi> as aforesaid; unless it be the Name of some Vulgar place or thing, for which there is no <hi>Latine</hi> Name, then that Name or Word is to be in <hi>English</hi> Letters; but the first Letter a <hi>Capital,</hi> or (for the Reason aforesaid) all <hi>English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be sure to forecast, that in a large Inscription of a continued <hi>series</hi> of Discourse, each Line be exactly of the same length; unless it be where a Break is proper to be made, for then you may end either in the middle or any where else of the Line. Or unless your Inscription be in Verse, for then also you may end at any length. Yet take notice, that it is not graceful to end a Break with a short word onely in a line, because it seems too like a White-line. But to remedy that inconvenience you may allow more <hi>Spaces</hi> between the words in the former two or three Lines, that so you may have a Word or two the more in your Break-line.</p>
               <p>When you begin new matter after a Break, you must indent your Line four <hi>Spaces</hi> at least, and make the first Letter a <hi>Capital.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you draw a Title over an Inscription, you must consider the words of <hi>emphasis,</hi> and make those words to vary from the Letter your Discourse is in, as either <hi>Roman, Italick,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> according as the words may properly require. But of this and several other Observations of this nature I have written more at large in a Book I intend to publish of the whole Art of Printing. Yet for your present Instructions I shall give you some Examples of Monuments, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57827:9"/>Therefore it will be very necessary you design and draw your Inscription first on Paper, and then either pounce or draw it through by Redding or Blacking the Backside of your Paper, and drawing pretty hard upon the Out-strokes of your Letter with the point of a Needle, made blunt, smooth, and round, for then the Red or Black on the backside of the Paper will deliver it self upon the Wood or Stone that it is to be engraven or painted on. But if the Stone be so smooth and hard that it will not receive and take off the Red or Black, you may rub your Stone over with a little Bees Wax gently, and it will take off the Tracings very exactly.</p>

But thus it is made: Set your Compasses to 9 ¾, and placing one Foot in Parallel 21 ¾ Erect 9 ¾, (as at 1.) with the other Foot describe the under part of the arching Belly from Parallel 17 ½ to Parallel 22; then set your Compasses to 8 ½, and placing one Foot in Parallel 20 Erect 8 ¼, (as at 2.) with the other Foot describe the upper part of the arching Belly. Then set your Compasses to 8, and placing one Foot in Parallel 22 Erect 12, (as at 3.) with the other Foot describe an Arch for the inside of the Belly. Then set your Compasses to 5, and placing one Foot in Parallel 34 Erect 8 ½, (as at Fig. 4.) with the other Foot describe almost a Circle for the outside of the Head; through this Circle draw a Perpendicular Diametral line, (as <hi>a, b</hi>) and from the point <hi>a</hi> set off in the Circle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand 2 parts, (as at <hi>c</hi>) and set off 2 parts towards the right hand from <hi>b</hi> to <hi>d</hi> through the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57827:26"/>
Diametral <hi>c, d,</hi> draw another Diametral line at right angles, as <hi>e, f.</hi> Then in the point where this Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral line cuts the Circle of the Head, as at the point <hi>e,</hi> set off on the Diametral line 3 ½, <hi>viz.</hi> one Stem, and with your Compasses set to 5, (as before) place one Foot in the Point set off, and extend the other on the Diametral line, and placing it there, with your first Foot describe the inner Arch of the Head on the left hand. Then set off also 3 ½, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Stem on the right hand from the Intersection of the Diametral and the Circle, and place one Foot of your Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (being set to 5) there, extending the other on the Diametral towards the left hand, and on that point with the other Foot describe the other inner Arch of the Head, which meeting of the two Arches at the Top and Bottom you must work into an Oval. Then set your Compasses to 32, and placing one Foot in the point where Erect 6 cuts the under part of the outer Circle of the Head, with the other Foot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe towards the Bottom-line on your left hand an occult Arch. And removing one point of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes to Erect 17 Parallel 15, with the other Foot describe another occult Arch to intersect the former, (as at 5.) and on this point as on a Centre describe an Arch for the inside the Diagonal Stem. Then draw a straight line from the middle part of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Stem, and set off on it from the Centre 5, 3 ½, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Stem, and placing one Foot of your Compasses as before, (as at Fig. 6.) with the other describe the outer Arch of the Diagonal Stem. The Tail of the Diagonal Stem is made by setting your Compasses to 6 ½, and placing one Foot in Parallel 18 ½, Erect 22, (as at Fig. 7.) with the other describe the under Arch of the Tail as far as Parallel 15 Erect 27. The upper
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57827:27"/>
Arch of the Tail is made by setting your Compasses to 4 ½, and placing one Foot in Parallel 17 Erect 24, (as at Fig. 8.) with the other describe it; onely the end of the Tail must be wrought into a sharp point. The Arch above the Diagonal Stem is made by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Compasses to 24, and placing one Foot in Parallel 33 Erect 1, (as at 9.) with the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the outer Arch. Then remove your Compasses to Parallel 32 Erect half less than 0, (as at Fig. 10.) with the other describe the inner Arch.</p>

                  <p>Having given you such full Instructions upon the Roman Capitals and Small Letters, I think it needless to give you Copious Rules upon the Italick or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Letters, the Paterns being so large that every Member in them are distinct and intelligent, and the Manual Operations so much the same in all, that the Scales down the side and in the Bottom-line serve for an ample Discourse upon every one of them.</p>

               <head>Of Italick Letters.</head>
               <p>ITalick Letters seem to be derived from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, because its shape is so like the Roman, that its Members differ in very few Letters from it; onely the Stems of the Roman are perpendicularly upright, and the Bellies are circular, but in the Italick the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57827:27"/>
Stems are aslope, and the Bellies are oval. The slope of the Stems are ¼ of the whole depth of the Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> 10 ½ parts set off from a Perpendicular on the left hand in the Top-line, and a line drawn from the same Perpendicular in the Foot-line to the 10 ½ in the Top-line, as in Letter <hi>A, F</hi> From 1 to 2 is the slope of the Letter.</p>
               <p>Those Letters that have Bellies, as <hi>a, b, c, d, e, q,</hi> have the inside of their Bellies Ovals, whose greatest Diameter is 18 parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole length of a Small Letter, and its least Diameter 6 parts; which Oval is so set aslope, that half a part lies below the Head-line, and ⅔ parts above the Foot-line; so that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the Oval into the Head-line, and below the Oval into the Foot-line, you may make the Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Head and Foot of the Belly; but how the Belly fattens downwards, you may best see by the Paterns themselves.</p>
               <p>The Beaks of Letters project 3 parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Stem from the Stem towards the left hand, and lie at the point of the Beak 1 part below the Top-line; so that a straight line drawn from the Top of the right hand line of the Stem to the point of the Beak is the upper bounds of the Beak; and 1 set off in the left hand line of the Stem under the lower bounds of the Beak is the thickness of the Beak, so that a straight line drawn from that point to the end of the Beak is the lower bounds of the Beak.</p>
               <p>The Nose of Small Letters project also 3 parts, <hi>viz.</hi> one Stem from the Stem of the Letter, and the point of it lies three parts below the Head-line.</p>
               <p>The Tails are made just like the Beaks, if you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Foot were turned into the Head-line.</p>

               <head>Of the English Letters.</head>
               <p>THis sort of Letters by the Fatness of the Stems seems to be first invented for durable Records: For from these Letters seems to proceed the several Court-hands of Law, Chancery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Although the most parts of these Letters, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Small, are straight lines, which are to be drawn by the side of a Ruler, yet are few of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Capital Letters Arches of Circles, and therefore cannot well be described with Compasses, but are made without Geometrical Considerations, onely by Judgment and good Command of Hand; because the Inventers contented themselves to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected rather by the Humours of the Pen (which oft differs according to the temper of the Quill and shape of the Nib, and a Traditional Observance, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be equal in all Hands or Wits) than those nice Symmetrical Proportions which would have preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them in all Ages in the same Youth and Beauty they were in at the first; whenas now not onely Manuscripts, but many printed Books differ in the shape of their Letters among themselves.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that these Paterns cannot be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable with all English Letters; yet have I elected them which are now most in mode, and in my Judgment the best. Onely I have in some few parts (where I think all Ingenious Contrivers would acknowledge Error) corrected them.</p>
               <p>The Fatnings, Returnings of Angles, Distances of Joynings, and other niceties, are better seen by the Paterns, than learnt by many words of Descriptions on them. And therefore I have divided (like the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57827:28"/>
the Plain they stand on into 42 equal Parallel parts of the Depth, and through every sixth part you may draw a small straight line; and also divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bredth or thickness of the Letter into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny equal parts called Erects, Parallel to each other, as is requisite; for each Letter you may also draw a small straight-line downwards, so that the Parallel lines and these Erects may cut each other at right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, which will divide the Plain into so many Squares as each Letter is made on. And by these Squares you may observe how every Member and part of a Member in a Letter passes from the Top to to the Bottom-line, and from the right hand to the left, and by making a Plain with the same number of Squares, you may carry on the several strokes from Square to Square, as you find them in your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns.</p>
               <p>But as I have given you full Instructions for the making the Roman Letters, so shall I give you some few Directions, which may serve to inform you in all the Rules that belong to these Letters, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Small, because they consist almost wholly of straight lines.</p>
               <p>The Stem of the Capitals (as was said before) is 6 parts, the Stem of the Small Letters 4 parts. The Foot-line lies in Parallel 9, the Head-line lies in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel 33. The Return Angles of those straight lines that proceed from the Head-line and from the Foot-line are 4 parts, <hi>viz.</hi> one Stem below the Head-line, and 4 parts above the Foot-line.</p>
               <p>The Fatness of the Stem is made by occult Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches placing one Foot of your Compasses on the Return Angles, as in <hi>A</hi> at 1 and 2, and with the other Foot describing the Arches 3 and 4; so that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57827:29"/>
a straight line drawn through the Convex points of these two Arches shall give the Fatness of the Return Angle. The like in all other Letters, as you have been taught in Roman Letters.</p>
               <p>The Beaks of the Small Letters, as <hi>v, h, k, l, s,</hi> are 1 part broad and long, and end in a point. The upper stroke of these Beaks proceed from the Head-line.</p>
               <p>The Cloven Tops of <hi>v, h, k, l,</hi> project on the left hand 1 part over the Stem, and the point where it divides in the Stem lies in 1 ½ below the Top-line, at 1 ½ distance from the right hand side of the Stem, as you may see in the Paterns.</p>
               <p>The strokes of <hi>f, t, &amp;,</hi> lie in the Head-line and 1 part below it, projecting over the Stem 1 part on the left hand, and 2 parts on the right hand.</p>
               <p>More Observations I think needless, because the Letters themselves are so demonstratively laid down on the Plain. Onely some have made all these Small Letters with little Beaks on the Angle of every Return, because the Humour of the Pen may be made to give them; but I account them Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Troublesom, and Affectatious. Therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them plain as they lie in the Squares, whereby they will stand more close, become more regular, be quicker made, and more distinct and intelligent to the Eye; yet such as affect them so may make them at their own discretion, by projecting on the Angles 1 part, as you are taught to do the Beaks.</p>
