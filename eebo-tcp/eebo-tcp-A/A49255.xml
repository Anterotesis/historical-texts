            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Love</hi>'s books
have found with ſober and
ſolid Chriſtians, as it hath
occaſioned the publiſhing of more treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

hath imboldned ſome without our
knowledge and conſent, to thruſt forth
ſome imperfect Copies under M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Love</hi>'s
name; concerning which we will only
ſay, that the want of our atteſtation (to
whoſe care the publiſhing of his ſermons
were intruſted) is ground enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them as ſuſpected and ſuppoſitious to
the ſerious and deliberate Reader.</p>
            <p>Amongſt ſome other Sermons of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Love</hi>'s, which have been printed by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

unhappineſſe to be very haſtily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely
publiſhed, being never peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by any of us, or compared with his
own Notes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96119:3"/>
Now that theſe two, very uſeful tracts,
may be fit to be joined with the reſt of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Love</hi>'s works, the Reader is deſired to
know, that they have been diligently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
with the Notes written with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Love</hi>'s own hand, and have been corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from very many faults, with which
the former Edition abounded, and moſt
of them materiall.</p>
            <p>We will add no more but this; that in
the Polemicall part of theſe diſcourſes, as
we approve the authors judgement to be
ſound and orthodox: ſo we beleeve, that
had he lived to publiſh his own labours,
this and other books had come forth more
anſwerable to the learning, piety, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
parts of the Author. We commend
thee to God, and the word of his Grace,
which is able to build thee up, and to give
thee an inheritance amongſt thoſe that
are ſanctified.</p>

               <q>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions to

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pſalme treats of the bleſſedneſſe of a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of a pardoned ſinner; touching which, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
particulars are handled. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
handles, wherein the forgiveneſſe of ſin
conſiſts, that he mentions under two expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Verſe 1. <hi>Bleſsed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven,
whoſe ſin is covered:</hi> the forgiveneſſe of ſin conſiſts, firſt in
the <hi>covering</hi> of ſin: the covering of ſin not from God, but
by God, ſo it is explained by God himſelfe, <hi>Pſal. 85.</hi> verſ.
2. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm 85. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

            </p>
            <p>It is ſin in us to hide our ſins: as it is ſin to hide our
talents, ſo it is ſin to hide our ſin; therefore when the
Pſalmiſt ſaith the forgiveneſſe of ſin conſiſts in the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſin, this covering is underſtood of Gods covering.
Which is not to be underſtood of a totall abolition or
Extirpation of ſin, but of ſuch a covering of it, as it ſhall
never be imputed for condemnation and that is a ſecond
expreſſion to ſet out Gods pardoning ſin. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This forgiveneſſe is ſet out <hi>by not imputing of ſin,</hi>
verſ. 2. Sin ſhall not be imputed unto a juſtified perſon,
though ſtill it ſhall be inherent in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Pſalmiſt ſhews the Character of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96119:7"/>
man whoſe ſin is pardoned, verſ. 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in
whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> If ſin be pardoned to the ſoule,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Here is laid down the happineſſe of a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, verſ. 3. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old,
through my roaring all the day long:</hi> yet for all this <hi>David</hi>
cals him bleſſed; though Gods hand was heavie upon him,
yet his heart was ſtill towards him; yet a bleſſed man,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, Here is laid down the courſe that the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
took to procure pardon of ſin, that is in my Text,
<hi>I ſaid, I will confeſse my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou
forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> Thus I have brought you
by the hand to the Text. I ſhall give you a ſhort para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
of the words: <hi>I ſaid,</hi> this word implies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
phraſe three things.<note place="margin">Pſalm 14. 1.</note> Firſt, it notes a deliberation or
conſideration of the minde, <hi>Pſal 14.</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>The fool hath
ſaid in his heart, there is no God:</hi> (that is) he hath thought
ſo in his minde,<note place="margin">Pſalm 30. 6.</note> that there is no God. <hi>Pſal. 30.</hi> verſ. 6.
<hi>And in my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved:</hi> that is,
I thought ſo. Saying, is not alwaies an act of the tongue,
but ſometimes of the minde: I <hi>ſaid I will confeſse my ſin,</hi>
that is, I have bethought my ſelfe, and conſidered in my
minde, that it is meet for me to get pardon and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
my ſin to God, <hi>I ſaid.</hi>

what the minde reſolves upon, <hi>Pſal. 39.</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>I ſaid I

               <note place="margin">Pſalm 39. 1.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, I did look to my waies,

this, I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion, I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
it ſo in my minde, and it is good and meet ſo to
do, I have purpoſed and reſolved in my will, and am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96119:7"/>

their ſins, but they blame not themſelves but God,
the ſtars, and what not. It is worth your notice, that ſin is
expreſt by three words in this Text; firſt, <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>iniquity,</hi> and thirdly, <hi>ſin; I will comfeſse my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> There are but
four places as I remember in the Scripture where in theſe
three words are joyned together in one verſe, <hi>Tranſgreſsion,
Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Sin. Exod. 34.</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi>

            <p>Levit. 16,<note place="margin">Levit. 16. 21.</note>

            <p>

            <p>In theſe four places the words are uſed in Scripture,
and in my Text, but not elſe as I remember throughout
the word of God: and becauſe theſe three words are here
uſed, Interpreters take much pains to finde out ſome
material diſtinction between them: her is <hi>Tranſgreſſion,
Sin,</hi> and <hi>Iniquity;</hi> I have conſulted with many, and the
trueſt account I can give you is this; <gap reason="foreign">

to a great height. Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> ſignifies evils

them all one. Therefore we need not make further curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enquiry after the diſtinction of theſe words, <hi>And
thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin. The iniquity of my ſin;</hi>
There is ſome diſagreement about the ſenſe of theſe
words, what it is for God to forgive the iniquity of ſin:
By the iniquity of ſin, ſome do underſtand the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ſin deſerves: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>Iniquity,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> the ſame word here is

there is the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: therefore in ſome tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it is read thus, <hi>Thou for gaveſt the puniſhment of my ſin.</hi>
Secondly, others here do underſtand by the <hi>iniquity of ſin,</hi>
(with whom I do concure) ſin with all its aggravations,
with all its hainous circumſtances, ſin with all its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
<hi>Thou doſt forgive the iniquity of my ſin:</hi> moſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

confeſſe ſin, but they do confeſſe ſin as againſt God,
that is, they do confeſſe ſin as if. God were the author of
ſin, that charge him to be the patron of their impiety and
wickedneſſe, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion againſt
myſelfe.</hi> Fourthly, The object of this duty, <hi>I will confeſs
my transgreſſion to the Lord:</hi> and this beloved takes off
Auricular confeſſion, uſed and ſtood on much in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Confeſſion that God cals for, and the
Scripture cals for, is in ſecret between God and your
own ſouls; when conſcience ſhall ſuggeſt guilt to you in
reference to your former miſdoings, when you can pour
out your ſoul in complaint to God, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe
my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</hi> Fifthly and laſtly, The iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
and event of this duty; <hi>and thou forgaveſt the iniquity
of my ſin:</hi> obſerve the connexion; here is a connective
particle, <hi>and</hi> thou forgaveſt: he doth not come with an
<hi>Ergo</hi> or a <hi>Quare,</hi> not with a cauſal, but with an <hi>et,</hi> a copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
<hi>and</hi> thou forgaveſt; not J confeſſe ſin, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
I am forgiven; but I confeſſe ſin, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>and</hi>
thou haſt forgiven me. Forgiveneſſe of ſin is not laid
down as an effect flowing from a cauſe, but as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
flowing from an antecedent. Indeed the Papiſts
plead much for merit, becauſe ſometimes cauſal particles
are uſed, but this is beyond my Text: thus much for the

men muſt never leave confeſſing of ſin: as long as ſinne
leaks into thy ſoule, thou muſt ſo long be pumping;
confeſſion is to the ſoule as a pump to the ſhip. O what
leaks into thy heart by heedleſneſſe and careleſneſs, pump
out by confeſſion. Till thou art above the actings of

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> A ſecond rule to guide thee in the matter of confeſſion
of ſin to God is this: Make conſcience to confeſſe your
ſmall and ſecret evils as well as your open and groſſer

of thy countenance, <hi>Pſal. 90. 8. Thou haſt ſet our iniquities

me from ſecret faults.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> did not onely confeſſe his murder of <hi>Vriah,</hi> his

heart ſmote him for cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it was onely the appearance of revenge, he had his
knife neere his throte: that which had the appearance of
a ſin, <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him for.</p>
            <p>Conſcientions men do not onely bewail and confeſſe
open and groſſer evils; but the ſecret and the ſmalleſt
corruptions of the heart they bewaile to God: they
confeſſe their ſecret pride, their ſecret worldlineſſe, and
ſecret murmurings againſt God, they confeſſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

            <p>Indeed wicked men fall ſhort of this: wicked men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their Groſſe and their open ſins, but do dot take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

for this, one is in <hi>Cain, Cain</hi> confeſt his murder, his

               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Gen. 4. 13. And Cain ſaid unto

did not confeſſe his emnity that made him murder his

more ſlie and ſecret evils. Thus you read likewiſe of
<hi>Judas, Judas</hi> confeſt his betraying of Chriſt (a groſſe ſin)

his murder in betraying Chriſt, did not confeſſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
his covetouſneſſe and hypocriſie, that were more

conſcience to confeſſe ſmall and ſecret evils, as well as
open and groſſer ſins.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>3</label> Third Rule touching confeſſion of ſin unto God is this,
When you confeſſe and acknowledge ſecretly your ſins
unto God, labour to greaten your ſins with all the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
circumſtances and heart-humbling aggravations
you can imagin. Thus the ſervants of God uſed to do,
when they confeſt ſin unto God, they would confeſſe
ſin with all the heinous circumſtances, <hi>1 Kings 8. 47. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
We have ſinned, and have done perverſly, we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
wickedneſs.</hi> Saith <hi>Lorinus,</hi> Mark what a heap of
words a heart-humbled ſoul will lay together in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
of ſin; <hi>We have ſinned,</hi> there is one word; <hi>We have
done wickedly,</hi> there is a ſecond; <hi>and we have done per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly,</hi>
there is a third. A notable inſtance you have of
<hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Act. 26. 10, 11.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Which thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem,
and many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
authority from the chief Prieſts; and when they were put
to death, I gave my voice againſt them. And I puniſhed them
oft in every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme, and
being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even
unto ſtrange Cities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Paul</hi> comes to aggravate his ſin: there are eight
aggravations that here <hi>Paul</hi> doth lay down of his ſinne,
wherby he would greaten ſin unto himſelf that he might
be the more humble.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of all, they were not ordinary men that he caſt
into priſon, but they were <hi>Saints,</hi> and to wrong them
is a ſacriledge, <hi>the Saints have I caſt into priſon.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, To caſt a man into priſon for debt is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice 
if the man be able to pay: <hi>but many have I caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
priſon,</hi> why? <hi>for profeſſing the name of Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi>
meerly for profeſſing <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If it had been but one or two Saints it were
not much, but they were a greater number, <hi>Many of the
Saints did</hi> I <hi>caſt into priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96119:14"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, he aggravates his ſin further: to caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
priſon and give them in priſon liberty, is not much,
but he <hi>ſhut them up in priſon,</hi> and kept them cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If he had reſted there, it had not been much,
but <hi>he gave his voyce againſt them to put them to death.</hi>
Nay,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, He goeth higher, for he did wrong to their
ſouls too, for <hi>he compelled them to blaſpheme God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, To aggravate it further, he was mad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>was exceedingly mad againſt them;</hi> hee
was mad with rage, and with paſſion, and with fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, I <hi>did perſecute them to ſtrange Cities;</hi> them I
did not kill, I made them leave their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and made them run and ſhift for their lives into
ſtrange corners. This is the nature of a true penitent, not
to confeſſe ſin ſlightly and careleſly, but in confeſſion of
ſin to cloath his ſins with all aggravations that can be;
In confeſſion of ſin we ſhould aggravate it that we have
ſinned againſt mercies, correction, warnings, reſolutions,
checks of conſcience, motions of the Spirit, &amp;c. and this
is a good Rule if you will follow it: You have the like
inſtance in the book of <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 9. v. 5.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 5.</note> 
               <hi>We have ſinned

in confeſſing of his ſin, to aggravate his ſin; how
doth <hi>Daniel</hi> cloath his confeſſion? Firſt, <hi>We have ſinned,</hi>
there is one. Secondly, <hi>We have committed iniquity.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>We have done wickedly.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>We have re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>belled

precepts.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>We have not hearkned unto thy ſervants.</hi>
Seventhly, <hi>Nor we nor our Princes, nor all the people of the
Land:</hi> There are ſeven aggravations which <hi>Daniel</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96119:14"/>
up to his confeſſion: Thus <hi>David</hi> when he would

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>4</label> A fourth Rule in confeſſion of ſin is this, In your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
look not diſcouragingly on God as an angry
Judge, but hopefully, as on a diſpleaſed Father; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
ſin to God as an angry Judge, is to make you but
condemned Malefactors in your confeſſions; therefore
make confeſſion to God only as a diſpleaſed Father: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
men do confeſſe ſin to God as a Father: whileſt
you have an eye of ſorrow upon ſin, you are to have an
eye of hope upon pardon, thus Gods people did in their
confeſſions. To confeſſe ſin to God as a Judge, is to howl
like dogs becauſe you ſhall be beaten: but to confeſſe
ſin to God as an angry Father, is child-like with a fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
confidence of pardon.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Dan. 9. 9. To the Lord our God
belong mercies and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <hi>one of the

againſt our God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>

goe to my Father,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 18.</note> and will ſay unto him, Father, <hi>I</hi> have ſinned
againſt heaven and before thee.</p>
            <p>Though he was a Prodigal, yet he would goe to God
as to a father. In confeſſion you are to go to God hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as to a diſpleaſed father: confeſſions when they
come to God as a Judge, create fear, horrour, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the conſcience, but when confeſſions are mingled
with hope, and come to God as a Father, they work a
holy brokenneſſe of heart, a holy tenderneſſe and remorſe
on the conſcience. We ſhould confeſſe our ſins to God
as a Patient confeſſeth his diſeaſe and bodily diſtemper to

               <hi>A fift Rule in confeſſion of ſin unto God is this, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not your ſelves with ſlight and ſuperficial confeſſions

            <p>Leave not confeſſing of ſin, until ſhame hath filled your
face, and ſorrow hath filled your heart: it is a great
fault in many people, if they confeſſe their ſin, in crying
God mercy in a general way, they think they have made
God a compenſation for all the injuries they have done
him, though they never have any godly ſorrow for their
ſins: but beloved you are not to content your ſelves

thy heart ſtraitned in confeſſing preſent guilt and preſent

guilt and ancient ſins: This is a very uſeful thing in a
mans Chriſtian courſe. It may be a man or woman
profeſſing Chriſtianity, may not know the ſins he, or ſhe
hath done this laſt week; for want of heedfulneſſe and
obſervation of their waies: in that caſe let them recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
what they have done many years agoe, recollect old
ſins, when new ſins do not come to remembrance, and be
humbled for them: thus <hi>David</hi> did, in <hi>Pſal. 51. 3. For I

this rule, not that a godly man, who is under trouble of
minde ſhould take this courſe to collect old ſins, this
may lead him to deſpair; but in caſe of barrenneſſe, if
any man wants matter in reſpect of preſent ſinnes,
and findes his heart hard and very inſenſible in ſecret
prayer unto God, in that caſe he is bound to let conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>7</label> Laſtly take this Rule, take more freedom in confeſſion
of ſin in ſecret before God, then in publick before men;
To provoke you to practiſe this Rule, conſider two
things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Firſt, it is not fit to confeſſe all the evils you have 
done before men, and if there were no argument to prove
ſecret prayer this were enough, that it is not fit for a
man to confeſſe all the ſins of his life before men. <hi>Zach.
12. 12. And the Land ſhall mourn every family apart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

Thou art a poor profeſſor, that doſt confeſſe what
thou confeſſeſt in publick onely, and never in private,
thou art but a barren profeſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Again conſider this, that though we read of wicked 
men that have made great confeſſion of ſin unto God, yet
we never read in the Scripture that wicked men ever
made conſcience to confeſſe ſin to God in ſecret. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
(you know the ſtory) confeſt his ſin unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and
unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> but we never read that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> confeſt his
ſin unto God.<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Exod. 9. 27. And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſent and called
for</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and ſaid unto them, I have ſinned this

            </p>
            <p>Saul <hi>confeſt his ſin unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>but we never read of
his confeſſing ſin unto god.</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 24. And <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid

               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 24. 30.</note> I have ſinned, for I have tranſgreſsed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement

ſinned, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judas</hi> confeſt his ſin, but to whom was it? to the High
Prieſt and to the Phariſees, but <hi>Judas</hi> never went into a
corner and in ſecret to bewail bloodſhed: wicked men
have made publick confeſſions of ſin, but in ſecret between
God and their own ſouls they never made acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96119:16"/>
and confeſſion of their evils unto God: thus much
for the third Quere.</p>
            <p>The fourth Quere is this, Wherein appears the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a gody mans making confeſſion of ſin unto God,
and between thoſe confeſſions of ſin in wicked men: and
there are theſe eight differences.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Holy confeſſion in godly men, makes the ſoul
to be more active and inquiſitive after cure, remedy, and
pardon for ſin: holy confeſſion makes the ſoul induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
I confeſſe ſin, but how ſhall I ſubdue ſin? I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
ſin; but how ſhall I get pardon for ſin? It
makes it enquire how to get cure and remedy for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
which before were confeſt. <hi>Job. 7. 20. I have ſinned,
What ſhall I do unto thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 7. 20.</note> 
               <hi>O thou preſerver of men? &amp;c. I
have ſinned,</hi> there is his confeſſion: <hi>Lord what ſhall I do?</hi>
there is his induſtry. Thus the Jewes they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by <hi>Peter</hi> of their great ſin, inſomuch as they cryed
out,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> 
               <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> But falſe confeſſion leaves
men idle, and careleſſe: confeſſe they do, but they are
not inquiſitive how to get pardon for thoſe ſins they do
confeſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Holy confeſſion of ſin unto God in godly
men, is attended with remorſe of conſcience, and with
grief of heart. <hi>Pſal. 38. 18. For I will declare mine iniquity,
I will be ſorry for my ſin:</hi> there is confeſſion and ſorrow
joyned together.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 12. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Hoſ. 12. 4.</hi> Yea he had power over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and prevailed, he wept and made <hi>ſupplication unto him.</hi>
Whileſt confeſſions are in the mouth, there will be either
tears in the eye, or ſorrow in the heart, if confeſſion be
true.</p>
            <p>The wicked confeſſe ſin, but tey never grieve for the
ſins they have committed, they are not aſhamed, neither
can they bluſh, in the Prophets language.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, A godly man in confeſſion of ſin, hath more
freedom of ſpirit to confeſſe his particular ſins in ſecret,
then he hath in publick: <hi>I have powred out my ſoul before
God,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: confeſſion of ſin is a pouring out
of the ſoul <hi>before God;</hi> he that can pour forth complaints
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96119:16"/>
againſt ſin in ſecret more then in publick, is a grecious
man</p>
            <p>The wicked are only for confeſſion of ſin before men,
and not before God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Fourthly, Godly men confeſſe ſin freely, out of a 
willingneſſe they have to be rid of ſin: wicked men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
ſin, with confeſſions extorted and drawn from them
as men on a rack whether they will or no. Godly men
confeſſe ſin freely, they are freely willing to part with
their luſts,<note place="margin">Job 32. 18, 19, 20.</note> therefore they confeſſe them to God, <hi>Job. 32.
18. For I am full of matter, the ſpirit within me conſtraineth
me.</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>Behold my belly is as wine that hath no vent,
it is ready to burſt like new bottles.</hi> Verſe 20. <hi>I will ſpeak
that I may be refreſhed, I will open my lips, and anſwer.</hi> Thus
a godly man in confeſſing ſin his belly is as ready to burſt
with new wine, he muſt needs have vent, elſe he is broken,
he muſt needs confeſſe ſin, his ſin drives him to God. But
confeſſion is extorted and wreſted from wicked men. It
was the plagues of Egypt upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 1.</note> that wrung con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
from him: before theſe he would ſay, <hi>Who is the
Lord?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 3.</note> It was pangs and horrour of conſcience in <hi>Judas,</hi>
that forced him to acknowledge he had ſinned in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent blood. Mariners caſt over their goods,
not that they hate them, but as they are forc't to do it to
eſcape drowning; when there is a ſtorm and a tempeſt
in their conſciences, then men are forc't to confeſſe ſin, it
is by compulſion, it is not voluntary.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, A godly man is conſcious to confeſſe ſecret 
and ſmall ſins, as well as groſſe wickedneſſe. <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
his pride and carnal confidence in numbring
the people, as well as his adultery with <hi>Bathſheba:
David</hi> confeſt the cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, as
well as ſpilling the blood of <hi>Vriah.</hi> But hypocrites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their groſſe ſins, but not their ſmall ſins. <hi>Cain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
his murder, but not his bad offering: they confeſſe
their groſſe ſins but not their ſmaller. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> confeſt
his oppreſſion of the children of Iſrael, but he did not
confeſſe the hardneſs of his heart. But godly men though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96119:17"/>
they have not ſo many groſſe and open evils, yet ſmall
and ſecret evils pinch their conſciences, and trouble
their ſpirit. Thoſe evils which will not break a wicked
mans ſleep, will break their hearts: what though they
have not uncleanneſſe in the fleſh? what though they
have eſcaped the pollutions of the world? yet they know
they have ſecret and inward defilements on the ſpirit:
and theſe they bewaile, and theſe they acknowledge to
God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A ſixth difference is this, that godly men are diſtinct
and clear to confeſſe their particular ſpecial evils that
have moſt predominancy over them. Beloved, obſerve
this; Wicked men in their confeſſions are confuſed, and
only run in general that they are ſinners; Juſt like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himaaz</hi>
when he would bring tydings to <hi>David,</hi> touching
the iſſue of the battel with <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I
ſaw a tumult,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 29.</note> 
               <hi>and I heard a noyſe, but I know nothing.</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men will tell you that their ſins do make a noyſe
within them, but they can tell you nothing diſtinctly,
and nothing particularly, but only go at randome.
Wicked men in confeſſing ſin are like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,
Dan. 2.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He dreamt ſomething but he could not tell what it was:</hi>
Wicked men dream of ſins and think of them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
as a man in a dream; but when, how, and where,
and with what aggravating circumſtances they know
not: they have not a diſtinct and clear view of their
corruptions. The people of God do in their confeſſions
ſingle out their ſpecial luſts and ſay thus did the people
of Iſrael.<note place="margin">Judg. 10. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Judg. 10. 10.</hi> Thus <hi>Belarmine</hi> did ſhew his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
in ſaying he was not wicked; when he was on his
death-bed, and his Confeſſor came to him to have him
confeſſe his ſin to him, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, I do not know any
ſin in my ſelf to confeſs.</hi> This was not the holineſſe of
the man, but the heedleſneſſe, that he did not obſerve his
waies. <hi>Donatus</hi> the great ringleader of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi>
ſaith, <hi>O Lord I have nothing that thou ſhouldſt pardon me.</hi>
Beloved, this doth ariſe from ſtupidity that men ſee not
ſin; it doth not ariſe from holineſs, but from heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96119:17"/>
and careleſſeneſs. It is an obſervation that one hath
on <hi>Iob,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob, I have ſinned, and cauſe me know wine
iniquity, and my tranſgreſſion, and my ſin.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Iob</hi> made
this complaint that he had ſinned, God ſaith, <hi>in all this</hi>
Job <hi>ſinned not:</hi> that is, not abſolutely, but meaning
comparatively. Beloved, to be free in complaints, and
to be full in confeſſion of ſins, doth not argue that you
have more ſin then other men have; but it argues that
you have more ſight then other men have, and the leſs ſin
you have in you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, Godly men confeſſe ſin out of a ſight and 
ſenſe of ſin, as it is diſhonourable to God, rather then
as it is a ſhame and reproach unto themſelves. Confeſs
thy ſin rather for the foul nature of it, that it doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, then for the evil conſequence of it, that it
deſerves damnation to the ſinner. In <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi> ſaith <hi>David,
Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned:</hi> it was not againſt
<hi>Vriah</hi> that he had ſinned; but againſt thee, thee onely
have I ſinned, for thou waſt diſhonoured by my ſinne.
When the Apoſtle ſpeaks of repentance, he calls it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
towards God, <hi>Acts 20. 21. Teſtifying both to the
Jewes, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and
faith toward our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> To note, That where
ſorrow and confeſſion of ſin is true, it is more out of a
ſenſe of ſin, as it is againſt God, then as it is againſt ſelf.
But wicked men never confeſs ſin as it is a diſhonour to
God, but as it contracts a guilt and a ſhame on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, Holy confeſſion of ſin in godly men, leaves a
holy awe, and a dread upon the heart, making them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to commit the ſin after they have confeſt it; making
them afraid to come into the occaſion of that ſin which
they have confeſt; thus you read, <hi>Acts 19. 18. And many
that believed came, and confeſsed and ſhewed their deeds.</hi>
Verſe 19. <hi>Many alſo of them which uſed curious Arts, brought
their books together, and burned them before all men, &amp;c.</hi> He
ſpeaks of their <hi>ſorcery</hi> and <hi>witchcraft;</hi> they would burn
their books, that there ſhould not be an occaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96119:18"/>
again that ſin which they confeſt unto God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
this is holy confeſſion; when thou ſhalt come to
God on thy knees in ſecret, and there bewail a luſt: and
thy confeſſion leaves a holy awe and dread on thy ſoul to
take heed on that ſin thou haſt confeſt.</p>
            <p>A godly man may commit a ſin which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
but yet he retains a fear and awe upon his heart, that
it ſhall not prevail over him in his practice.</p>
            <p>Wicked men confeſs ſin they have committed, yet they
are bold and adventurous to commit the ſame ſin again
which they have confeſt.</p>
            <p>And thus the Harlot did, <hi>Prov. 7. 14. I have peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with me, this day I have payed my vows.</hi> Paying the
vow, is a confeſſion that I am in debt to God for my ſin;
and I owe God homage and ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſhe made the
confeſſion of ſin to be a means to provoke her to be more
bold and adventurous in her wickedneſſe. To confeſſe
drunkenneſſe, and afterwards to be drunk; to confeſſe
profaneneſs, and afterwards to be profane; this is the bold
adventurouſneſs of wicked men: Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Exod.
9.</hi> confeſt his ſin, and afterwards when the plagues were
over, runs into the ſame ſin he did confeſſe: and this is
the badge and portraiture of a wicked man. And thus I
have done with this fourth particular.</p>
            <p>I now come to the uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>

in whoſe breaſts the arrow and dart of reproof muſt
juſtly ſtick. If ſo be juſtified perſons are bound to make

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort </seg>1</label> Firſt, The <hi>Antinomiſts,</hi> who account it a legal and a
ſervile work, for believers to be bemoaning themſelves
unto God, and confeſſing ſin unto God. And therefore
in their prayers (when you may be caſt to hear them in
publick) all their expreſſions in prayer, are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
the Majeſty of God, the excellency of Chriſt, the
glory of Heaven, the riches of Grace, but not a word of
laying low the creature in prayer; but raptures in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the extolling of divine Majeſty: theſe are all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96119:18"/>
dials of expreſſions which they uſe in prayer.</p>
            <p>Now to overthrow this vain conceit of the <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Confeſſion of ſin to God hath been practiſed by
all the godly under the Old Teſtament; and therefore
why ſhould it not be uſed under the New?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dan. 9.</hi> He made a praher to God, and it conſiſted
of 16. verſes, and 14. of them verſes were ſpent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus the godly in</hi> Nehemiah'<hi>s daies made a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God, and the whole prayer conſiſted of 32. verſes,
and 31. of them verſes were ſpent in confeſſion of ſin.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.
16. Let thine ear be attentive, and thine eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that thou mayſt hear the prayer of thy ſervant, which I
pray before thee day and night, for the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
thy ſervants, and confeſſe the ſins of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
which we have ſinued againſt thee, both I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe have ſinned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> David, 2 Sam. 24. 10. And <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote
him, after that he had numbred the people: and <hi>David</hi> ſaid
unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done: and
now, I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy
ſervant, for I have done very fooliſhly. <hi>That is one thing to
confute this practiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Not onely Believers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but alſo Converts under the New Teſtament, did
make conſcience of confeſſing of ſins unto God,</hi> John 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.
And they were baptized of him in Jordan, confeſſing their
ſins, <hi>Acts 19. 18.</hi> And many that believed came, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and ſhewed their deeds. <hi>Luke 15. 17.</hi> And when he
ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my Father have bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uough,
and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? <hi>Verſe 18.</hi> I
will ariſe, and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee. <hi>It is an
Embleme of a Convert, if ſo be it be a Parable: In the
inſtance of the Publican, that Chriſt declares was uniuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
rather then the Phariſee,</hi> And the Publican ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afar off,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 13.</note> would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to Heaven,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96119:19"/>
but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a
ſinner. <hi>Verſe 14.</hi> I tell you, this man went down to his houſe
juſtified rather then the other, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now (beloved) when you have inſtances in the Old
Teſtament, and many examples in the New, why then
ſhould we blot out ſo uſeful a part of Gods worſhip as
this, of confeſſion to God in ſecret?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, God doth command confeſſion of ſin unto
him.</hi> Jer. 3. 12, 13. Goe and proclame theſe words towards
the North, and ſay, Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith
the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for
I am merciful ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Onely acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
againſt the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, God both in the Old Teſtament and in the
New, hath annexed many gracious promiſes to a ſincere
confeſſion of ſin unto him: in the Old Teſtament,</hi> Lev.
26. 40. If they ſhall confeſſe their iniquity, and the iniquity of
their fathers, with their treſpaſſe which they treſpaſsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, and that alſo they have walked contrary unto me.
<hi>Verſ. 41.</hi> And that I alſo have walked contrary unto them,
and have brought them into the land of their enemies: if then
their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and they then accept
of the puniſhment of their iniquity, Then will I remember my
Covenant with <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they</hi> confeſſe their iniquity, <hi>I
will</hi> remember <hi>them. And there are gracious promiſes
made to ſuch as confeſs their ſins; and it is certain that
a man cannot have a promiſe to any thing which is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Prov. 22. 13. He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper,
but whoſo confeſseth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy. Iob
33. 27. He looketh upon men, and if any ſay I have ſinned,
and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not,
&amp;c. <hi>And in the New Teſtament, in</hi> 1 Iohn 1. 9. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and
to cleanſe us from all uurighteouſneſs. <hi>Now beloved, put
all theſe four together; the godly have practiſed this
under the Old Teſtament, and converts under the New,
God hath commanded it, and he hath recompenced it;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96119:19"/>
therefore thoſe that account confeſſion of ſin to be but a
legal and ſervile work deſerve reproof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reproof, is to thoſe of the Popiſh Religion,
who in ſtead of ſecret confeſſion of ſin to God in prayer,
doe preſſe vehemently Auricular confeſſion in the ear of
the Prieſt. Touching this Auricular confeſſion, they
ſpend many volumes to make good the divine right of
it; the Councel of Trent do lay an <hi>Anathema</hi> on any
that ſhall not count Auricular confeſſion to be neceſſary
to ſalvation. There are theſe ſeveral miſtakes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in the Popiſh Doctrine of Auricular confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They urge the neceſſity of it, that you muſt not
expect ſalvation without it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Confeſſion againſt whom, and when you did
it, all the circumſtances of your ſins you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Prieſt upon your confeſſion, hath
power from Chriſt to give you pardon, and to give you
abſolution; theſe goe currant with them about Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
confeſſion.</p>
            <p>That you might ſee this is blame-worthy, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of reproof; I ſhall confute it by theſe Confiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Firſt Conſideration of the time when Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
came firſt in uſe in the Church: For 800. yeares
after Chriſt there was no ſuch practiſe in the Church of
God: and that the Law of Auricular Confeſſion was
not enacted until Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Vſher.</hi>
               </note> which was
about 1200. years after Chriſt: and the firſt Councel that
did eſtabliſh Auricular Confeſsion, was the <hi>Laterane</hi>
Councel, and after that the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> The
Church of God in the Primitive times having no ſuch
practiſe, it may be exploded from being now in the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why did the Popes invent Auricular confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion?
One doth demonſtrate this;</p>
            <p>Firſt there is this Reaſon: It is a notable invention
to diſcover the ſecrets of mens thoughts, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96119:20"/>
and deſignes, both in Church and State</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a means to get money for the Pope:
for according as the ſin confeſſed, is more capital and
notorious, ſo the more money muſt be given for indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and pardon; thus a reverent Divine calls it, the
pick lock of Sacramental confeſſion: this being enacted
meerly out of State policy to know mens ſecret thoughts
and temper; and likewiſe to bring in profit and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which doth ſhew the practiſe
to be unjuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider what the Scripture doth preſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
confeſſion unto men, mark the Text, <hi>Jam. 5. 16
Confeſs your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that you may be healed.</hi> The Scripture doth not tie us to
a Prieſt as the Popiſh Religion ties them: but it ties us,
that in anguiſh of conſcience and trouble of minde we
confeſſe to any who are abce to give us wholſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
from the Lord. We are to confeſſe our ſin to any
Chriſtian freind or member of the Church whom we
judge fitteſt to adviſe us for their wiſdome, faithfulneſs,
compaſſion and experience.</p>
            <p>A good note our Proteſtant Interpreters have againſt
the Papiſts: the Apoſtle bids, <hi>if a man be ſick, call for the
Elders of the Church,</hi> and they were to pray for him; but
he doth not bid them confeſſe ſin to the Elders, but
confeſſe ſin one to another; which doth no way tie to
confeſſe ſin to a Prieſt. But this is a point of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
and bleſſed be God this Church is not tainted with
this erour; therefore I ſhall leave it: this is the ſecond
ſort that is to be reproved; to wit, thoſe of the Popiſh,
Religion, who inſtead of confeſſion of ſin unto God
bring in auricular Confeſſion to the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine reproves thoſe who to avoid
the Popiſh Auricular Confeſſion unto the Prieſt, deny all
kind of confeſſion of ſin unto men: there are many faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
many who keep the Devils counſel, who groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſtrong corruptions, yet will never open their minds
to have counſel and prayer from other men. There are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96119:20"/>
ſome peculiar and ſelect caſes wherein we are not onely
bound to confeſs ſin unto God, but to confeſſe ſin unto
men: but before I handle this, take theſe two Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caut. </seg>1</label> Firſt Caution is this, That you are not to confeſſe ſin
needleſly to men, but when there is a great and an ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
neceſſity, when you are exceedingly troubled in
conſcience, and cannot be comforted; in ſuch a caſe
you may go to men to acknowledge what ſins trouble
your conſciences: but to confeſſe ſin needleſly to men,
you are not called. God doth not love, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
that we ſhould not go to men to reveal our ſhame, but go
to God; unleſs the caſe be very urgent, that by all the
means ye can uſe, ye cannot eaſe your ſelves, then are
ye to confeſſe ſin in that caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caut. </seg>2</label> Secondly, That when ye are to confeſſe ſin to men, you
are not to confeſſe ſin to every one; you are to confeſs
ſin to thoſe that are compaſſionate, that are of ability to
pray for you, to thoſe who have wiſedom and can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
you, to thoſe who have pitty that can compaſſionate
you, to thoſe who have experience that can adviſe you,
to thoſe that can give counſel and keep counſel: you are
not to confeſſe your faults to any but to thoſe you think
are tender hearted, to be able to pray for you. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if a man ſhould be in diſcredit and laviſh in confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and confeſſe his ſin to every body, it may be ſome
would jear and reproach him: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Homilie
on <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> hath this expreſſion, If thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
thy ſin in ſome mens ears, they will caſt thy ſins in
thy face in a way of ſcorn: Some men would deal with
you as the Phariſees did with <hi>Judas; Judas</hi> when he
was ſmitten in conſcience for ſin, came to the Phariſees,
and ſaid unto them, <hi>Here is your money again, for I have
ſinned in betraying innocent blood:</hi> ſay they, What is that
to us? look you to it, for what you have done: ſo men
will expreſs no pitty, and will give no counſel; therefore
there muſt be wiſedome in revealing of your ſins to other
men. Thus you have the Cautions preſcribed unto you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96119:21"/>
Now in what caſes is it meet that men ſhould confeſs
their ſins to men as wel as unto God? I ſhall reſolve this
to you in four Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, In caſe of publique ſcandal given to the Church,
whereof thou art a member, by falling into ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and known ſin, when thy ſin becomes ſcandalous
and known to all that live about thee, and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
where thou doſt communicate is blemiſhed by thy
fall; in that caſe thou art bound to make a confeſſion,
to confeſs thy ſin to the Church. <hi>David</hi> fell into the ſin
of Adultery, and the ſin was known among all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
inſomuch that the enemies of God ſpoke ill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and ſpoke ill of God: what doth <hi>David</hi> doe to
recompence the wrong done to the Church? he makes
the 51. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which was not for his private uſe onely
but for publique uſe; mark the Title of it. <hi>To the chief
Muſitian, A Pſalme of</hi> David, <hi>when</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet,
came unto him, after he had gone in to</hi> Bathſheba. This
Pſalm was permitted to be ſung in the Sanctuary, and in
the Temple, that ſo the Church of God being ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, ſhould be ſatisfied by <hi>Davids</hi> publick
confeſſion and repentance: Beloved, this is equitable,
becauſe the Communicants of a Congregation, of a
Church, are offended by thy ſcandal, and whileſt thy ſin
is notorious they are ſcrupled: therefore there muſt be
a publick repentance. And beſides, publick ſcandal given
by any member of the Church may bring Gods wrath
on the Congregation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Compare</hi> Joſh. 7. 19. <hi>with</hi> Joſh. 22. 20.</note> if the offender doth not confeſſe
his ſin. <hi>Joſh. 22. 20. Did not</hi> Achan <hi>the ſon of</hi> Zerah <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a treſpaſs in the accurſed thing, and wrath fell on all the
congregation of Iſrael? and that man periſhed not alone in
his iniquity. Achan</hi> ſinned alone, but did not periſh alone,
the wrath of God fell upon all the Congregation.
Therefore for the good of the Congregation and Church,
whereof thou art a member; if thy ſin becomes notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and known, thou art bound to confeſſe it; not that
every private ſin muſt be confeſt to the Church, but in
caſe of publick ſcandal, thou art then to compenſate the
congregation by manifeſting thy confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96119:21"/>
A ſecond Caſe wherein you are to confeſſe ſin to men,
is, in Caſe of private injury done to thy neighbour,
in caſe of wrong, perſonal injury done to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
thou art to confeſſe ſin unto him. <hi>Mat. 5. 23, 24.
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt
that thy brother hath ought againſt thee: leave
there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> If
thy brother can ſay thou haſt done him wrong, then
go firſt to thy brother and be reconciled to him. Chriſt
directs that in caſe of private and perſonal wrongs I
am bound to make confeſſion, and give all juſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the man whom I have wronged. And this
Chriſt adviſeth further, in <hi>Luke 17. 3, 4. Take heed to your
ſelves: if thy brother treſpaſse againſt thee, rebuke him,
and if he repent, forgive him. And if he treſpaſſe againſt
thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to thee, ſaying, I repent; thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi>
Chriſt doth here intimate, that we are to confeſſe ſin to
our brother whom we have wronged; to private men,
againſt whom we have done private injuries; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God, but to them. That is a ſecond Caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
confeſſion of ſin is required to men as well as to God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly, You are to confeſſe ſin to men as well as to
God, in caſe of extream trouble of conſcience for ſome
particular ſin which you have done againſt God; when
conſcience flies in thy face, thou canſt neither eat, nor
drink, nor ſleep, nor be quiet; thy conſcience doth ſo
purſue thee with terrour; if thou canſt not by any help
of thine own get a quiet and a calme conſcience, in
ſuch a caſe thou mayeſt go to a godly and experienced
friend, (make thy own choice) to reveal thy caſe: this
is the intent of the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Jam. 5. 16. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed.</hi> That is, when you are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
anguiſh and perplexity of conſcience, thou art
troubled for ſin, then confeſſe thy ſin to other men and
deſire them to pray for thee. And in confeſſing to men,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96119:22"/>
you are not to confeſſe all your ſins, but only that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſin that moſt troubles conſcience: when you
go to a Phyſician, you will diſcover no more to him
then where the ſore lies; you are to confeſſe no more
to men then that particular evil that conſcience trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
you moſt for.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt caſe is this, to confeſſe ſin to thoſe
that have been companions and co-partners with you
in ſin; in that caſe you are to go to men to confeſſe ſin
as well as to God. There are ſome Interpreters that do
expound that place in <hi>Jam. 5. 16. Confeſſe your faults one
to another,</hi> that is, that thoſe that have been partners
together in ſin, they ſhould go one to another to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their ſins: if you have been a drunkard, go to thy
companion, and tell him thy conſcience ſmiteth thee
for thy ſin; you that have been unclean together, if
God hath troubled thy conſcience for thy uncleanneſs,
why go to thy partner in ſin, and tell her God hath
troubled thy conſcience for thy luſt, and it may be this
may awaken her conſcience too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, that <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
returning from <hi>Patmos</hi> to <hi>Epheſus</hi> after the death of
<hi>Domitian</hi> was met by a company of theeves; amongſt
whom was a young man their Captain, whom <hi>John</hi> did
convert, and the ſtory ſaith, that this young man now
converted by <hi>Johns</hi> wholſome counſel, went to all his
fellow theeves, and adviſed them in the name of Jeſus
Chriſt, that they would not walk in that way of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe;
he was troubled in conſcience, and therefore
gave them earneſt counſel, that as they loved their ſouls,
they would not walk in that way of wickedneſſe; and
by that means many of theſe great robbers became great
Converts. In like manner do ye to thoſe that know
of your drunkenneſſe, of your adultery, &amp;c. confeſſe
your ſins, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſaid to the Harlot, I am not the
ſame man I was: and it may be, that ſo their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
may be awakened, and they ſtartled for it, and
bethink themſelves of their wicked courſes, and God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96119:22"/>
may work a change in them, as he hath done in you.</p>
            <p>There is one Uſe more of this Point, and that is for
lamentation and humiliation; to humble you in the
preſence of God, that ſeeing God calls you to confeſſe
ſin to him, you have ſo many palpable and manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in ſecret confeſſing of your ſins to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">10 Defects.</note>Now beloved, there are ten uſuall defects, to which not
only the wicked but the godly are lyable in their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their ſin unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>1</label> The firſt Defect in confeſſion of ſin unso God is this,
that when men come to confeſſe ſin to God, they have
ſuch a barrenneſſe and confuſion on their ſpirits, that
they cannot call to remembrance their particular ſins to
confeſſe them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hilderſham</hi> on Pſal. 51.</note> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> hath a good note deſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on them words in <hi>1. John 1. 8. If we ſay we have no
ſin we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Saith
he, if we ſay that we have no ſin, there is no man ſo groſſe,
to ſay that he hath no ſin, for his own practiſe will give
the lie to his tongue; but it is when we come to God, we
doe as in effect ſay ſo, when we doe not know what ſin
to confeſſe to God; we are ſo confuſed and heedleſſe in
obſerving our own waies, that we doe not know what to
confeſſe in prayer unto God, and that the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns.
It is ſtoried of <hi>Donatus</hi> the father of thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did write againſt, that he ſaid to
God, <hi>Non habeo Dominae quod ignoſcas,</hi> I am guilty Lord
of nothing for thee to pardon.</p>
            <p>This was the fault of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when his Confeſſor
came unto him on his deathbed, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did proteſt
unto him, that he did not know one ſin that he was
guilty of to confeſſe unto the Prieſt: this was heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in him, for if he had obſerved his own waies, he
would have found ſins enough to have confeſt: many
are heedleſſe that they doe not take notice of their own
evils, this is a common and an ordinary Defect;
there are many when they come to prayer though
they have manifold ſins in them, yet they are ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96119:23"/>
confuſed, ſo indiſtinct in the knowledge of their own
waies, that they have only general confeſſions, Lord we
have ſinned, Lord we have done evil in thy ſight, but
cannot call to minde any particular ſin they have done;
Was it never thus with you, that ye did not know what
to bewaile to God, and what to lament of in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
this is a Defect that godly men are often guilty
of.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>2</label> A ſecond Defect in the confeſſion of ſin to God is this,
when men in prayer do confeſſe many ſins to God, yet
do leave out their maſter and predominant ſins: many
men are large in confeſſion, yet do leave out their maſter
ſins. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though a good man, yet was faulty in this
regard; God commanded him to go to <hi>Egypt</hi> to deliver his
people, but ſaith <hi>Moſes, I am not eloquent, I am of a ſlow
ſpeech;</hi> he did complain of a natural defect, but he did
not complain of a ſpiritual defect, but God did anſwer
all his pleas in <hi>Exod. 4. 19. And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in</hi>
Midian, <hi>Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead
that ſought thy life.</hi> Verſ. 20. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took his wife, and
his ſons, and ſet them upon an aſſe, and he returned to the
land of Egypt.</hi> So that God here put his finger upon the
ſore: <hi>Moſes</hi> complained of the peoples incredulity, of
his own natural infirmity, but <hi>Moſes</hi> did not complain
of his ſlaviſh fear, that if he ſhould go to Egypt there
were men that would kill him; till God did aſſure <hi>Moſes</hi>
that thoſe men that ſought to kill him were dead, <hi>Moſes</hi>
would not go: here a good man would not confeſſe his
ſlaviſh fear, that he did fear death; therefore he would
not go on Gods command. Beloved, this is a Defect that
doth many times cleave to godly men to leave out their
predominant ſins, and to confeſſe only thoſe ſins which
are ſins of infirmity; and herein men do but diſſemble
with God, and like the lapwing crie lowdeſt when fartheſt
from the neſt.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>3</label> A third Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>4</label> A fourth Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to
confeſſe to God the ſins of your life, but not the ſins of
your nature: many men will be large in confeſſing the
ſins of their life, but ſeldom or never bewail the ſins of
nature, that vicious inclination in the heart to ſin; very
few but <hi>David</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the
New, who did ſufficiently confeſſe original ſin, <hi>David</hi>
in the Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi> there he begins to bewail
the root of thoſe ſins which he was guilty of. So <hi>Paul</hi> in
<hi>Rom. 7.</hi> bewails the body of ſin:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> many men bewail actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſin, but not habitual ſin, but not original ſin: many
men bewail bad actions, but never confeſſe unto God
their vicious inclination. This Defect good men many

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>5</label> A fifth defect is this, to confeſſe groſſe and open ſins,
but not to confeſſe ſmall and ſecret evils: we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to keep the Law as the apple of our eye, <hi>Prov. 7.
2. Keep my commandements and live, and my Law as the
apple of thine eye.</hi> Now you know, a man that keeps his
eye will not only keep his eye from great blowes, but
from ſmall motes, which may put out the eye as well as a
great blow; men ſhould not only take heed of great
blowes, great tranſgreſſions, but they ſhould take heed
of leſſer motes, ſmall ſins. Now beloved, good men
many times commit thoſe ſins that are infamous, that the
natural light of conſcience can control them for, why
thoſe evils are complained of, and confeſt; but ſecret
evils, wandring thoughts in duties, vanity of minde, the
deadneſſe of the heart, emptineſſe of ſpiritual meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96119:24"/>
inward diſtruſt; theſe evils are ſeldome bewailed
and confeſt: this is many times a Defect found in good
men, good men are not ſo apt to confeſſe omiſſion of

confeſſe ſin more becauſe of its guilt, then of its ſpot:
my meaning is, more becauſe ſin hath a damning power,
then a defiling nature; more becauſe ſin damns thy ſoul,
then defiles thy conſcience. A child would touch a coal
though it be ſmutty and ſoily, but he forbears to touch
it meerly becauſe it is a burning coal: we forbeare ſin
becauſe ſin is a burning coale, but we doe not forbear to

to confeſſe thoſe ſins to God, which if men ſhould charge

ſin or other, when you come to prayer it will help

When <hi>David</hi> came to prayer, he would put before

Art thou a drunkard? ſet they drunkeneſſe before thee:

            <p>Fourthly, Call to remembrance ſome old tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many yeares paſt before thy converſion, and muſter
up theſe ſins together, that ſo thou mighteſt have matter

that are ſluggiſh and barren of any ſpiritual complaints

            <p>A word of Uſe further for direction.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that Juſtified perſons are bound to make
ſecret confeſſions unto God: then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſtians keep a heedfulneſſe over your hearts,
that you may not let ſin go unconfeſt; make conſcience
and be heedful that ſin committed by you may not be
unconfeſt: a ſin unconfeſt as to the apprehenſion may be
unpardoned; a ſin unconfeſt cannot be mourned for, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be actually repented of. Obſerve, that a leſſe ſin
unrepented of, may damn a man, when a greater ſin that
is confeſt to God may be pardoned: if you compare <hi>Saul</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> together, <hi>1 Sam. 15. 9. But</hi> Saul <hi>and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96119:26"/>
ſpared</hi> Agag, <hi>and the beſt of the ſheep and of the oxen,
and of the fallings, and of the lambs, and all that was good,
and would not utterly deſtroy them: but every thing that was
vile, and refuſe, that they diſtroyed utterly. Saul</hi> did there
commit a farre leſſe ſin then <hi>Davids</hi> was, to wit, adultery,
<hi>Saul</hi> did only for his private uſe ſpare the fatteſt of his
ſheep and oxen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was little or nothing in compariſon
of <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, yet behold <hi>David</hi> was pardoned and <hi>Saul</hi>
damned, <hi>David</hi> had his ſin pardoned and <hi>Saul</hi> not:
why? <hi>David</hi> did confeſſe ſin, and <hi>Saul</hi> not: <hi>Saul</hi> did
delude the reproof of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and told him the people
did it, and not I; <hi>Sauls</hi> ſin unconfeſt ruined him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed of letting ſin go unconfeſt, a leſſe ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confeſt
may damn a man, when a greater ſin that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
may not damn him.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Direction is this, Depend not upon the moſt
inlarged and the moſt ſenſible confeſſions that ever you
have made to God, ſuppoſe thou haſt poured out thy ſoul
to God, thou art never the better: thou O man when
thou doeſt confeſſe ſin, thou doeſt but like a begger ſhew
God thy ſores, thy botches, and ſcabs, do not depend
upon your confeſſions; as you muſt not depend upon
your righteouſneſſe, ſo not upon confeſſion of your ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
It is worth your obſervation, <hi>Saul</hi> purſuing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
like a Partridge over the mountains, <hi>David</hi> cut off
the lap of his garment; ſaith <hi>David, well, I have ſinned;</hi>
and Saul, <hi>thou art more righteous then I:</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi>
came to <hi>David, David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi>
told him, <hi>the Lord hath taken away thy iniquity. Saul</hi>
ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> yet the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> told him, <hi>the
Lord hath taken away thy Kingdom:</hi> here is not the ſame
reſult, for <hi>David</hi> had his ſin taken away, and <hi>Saul</hi> had
his Kingdom taken away, therefore do not depend on
your confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take this Direction, that when you confeſs
ſin to God and are the moſt vile in your own eyes, you
are then moſt amiable in Gods eye: <hi>Cant. 1. 6. Look not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96119:26"/>
upon me becauſ I am black, becauſ the ſun hath looked upon me.</hi>
The Church there confeſt to Chriſt I am black and not
comely, ſhe was ſun-burnt as ſhe thought. I, but in verſe
8. <hi>My Love my Dove, thou art the faireſt among women:</hi>
Chriſt lookt on her as the faireſt among women: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in <hi>Cant. 2. 14. O my Dove, thou art in the clefts of the
rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtaires: let me ſee thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
let me hear thy voyce; for ſweet is thy voice, and thy
countenance is comely.</hi> When the poore Dove, the Church,
lay in a hole under the ſtaires, bewailing and mourning
like a Dove for her ſinfulneſſe, O ſaith Chriſt to her, <hi>let
me ſee thy face, and let me hear thy voyce.</hi> Chriſt doth love
to hear the moan-makings of his people, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. I
have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim, <hi>be moaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt
chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed
to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; thou art
the Lord my God.</hi> It is worth your notice, <hi>Job</hi> when he
was afflicted by God in having botches and boyles all
over his body, it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> made his complaint to God,
Chap. 7. verſ. 20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee,
O thou preſerver of men?</hi> I have ſinned ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> but what
doth God ſay of <hi>Job?</hi> in all this <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not, <hi>Job. 1.
22. In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> It
was not ſpoken abſolutely he ſinned not, but the meaning
is, he ſinned not ſo as other men ſinned. The more you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile,
condole, &amp; confeſſe ſinne to God, &amp; are by reaſon
thereof vile in your own eyes, the more amiable you are
in Gods eyes. And thus I have done with the firſt part of
the Text, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſse my trangreſſion unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been all this while in theſe Sermons on <hi>Davids</hi>
Act, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</hi>
I am now come to Gods Act, <hi>and thou forgaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of my ſinne. Thou forgaveſt, &amp;c.</hi> that is, not only my
<hi>ſinne,</hi> but the malignity of it, with all its agravations,
all its hainous circumſtances: Now here touching Gods
Act, two things are to be obſerved,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt the manner of bringing in this Act of God, the
Pſalmiſt doth not bring it in thus with an <hi>Ergo, I ſaid I wil
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96119:27"/>
confeſſe my tranſgreſſion to the Lord, therefore he forgave the
iniquity of my ſinne,</hi> but it is with an <hi>et,</hi> a conjunctive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and not a cauſall, <hi>I confeſſe</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>and thou
forgaveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve this further, the manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
the <hi>confeſſion</hi> was in purpoſe and intention, but
the <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> is actuall: obſerve from hence this note,
That God doth recompence the very gracious purpoſes as
well as performances of his own ſervants; God forgave,
but <hi>David</hi> did but purpoſe to confeſſe; <hi>I ſaid I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
and thou forgaveſt.</hi> O beloved what a God doe yee
ſerve! your maſters are not pleaſed with your purpoſes
to work, if you doe no labour with your hands; you ſerve
a God which takes will for work; God takes purpoſes if
they be reall, for performances. The Lord doth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
not onely gracious performances, but alſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
purpoſes in his owne ſervants.</p>
            <p>The Vſe or corollary from hence is this:</p>
            <p>That wicked men looke to it, God will not onely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their wicked practices, but their wicked purpoſes:
Didſt thou ever purpoſe to be uncleane, or to deceive,
and it may be thou waſt interrupted, that thou couldſt
not have ſecrecy &amp; opportunity? Why, God will puniſh
thee for thy purpoſe, though thou never doſt act it. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it is not onely what evill thou haſt done, but what
evill thou wouldſt have done: Wouldſt not thou have been
an oppreſſour, if the World would not have cry'd ſhame
on thee? wouldſt not thou have been a drunkard, if the
world would not brand thee with infamy? God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
wicked men for evill purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Further to godly men, Thou canſt not mourn, but
wouldſt thou mourn? thou canſt not confeſſe ſinne, but
wouldſt thou confeſſe ſinne? thou canſt not break thy
heart, but wouldſt thou break thy heart? God looks on
your purpoſes with approbation, as well as your practiſes.
As here <hi>David,</hi> I <hi>ſaid</hi> I <hi>will confeſs my ſin &amp; thou forgaveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth not onely look on wicked mens
purpoſes, to puniſh them for them, and good mens pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96119:27"/>
to reward them for them; but God doth looke
on the purpoſes of devils to doe hurt, for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them: A notable paſſage, <hi>Luk. 21. Peter, Peter,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee like Wheat. I
have</hi> (actually) <hi>prayed:</hi> the hurt was only the devils pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and the devils deſire; but when the temptation
was but in the deſire, then ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have</hi> actually
<hi>prayed for thee.</hi> O fall down and admire the condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt, he doth crown your purpoſes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and deſires: <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion,
and thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the connexion of confeſſion and forgiveneſſe of
ſinne,</hi> And thou forgaveſt, <hi>which is by way of connextion
not cauſation, with an</hi> et <hi>not an</hi> ergo. <hi>The Doctrine I
hence obſerve is this,</hi> That there is a neceſsary connexion
between a penitentiall confeſſion of ſinne, and forgiveneſse of
ſinne. I confeſſed, and God forgave. <hi>You have frequent
teſtimonies that inculcate this on your thoughts,</hi> Prov. 28.
13. He that covereth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper; but whoſo
confeſseth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy. Job, 33.
27. He looketh upon men, and if any ſaid, I have ſinned, and
perverted that which was right, &amp; it profited me not. <hi>Verſ. 28.</hi>
He will deliver his ſoule from going into the pit, and his life
ſhall ſee the light.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this point, there are theſe
particulars which I ſhall diſpatch.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>1</label> Firſt, What is meant by forgiving ſin; To explicate
this, there are three things which are needful to be
ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>Firſt for the varieties of names and expreſſions of
forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt pardon of ſin is a caſting of ſinne behind the
back, <hi>Iſaiah. 38. 17. Behold for Peace I had great bitterneſſe,
but thou haſt in love to my ſoul, delivered it from the pit of
corruption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 17.</note> 
               <hi>for thou haſt caſt all my ſinnes behinde thy back.</hi>
In Scripture to caſt a thing behind the back,<note place="margin">Mehem. 9. 17.</note> ſignifies to
forget and diſregard it; ſo wicked men caſt <hi>Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
behind their backs; that is, they doe not mind it,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96119:28"/>
they will not obey it: ſo when God is ſaid to caſt ſinne
behinde his back, he will take no notice of it ſo as to
puniſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond expreſſion that illuſtrates pardon of ſinne, is
this, it is called a caſting of ſinne into the bottom
of the Sea, <hi>Micah. 7. 29. He will turn again, he
will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities,
and will caſt all our ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> It is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
unto Gods great Judgement on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Hoſt; when they purſued the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they
came to the Red Sea, and thinking to goe through as
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, the Sea fell in upon them, and they
were drowned in the bottom of the ſea, ſo ſaith God, <hi>I wil
deal with ſinne as I dealt with Pharaoh,</hi> you ſhall never be
troubled more with them, not unto condemnation, you
need not fear the riſing of ſin again, againſt you; ſin is
not like unto light weeds in the Sea, that will ſwim of
themſelves, but Lead that is caſt into the Sea, the alluſion
holds here,<note place="margin">Revel. 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Exod. 15. 10. Thou didſt blow with the wind,
the Sea covered them, they ſank as lead in the mighty wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 7. 21.</note>
God when he pardons ſins and caſts them into the
bottom of the Sea, ſin lies like lead, it can never riſe of
it ſelfe in a way of condemnation to a juſtified man, to
a pardoned ſinner.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, pardon of ſin is expreſſed in Scripture, by
blotting out, <hi>Act. 3. 19. Repent ye therefore, and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. I even I
am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake.</hi>
This is a metaphor taken from men, when a man is not
able to pay his debt, the Creditor doth cancel the Bond,
blots out the writing and breaks the Seal, that nothing
ſhall prevail in Law againſt this poor man. So the Lord
doth cancell the bond, and blots out the writing, that
neither ſin, nor the Devill ſhall have any proceſſe
againſt him in a way of condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Pardon of ſin is expreſſed in Scripture by
acquitting of a man from his iniquity, <hi>Job. 10. 14. If I
ſin, thou markeſt me, and thou wilt not, or, aquit me then</hi> (not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96119:28"/>
ſet mee free) <hi>from mine iniquity.</hi> Acquitting is a term of
Law, giving you a diſcharge and diſmiſſion of the Court;
the Lord in pardoning of ſin, gives a man a Legall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
that no proceedings of Heaven ſhall goe againſt
him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Pardon of ſin is called in Scripture a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of ſin, <hi>Pſal. 32. 1. Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is
forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Beloved, if pardon of
ſin had conſiſted in the removing of ſin, we had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
pardon of ſin doth not conſiſt in the removall of
all ſin out of a man, but in the covering of ſin; God will
hide ſin, that the fierceneſſe of his wrath, and the Eye of
his indignation ſhal not look on it to condemnation, It
is the ſame word that refers to <hi>garments</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96119:29"/>
not imputing of ſin, <hi>Rom. 4. 8 Bleſſed is the man to whom
the Lord will not impute ſin?</hi> It is a word drawn from
Merchants, when they have a friend that owes them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
that they care not whether they receive or no, they
do not put it down in their Book. God will not impute
ſin, he will not ſet ſin on the ſcore, he will not put ſin to
thine account, though ſin be in thee, yet it is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to thee. Thus theſe names or expreſſions do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Illuſtrate the nature of forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place, to enquire how many wayes a ſinne
may be ſaid to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>Firſt in regard of Gods decree, and ſo ſin is forgiven
before all Worlds, becauſe God intended to deliver the
Elect, that ſuch a remnant and number of men ſhould
have ſin pardoned. Thus Chriſt is the Lamb ſlaine from
the beginning of the World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin is ſaid to be forgiven when the Lord
doth manifeſt forgiveneſſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and chiefly, Sin is ſaid to be forgiven, when
the eternall guilt and condemnation due for that ſin is
taken away, when God doth expiate or take off the guilt
of ſin, in that properly lies the nature of forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the third place what is conſidered in ſin, when
God is ſaid to forgive it; this is worth your underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Three things are to be conſidered in ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt the blot and pollution of ſin; and this cannot be
taken away by pardon, the ſin is a ſin though it be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
the pollution of ſin is not taken away by pardon,
the blot remaines.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is conſidered the deſert of ſin, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
damnation, and the wrath of God; though it be
pardoned, this is not taken away.</p>
            <p>A Third thing conſidered is this, the Ordination or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of a ſinner to eternall puniſhment; and this
is fully taken away by pardon, when God doth give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſin, he doth take away all obligation to wrath,
death, hell, and damnation; and this is properly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of forgiveneſſe of ſin, it is a gracious and a free act
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96119:29"/>
of God, whereby he acquits a ſinner from eternall guilt
and eternall puniſhment, that is due to all his ſin in an
eternall puniſhment, God doth not acquit a pardoned
man from externall puniſhments, God may pardon thy
ſin, yet he may puniſh thee externally for thy ſinnes, but
not eternally; and thus much for the firſt particular.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For anſwer in the generall, it is not every kind of
confeſſion that carries a connexion of pardon, <hi>Saul</hi>
confeſt his ſin, but God did not take away his ſin, but

that hath a connexion with forgiveneſſe of ſin, but
that confeſſion which hath connexion with pardon of

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt it is a free and ingenuous confeſsion, not extorted
by force, not with ſinfull reſerves, but a free, a full and
ingenuous confeſsion, that is the meaning of that Phraſe,
<hi>Pſal. 32. 21. Bleſsed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth
not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit is no guile;</hi> Guile is not
there taken largely in oppoſition to Hypocriſie, but for
a ſinfull reſerve of ſin, when a man will not be free and
open in confeſſing his ſin unto God; <hi>David</hi> would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully open himſelfe and confeſſe his evils unto
God; that confeſsion that is a free and ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
it hath pardon of ſin annexed to it; the confeſsions
of them that rowle ſin under the tongue, as a ſweet
morſell that they would not part with, have not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
entailed on them; thoſe confeſsions onely are

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that confeſſion which hath pardon annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it is a penitential confeſsion, a confeſsion that hath
ſorrow of heart mixt with it, <hi>Pſ. 38. 18. For I will declare
mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi> True confeſsion
of ſin is rather a voice of mourning, then a voice of
words, it hath ever a ſorrow and grief of heart joined
with it; That preſcription, that God gave to the Leper

what was joined with his confeſsion before hee could be

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third Concomitant of confeſsion that hath pardon
annexed to it, is this, That there muſt be a voluntary
and a free leaving of thoſe ſins which we doe confeſſe.
To confeſs ſin, yet to have a lothneſſe in the ſpirit to part
with it, is no reall confeſsing of ſin. <hi>Prov. 28. 13. He that
covereth. his ſin ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and
forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> Confeſsion is there joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be with a forſaking of ſin,<note place="margin">Eſta ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis vomitns. Bern.</note> in caſe mercy be to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cals confeſsion a ſpirituall
vomit; you know a man that is burdened in the
ſtomack, would be willingly rid of that load on his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
that doth oppreſſe nature; a man that doth confeſs
ſin truly would as willing be rid of ſin on his Conſcience,
as a man that is ſick at his Stomach would be rid of that
burden which doth oppreſſe it, ſuch a confeſsion hath
pardon annexed with it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly that confeſsion that hath pardon annexed
to it, is joyned with a holy aw and fear of running into
the commiſsion of thoſe ſins that we do confeſſe to God,
<hi>Pſal. 38. 18.</hi> compared with <hi>Pſal. 39. 1. For I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin, I ſaid I will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96119:30"/>
take heed to my wayes that I ſin not with my tongue. Davids</hi>
confeſsing ſin did worke in him a holy awe, and a holy
care to take heed of thoſe ſins he had confeſt, to confeſſe
ſin and to be bold and adventurous to run into ſin, hath
not ſuch a connexion, with pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, That confeſsion that hath pardon annexed to
it, doth quicken the ſoul to ſtrong &amp; earneſt ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to prayer. <hi>David</hi> confeſt ſin &amp; his confeſsion quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Prayer, <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſt ſin, and confeſsion quickened
ſupplication; <hi>Daniel 9. 20. And while I was ſpeaking,
and praying, and confeſſing my ſin, and the ſin of my people
Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> (Beloved,) when confeſsions of ſin are to
prayer as the whet-ſtone to the knife; when you ſharpen
your affections and put a keen edge on your hearts in
prayer: this is an evident token that ſuch confeſsion hath
a connexion with forgiveneſſe of ſin. So much for the
ſecond particular.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>3</label> The third particular is to ſhew you, how doth this
connexion between confeſsion of ſin and forgiveneſſe of
ſin conſiſt with the feerneſſe of Gods grace in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſin, in placing a connexion between pardon and
confeſsion? How doth this conſiſt with the freeneſſe of
of Gods grace in pardoning of ſin? For anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt if we ſhould place a cauſality or a merit in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of ſin to procure pardon, as the Papiſts doe, this
would overthrow the free Grace of God in forgiving ſin:
though wee do place a connexion between confeſsing
ſin, and pardon of ſin; yet wee do not place any merit
in thoſe confeſsions, we do not place any worth, any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality
in thoſe confeſsions: that is my firſt anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, The Scripture makes a fair conſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
mans confeſsing ſin, and Gods free Grace in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
ſin: the Scripture makes a double conſiſtency.
Firſt in regard of the Precept that doth enjoyn and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
confeſsion. 2. In regard of the means that this is
a way to procure pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, In regard of the command, God doth command
us to confeſſe ſin; Now no command of God that he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96119:31"/>
would have us doe, can derogate from his free grace,
therefore ſurely this command can no way eclipſe the
freeneſſe of grace in what he will doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In regard of means as a way to get pardon:
God is the efficient cauſe, and Chriſt is the meritorious
cauſe of pardon; but yet confeſsion of ſin is that cauſe
which Logicians call <hi>(cauſa ſine quâ non)</hi> without
which pardon of ſin ſhall never be obtained,<note place="margin">Cauſa ſine quâ non.</note> I <hi>confeſt and
thou forgaveſt.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> A third anſwer, Though no man can be pardoned
for his confeſsion, yet no man ſhall have pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
confeſsion: <hi>Repent that your ſins may be blotted out,
Act. 3. 19.</hi> No blotting out of ſin without repentance;
there muſt be a ſorrow &amp; bewailing of ſin before it can
be pardoned; and that Chriſt was broken for ſin, it will
no ways exempt you from being broken for ſin; though
Chriſt was <hi>a man of ſorrow,</hi> &amp; all in a way of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet you muſt ſhed teares for ſin in a way of contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and humiliation.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> Laſtly, This connexion between confeſsing ſin and
Gods forgiving ſin, is not as if our confeſsion did bear
any proportion in a way of ſatisfaction to Gods forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of ſin; though God doth forgive ſin upon confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
yet it is not for confeſsion; there is more evill
in thy ſin that is an offence to God, then there can be
good in thy confeſsion; And thus much for the third
particular, that there is a connexion between Gods act
of forgiving ſin and our confeſsing ſin.</p>
            <p>I now come to anſwer the Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> The firſt Objection is this, Why but you will ſay,
what need all this preſsing of confeſsion of ſin, urging,
that there is a neceſſary connexion between mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
of ſin and Gods forgiving ſin? what needs
confeſsion? doth not Gods eyes run to and fro the
earth? doth not God behold the evill and the good, and
fully knoweth all the evils under the Sun? what we tel God
when hee knoweth all things? This Objection the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
make againſt confeſsion of ſin. For anſwer.</p>

               </label>
Firſt, Negatively, we doe not confeſse ſin becauſe only
of Gods Soveraignty, becauſe God will have us to confeſſe
ſin, Gods Soverainty may command us and ſay, You ſhal
come with ropes about your Necks, and I will make you
lie in the duſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Wee doe not confeſſe ſin, to inform God of
our ſins, for God knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly wee do not confeſſe ſin by way of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if your confeſsion could ſatisfie Gods juſtice for
the wrong we have done him.</p>
            <p>But Poſitively, though God doth know our ſins, yet
we are bound to confeſſe our ſins for many ſolid reaſons;
As;</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Though God doth ſee our ſins, yet wee are
bound to confeſſe our ſins that wee may ſee them our
ſelves, that we may put memory &amp; conſcience and heart
a work, in the review, &amp; in the remembrance of our evils,
we do not confeſſe ſin to inform God, but our ſelves,
that wee might ſee ſin more diſtinctly, and ſo ſet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We do confeſſe ſin, to ſtir up more ſorrow

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We confeſſe ſin on this ground, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
ſin to God we might ſee ſin to become exceeding
ſinfull. Confeſsion of ſin ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> is enjoined by
God for this reaſon, that thou mighteſt magnifie the
greatneſſe of grace, and ſee the greatneſſe of ſin;
if a man ſhould never ſee his ſin, he could never magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods grace and pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That you might more prize the merits of
Chriſt. Should a man never confeſſe ſin to God, he would
never ſee of what value Chriſts bloud is of. A Chirurgions
skill is not ſeen in healing a ſlight green wound; but in
the healing a man of a deadly diſeaſe: Beloved, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
plaiſter can cure a green wound: if you look on
your ſins as green wounds, you will never prize
Chriſt, nor put an eſtimate on his merits and bloud,
when a man can confeſſe his ſin, withall its hainous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96119:32"/>
circumſtances, this doth greaten the merits of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, You are to confeſſe ſin, becauſe the confeſsion
of ſin doth give glory to the attributes of God; it gives
glory to his <hi>Omniſciency,</hi> you doe by your confeſsions
acknowledge that God ſeeth your ſins: it gives glory to
his <hi>Patience</hi> that he would ſpare you in the act of ſin,
that he would not throw you to hell in the very act of

He confeſt his ſin that ſo he might the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Again, Of confeſsion of ſin there is great uſe, becauſe
it doth eaſe the minde, it gives vent to a troubled minde,
<hi>concealed guilt breeds horrour and hell in the conſcience; it</hi>
is an ingenuous clearneſſe when a man can open himſelf
to God in free confeſsion, which doth allay the anguiſh

               <label type="milestone">

need ſuch preſsing of confeſsing of ſin, as having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection

               <label type="milestone">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, In a ſenſe God doth receive injury by a
mans ſin; as firſt, if you conſider the eternall attributes
of God in themſelves, his Juſtice, his Goodneſſe, his
Wiſedom, ſo God is unchangeably, and immutably bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and as our graces can give no additions to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
ſo our ſin can give no diminution to his glory;
but ſecondly, ſin is an injury to God, becauſe God hath
leſſe externall glory. God by the ſin of man is not
wronged in his eſſentiall Glory, but he is injured in his
manifeſtative Glory.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Though our ſins can doe no injury to God,
to make God unholy, or to make God unhappy; yet ſin
doth great injury to your ſelves; if thou beeſt ſinfull, what
wilt thou doe againſt God? why, thou canſt not bring
God out of Heaven, though thou maiſt caſt thy ſelfe into
hell, God receives no diminution of his Holineſſe, of his
Wiſedom, of his Glory, by thy ſinfulneſſe, yet thou ſhalt
not have Glory, Holineſſe, Happineſſe, Heaven, nor eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, thou ſhalt receive miſeries by thine own ſins;
And thus I have done with the Doctrinall part of this

            <p>I now come to the Uſe, which is for triall, to put you

whether God hath forgiven you your iniquities? There
are ten wayes to diſcover this; I ſhall divide them into
this order: there are ſix Concomitants, that doe attend
a perſon in a pardoned eſtate, and four charactors laid
downe in Scripture of a man whoſe ſin is forgiven him.

Rev. 2. 17. To him that overcometh will <hi>I</hi> give to eat of

            <p>Interpreters doe give this ſenſe of that promiſe:
you read of two things, <hi>a white Stone,</hi> and <hi>a new name
written in that ſtone;</hi> the white ſtone it is an expreſsion
borrowed from the practice of the Gentiles, who in their
Judicature did uſe a white ſtone: If a malefactour was
condemned, and had the ſentence of death paſt upon
him, there was given him a black ſtone in token of
condemnation;<note place="margin">Ovid Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. lib. 15.</note> but if a man had a white ſtone given

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth Concomitant that attends forgiveneſſe of ſin,
is repentance from dead works: repentance for ſin is a
Concomitant that is ever joyned with the forgiveneſſe of

power can forgive a man his ſin, if a man doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him of ſin. There are few of them that do incline to
the affirmative, becauſe God hath expreſly tied himſelf
in the Word, that pardon muſt have repentance for ſin.

            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 38.</note> Forgiveneſſe of ſin, is accompanied with holy
endeavours for the mortification of ſin: he that hath the
guilt of ſin pardoned, labours to have the power of ſin
deſtroyed; therefore in Scripture pardoning mercy and
ſubduing grace, they are both joyned together, <hi>Mic. 7.
19. He wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into
the depths of the Sea:</hi> there is ſubduing grace, as well
as pardoning mercy. Beloved if God pardon ſin there
are reall endeavours in a ſoul to have the power of ſin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. Indeed many men in the world do lay claim
to pardon, who never have endeavours, and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
after mortification: many have counterfeit mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
who playwith their ſins like Fencers; which it may
be given them a touch, a ſlight blow, but do not fight like
warriers, either to kill or to be kill'd: but godly men do
not play with their ſins, but doe with their luſts as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
they doe conflict with luſts on theſe terms, that either
wee muſt kill them, or they will kill us. Many counterfeit
Chriſtians who do lay claim to reall pardon, have
but counterfeit mortifications; <hi>I</hi> may fitly reſemble ſuch
men as theſe to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had one Feſtival annually
where in they uſed this cuſtome, that they laboured to
finde out all their venomous creatures, as Snakes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
and the like: and one day in the year they would
kill all which they found, but afterwards they let them
encreaſe. Many men in ſome ſolemn performances to God,
will make great adoe of killing their luſts, but afterwards
they let them encreaſe and live again. And thus much
for the ſix-Concomitants that do attend a perſon in a
pardoned ſtate.</p>
            <p>The next is, the Characters to be given of a pardoned

dread in his heart from committing that ſin that he

this, that before a ſin can be pardoned, it did coſt Chriſt
much, and will coſt himſelf much; it did coſt Chriſt
much bloud to expiate the guilt of that ſin; it will coſt
the ſinner many teares to deſtroy the power of that ſin;
now that ſin which he hath ſmarted for, and Chriſt hath
ſuffered for, he will not eaſily commit. <hi>Pſal. 38.</hi> when
the Pſalmiſt ſaid, he would <hi>declare his iniquity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 38. 18.</note> then in
<hi>Pſal. 39.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I will take heed to my wayes;</hi> as if

If I ſin then thou markeſt me, and thou wilt not acquit me

but if I ſin as I am charged, that I ſhould ſin murmuring

<hi>Job, If I ſin</hi> as yee charge me, what followes? <hi>then God

this, to have unfained ſorrow and remorſe of heart for

and ſoakt in teares: ſorrow before pardon is ſervile and
legal; none can ſorrow in an Evangelical manner, but he
who is brought into a pardoned eſtate. Indeed there may
be a fore't, and a conſtrained ſorrow which may come
from the eyes of unpardoned men: there is this difference
between the one and the other. Teares in an unpardoned
ſinner come from him like water in a Still; but Tears in
a pardoned ſinner come from him like water from the
clouds: water will drop from the Still, but it is forc't
by keeping cloſe the Still, and by the heat of the fire?
the fire of hell may make a wicked man agaſt: but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, You that make this Objection know this, that
there may be greater ſorrow for ſin in the heart, when
there is no tears for ſin flowing from the eye; tears from
the eye doth eaſe and lighten the minde, there may be
the greateſt ſorrow when it can have no vent from the
eye.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You that make this Objection know, you
muſt diſtinguiſh of a two-fold ſorrow for ſin. Firſt,
there is a judicious ſorrow: and ſecondly, a ſenſitive
ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a judicious ſorrow, and this conſiſts
in an apprehenſion in the judgement, that ſin is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
evil in the world, and moſt to be lamented, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
oppoſed, and reſiſted: Divines doe place more
ſtrength and height of grace in having an indignation
ſtirred up in the underſtanding againſt ſin, touching the
evil of ſin; this is more then to ſhed a few teares for
ſin. Now if thou haſt a judicious ſorrow to apprehend
ſin to be a great evil, though it hath not vent at the
eye, yet this is godly ſorrow for ſin. A man that hath
the Tooth-ache, he will cry out and complain more, and
ſhed more teares happily for the exquiſite pain of the
Tooth-ache, then he will doe in the burning Feaver;
yet ask him which he had rather have, he will tell you
the Tooth-ache: the reaſon is, becauſe the peſtilential
Feaver is more hazardous to life: ſo bad you rather
loſe your children, then loſe the ſenſe of Gods favour.
Which had you rather have, afflictions in the world, or
willingly commit ſin againſt God?</p>
            <p>The judgement of a man, if he be a regenerate man,
tells him he had rather a thouſand times loſe the deareſt
relation, then the manifeſtation of Gods love unto his
ſoul, he had rather endure the greateſt affliction, then
to venture willingly on the leaſt ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, Conſider, that Gods own people have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
expreſt more ſorrow for outward afflictions,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96119:36"/>
then they have done for inward corruptions; there is
great reaſon for it, becauſe things of ſenſe doe more
affect us, then things of faith doe; lay a man upon the
Rack, and he ſhall more roar and cry then any man
in the world ſhall doe in the ſenſe of ſin, becauſe the
pain is ſenſitive, and it will have more ſenſe of ſorrow:
it was thus with good men in Scripture. We read much
of <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow, he had no reſt in his bones by reaſon
of his ſin, yet mark, when <hi>David</hi> loſt <hi>Abſolom,</hi> O what a
fit of ſorrow was he in, crying out, <hi>O my ſon</hi> Abſolom,
<hi>my ſon, my ſon</hi> Abſolom, <hi>would God I had dyed for thee,
O</hi> Abſolom, <hi>my ſon, my ſon.</hi> Wee do not read of ſuch cryes,
O my ſoul, my ſoul, O what ſhall I doe for thee my
ſoul! becauſe the ſorrow was ſenſitive, the loſſe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</p>
            <p>Now beloved, Gods people do expreſſe more ſenſitive
ſorrow for outward croſſes then for inward corruptions.
A late Author doth quote an inſtance out of <hi>Jerome,</hi> a
godly woman loſt her children, &amp; ſhe wept even to death,
yet ſhe could not weep ſo for her ſin: the reaſon is, becauſe
things of ſenſe do more affect a man then things of faith;
though there be more evill in one ſin then in a thouſand
afflictions.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the relief of a troubled ſinner in
anſwer to the firſt Objection.</p>

thy ſelf, it may be thou miſtakeſt the nature of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and takeſt mortification to be that which it is
not: as firſt, it may be a godly Chriſtian doth extend
mortification beyond its bounds, as thus, it may be thou
doeſt extend mortification not to a gracious ſuppreſſion
of ſin, but to a totall extirpation of ſin, and thinkeſt that
becauſe ſin is not removed, it is not ſubdued. Now this
is a miſtake: mortification doth not extend ſo farre, but
it extends to an abolition of the dominion of ſin; not
of the being of ſin: before we dye we ſhall never be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
rid of the being of ſin; ſin will be in the heart. As
the tree in <hi>Dan. 4. 14. He cryed aloud, and ſaid thus:
Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, ſhake off his
leaves, and ſcatter his fruit; let the beaſts get away from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and the fowls from his branches; nevertheleſſe leave
the ſtump of his roots in the earth:</hi> So ſin in the heart, the
branches are cut off by mortification, the luxuriant
buddings, and bloſſomings, and breakings forth of ſin,
they are cut off; but the ſtump, the root of originall ſin,
from which all ſin flowes and growes that remaines
<hi>Dan. 7. 12. As concerning the reſt of the beaſts, they had
their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged
for a ſeaſon, and time;</hi> Though thou beeſt a mortified
man, yet mortification doth only take away the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> Again, thou doſt miſtake the nature of mortification,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96119:37"/>
there is this reaſon to be given for this, becauſe
mortification is not ſo compleat and perfect as remiſſion
of ſin is; remiſſion of ſin is a perfect act, and all men,
though their graces be inequall, yet their forgiveneſſe and
pardon is equall, and alike; becauſe God doth
not pardon one ſin and not another: but in the work of
mortification, it is partly done, partly not done; it is a
work begun: therefore a ſin may be fully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,

Obſerve if a man did lye under the power of ſin, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

through heedleſnes and in-obſervancy have not their
judgements inlightned to diſcern ſin; and if the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath not an eye to ſee ſin, the conſcience wil never
have an hand to ſmite for ſin: it is a Proverb, <hi>What the

can be the object of deſire, neither can any thing that
is unknown be the object of ſorrow; unknown miſeries
we weep not for, but miſeries we know, thoſe we mourn
for: if a mans judgement be not inlightned to ſee ſin, he
can never mourn for it; he may live and dye in a ſin that
his judgement is not convinced of to be a ſin: thus the
godly in the Old Teſtament lived in the ſin of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamie,
marrying of many wives, they knew not it was a

as they would.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:96119:40"/>
A godly man that holds an error, conſcience may never
ſmite him for it, becauſe his judgment is miſtaken his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thinks he holds the truth, and therefore conſcience
cannot ſmite him for holding an error</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, take this by way of anſwer, that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a pardoned ſinner, may be ſo farre benummed,
that a man may continue under the guilt of known ſins,
and conſcience never check him for it for a long time;
this is a further gradation, that when he knoweth he ſins,
againſt God, yet I ſay conſcience may be ſo far benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that, for a ſeaſon not be tortured and ſmitten
in conſcience for his ſin: <hi>David</hi> could not be
ſo ignorant of Gods Law that lying with another mans

leaſt without remorſe for it; when <hi>Nathan</hi> came and
reproved him, then ſaid he, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> I <hi>have ſinned.</hi>
O beloved, if God doth but let a ſinners conſcience alone,
though he be a good man, yet he may continue for a
long time under a known ſin, and conſcience not work
remorſe or trouble in him. And the like inſtance we have
in the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were not ſenſible of their ſin
in ſelling <hi>Joſeph,</hi> untill 20. yeares after they fell into

ſo much out of office for a while, that he may rather put
his wits a work to hide his ſin, then his conſcience on
work to check him for ſin; to give you an inſtance for this,
plain in the caſe of <hi>David, David</hi> committed adultery
with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> but he did not put his conſcience on
work to check him for his ſin, but he did put his wits
on work to hide the ſin. Four projects <hi>David</hi> had to hide

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, He did plot <hi>Vriah's</hi> death, that ſo there
might be no clamour on his part for the defilement of

            <p>Laſtly, <hi>David</hi> would have fathered his plot on provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for <hi>David</hi> himſelf had plotted the death of <hi>Vriah;</hi>
mark <hi>Davids</hi> project: a good man did put his wits on
work and made ſhifts to hide his ſin; yet all this
while did not put conſcience on work to check him for
his ſin. O how near the ſuburbs of hell may a godly man
go, and yet go to heaven!</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, This is the furtheſt ſtep of all, take this for
thy comfort, it is poſſible that the conſcience of a pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſinner may not ſmite him for thoſe very ſins that a
Heathen man by the light of a naturall conſcience may
be aſhamed of, and this is clear in the caſe of <hi>Abraham,
Gen. 20. 9. Then</hi> Abimelech <hi>called</hi> Abraham, <hi>and ſaid
unto him, What haſt thou done unto us, and what have Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

            </p>
            <p>And thus I have gone very farre in anſwering this
Objection. <hi>I</hi> have done it for to ſtay the troubles of a

theſe ſix ſteps neer going down to the Chambers of
death, yet it is poſſible that a pardoned ſinner may have
his conſcience thus deluded and out of office,</p>
            <p>Me thinks I hear many a preſumptuous heart alledge,
if this be true, that you ſay a pardoned ſinner may go
thus near hell, and yet come to heaven: if good men
may ſin a ſin, and yet conſcience never trouble them, then
I hope that I may have my ſin pardoned as well as the

            <p>Firſt, Though a pardoned man may have ſometimes
conſcience aſleep, yet that pardoned man dares not be
ſo bold and adventurous to ſin againſt conſcience
as wicked men do: you have this fully laid down in
Scripture, though but darkly. <hi>Lev. 13. 10. And the
Prieſt ſhall ſee him, and behold, if the riſing be white in the

                  </gap>e,</hi> then <hi>raw fleſh in the riſing:</hi> the Hebrew Rabbins do
underſtand two things by this Law,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The turning of the <hi>hair white in the ſore,</hi> they
note to be continuance in ſin, living from youth to old
age in ſin, till the hair be white and gray.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was to be <hi>quick and raw fleſh in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96119:42"/>
riſing,</hi> they underſtand it to be adventurouſneſſe in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to commit ſin againſt a raw, and a gawled, and a
rebuked conſcience. Another man might have ſcabs all
over his fleſh, yet he was not to be unclean. Verſ. 13.
<hi>Then the Prieſt ſhall conſider: and behold, it the leproſie
have covered all his fleſh, he ſhall pronounce him clean that
hath the plague, it is all turned white, he is clean.</hi> Yet if a
man had rawneſſe in the ſore, he was to be unclean: to
note, that a man may have many ſins, yet not be unclean
in Gods ſight; but if he ſin againſt the very dictates of
conſcience, and be bold and adventurous againſt the
gawlings of a perplexed conſcience, he ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take this for a difference, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

him for ſin committed, yet he doth not take that courſe

as <hi>Cain</hi> did, <hi>Gen. 4. Cain</hi> to put off the troubles of
his conſcience, would fall to buying, building, and
drowning himſelf in the world, that ſo he might hear no
more. A pardoned ſinner doth not thus, but if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſuggeſts guilt, he prayes to God that conſcience
might ſpeak throughly and to the heart.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A godly man doth not wallow and continue
in a cuſtome of ſin, that ſo cuſtome in his ſin, might take
away conſcience of his ſin. <hi>Epheſ. 4. 19. Who being
paſt feeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> 
               <hi>have given themſelves over to laciviouſneſſe,
to work all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe.</hi> Wicked men give
themſelves over to a cuſtome in ſin, that ſo they might
not have conſcience to ſmite them for ſin. They are like
a Smiths dog, a ſtrange dog that comes to a Smiths
forge cannot abide to have the ſparkles of fire flie about
him;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but that dog that hath alwayes been accuſtomed to
the ſhop, can ſleep ſtill on, and it never troubles him:
wicked men are like Smiths dogs uſed to the ſhop, though
flaſhes of hell fire are caſt about them, yet they ſleep ſtill
and are not awakened; but godly men do not make uſe
of cuſtome in ſin to lull them aſleep in their ſweet
luſts.</p>
            <p>A 7. difference, That though the conſcience of apardoned
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96119:43"/>
ſinner doth not ſmite him for ſin, yet is it ſooner and
eaſier awakened and raiſed out of a dead ſleep, then
the conſcience of a wicked man; a look from Jeſus
eye, and the Cock crowing made <hi>Peter</hi> weep, <hi>hee went
out and wept bitterly;</hi> a rebuke to <hi>David</hi> from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
made him cry out, <hi>Lord I have ſinned.</hi> A reprobate
conſcience is not ſo eaſily put into office, it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
him, there muſt be much adoe and great labour
taken before his dead conſcience will hear the rebukes
of the Word, there is more adoe with a wicked
man to have his conſcience in office then with a godly
man.</p>
            <p>Eightly, There is this difference, though the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a good man be aſleep for a time, and doth not
ſmite him for ſin, yet ſome time before he dyes, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſhall ſmite him for ſin; there is no godly man in
the world but under known ſins, if his conſcience hath
not ſmitten him, his conſcience ſhall ſmite him before he
dyes; but wicked men live &amp; dye in ſin &amp; never have the
controll or rebuke of conſcience: <hi>Ahaz</hi> was troubled
by affliction from God, yet conſcience never troubled
him, for he did yet more wickedly againſt God.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Though the conſcience of a pardoned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may be aſleep for a time, and may not reprove him
for ſin committed; yet a good mans conſcience when
it doth reprove him, it doth check him more out of a
ſenſe of ſin and the diſhonour done to God, then out of
fear of hell or any outward judgements; but wicked
men are aſleep in their conſciences, and if conſcience
doth ever awake, it is not becauſe ſin is ſin, and becauſe
God is diſhonoured; but becauſe there is hell for ſin,
&amp; becauſe there are outward grievous judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
God breaks men by his judgements, then they will
put conſcience on work, but never doe it out of ſenſe
of ſin; Take this compariſon of Ducks in a pond of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>And thus I have run haſtily over the anſwering of this
third Objection, I have done it meerly for the relief of
a perplexed Conſcience; thus I have done with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>I confeſt, &amp; thou forgaveſt. Thou forgaveſt,</hi> to forgive;
ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> is a word of favour, or grace, not merit.
<hi>Thou forgaveſt;</hi> It notes, pardon of ſin is not vouchſafed to
men by way of debt, but of gift; <hi>I confeſſed, and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;</hi>
thou forgaveſt what? <hi>Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of
my ſin,</hi> the ſin of my ſin. Interpreters have various appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
touching the meaning of theſe words, what
it is for God to forgive the iniquity of my ſin. <hi>I</hi> will
bring it to a two fold channell: Some there are that by
iniquity, underſtand the puniſhment of ſin; <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
my ſin, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin;</hi>
That is, thou forgaveſt <hi>the puniſhment of my ſin;</hi> the reaſon
of that interpretation is, becauſe in the Hebrew language
the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſignifies <hi>iniquity,</hi> ſignifies <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and therefore they underſtand the <hi>iniquity of ſin,</hi> the
<hi>puniſhment of ſin;</hi> but Interpreters generally go againſt
this interpretation, for uſually the word is taken for ſin
it ſelf; Again the whole ſcope of the Pſalm is not in
ſeeking the outward puniſhment to be forgiven; but the
forgiveneſſe of ſin is referred to eternall guilt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is in the Text a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a note
of admiration annexed to his expreſſion; <hi>Thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
&amp;c.</hi> ſurely that would be no wonder to God to
paſſe by an externall puniſhment, for that he might do
to men whoſe ſins were never pardoned: What is it for
God to forgive the <hi>iniquity of ſin?</hi> I anſwer, the <hi>iniquity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96119:44"/>
of ſin</hi> is meant, that God out of his free grace doth not
onely ſimply forgive a ſin committed, but he forgives
the iniquity of that ſin, all the malignity of that ſin,
all the hainous aggravated circumſtances that may any
wayes make it great. A Learned Author having a whole
Tract upon this Pſalme, hath theſe words, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
uſeth this kind of ſpeech, <hi>To forgive the iniquity of ſinne,
that he might touch us, that it was no light fault that was
pardoned, it was ſin, and it was the iniquity of ſinne, ſin
upon ſin, and ſin greatned by many hainous circumſtances.</hi>
Yet, Behold! the great mercy of God, <hi>Thou forgaveſt the
Iniquity of my ſin;</hi> thus much for the explaining of the
words.</p>

               <hi>The Obſervation is this;</hi> That ſuch are the riches of
Gods pardoning grace, that he forgives his people not onely
ſin in the general, but their great ſins, ſuch as are cloathed

Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this point I ſhall proceed in this
method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To prove the point to you by an Induction of
particular inſtances; then the application of it by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uſes. It is a pointfull of comfort, and indeed I know
not ſuch a Text in all the Bible that ſpeaks of Gods
grace in pardoning aggravated ſinnes, more clearly then
this Text doth.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, I ſhall give you an induction of inſtances,
that God doth not onely forgive his people a bare ſin
committed, but God doth out of the riches of his Grace
forgive his people thoſe ſins that you may call the <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſin,</hi> ſins cloathed with many hainous aggravated
circumſtances, to prove this take the inſtance of <hi>David,</hi>
that ſpeaks the words; an inſtance of <hi>Peter,</hi> another of <hi>Paul,</hi>
many men that have ſinned againſt light &amp; love, ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
checks of conſcience, and againſt mercies, are
theſe ſins forgiven? Yes, that is my work to prove, that
Gods grace doth forgive ſins that are cloathed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hainous and aggravated circumſtances, to make them
great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96119:44"/>
Firſt, I begin with <hi>David,</hi> becauſe it is the inſtance
in hand; will you conſider <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, the ſin of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and ranſack the bowels of it? you ſhall finde <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſin cloathed with great, hainous, and aggravated
circumſtances to make it great and grievous; and yet for
all this that ſin forgiven him.</p>
            <p>Firſt Circumſtance to aggravate <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, if you
conſider the quality of it, the kind of it. What ſin was
it? it was the ſin of Adultery; now of all ſins the ſin
of Adultery is an aggravated ſin; there are five circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>1. He that commits adultery, he ſins againſt his own
body.</p>
            <p>2. He ſins againſt the body of the woman he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
with.</p>
            <p>3. It is a wrong to his own Wife.</p>
            <p>4. It is a wrong to the Adultereſſes Husband.</p>
            <p>5. It is a wrong to the child that is illegitimately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in adultery, that an ignominy ſhould be on him
when he is borne: and therefore that <hi>David</hi> ſhould fall
to that ſin, it was one great ſin to aggravate <hi>Davids</hi>
ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If you conſider the dignity and quality of
<hi>Davids</hi> perſon that did commit this ſin,<note place="margin">Omne animi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium tantò con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectius in ſe Crimen habet quantò major qui peccat habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> He was King;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A Third Circumſtance to aggravate his ſin, it was
that he did commit the ſin after God had given him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
mercies, ſo <hi>Nathan</hi> telleth him, <hi>2 Sam. 12. 8.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Conſider this, that <hi>David</hi> had a Wife of
his own, nay many wives of his own, that did greaten
<hi>Davids</hi> ſin, and ſo <hi>Nathan</hi> told him; for (ſaith <hi>Nathan)
There was a poor man who had but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one Lamb, and a rich
man that had many Lambs, which killed the poor mans
Lamb;</hi> his meaning was, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould commit
adultery with the wife of that man that had but one wife,
when he had many of his own.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifth Circumſtance, if you conſider the time when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96119:45"/>
               <hi>David</hi> committed this ſin, it was when <hi>Davids</hi> Armies
were lying in the fields, this was done then, which was
enough to provoke God to make them turn their backs
upon their enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixth Circumſtance, It was a great injury to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Commander in his Army as to <hi>Vriah.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, Which is the chiefeſt Circumſtance of all,
that <hi>David</hi> ſhould commit many ſinnes to hide that one
ſin, that was an aggraving Circumſtance, <hi>David</hi> did
commit ſix-ſins to hide that one ſin of Adultery.</p>
            <p>1. He ſent for <hi>Vriah Bathſheba's</hi> husband to leave the
Army, when they were ſtorming a place, this might have
endangered the whole Army.</p>
            <p>2. The Text ſaith that <hi>David</hi> made <hi>Vriah</hi> drunk,
thinking thereby to make him go in to his Wife.</p>
            <p>3. He uſed a meanes for <hi>Vriah</hi> to father his baſtard
that he had gotten in uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>4. When that Plot would not take, <hi>David</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire,
and conſult how to kill <hi>Vriah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>David</hi> ſent a letter by <hi>Vriah,</hi> wherein <hi>Vriah</hi> was
a meſſenger of his own death, unknown to him.</p>
            <p>6. When <hi>Vriah</hi> was dead, the Text ſaith, that <hi>David</hi>
ſaid, <hi>The ſword makes no difference, for the ſword deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
one man as well as another;</hi> he laid <hi>Vriahs</hi> death on

have done an ill turn, if they ſhall doe many ill turns to

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighth Aggravation, which greatens <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, was
this, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife, firſt killed

aggravations for nine moneths together without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
or remorſe of conſcience. I do not name this

the glorious Goſpel of the bleſsed God which was committed

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third Conſolation is this, to you that are perplexed
in conſcience, that you have committed hainous and
aggravated ſinfulneſſe, yet that Jeſus Chriſt doth wipe
away the infamy and the ignominy of thy moſt horrid
and ſcandalous ſins, committed before converſion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thou haſt been a notorious infamous creature; yet
Chriſt takes off the ignominy and the infamy of thy ſin,

when he juſtifies thy perſon and doth ſanctifie thy nature.
It is obſervable of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> as is conceived ſhe
was a notorious whore, every one that ſaw her knew ſhe
was a common harlot; <hi>there was a woman that was a ſinner,</hi>
the meaning was, ſhe was an infamous notorious harlot;
What is done when Chriſt converted this woman? <hi>Luk. 7.
47. Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſins which are many are
forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Chriſt did delight to wipe
away the ignominy of her harlotry in her after-life. It
is worthy obſervation, that four women are reckoned in
the Genealogy of Chriſt; what women were they?
they were women that were infamous, the beſt of them
did fill into much ſcandal, and gave much offence: there
you find mention of <hi>Thamar, Rachab, Ruth,</hi> and <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi>
no more in the Genealogy but theſe; what were
all theſe women? Begin with <hi>Thamar,</hi> ſhe committed
uncleanneſſe with her Father in Law, an infamous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as you have the ſtory in <hi>Gen. 38. 18. And he ſaid,
What pledge ſhall I give thee? and ſhe ſaid, thy Signet, and
the Bracelets and thy Staffe that is in thine hand; and be
gave it her, and came in unto her, and ſhe conceived by him.</hi>
Then you read of <hi>Rachab,</hi> a common harlot, in <hi>Heb.
11. 31. By faith the Harlot Rachab periſhed not with them
that beleeved not when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace,
Matth. 1. 5. And Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab, &amp;c.</hi> A
third woman mentioned in the Genealogy is <hi>Ruth,</hi> what
was ſhe? ſhe was not ſo infamous as the reſt were, yet
ſhe ran into a grievous ſcandal, <hi>Ruth</hi> came of <hi>Moab,</hi>
whom <hi>Lot</hi> begat of his own daughter, you have the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Book of <hi>Geneſis 19. 36. Thus were both the
daughters of Lot with child by their Father.</hi> verſ. 37. <hi>And
the firſt borne bare a Son, and called his name Moab:</hi> What
was ſhe? for her perſon ſhe was a good woman; but as
all Divines obſerve of her, ſhe did an action that had
appearance of evill, what did ſhe? read the ſtory in the
third of <hi>Ruth,</hi> beginning at verſe 5. &amp;c. the ſtory ſaith,
that ſhe came alone at midnight to <hi>Boaz,</hi> there was an
action full of infamy, which was a ſhamefull thing that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96119:48"/>
a woman ſhould come to a man lying alone. Secondly,
ſhe came and lay by him in the night ſeaſon, but it is true,
the Scripture c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ears her for any thing following, verſ. 14.
<hi>And ſhe lay at his feet untill morning, and ſhe roſe up before
one could know another:</hi> there was no vanity, no folly
and no evill, yet it was a grievous ſcandall for a woman
to be with a man, and <hi>Boaz</hi> did fear the ſcandall of it too;
yet this woman is reckoned in the Genealogy of Chriſt.
The fourth woman is <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> ſhe was unclean with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
What is the Myſtery of this? truely all Interpreters
give this; There are but four women named in the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
al of them blame-worthy, ſome in a higher and ſome
in a lower degree; and it is recorded that Chriſt came
from theſe four, to take off the ignominy and infamy of
your ſins that you have fallen into before converſion: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
God ſhould ſuffer thee to fall into execrable villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
reall and ſound converſion to God takes off the
reproach and ignominy; therefore Chriſt to take off the
ignominy and reproach from theſe women would honour
them ſo far, as to reckon them in his own Genealogy.</p>
            <p>The point was this, That ſuch are the riches of Gods
pardoning grace, that hee forgives his people the great
ſins that are cloathed with many hainous and aggravated

may be aggravated and cloathed with ſuch cricum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as may make them great, two inſtances in <hi>Adams</hi>
ſin, and <hi>Davids</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, you would account it a ſmall matter
to eat an apple or ſome other fruit; but yet that ſmall fact
of eating the forbidden fruit, was ſo cloathed with many
circumſtances, which made it a great and grievous ſin:
for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, if you conſider the ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> he was not
as we are; but <hi>Adam</hi> was a perfect and an innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and it is a greater evill for a perfect creature to ſin,
then for us that are imperfect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the place where <hi>Adam</hi> was, it
was in Paradiſe, and yet there to ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the publickneſſe of his perſon, hee

repreſenting other men, his ſin is other mens ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How many aggravations were in the bowels
of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: there are ſix:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was unbliefe in his ſin, God did not tell
them with an <hi>if,</hi> or an <hi>and,</hi> but told them peremptorily
they ſhould dye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was this aggravation, that <hi>Adam</hi>
did believe the Devil, before God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there was pride in this ſin; for ſaith the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> and that pleaſed them; it was
not enough to be man and woman, but they muſt be gods.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There was curioſity in that ſin. You ſhall be
as gods <hi>knowing good and evil;</hi> now out of meer curioſity
to know more then they did know, though they knew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make them happy and bleſſed, did they plunge

            <p>Fifthly, They were not contented with their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly and laſtly, There was murder in this ſin, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

ſin entred into the World and death by ſin,</hi>

            <p>Look on <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring the people, it was
a very ſmall ſin, and indeed interpreters juſtifie the fact,
in it ſelfe it was no ſin for a King to number his Army;
yet there were ſome circumſtances with which this fact
was cloathed, that made <hi>Davids</hi> fact very ſinfull: there
were ſix hainous aggravations in that fact of <hi>Davids</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the people.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, there was pride and vain glory; this <hi>Toſtatus</hi>

            <p>Secondly, There was carnal dependance in his ſin, he
would number his people, that ſeeing how ſtrong he was
he might depend on the multitude, this ſaith <hi>Zanchius</hi>
was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There was covetouſneſſe in the ſin too. <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
ſaith this was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin. It is obſervable, that when
in Iſrael the ſouldiers were muſtered, and the ſubjects
numbred, there was a tax by pole, that every one ſhould
pay, this was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin that he would needleſly number
the people for covetouſneſſe ſake.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There was curioſity, for <hi>David</hi> did a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
act; for what need <hi>David</hi> know every particular
man in his kingdome. <hi>Ioab</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, 1 Chron. 21. 4.
Why doth my Lord require this thing? why wilt thou mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

to thee: yet vain curioſity made <hi>David</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, there was the ſin of ſacriledge, this</hi> Zanchius
<hi>notes: for when the people were numbred, there was
to be given for the uſe of the Sanctuary, halfe a
ſhekel, as you have the ſtory,</hi> Exod. 30. 12. When thou
takest the ſum of the children of Iſrael, after their number,
then ſhall they give every man a ranſome for his ſoule unto
the Lord, when thou numbreſt them, that there be no plague
amongſt them, when thou numbreſt them, <hi>Verſ. 13.</hi> This
they ſhall give, every one that paſſeth among them that are
numbred, halfe a ſhekel after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary:
<hi>compare this with</hi> Exod. 38. 25. And the ſilver of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96119:50"/>
that were numbred of the Congregation, was an hundred
talents, and a thouſand ſeven hundred and threeſcore and
fifteen ſhekels after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary, &amp;c. David,
<hi>ſome ſuppoſe, did defraud the Sanctuary of that mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, In this ſin, there was an expreſs breach of
Gods Law: this <hi>Deodat</hi> ſaith: for his Law was, the
people ſhould not be numbred that were under 20 years,
but only thoſe above 20 years, now <hi>David</hi> did number
thoſe that were under 20 year. <hi>Exo. 30, 14 Every one that
paſſeth among them that are numbred, from 20 years old

From 20 years old and upward, all that are able to goe forth
to war in Iſrael:</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> numbring thoſe that were

That is a third conſideration to you that ſay you never run
into ſcandalous ſins: yet conſider, that little ſins may bee
ſo aggravated by circumſtances, as that they become grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous:
ſuppoſe thy ſin be ſecret luſt, and paſſion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
pride: thy ſins may have ſuch circumſtances, as to
make them great: ſuppoſe thy ſins be againſt checks of
conſcence they are great ſins, becauſe they are againſt
Gods officer in man; Conſcience is Gods officer in thee,
and Gods Regiſter, and Vicegerent in man; and for thee
to controll thine own conſcience againſt the accuſations
and againſt the convictions and checks of thy conſcience,
though the ſin be but a ſmal trifie, yet it is very great; <hi>He
that doubteth is damned, if he eats.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, it
is no ſin to eat meat, but if thou thinkeſt it is a ſin to eat
meat, and doſt it, thou ſinneſt againſt conſcience. If
thy conſcience telleth thee that it is unlawfull to do this or
that, and yet thou wilt venture on it, the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>He that doubteth is damned, if he eats.</hi> If thou doeſt any
any thing againſt the rebukes of conſcience, it is a great
crime; becauſe conſcience is Gods Officer in thee: to
eat meat, is but a trifle; the Queſtion was, whether
they might eat meat offered to an idoll, the Apoſtle ſaith
they might do it, I, but ſuppoſe conſcience in a man might
ſay, I am perſwaded that if I ſhould eat this meat that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96119:51"/>
was offered to an Idoll, I ſhould approve of Idolatary, <hi>then</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>thou art damned if thou eat:</hi> to ſhew that
if in ſo ſmall a thing as eating fleſh, then in other matters
alſo; if thy conſcience telleth thee, that thou ſinneſt if
doeſt it and yet doeſt it, thy little ſin is become a great
ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſmalleſt ſin may be aggravated, if there
be a complacency in thy heart to a ſmall ſin. A ſmall
ſin that is indulged, is a more aggravating ſin then a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſin thou doeſt fall into with reſiſtance. It is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in <hi>Lev. 13. 12. And if a leproſie break out abroad in
the skin and the leproſie cover all the skin of him that hath
the plague, from his head even unto his foot, whereſoever
the Prieſt looketh. Ainſworth</hi> admires and wonders what
God intends by this Law: the meaning is, the leproſie
betokens ſinne. Now if the leproſie, or the plague, or
the ſmall pox; if it comes out into a ſcab, and comes
into the fleſh, and ſtrikes outward, there is no diſeaſe
within; but then there is danger when ſores ſtrike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and do not come out in the fleſh: this Law hath
this uſe in it, if the leproſie were onely on the skin, the
man was not unclean, though there was ſin in his life,
yet ſin was not in his heart: I, but ſaith God, <hi>if the ſcab
be in ſight deeper then the skin, then pronounce him unclean;</hi>
to ſhew, if ſin be in thy heart and in thy life too, though
it be but a ſmall ſin, yet it is a ſin that will damn thee:
<hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, Pſal 66. 18. the Lord
will not hear me.</hi> Therefore you that are morall
men, that ſay, you thank God, that you have not broke
out into groſſe ſins: conſider, though ſin be ſmall, yet
your ſmall ſins may have ſuch circumſtances, as may make
them very great, ſinning againſt your conſciences, or elſe
ſin ſeiſing upon the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to morall men, that a great and groſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may be pardoned, when morall men who never
brake out into ſuch groſſe wickedneſſe, may live and dye
in an unpardoned eſtate. I will give you tow inſtances, the
one of the Phariſee, and the other of the young man in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96119:51"/>
the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the Phariſee, in <hi>Luk. 18. I thanke God,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>I am no extortioner, no drunkard, no adulterer;</hi> I am not
this nor that: the Phariſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a man that never
broke out into ſcandalous ſins; what was the concluſion?
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that he that juſtified himſelf was not juſtified;
but the Publican was juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied rather then the Phariſee:</hi> the
Publican that had fallen into extortion, by his office he was
tempted unto much extortion, he was a wicked liver,
and yet went away juſtified. O! a civill honeſt Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a Phariſee that never brake out into ſcandall, yet was
not juſtified: a Pulican that was a known and infamous
ſinner, went away juſtified.</p>
            <p>2 The progidal ſonne that ran away from his father,
ſpent all his ſubſtance, and went to live among hogs and
ſwine, in this world, that is wicked men, yet this man
a pardoned man. The young man who told Chriſt that
he kept al Gods commands from his youth was an unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
man, yet the prodigal that was riotous from his,
youth &amp; confeſſed his ſin, became a juſtified man, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the very intent of theſe Scriptures, is for this end;
that civil moral men ſhould not preſume on pardon, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their civil morality.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly conſider, That what your ſins do want in regard
of others mens in bulk and magnitude, you may make up
in number. Suppoſe thou haſt not been a drunkard, an
adulterer, an oppreſſor, yet thou haſt many ſmall ſins,
thou haſt many ſecret and ſmall failings: now remember,
many ſmall ſins may ſooner damn thee, then a few greater
ſins, I may make uſe of that pertinent Scripture, in <hi>Jer.
5. 6. Wherefore a Lion out of the forreſt ſhall ſlay them, and
a Wolfe of the evenings ſhall ſpoil them; a Leopard ſhall

back-ſlidings are increaſed,</hi> Verſ. 7. <hi>How ſhall I pardon
thee for this? &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe their tranſgreſſions were
many, therefore God comes with a queſtion, <hi>How ſhall
I pardon?</hi> Beloved, Suppoſe thy ſins be not great, yet if
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96119:52"/>
they be many ſmall ſins, God may put this queſtion to you,
How ſhall I pardon you? Let me tell a paradox, that ſmall
ſins are as hardly yea more hardly pardoned, then greater
ſins are. And the reaſon is, becauſe a man is not ſo apt to
repent for ſmall ſins, as he will be for great, becauſe they
are not ſo viſible, and therefore conſcience not ſo apt to do its
office to put a man upon repentance; that is the reaſon
of Chriſts ſpeech, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that Publicans
and harlots ſhall goe to heaven before them,</hi> why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Phariſees did depend upon their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and did not ſee their little ſmall ſins: a Publican, a
harlot, that could not but by the light of nature ſee their
extortion, their wickedneſſe, and harlotry, they ſhould
go to heaven before them, Chriſt told them of their ſins
and they repented of them. Therefore though your ſins
be but ſmall, yet they may be many, and that will grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your ſins: a many ſmall ſins may run thee into deeper
arrearages unto God, then a few groſſer evils. As in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick
many ſmal ſigurs put together amount to agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſum then a few great ones; So it is in reſpect of little
ſins. O then let me perſwade you, that none of you would
preſume on pardon, becauſe you have not fallen into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and groſſer evils. Thus much for firſt branch of the Uſe.</p>

            <p>Firſt, ſomething by way of admoniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt conſider, though your groſſe ſins cannot bring
your perſons into a ſtate of damnation, yet they will bring
you into a ſtate of ſequeſtration; though they cannot keep
thee from heaven, yet will they keep thee from comfort:
God will ſuſpend and withdraw the manifeſtations of
his grace; he will turn his ſmiles into frownes upon thee.
Beloved this is ſad, a groſſe ſin will keep thee from the
comforts and joyes of heaven, though it cannot keep thee
from the poſſeſſion of heaven.</p>
            <p>A child of God that ſins though hee bee not under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96119:52"/>
but of his heritage, yet he is under an interdiction
thou mayeſt have a right to heaven, a right to ſalvation,
yet God hath ſhut thee up that thou mayeſt not have the
manifeſtations of a reconciled God towards thee; this
is aſtoniſhment to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to admoniſh thee, though thou beeſt pardoned;
yet ſuch wofull commotions, ſuch diſmall fears, will ariſe
in thy conſcience, that will make thee verily think thou
art not pardoned. Beloved, if you fal into groſſe ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the ſanctifying work of the Spirit, God will withdraw
the comforting Work of the Spirit. The ſpirit of God is
compared to a Dove; the Dove loves to bee in clean
places, but if the houſe be naſty, the Dove goeth away,
and will not ſtay there: Gods Spirit is like a Dove, it
loves to have the houſe of thy ſoule kept clean; but if
thy ſoul be filled with noyſome and naſty luſts, the Spirit
of God will not deſcend on thee; the greater thy ſins are,
the greater thy ſorrowes, anguiſh and tortures of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will bee. Philoſophers ſay, the more vapours
are drawn from the earth, the more the light and luſtre
of the Sun is eclipſed: the more ſin doth ariſe from thy
heart to thy life, the more thou darkeneſt the riſing of the
Sun of righteouſneſſe, that glorious beams ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on thee: thy falling into groſſe ſins, may cauſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commotions, &amp; diſmal horrors in thy conſcience; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
is not this grievous, thou pardoned ſinner, to think
though this groſſe ſin may not damn my ſoule, yet before
I dye it will torture my conſcience? If I do ſpeak to a
troubled conſcience there is none in the world wil ſay, that
the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure of ſin, can compenſate the
anguiſh and torture of conſcience which ſmarteth for ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Conſider, thou that falleſt into a groſſe ſin, 
though a juſtifyed perſon; yet it will be a harder work
and a longer time for thee to attain aſſurance of pardon
then for other men: the deeper a wound is, and the
longer it is feſtering and rankling, the harder and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it will be before it be healed again. <hi>David</hi> did pour
out a river of tears before God did pour in a drop of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96119:53"/>
oyle of joy and gladneſſe into his heart; <hi>David</hi> brake
Gods Law, God broke his bones; therefore he prayed,
<hi>Lord reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation, that the bones
which thou haſt broken may rejoyce.</hi> It is worthy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of what you read of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a notorious
ſinner, <hi>there was a woman which was a ſinner, that is,
as ſome expound it, a knwn harlot, a known strumpet,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>her ſinnes which are many are forgiven her:</hi> but
did Chriſt tell theſe words to <hi>Mary?</hi> no, Chriſt ſpake
theſe words to <hi>Simon,</hi> in whoſe houſe Chriſt was at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
mark the method, Divines make much uſe of this.
<hi>Mary</hi> fell into a groſſe ſin, but <hi>Mary</hi> muſt not firſt know
her own pardon; <hi>Mary</hi> was weeping for her ſin, and
it was firſt revealed unto another that ſhe was pardoned;
to ſhew, that when men fall into groſſe ſins, God doth
many times hide comforts from them, other men ſhall
have good hope of their pardon, more then they have
of themſelves; let this be admoniſhment and a check to
you to take heed of falling into groſſe evils; for God may
keep you long without manifeſtation of pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to admoniſh thee, conſider, that thou doeſt
run a very dangerous and deſperate hazard to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the commiſſion of ſin upon preſumption of pardon:
Wilt thou ſin, that may be as painfull to thy conſcience as
the breaking of thy bones, becauſe Chriſt can ſet thee in
joynt again? Wilt thou ſin and cut gaſhes in thine own
fleſh, becauſe thou knoweſt the Bloud of Chriſt to be a

we are healed.<note place="margin">Direction to. great ſinners</note>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to give you ſomething by way of direction:
Haſt thou been a man that God hath left to thine own
hearts luſt? thou haſt not onely ſin, but the iniquity of ſin,
ſin aggravated; then,</p>
            <p>Firſt take this rule, Labour in the reſidue of thy dayes
to be as eminent in grace, as thou haſt been formerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
in ſin: have thy luſts been ſtrong? labour now,
that thy affections may be ſtrong God-ward and Heaven-ward:
has thy ſin been cloathed with many hainous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96119:53"/>
to make it great? let thy graces be cloathed
with many holy circumſtances to make them great:
though this cannot make a compenſation to the moſt
High (for nothing thou haſt or doſt can recompenſe God
for the wrong ſin doth him) yet is this ſomething by
way of a Holy revenge on thy ſelfe; the more thou haſt
been notorious in evill, thou ſhouldeſt labour now to be
more eminent in good.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Haſt thou fallen into any groſſe and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
guilt? follow this Rule, Labour that the greater thy
ſin and thy unkindneſſe hath been to God, thou expreſs
now the greater love to Jeſus Chriſt for pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
O labour thou that haſt great ſins pardoned, that thou
mayeſt have great love iſsued out to Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt
did not ſimply aske <hi>Peter, Simon Peter loveſt thou me?</hi> out
goeth higher, <hi>Peter doest thou love me more then theſe?</hi>
there was this reaſon why Chriſt ſhold aske him this
Queſtion, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> had ſinned againſt Chriſt more then
all the diſciples had, therfore <hi>Peter</hi> muſt love Chriſt more.</p>
            <p>Do I ſpeak to any that have been taler by the head in
ſin, then any of their neighbours have been? O! if thou haſt
ſinned much, love much; the greater the ſin, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the pardon muſt be, and therefore on thy part the
greater muſt thy love be to Jeſus Chriſt; this is held
out plain in that familiar parable that Chriſt uſeth, <hi>Luk.
7. 41. There was a certain creditor, Which had two deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the one ought five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</hi>
Verſ. 42. <hi>Aud when they had nothing to pay, he frankly
forgave them both; Tell me therefore, which of them will
love him moſt,</hi> Verſ. 43. Simon <hi>anſwered and ſaid, I
ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt: and he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, thou haſt rightly judged.</hi> The meaning of this
is, the two debtors are two ſorts of ſinners, he that
owed a little ſum he could not pay his debt: though thou
haſt but few little ſins, yet thou canſt not ſatisfie for it.
He that owned much was a great ſinner, as <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen:</hi>
It may be God hath forgiven thee thy hundred of
ſins, &amp; thy five hundred of ſins: O make good this Parable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96119:54"/>
that he that hath moſt forgiven him, love moſt, the
greater thy ſin hath been, the greater thy love moſt bee.
It is thus with <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luk 7. 47. wherefore I ſay
unto thee, Her ſins which are many are forgiven her, for
ſhee loved much.</hi> Her love doth hold proportion to her
pardon; much pardon on Chriſts part, and much love
on her part. O beloved let me here inculcate this on
your thoughts: have any of you been great ſinners? have
you been guilty of aggravated and hainous circumſtances?
now finde that your love doth carry ſome proportion to
your pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly hath God ſuffered thee to fall <hi>into the iniquity
of ſin?</hi> obſerve this direction, the greater thy ſin hath
been to God, labour that thy humiliation may be greater,
that it may carry ſome proportion to the greatneſſe of
thy tranſgreſſion. It is obſervable of what you read of
three men in Scripture, of <hi>David, Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
theſe all ſinned greatly; and their ſorrow and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did carry proportion to their ſin, in ſome meaſure;
<hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſinned greatly, and the Scripture ſaith of him,
<hi>That he humbled himſelf greuly before the Lord. Peter</hi> did
deny Chriſt ſhamfuly, <hi>and Peter went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
You know <hi>David</hi> ſinned notoriouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he mourned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
<hi>rivers of tears ran from his eyes, he watered his
couch with tears:</hi> all this teacheth you, that the greater
thy ſin hath been, the greater thy humiliation ſhould bee.
An obſervable Law you read of in <hi>Lev. 11. 24, 25. And for
theſe you ſhall be unclean, whoſoever toucheth the carkaſſe
of them ſhall be unclean untill the Even. And whoſoever
beareth ought of the carkaſſe of them ſhall waſh his clothes
and be unclean until the Even,</hi> touching an unclean thing,
a man was unclean; but if a man carried an unclean thing
any length of time, then ſaith God he ſhall be <hi>unclean
till Even, and he ſhall waſh his clothes.</hi> This law ſhews,
that touching an unclean ſin, requires an humiliation;
but if thou haſt born a ſin, and hugged a ſin in thy armes,
then there is greater worke required of thee, <hi>he was to
waſh his clothes,</hi> He that hath continued in ſin muſt waſh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96119:54"/>
his heart by humiliation and muſt take more pains with
his heart that hath fallen into a groſſe evil, then thoſe who
have not fallen ſo foulely and frequently.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourth Direction; In caſe thou expecteſt to have a
high eſteeme of pardoning grace, labour thou to find out
all the aggravated and hainous circumſtances in thy ſin.
Do not fear that the ſeeing of the ſinfulneſſe of ſin will do
you hurt: firſt look on pardon, and then look on the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of thy ſin; this is the way to heighten Chriſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and greaten Gods mercy, and extoll Gods pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace. It is notably mentioned of two men that
were famous this way. It is reported of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when
he came to confeſſe ſin, he uſed theſe words, <hi>Lord there
is none have ſinned, as I have ſinned, the Devil ſinned,
Judas ſinned grievouſly, but none ſinned as I:</hi> The Devil
indeed ſinned, but Chriſt never dyed for the Devill as he
dyed for me, therefore my ſin is a greater ſin then the
Devils: <hi>Judas</hi> ſinned greatly, but <hi>Judas</hi> never had the
pardon I had; <hi>Achan</hi> ſinned too, but I ſinned further then
he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O labour to finde out what aggravations there are that
thy evils are capable of, that ſo thou mightſt come to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
and greaten the grace of God in thy eſteem. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ſtory of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when God converted him, and
ſmote his conſcience for the vanity of his youth;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> how
doth he aggravate his ſin when he was a boy for robbing
of an Orchard, he doth aggravate that ſin with many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
Firſt, I robbed an Orchard meerly out of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
not out of need, to ſteale for need is more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
though not juſtifiable; but when he had enough,
that was vanity; then it was not for the goodneſſe of the
fruit, but meerly for the luſt of the eye: then I did not
rob the Orchard alone, but I got others with me; then,
it was an unſeaſonable time of night; then, he went to
rob the Orchard after he had ſpent all the day in vain
ſport, then, what they could not eat they gave to the
hogs; then, ſaith he, I wronged and injured an honeſt
neighbour that never did me wrong; O ſee how hee
clothed that ſin with many hainous crimes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96119:55"/>
canſt not thou cloath thy uncleanneſſe, thy oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
thy extortion, thy unjuſt dealing, with hainous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances?
let me direct you a little in this rule.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To aggravate thy ſin, conſider all ſins againſt the
manifeſtation of Gods love are great, when God ſpeaks
peace to thee, if thou ſhouldſt then return to fooliſhneſſe,
<hi>Pſal. 85. 8.</hi> this greatnes ſin: it was an aggravation of
<hi>Solomons</hi> ſin, that he ſinned againſt the Lord after God
had revealed himſelfe twice to him, <hi>1 King 11. 9. And
the Lord was angry with Solomon, becauſe his heart was
turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared
to him twice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It aggravates ſin, when you commit a ſin
upon a ſlight temptation, for a man to ſin when he hath
little or no provocation, that greatens ſin; What made
the ſin of the Devil ſo great? it was this, that thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
had none to tempt them: for thee to follow the
ſtews, for thee to follow thy luſts? when the Devil doth
not tempt thee to doe it, when the provocation is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from thine own heart, this greatens a mans ſin; and
thus in the Prophet <hi>Micah, that men ſhould ſell the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for ſilver, and the needy for a paire of ſhoes.</hi> O when thou
ſhalt recollect and ſay, how have I diſhonoured God, how
have I run the hazard of an immortall ſoul? when the
Devil hath laid no temptation to me, this greatens ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</p>
            <p>A third thing to greaten ſin by is, when a man doth
ſin againſt the checks and rebukes of his own conſcience;
Conſcience ſaith, doe not ſin, doe not wickedly, and the
man ſaith, I muſt, I muſt, I ſhall loſe all elſe. When
Conſcience ſhall arreſt thee, and accuſe thee of ſin, and
thou ſhalt ſtifle and put by all: this aggravates thy ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The frequency of the acts of ſinne, to
commit a ſin once is not ſo much, but to fall often into the
ſame ſin, this greatens ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Complacency of heart in ſin, when ſin is not
onely the ſin of thy practiſe, and of thy life, but thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteſt
in ſin; if ſin be rivetted and rooted in thy heart,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96119:55"/>
thou art unclean: canſt thou go to God, &amp; ſay, Lord what
grace is here land what mercy is here! that thou haſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
great tranſgreſſions, and thoſe ſins that I can aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
by many hainous circumſtances; I have read my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and yet I have now blotted my pardon: canſt thou ſay, I
have ſinned, and upon a very trivial occaſion and on a smal
temptation, I am a drudge to the Devil on an eaſie temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
when the Devill can draw thee by a ſilken thread
to a ſin; O it is a great aggravation, when Conſcience ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
thee for ſin, and thou wilt ſtill be ſtifling the cries of
conſcience: would you greaten ſin, you are in a ready way
to greaten mercy, &amp; pardoning grace, that is a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> direction.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If God doth out of the riches of his grace par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
aggravated ſins, take you heed, that when you have
obtained great and gracious pardons for great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſins, you do not extenuate your ſins, do not ſay of
your ſins as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar, Is not this a little one?</hi> doe not ſay
of wilfull enormities as <hi>Jacob</hi> did. <hi>Peradventure it was
an overſight,</hi> do not mince the matter, and doe not leſſen
ſin, but greaten ſin. The reaſon why thou ſhouldſt not
doe it, conſider <hi>firſt</hi> by extenuating ſin and making it ſmal
and little in your eye, you will leſſen the greatneſſe of
Gods pardoning grace: who will value the skill and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of a kitchin woman? That Phyſitian is valued that
can cure a deadly and dangerous diſeaſe: when a mans
ſpirits are gone, and ſtrength is conſumed, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
is prized: thou by leſſening thy ſin doſt leſsen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
grace.</p>
            <p>2. By the extenuating thy ſin, thou doeſt leſsen the
value of Chriſts bloud.</p>
            <p>3. Thou wilt leſsen thine own repentance and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:
for what man will labour after great humiliation
for ſmall tranſgeſſions? therfore there is a world of wrong
done to thy own ſoule, when God hath pardoned great
tranſgreſſions, if thou ſhouldſt extenuate and leſſen the
greatneſs of thy evils,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Content not your ſelves with ſlight and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
repentance ſo falling into great and groſs evils,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96119:56"/>
be not like <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> when he
did an evill againſt his conſcience, he pulled off his hat
and tooke his Crucifixe and cryed God mercy for what
he had done; ſo many men, if they can but cry God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in ordinary and generall tearms, they think they have
made a Compenſation to Divine Juſtice. And thus have
I done with the ſecond branch of the uſe in theſe ſix par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>The third and the laſt branch ſhall be by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note>
to troubled and perplexed Conſciences,<note place="margin">Conſolations againſt great ſins.</note> that by
reaſon of their falling into aggravated and hainous ſins,
do entertain doubtfull thoughts of their own pardon: five
Conſolations I ſhall lay down to you from the ſcripture,
who have repented of great and many ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Conſider for thy comfort, that converſion
and repentance for ſin before God, wipes off the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
and the infamy of thy former miſcarriages; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thou haſt been an ignominious notorious ſoul crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet repentance puts a vail over thy ignominious
luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take this for thy comfort, that Jeſus Chriſt,
doth manifeſt more love to thoſe men who have fallen
into groſs ſin, after repentance and humiliation, then he
did to any other ſorts of men in the world; It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
of <hi>Peter. Peter</hi> did ſin more then all the Diſciples
unleſs <hi>Judas</hi> that was the caſt-away; after <hi>Peter</hi> did
humble himſelfe and repent of his denyall, Chriſt did
ſhew more love to <hi>Peter</hi> then to all the other Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> after his Reſurrection,
before he appeared to any other, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> tels you in <hi>1 Cor.
15. 5. And that he was ſcen of Cephas, and then of the
twelve,</hi> there was love in Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> did deny but three
daies before, and <hi>Peter</hi> muſt firſt ſee him.</p>
            <p>Again, When Chriſt was riſen from the dead, he ſent
a meſsenger to <hi>Peter</hi> particularly by name, <hi>Goe tell my
Diſciples in generall, and tell</hi> Peter <hi>that I am riſen, Mark.
16. 7. But goe your waies, tell his Diſciples and Peter. Peter</hi>
was crying, weeping and be wailing that he ſhould deny
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96119:56"/>
his Maſter, and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe tell Peter that I am riſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Chriſt doth ſingle out <hi>Peter</hi> after he roſe from the
dead, Chriſt hath more diſcourſe with <hi>Peter</hi> then hee
hath all with his Diſciples elſe, <hi>Joh. 21.</hi> Thus you ſee that
Jeſus Chriſt manifeſts love to thoſe ſinners that ſinned
foully, after they have repented and are ſufficiently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for their ſin. Thus it is with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> after
ſhe repented, what expreſſions of love doth Chriſt to
her? Firſt, we read that hee caſt out of her ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
<hi>Luk. 8. 2.</hi> Then he appeared firſt to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhee
was the firſt that ſaw him when he was riſen: <hi>Mark.
16. 9. Now when Jeſus was riſen early the firſt day of the
week, he appeared firſt to Mary Magdalen.</hi> Again, Chriſt
commanded, that where ever the Goſpell came to bee
preacht, the fame of <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be made known,
<hi>Matth. 26. 1, 3. Verily I ſay unto you, whereſoever this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
ſhall be preached in the whole world, there ſhall alſo this
that this woman hath done, be told for a memoriall of
her;</hi> what a great honour was this to <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen?</hi>
Thus it appears that God doth manifeſt to thoſe
perſons that have ſinned the groſſeſt ſins, if afterward
they ſhall have the more ſerious, and through humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the cleareſt evidences, and the ſtrongeſt comforts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take this for your comfort; It is not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of that ſin thou committeſt, but onely the hardneſſe
and impenitency of thy own heart that can exempt thee
from pardon. Divines doe generally ſay, that the reaſon
of that ſaying in Scripture, <hi>All ſin and blaſphemy ſhall
be forgiven, but the blaſphemy against the Holy Ghoſt
ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to
come;</hi> It is not that there is not more merit in Chriſt to ſave
then there is guilt in that ſin; but it is becauſe that man
cannot, will not, repent of the ſin; Therefore that ſin
cannot be forgiven, becauſe he cannot repent. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thy ſin be blaſphemy, this doth not exempt from
pardon. It is not the greatneſſe of thy ſin, but the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
hardneſſe and finall impenitency of thy heart, that
can exempt thee from pardon. when <hi>Peter</hi> preached to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96119:57"/>
the Jewes that had a hand in crucifying the Son of God;
yet ſaith he, <hi>repent and your ſins ſhall be blotted out, O</hi> what
ſin could be greater then their embrewing their hands in
the bloud of Chriſt? yet doe but <hi>repent and your ſins ſhall
bee blotted out.</hi> It is not for want of great mercy on Gods
part, and great merits on Chriſts part that men are unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
but it is want of repentance on thine owne part.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That no groſſe ſin committed by a juſtified
perſon can make void his former pardon; A rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Shoolemen: the worke of God cannot bee
made void or fruſtrated by the worke of man, Election
is a work of God, Redemption the work of God, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
the worke of God, which cannot be made void by
the work of man; therefore if God hath elected thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
thee, juſtifyed and pardoned thee, the incurſion
of groſſe evills cannot reſtrain thee of former pardon; It
is true, ſinne may make void thy former comforts, thy for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer
evidences; groſs ſins may lay waſt thy conſcience; but
they cannot lay waſt the grace, and the mercies of God;
herein you may be greatly comforted and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Take this for thy comfort, though thou doſt fall
into groſſe and aggravated guilt, yet ſuch is the goodneſs
and mercy of God; <hi>that he orders thy very falling into ſin
to turn to thy good:</hi> I doe not mention this to any
that they ſhould be imboldened to fall into ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may turn to good; <hi>O</hi> it is God that orders a
mans fall for his good: A threefold good that God doth
to his people out of their very ſins, God doth not onely
doe good to his people by their afflictions, but he doth
good to his people by their very ſins.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sometimes God doth ſo order that the falling of
a godly man into ſin, ſhall abate pride in his heart; men
of great parts are apt to be proud, God many times will
let ſtrong luſts attend ſtrong gifts, the more to abate and
keep under the exaltation of ſpirit, therefore ſaith
<hi>Paul, I have the meſſengers of Satan to buffet me, that I
might not be exalted above meaſure;</hi> God doth many times
to keep under pride, let a temptation looſe on a man, &amp; ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96119:57"/>
God doth him good that way. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, I am not
afraid to ſay, that it is profitable ſometimes for good men
to fall into ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will prevent many other ſins; here is
Gods great mercy, the putting of a man to pain takes
away pain; God ſometimes ſuffers a man to ſin, that ſin
might keep out another ſin; one ſin may be ſo ordered
by God to keep out another ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdy, Falling into ſin ſometimes doth renew the
work of repentance, the Lord ſometimes lets them ſleep
that ſo he might awaken them by a greater humiliation,
and to taſt the more of the bitterneſſe and fruit of ſin,
here then is Gods goodneſſe to a ſinner, that by letting
him fall into a ſin he doth thee good, and makes thee to
renew repentance, and greatens humiliation in thy heart.</p>
            <p>Now for the finiſhing of this ſubject,<note place="margin">Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</note> there are
ſeven Caſes of conſcience that in this Doctrine are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether God may forgive a man his ſin, and
yet the man himſelfe not know it: here <hi>David</hi> had ſin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him, and <hi>David</hi> did know it, <hi>I acknowledge, and
thou forgaveſt:</hi> but whether may a man have ſin forgiven
him, and yet not know he is pardoned? I anſwer, in the
affirmative, that a man may have ſin forgiven him, <hi>and yet
not know that his ſin is pardoned;</hi> though <hi>David</hi> did know
his pardon at this time, yet he did not know his pardon
at other times, <hi>Pſal. 51. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy
Salvation.</hi> God broke <hi>Davids</hi> bones for his Adultery,
and <hi>David</hi> was driven to ſhed a River of tears before
God did pour in one drop of joy, <hi>Job 33. 10. Behold hee
findeth occaſions againſt me, he counteth me for his
enemy. Job</hi> thought that God was an enemy unto him: and
you have not onely the confeſſion of one man, but the
doubts and fears of the Church in generall, <hi>Lament. 3. 42.
We have tranſgreſſed and have rebelled, thou haſt not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
we have rebelled, &amp;c.</hi> Yet God had pardoned,
and God had forgiven them; yet here was their fear
and their doubt, they lay under ſuſpenſe of pardon;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96119:58"/>
God may pardon a ſinne unto the Elect, and yet they
not know that they are pardoned, and in the manifold
Wiſdome of God there are divers reaſons for it; <hi>firſt
by keeping them under a ſuſpenſe of pardon, they may ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize
with and carry more tenderneſs of compaſſion towards
them that are troubled in minde;</hi> it was one end of Chriſts
ſufferings, his ſoule was in an agony and under a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
crying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
what was the end of it? it was for this, that Chriſt might
carry more compaſſion, and more bowels of tenderneſſe
towards perſons that are under deep deſertions; Let a
ſcholar that ſtudies many things, read in a Booke, of
the ſtorms and diſtreſſes that ſea-men are ſubject unto; yet
by all he reads he cannot pity men in a ſtorm, if he have
never been in a ſtorm himſelfe; let one read what the
ſcripture mentions of the pangs of a woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
ſhe cannot ſo compaſſionate a woman in travell,
unleſſe ſhee hath had the pangs her ſelfe; ſo in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, it is experience that makes men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is for this reaſon, to raiſe up in mens
hearts a higher eſteem of pardoning grace; things hardly
come by, are highly ſet by; what is the reaſon that
birds do chirp and ſing more ſweetly in the ſpring then
in any other part of the year? it is for this, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the vaniſhing away of a long and tedious winter the
refreſhing Spring comes in: Beloved, The Lord makes
his people chirp and ſing in the ſenſe of pardoning grace,
rejoycing in that the more, the longer the winter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
hath been: when God lets them have long deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then they doe the more rejoyce and ſing when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
are attained: Men do then prize the ſhore, when
they have been toſſed by a tempeſt on the ſea. Thoſe that
have been toſſed on the waves of ſpirituall trouble, that
have had a ſtorm and tempeſt in their conſcience, they
will prize pardoning grace moſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth ſometimes pardon a mans ſin, yet
not tell him of it; and it is for rebuke to him, becauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96119:58"/>
he hath not lived in the exerciſe of grace: thou keepeſt
back <hi>obedience</hi> from God, and God keeps back <hi>comfort</hi>
from thee: this is a main reaſon why ſometimes God
pardons a ſinner, and yet doth not tell him of it in his
own conſcience. It is done in heaven, the pardon is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
there; but it is not done in the conſcience, it is not
written here: It is to give thee a rebuke, a check in thine
own heart; ſurely I have not exerciſed grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſurely God will not give me the comforting
work of his Spirit: when thou art not much in grace,
then thou ſhalt be but little in peace, it is juſt with God
ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Lord pardons a ſin when he doth not
tell that it is pardoned; it is to make the repentance of
men more viſible and ſatisfactory to the world that hath
been offended by their ſin. The Lord will make the
world ſee that if men will ſinne notoriouſly they ſhall
ſmart bitterly; to make the world ſee that repentance is
no ſlight worke, and to make peace with God, is not
eaſie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to make men to taſte the evils and bitterneſſe
of ſin; ſhould a man that is notoriouſly wicked, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
attain the ſenſe of pardon, it may be he would not
taſt the bitterneſſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>6. Another reaſon is this, to teach doubting Chriſtians
that aſſurance is not eſſentiall to pardon, it is ſeparable
from pardon, it is ſeparable from faith, therefore from
pardon. A man may beleeve, yet know not that he doth
beleeve: The Lord doth it for that end, to teach doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſtians that though they have not aſſurance, yet
they may have faith; though they want the ſenſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
they may be pardoned: there cannot be fruit, but
there muſt be a tree; yet there may be a tree, when
there is no fruit; there may be grace in the heart, when
there is no peace in the conſcience; to have peace is
additionall to grace: now the Lord for theſe holy ends
doth ſometimes pardon a ſin in heaven, when the pardon
is not ſealed to the conſcience. Thus much for the firſt caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:96119:59"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Caſe of conſcience is this, if God pardons
a ſin, whether or no doth he afflict and puniſh men for
it after it is forgiven? this is an uſefull queſtion: and the
reaſon is, becauſe there are errors and miſtakes about
it; miſtakes on the right hand and on the left. The
<hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay that a pardoned ſinner is never afflicted
for ſin; and ſay they, to ſay that a man whoſe ſin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
is afflicted for ſin, doth derogate from the ſatisfaction
and ſufferings of Chriſt. Then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that
men are afflicted and puniſhed for ſin, and that theſe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments
are for ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, and they are
meritorious: and on this ground they bottome Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that after a man is dead, he muſt for ſome years lye
in Purgatory, to ſatisfie for ſome notorious groſſe ſin done
in his life.</p>
            <p>Now Beloved to keep you from ſwerving either way,
I ſhall lay down the true genuine ſtate of this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and reſolve it to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider this, <hi>That God doth not afflict any
man but where ſin is,</hi> that is my firſt poſition. God doth
not cruciate an innocent creature: indeed the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have a queſtion, whether God by his ſoveraignty
may torment an innocent creature; but that is but a nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but this is moſt certain, that God in the diſpenſation
of his Judgements doth puniſh no man, but where ſin is,
<hi>ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, though God afflicts none ſinleſſe, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it may be <hi>for triall</hi> and not for any particular ſin; ſo
was <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, it was not for ſin, but for triall, to try
<hi>Iobs</hi> grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and chiefly, it is apparant from the Scriptures,
<hi>that pardoned ſinners may be puniſhed for their ſins.</hi> Would
not this be partiall for a father to beat the ſervant for
a fault, yet not beat the child for a worſe fault? Now
the Lord will not leave ſuch a plea as this in any wicked
mans heart. In all the Kingdomes of the world, where
ſword, where peſtilence, where famin, and where
plagues have been, the good have fallen with the bad;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96119:59"/>
the righteous have fallen by the ſword, as well as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
the reaſon is, that the world ſhould not ſay that he is
a partiall God. Now to ſatisfie and to eſtabliſh your
thoughts in this point, I ſhall give you two expreſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in the Scripture, that God doth puniſh his people
for ſin, though their ſins be pardoned. The one is of
<hi>David, 2 Sam. 12. 14. Howbeit, becauſe by this deed
thou hast given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaſpheme, the childe alſo that is born unto thee, ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dye.</hi> I will puniſh thee in thy child, I will pardon thy
ſin, yet I will puniſh thy ſin; ſo likewiſe in <hi>2 Sam. 7.
14. 15. I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſon: If hee
commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men,
and with the stripes of the children of men, but my mercy ſhal
not depart away from him, &amp;c.</hi> A promiſe to <hi>Solomon, I will
be his father, and he ſhall be my ſon:</hi> but <hi>if he commit
iniquity, I will chaſten him with rods.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt,
when he quotes this expreſſion, referres it to all the
godly, <hi>Pſal. 89. 31, 32. If they break my Statutes, and
keep not my commandements; then will I viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes.</hi> It
was not onely true of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but it is ſpoken of all the
Church, <hi>If they commit iniquity, I will chaſtiſe them with
rods.</hi> See, here a <hi>Solomon</hi> may be chaſtned with rods
if he commits iniquity: nay, not only one man, but all the
Church, 3. 2. <hi>You onely have I known of all the families
of the earth, therfore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi>
If God be ſevere, it is with his own people to make
them ſmart for ſin: he may ſpare wicked men, and not
puniſh them here, becauſe he hath his hell for them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
but this ſhall be all the hell of a godly man, and all
their puniſhment. I, but this is Old Teſtament, and
thus the <hi>Antinomians</hi> take off, and evade this Scripture:
but doth God ſo in the New Teſtament? Yes, in the New
Teſtament, <hi>Rom. 8. 20, And if Chriſt be in you, the body
is dead becauſe of ſin.</hi> He ſpeaks of the beleeving <hi>Romans</hi>
that death on their bodies was becauſe of ſin. And then
the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the godly <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96119:60"/>
29, 30. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth
and drinketh damnation or judgement to himſelfe, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Lords body. For this cauſe many are weak and
ſickly amongſt you, and many ſleep.</hi> Many godly men
were ſick and weak for their prophaning the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
and this is under the New Teſtament, that the
Apoſtle ſaith, as approving the righteous judgement of
God, let not us commit fornication, as ſome of them
commited, <hi>1 Cor. 10. Let not us fall as they fell,</hi> and many
of them it is probable among the 23 thouſand were good
men: The Apoſtle approves of Gods Judgement to bee
righteous in that Act.</p>
            <p>Only one objection againſt this.</p>
            <p>Doth not the Scripture ſay, in <hi>Iſa. 53. That the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our peace was laid on Chriſt?</hi> now if all thoſe chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments
that were due to us for ſin, were laid on Chriſt,
doth not this derogate from Chriſts ſufferings that hee
muſt ſuffer too? doth not this intimate that Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
were not ſatisfactory?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is eaſie.</p>
            <p>That when we ſay, we ſuffer for ſin, and are puniſhed
for ſin, underſtand it thus, there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between our ſuffering for ſin and Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for ſin; we doe not ſuffer for ſin as Chriſt did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our puniſhments for ſin are not by way of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to Divine Juſtice, but onely by way of caſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Divine Juſtice: when God doth puniſh a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
man with ſome outward Judgement for ſin, it is
no ſatisfaction, no compenſation: when the text ſaith,
<hi>that our chaſtiſements are laid upon Chriſt:</hi> the meaning
is, Chriſt ſuffers for ſin by way of ſatisfaction, he appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Gods wrath, he ſatisfies Gods Juſtice for the ſins that
we have done: ſhould we loſe our bloud for a ſin, ſhould
we give the fruit of our body for the ſins of our ſoule, yet
this cannot make a compenſation for ſin: therefore it may
well conſiſt that God puniſhed Chriſt for our ſins by way
of ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, and may puniſh us by way of
caſtigation, as a father his children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:96119:60"/>
Now to ratifie and ſatisfie your thoughts the more in
this: that though God doth pardon a ſin, yet hee will
puniſh for a ſin: take ſome reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe wicked men that are puniſhed for
ſin, would accuſe God of partiality and injuſtice, ſhould
he puniſh them and not his own people for the ſame ſin:
wicked men would account God partiall: but the wicked
ſhall ſay, I ſee Gods own people are puniſhed in this life,
more ſeverely then I am: the Lord doth it to vindicate
the impartiality of his Juſtice, that he will not ſpare ſin
where ever finds it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe God doth command
Magiſtrates to execute puniſhments in this life for ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon good men; therefore if he commands a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to puniſh a good man for his ſin, ſurely he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of their puniſhment. Suppoſe a good man ſhould
commit adultery, he was to dye for it: ſuppoſe he ſhould
commit murder, he was to dye for it; if God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nall puniſhment ſhould be inflicted on good

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>3</label> The third Caſe of Conſcience is this, Whether doth
pardon of ſin, go before faith and repentance, or elſe
follow after? I doe not ſpeak now of the priority of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but of the priority of time. This is a uſefull
queſtion.</p>
            <p>There are many Books in Print, made by ſeverall
<hi>Antinomians</hi> that plead for this, and they ſay that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is not a condition to qualifie the ſubject to obtain
forgiveneſſe, but onely a ſigne to manifeſt that ſin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and that a man is pardoned from all eternity, that
before a man beleeves and repents, he is pardoned: which
is a falſhood, for to a beleever the Apoſtle doth confine
pardon. <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God hath ſet forth to bee a
propitiation, through faith in his bloud, to declare his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the
forbearance of God.</hi> For ſins that are paſt, thoſe ſins you
have committed and have repented of, he gives you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96119:61"/>
for all them. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin,
ſhall fiade mercy,</hi> and he that doth not ſo, ſhall not find
mercy. He that hideth his ſin ſhall not proſper.</p>
            <p>I anſwer to this query, that God doth pardon ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a man repents and beleeves, not before: and to give
you a proofe for this: Firſt, I ſhall give you the grounds
from the Scripture: then abſurdities that would follow
if this were not ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Firſt from the Scripture, Obſerve, that the Scripture
doth limit and confine pardon to a repenting ſtate. Act. 3.
19.</hi> Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſin
may be blotted out. <hi>No blotting out of ſin without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
Repent that your ſin may be blotted out. Act. 26. 18.
To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to
light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they
may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inheritance among
them that are ſanctified by faith that is in me. <hi>So that
till thou beeſt turned from darkneſſe to light, untill thou
beeſt turned from Satan to God, thou haſt not received
forgiveneſſe of ſins: mark the antecedent word,</hi> hee
opens their eyes, &amp;c. <hi>therefore God expreſly doth tye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of ſin to repentance: and ſo in</hi> Joh. 1. 9. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and
to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe. <hi>There is firſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
this is a part of repentance, and then forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is no promiſe in all Scripture, that
God will pardon a ſin before repentance for ſin: but
there are many promiſes that God will pardon when they
doe repent, <hi>Jer. 23. 8. And I will cleanſe them from all
their iniquity whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and I
will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned, and
whereby they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Many promiſes,
that when men repent of ſin they ſhall have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in pardoned:
but there is never a promiſe that hath any ſhew, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man repents he ſhall have pardon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Scripture doth lay all men under a ſtate
of wrath and condemnation, till they beleeve and repent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96119:61"/>
unleſſe ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh, <hi>Luk. 13. 5.
I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe
periſh. Epheſ. 2. 3. Among whom alſo we had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in times paſt in the luſts of our fleſh, fullfilling the
deſires of the fleſh, and of the minde, and were by nature
the children of wrath, even as others,</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>that at
that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the
Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the
world.</hi> No hope of heaven, no hope of pardon in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
ſtate. Now by the ſufferings of Chriſt, wee
receive pardon; a man unrepenting, is a man without
Chriſt, therefore ſurely without pardon. Therefore
the <hi>Antinomians</hi> doctrine doth bolſter men in profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
ſaying (in a manner) to a drunkard, go on in
drunkenneſſe, for God hath pardoned thee from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
but I ſay, <hi>Repent therefore, that your ſins may bee
blotted out.</hi> There are not onely theſe expreſſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in Scripture, and reaſons grounded thereupon; but
manifold and groſſe abſurdities that would follow if you
ſhould deny this truth. This would follow then, that
there is no difference between a converted man, and a
man unconverted: and is not this groſſe to ſay that there
is as much comfort to a man before he is converted, as to
one after he is converted?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if a man is pardoned before he beleeves
and repents, then this deſtroyes Juſtification by faith,
<hi>being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> Now
juſtification is a pardoning of ſin, is Gods gracious act, and
not imputing ſin unto you; when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>I
am juſtified by faith,</hi> and the <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſaith, I am
juſtified without faith, where lyes the error? Now then
to ſay that a man is pardoned before he beleeves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
is in expreſs terms to contradict the Scripture, when
the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he is juſtified by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> have this evaſion, ſay they, a man is
pardoned before he beleeves, he is actually pardoned; but
when he beleeves, then he hath manifeſtation of pardon.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96119:62"/>
On this evaſion, another groſſe error will follow; for by
this reaſon faith is no more inſtrumentall to juſtification,
then as it is declarative to a man that he is juſtified: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Scripture ſaith there is more uſe of faith, for faith
is an inſtrument actually to lay hold on Chriſt for pardon;
the grace of love to Chriſt, the grace of humility, the
grace of ſelfe-deniall, and the grace of mortification;
theſe do evidence and declare a pardoned ſtate as well as
faith: this is to deſtroy the main uſe of faith, and makes
faith of little or no uſe in Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Again, another abſurdity will follow, to ſay that a
man before he repents is pardoned, it is as much as to
ſay, before a man be in Chriſt, he is pardoned: this is
falſe, for without Chriſt there is no pardon. I might
run over many abſurdities that would follow in denying
this orthodox point.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> There is one ſtrong Objection, which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Doth not God love a man from all eternity? and doth
not the Scripture ſay, that we were choſen in Chriſt before
the foundations of the world were laid? Now God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
of us, or loving of us, is Gods pardoning of us;
if God doth love a man before he was born, then ſure
God doth pardon a man from eternity. To argue
from Gods love to actuall pardon, is as great an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
as to argue, that becauſe God did purpoſe from all

created from eternity. God decrees to pardon from all
eternity, God executes this decree when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
God doth manifeſt this, that he hath pardoned

<hi>Antinomians</hi> make onely the <hi>decree</hi> and the <hi>manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and leave out the <hi>execution</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve this, That when we ſay that God

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96119:62"/>
towards elect men from all eternity, that is, a love where
God hath a purpoſe in time to doe a ſoule good: but a
love of complacency and delight in God, is not in God
till he be converted: before converſion, God hath not
a love of delight, for there is nothing in thee that God
ſhould take delight in: At that time ye were children of
wrath: God doth not love an elect man with the love
of complacency, till hee be converted, untill he doth
repent and beleeve.</p>

            <p>Doth not God pardon a man before hee beleeves, and

nothing for thoſe that plead for juſtification before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
and beleeving, this is onely ſpoken of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and ſalvation of Infants without actuall beleeving.</p>
            <p>Thirdly conſider, that there is a great difference between
the ſtate of an Infant, and of men grown to years: the
ſcripture tels you,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that faith comes by hearing,</hi> that is in
men grown in years they muſt get their faith in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way by hearing the Word preached: but this rule
holds not for <hi>young Infants,</hi> becauſe they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of underſtanding, they wanting the uſe of reaſon,
and God expects no more from them then he gives abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
faith comes by hearing, faith the ſcripture: but ſaith
the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> what need I hear, what need I pray,
for a man may have pardon without all? But conſider,
that though children cannot exerciſe faith, yet children
may have habituall faith, as Divines ſay, children may
have grace ſeminally, though they cannot have the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of grace. <hi>Thou canſt not tell,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, how
the bones of a childe grow in the womb,</hi> therefore much
more how God by a ſtrange and a powerful manner can
implant and impreſſe grace in the heart of a ſucking babe;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96119:63"/>
yet there is grace in elect children: in an elect child there
is ſeminall grace, and habituall grace. As there is ſin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
in a childes nature, that before a childe can act
ſin, it hath ſin; ſo by the ſame reaſon, they are capable
of grace, you that will deny grace to children, will fall
into the <hi>Pelagian</hi> error, that a childe hath no ſin: but a
childe hath a depraved nature, a nature enclining to ſin;
therefore when it comes to years, though it ſhould never
ſee a ſin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited, yet would it ſin: a child cannot act grace
cannot act faith &amp; repentance, that is true, but a child may
have grace habituall;<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> therefore Chriſt <hi>took children in his
arms and bleſt them,</hi> ſurely they muſt be gracious children;
ſuch children are pardoned: we know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their faith, but they have an habituall faith. And thus
much for the anſwering of that third caſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth Caſe to be handled, is this, Whether it be
conſiſtent with the ſtate of pardon to commit often the
ſame groſſe ſin over and over again? It is needfull to touch
upon this caſe, becauſe it perplexeth troubled mindes. I
ſhall ſpeak to this point two wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by way of comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Secondly, by way of Caution,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by way of Comfort.</p>
            <p>The firſt anſwer is this, That it is clear by an induction
of particular inſtances in Scripture, that pardoned men
have fallen often into the ſame ſin, this is moſt clear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if you referre it to ſpirituall ſins, to evils that are
of daily incurſion, evils that are inward and ſpirituall,
ſpirituall pride, diſtempered paſſion, omiſſion in duties; a
pardoned man may many times fall in ſuch ſins as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Further, it is clear by induction of inſtances in Scripture
that a pardoned man may fall into groſſe ſins, oftentimes
into the ſame ſin: ſome inſtances, one is of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> it
was a groſſe ſin for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſwear an heatheniſh Oath,
by the life of <hi>Pharoah, Gen. 42. 15. Hereby ye ſhall bee
proved,</hi> by the life of Pharaoh <hi>ye ſhall not go forth hence
except your youngeſt brother come hither. Send one of you
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96119:63"/>
and let him fetch your brother, and ye ſhall be kept in priſon
that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth
in you: or elſe</hi> by the life of Pharaoh <hi>ſurely ye are ſpies.</hi>
Yet the Jewes were ſo well inſtructed, and had ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
againſt ſwearing, one ſhould thinke that they
ſhould not be guilty of ſo groſſe an evill; yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> being
in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> court among heathens, he ſwore twice by
the life of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> And thus you read of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> he
fell twice into the ſame ſin, he made a league with <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>
King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he loved them that were enemies to
God, 2. <hi>Chron. 20 35, 36, 37. And after this did</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat
<hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>joyn himſelfe with</hi> Ahaziah <hi>King
of Iſrael, who did very wickedly: And he joyned himſelf
with him to makſhips to go to Tarſhiſh: and they made
the ſhips in Ezion Geber. Then</hi> Eliezer <hi>the ſon of</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danah
<hi>of Mareſhah propheſied against</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>ſaying,
becauſe thou haſt joyned thyſelfe with</hi> Ahaziah, <hi>the Lord
hath broken thy works: and the ſhips were broken, that
they were not able to go to Tarſhiſh.</hi> Twice he ran into
the ſame ſin. If there were no more ſpoken of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in the New Teſtament, then in the Old, it were
queſtionable whether he was a good man or no: but
what read you of <hi>Sampſon?</hi> You read of him firſt of al, <hi>that
he maryed a heatheniſh woman,</hi> which was againſt Gods
command. Nay, he fell to the ſame ſin when the Philiſtims
killed her, then he maryed a whore, chap. 16, 1. <hi>then
went</hi> Samſon <hi>to Gaza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jud. 15. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and ſaw</hi> there an harlot, <hi>and went
in unto her.</hi> Nay again, you ſhall finde him fall three
times into the ſame ſin. He did three times tell a lye,
one after another; when <hi>Daliah</hi> came to inveagle him
on the inſtigation of the Philiſtims that ſhe ſhould learn
where <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength lay: firſt ſaith <hi>Sampſon, If they
bind me with ſeven green withs, that were never dryed;
then ſhall I be weak, and be as another man.</hi> But when
he was bound, he broke the withs as one would break
the thred in two when it toucheth the fire: then ſaith ſhe,
why haſt thou deceived me and told me a lye? then hee
told her againe, <hi>If thou wilt binde me with new ropes that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96119:64"/>
were never uſed, then I ſhall be weak like another man:</hi>
but he broke the ropes. Nay, he tels her a third lye, he
ſaid unto her, <hi>If thou weaveſt the ſeven locks of my head
with the web, then my ſtrength will goe from me,</hi> and this
ſhe did alſo, and his ſtrength remained. But the fourth time
hee told her truth, ſaith he, <hi>If I bee ſhaven, then my
ſtrength will go from me, and I ſhall become weak, and
be like another man:</hi> and ſhe cauſed the ſeven locks upon
his head to be ſhaved off, and his ſtrength went from him.
I ſpeake this to a perplexed conſcience;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 32.</note> that good men
may be ſo overborn, that they may frequently act over the
ſame ſin again and again.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Peter</hi> that did lye thrice as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, <hi>Peter</hi>
did deny Chriſt three times with an oath and a curſing.</p>
            <p>Therefore this ſhould be ſomething to ſtay the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deſponding heart, that not only ſins of an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
infirmity, ſecret ſpiritual ſins, but alſo ſins that are more
obnoxious to infamy and ſcandal, good men have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and yet have been pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Another anſwer, that Jeſus Chriſt Chriſt bids us to
<hi>forgive our brother that ſins againſt us in one day ſeventy
times ſeven;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 4.</note> if Jeſus Chriſt cals for this at our hands, who
have hardly a drop of bowels, ſurely God that hath <hi>a ſea
and a vaſt Ocean of mercies,</hi> can forgive a ſin, and will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
a ſin, though it be often reiterated.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the anſwer to that queſtion, as to the
comfort of troubled ſouls.</p>
            <p>Now by way of Caution, that this comfort the ſcripture
gives be not abuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt Caution is this, That though it be poſſible a
man may fall often into the ſame ſin; yet it is not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſo to doe; it is a note that Mr <hi>Hilderſham</hi> hath on <hi>Pſ.
51.</hi> touching <hi>Davids</hi> foul ſin. I doe not read of any
expreſſe example in all the Scriptures of a godly man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
oft into the ſame groſſe ſins after repentance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
humiliation for that ſin. Obſerve this further, that
though it be poſſible, yet it is but very rare, and though
there be inſtances that ſome men have done ſo, yet there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96119:64"/>
are not more plentifull inſtances that good men have not
done ſo, I will give you a few inſtances. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>
entred into a ſinfull league with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> as he had done
before with his father, but when the Prophet rebuked
him; read the ſtory, <hi>1 King. 22.</hi> He had ſinned a once
with his father, but he would not ſin a ſecond time with
his Son, ſo that, here you ſee a good man would not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time joyn with an <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> So likewiſe you have
the inſtance in <hi>Judah,</hi> that was in father in law to <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
Gen. 28. 26. And Judah acknowlegded them and
ſaid; ſhe hath been more righteous then I, becauſe
that I gave her not to Shelah may ſon: and he knew her again
no more.</hi> It was not again done, <hi>he knew her again no more,</hi>
ſo as Divines do uſually urge it; <hi>Noah</hi> was drunke, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but once, and that before he knew the ſtrength of
the grape. <hi>David</hi> was adulterous, but never but once:
This therefore ſhall be one caution.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take this caution, that you might not bee
emboldned to run often into the ſame ſin; if a man doth
often commit the ſame groſſe ſin, it argues a greater
ſtrength and prevalency that ſin hath over him then all
other ſins. Phyſitians ſay, that a diſeaſe that a man doth
often relaſpe into, argues the ſtrength of theſe peccant
humours that feed the diſeaſe; if thou often falleſt
into luſts, it argues the prevalency of a luſtfull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>In the third place, Relapſes into the ſame groſſe ſin, are
very dangerous and deadly ſymptomes of a man in a loſt
condition, I do not ſay, they are ſuch ſymptoms that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibly
conclude a man to be an unpardonable man; I may
ſay as Phyſitians ſay of a relapſe into the ſame diſeaſe;
the ſecond time is more dangerous then the firſt; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe the firſt ſickneſſe feeds on the ill humours,
but relapſe into the ſame ſickneſs feeds on the vitall
ſpirits: Beloved, the falling and relapſing into the ſame
ſin is a dangerous ſymptome, it is a clear ſymptome of
the prevalency of that ſin. It is worth your notice what
ſymptomes, the Lord doth give of the plague of leproſie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96119:65"/>
for the Prieſt to judge that diſeaſe by, <hi>Levit. 13.</hi> the
firſt ſymptome was when the hair was turned white in
the fore; Divines accommodate that to a continuance in
ſin to old age, that argues you are unclean Lepers. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſymptome was, when there <hi>was raw fleſh in the ſcab;</hi>
Divines accommodate that unto a man being adventurous
to ſin againſt a raw, a troubled and a wounded Conſcience.
A third ſign of the plague of leproſie was, when after the
ſore was healed, there ſhould a new ſcab ariſe in the place
thereof: thus when after thou haſt healeda ſin, by vows,
by faſting and prayer, by holy purpoſes in Chriſts ſtrength,
and after the healing the ſame ſore breaks out, and the
ſame luſt breaks in upon thee, this is a dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that you might not be adventurous on ſin, and
ſo acuſe this comfort: conſider, that falling often into the
ſame ſin, doth more harden the heart then any thing in
the world, habituating and indulging a mans ſelfe into
the ſame road of wickedneſſe; there is nothing in the
world doth more harden the heart, then when the ſame
ſin hath an uſual inroad into thy conſcience &amp; life, then all
tenderneſſe and remorſe of conſcience wil be taken away;
I ſpeak meerly on this ground, that ſeeing you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that men may often fall into the ſame groſſe evils,
yet let theſe four conſiderations keep you from abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this comfortable point. I, but you will ſay, if
I do fall often into the ſame ſin, what may be to ſtay my
heart up that I may be in a pardoned ſtate for all this? I
ſay this to you, though thou doſt fall often into the ſame
ſin; yet if thy conſcience bears thee witneſſe thou doſt
exerciſe the ſame grace often in oppoſition to the ſame
ſin, thou mayeſt have a great deal of comfort that thou art
in a ſtate of pardon.</p>

to pray for thoſe things that are perfectly done ſo as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

I am not to pray to God to create the world, it is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, I am not to pray for Election, it is ſo done
as never to be done more. I am not to pray for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Chriſt, Chriſt is come into the fleſh, but
though I am not to pray for theſe things that are ſo fully
and perfectly done; yet I am to pray for thoſe things
that are ſtill adoing, pardon of ſin is an act of God that
is ſtill in doing, therefore the Apoſtle referrs pardon, <hi>Rom,
3. 24, 25. Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the
redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth
to be a propitiation, through faith in his bloud, to declare
his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt,
through the forbearance of God.</hi> And as ſin is remitted
and repented of, it is pardoned; therefore that reaſon
is not valid to take off men from praying for pardon of ſin,
the Scripture doth expreſs it, <hi>I acknowledged my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
and thou forgaveſt. Math. 6. 12. and forgive us
our debts as we forgive our debters.</hi> That Plat-form ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which we are to model our prayers, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians
would evade the Text and pretend, that in
that Text and ſuch Scriptures we onely pray for a ſenſe
and manifeſtation of pardon in the conſcience, and not
for actuall exhibition of pardon in regard of God.</p>
            <p>To take off this, firſt, the next words in the Petition,
are to be taken for a reall forgiveneſſe, not a forgiveneſſe
in ſenſe and feeling; for conſider the whole Petition, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us;</hi> there can be no reaſon ſhewen why the firſt
part of the Petition ſhould be taken for ſenſe and feeling
of forgiveneſſe, and the other ſhould not be taken ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider this, that in the ſame ſenſe you
muſt underſtand a ſin to be forgiven, as in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
it is ſpoken not to be forgiven; a ſin is ſaid not to
be forgiven when there is an actuall guilt lies upon a man;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96119:66"/>
a guilt abiding upon the perſon of a wicked man that is
not taken away, <hi>Mat. 12. 32. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a
word againſt the ſon of man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but
whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not bee
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world
to come.</hi> They that underſtand forgiving only in ſenſe
and feeling, muſt underſtand this clauſe, not forgiving
onely in ſenſe and feeling, and ſo no reall guilt to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the man: ſo that,</p>
            <p>It is againſt the nature of forgiveneſſe to be only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>6</label> A ſixt caſe is this, Whether when a man in ſuing for
pardon, ought to make any difference between great ſins
and ſmall ſins. The Stoicks ſay all ſins are alike, and there
is no difference; It is true, in regard of the object, all
ſins are againſt God; yet when you come to beg pardon
for ſin, according as your ſins are greatned, you are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to behave your ſelves in ſeeking for pardon: God
can pardon great ſins as well as ſmall, in regard of God
there is no difference, nor in regard of the merits of Chriſt;
but yet in your behaviour in ſeeking for pardon of ſinne
you are to make a great difference between the greatneſſe
and the ſmallneſſe of your evils: For conſider, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes a difference between ſins; therefore we muſt
doe ſo; The Scripture compares ſome ſin to <hi>Camels,</hi> and
ſome to <hi>Gnats;</hi> The Scripture compares ſome ſin to <hi>beams,</hi>
and ſome to <hi>motes,</hi> ſome ſins as <hi>talents,</hi> and others but as
<hi>pence,</hi> and in <hi>Amos</hi> there is mention made of mighty ſins
<hi>Amos 5.</hi> in <hi>John</hi> of greater ſins, <hi>Joh. 19. 11.</hi> Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were given thee from above; therefore he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
me unto thee, hath the</hi> greater ſin. It is true, every
ſin deſerves hell, yet there is more of the puniſhment of
hell inflicted on ſome ſinners then others, the reaſon why
I ſpeak of this caſe, is to let you know, that as God hath
ſuffered any of you to fall into aggravated and hainous
evils, ſo he requires more of you then of other men.
Conſider, That God requires of you more humiliation
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96119:66"/>
then he requires of other men: In the Law you read
that if a man <hi>toucht</hi> the unclean thing, he was unclean
till evening, but if a <hi>man bare an unclean thing</hi> he was to
<hi>waſh</hi> his cloths, to ſhew that the touch of ſin requires hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation;
but the <hi>bearing of a ſin</hi> in thy boſome, thy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in ſin</hi> requires more work then meerly the touch
of ſin; <hi>Peter</hi> wept bitterly for his deniall, he did more for
that ſin then for an ordinary ſin. So that you are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that though in regard of Chriſt there is no difference
between a great ſinne and a ſmall; as the red Sea could
drown <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt as well as a ſingle man; ſo
Chriſts blood can drown a huge hoſt of ſins; but yet you
muſt encreaſe your humiliation on the aggravation of
your guilt; thus much for the ſixth caſe of Conſcience.</p>

               <hi>1 King. 11. Solomon</hi> was the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, To ſinne againſt the rebukes and checks of

to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him
it is ſin.</hi> It is ſin to another man that doth not know it;
but to him that knoweth it, it is a greater ſin; this Chriſt

is Gods Officer in man; it is a greater fault to ſtrike a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable

ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, To ſin againſt Gods judgements upon other
men, is an aggravated evill; for thee to ſin when God
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96119:67"/>
hath given thee warning of ſin from other mens blood;
this did aggravate <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> ſin, <hi>Dan. 5. 22. 23. And
thou his ſon, O Belſhazzar, haſt not humbled thine heart,
though thou kneweſt all this; But haſt lifted up thy ſelfe

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Fifthly, To ſinne againſt mercies is an aggravation of
ſin,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. I delivered thee out of Sauls hand, I gave
thee thy Maſters houſe, I gave thee the houſe of Iſrael, and
if all this had been too little for thee, I would have moreover
given thee ſuch and ſuch things; Wherefore haſt thou deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <hi>Sixthly, It greatens ſin, when the ſinne is immediately
againſt God,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 25. If one man ſin againſt another,
the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord,
who ſhall intreat for him? <hi>If a man ſinnes againſt God, O

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, To ſin againſt the motions of Gods ſpirit,
aggravates ſin, when the ſpirit of God ſhall in thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
perſwade thee that thou wouldſt not follow ſuch
wicked waies as thou art walking in; when the Spirit of
God ſhall come and wooe thee to be reconciled, to alter
thy courſe, and to walk in better paths; when not only
the voice of conſcience, but the motions of Gods Spirit
ſhall be ſtifled, this aggravates ſin: Hence it is that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in ſetting out the wronging and withſtanding the
ſpirits motion, whether to good, or from evill, doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
by gradations: ſometimes it is called quenching the
ſpirit;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Quench not the Spirit;</hi> a higher degree, there is a

               <hi>grieving the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> when there are frequent acts to
withſtand divine motions, that is a grieving the Spirit.
And then there is an higher aggravation then this, that is,
<hi>reſiſting the Spirit, Act. 7. 51. Ye ſtiffe necked, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
in heart and eares, yee doe alwaies reſiſt the Holy
Ghoſt, as your Fathers did, ſo do ye:</hi> This is cauſed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſneſſe
in withſtanding the ſpirits motion. And
then the ſcripture ſpeaks of vexing the ſpirit, <hi>Iſa. 63. 10.
But they rebelled and vexed his holy ſpirit, therefore he was
turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them:</hi> This is
not only by one ſingle act; but when continually through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy courſe, thou haſt a wilfull and a gainſaying heart
againſt all the motions of Gods ſpirit within thee: Muſt
not this be a great evill in thee, when thou doſt quench,
grieve, reſiſt, and vex the ſpirit? all theſe circumſtances

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> Sin is aggravated when thou doſt frequently
fall into the ſame ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, Sin is aggravated when it is done in a way
of complacencie, that it is not onely acted by thee, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by thee, the acting of a ſin, is not ſo much as a loving
of ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, Sin is aggravated when it is done by eminent

ſin, and this did aggravate <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſin, <hi>2 Kin. 17. 21.
For he rent Iſrael from the houſe of David, and they made
Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat King, and Jeroboam drave Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
from following the Lord, and made them ſin a great ſin.</hi>
Thou that <hi>haſt ſinned a ſin,</hi> and art a publick perſon, thy
ſins are other mens ſins, thine is a greater ſin then another
mans ſin is; for every act that thou haſt done, will be an
imboldning and encouragement of others to do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> It aggravates ſin, when God doth puniſh other men for
thy ſin, this makes the ſins of Rulers to be great ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
for their ſins God may puniſh the people, as for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſin in numbring the people, there did thouſands of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

Abimelech called Abraham, and ſaid unto him, What haſt

haſt done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
               <hi>Sin is an aggravated ſin when it is done by a man that
lives under much means of grace;</hi> where the Goſpell is
preached, where ſin is reproved, there to live in a way of
wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 31.</note> greatens thy ſin: that made a woe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

they had the Goſpell, it ſhould be worſe with them

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Sin is aggravated, when they are againſt many vows,
purpoſes, and prayers, and many holy reſolutions, thou
addeſt perjurie to thine iniquitie, and that aggravates thy

            <p>Oh then admire the riches of Gods pardoning grace,
that he forgives ſins cloathed with many aggravated cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
O then what remains? there are two things
to be done by you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If at any time you <hi>find that you are under theſe
aggravations, that you can call your ſins the iniquity of ſin;
O then you ſhould admire and magnifie the multitude of
Gods mercy,</hi> that great ſins cannot out-vie Gods mercy, but
Gods mercy out-vies thy great ſins, Magnifie pardoning
grace the more; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 13. I was before a

            </p>
            <p>The firſt clauſe, <hi>If I go,</hi> its a good note that <hi>Calvin</hi>

peradventure he may go to Heaven, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not, but it ſerves for limitation of time when Chriſt
doth go to Heaven. A like phraſe you have, <hi>John 12 32.
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
unto me.</hi> This he ſpake of what death he ſhould die, if he
be lifted on the Croſſe, he ſhould ſave many by his death.
The word <hi>if,</hi> doth not note a dubitation or a ſuppoſition,
it may be, or it may not be, but it notes an Adverb of time,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96119:70"/>
when I am lifted up, and ſo in my Text, <hi>And if I goe and
prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receive you

<hi>If I go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that Chriſts Aſcenſion or going up to Heaven, is
a ground of great comfort and great advantage to all his
people while they dwell here upon the earth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervation, is, from the end and benefit
of his going up to Heaven, <hi>If I go, I go to prepare a place
for you;</hi> That the great end of Jeſus Chriſts going bodily to
Heaven, is to prepare Heaven for all the Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> The firſt Doctrine, That Chriſts Aſcenſion or going up to
Heaven, is a ground of comfort and great advantage to all
Gods people whilſt they dwell here upon the earth.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this point there are three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall prove it to you by Scripture, that Chriſt is
bodily gone into Heaven, I prove it by theſe five argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, by the Types that were before the Law,</hi> Enoch
<hi>was tranſlated and taken up bodily into Heaven, where
now he is.</hi> Gen. 5. 24. And Enoch walked with God,
and he was not, for God took him, <hi>this is confirmed by the
Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. By faith <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, that he
ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had
tranſlated him, for before his tranſlation he had this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
That he pleaſed God. <hi>And under the Law,</hi> Elijah
<hi>was taken up in a fiery Chariot,</hi> 2 King. 2. 11. And it
came to paſſe, as they ſtill went on and talked, that behold,
there appeared a Chariot of fire, and horſes of fire, and
parted them both aſunder, and <hi>Elijah</hi> went up by a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
into Heaven. <hi>So Chriſt makes a third under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
taken up to Heaven alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second Argument to prove this Doctrine, is by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
in the old Teſtament, that Jeſus Chriſt was to
be taken up into Heaven bodily, three propheſies, one in
the <hi>68 Pſalm,</hi> there <hi>David</hi> propheſi'd of Chriſt in the 18.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96119:70"/>
verſe, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, &amp;c.</hi> Now we ſhould
not have known ſo full that this had reference to Jeſus
Chriſts Aſcenſion, if <hi>Paul</hi> had not expounded this, in <hi>Heb.
4.</hi> and the 14. <hi>verſe, Seeing then that we have a great high
Priest that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Son of God,
let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> The Propheſies that were
long before Chriſt was born, did declare this, that Jeſus
Chriſt ſhould aſcend up into Heaven, and in the <hi>110. Pſa.</hi>
7. verſe, <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way, therefore
ſhall he lift up the head;</hi> what is that? It is ſpoken of
Chriſt, I will ſet him upon my right hand, firſt hee ſhall
drink of the brook by the way, he ſhall crie, I thirſt upon
the Croſſe, he ſhall die and be crucified, then afterwards
he ſhall lift up his head, he ſhall riſe againe and aſcend up
into Heaven, a full Prophecie in <hi>Daniel 7. 13, 14. I ſaw
in the night Viſions, and behold, One like the Son of man,
came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the ancient of
daies, and they brought him neer before him. And there was
given him dominion and glory and a Kingdome, that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him. His dominion
is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſſe away, and
his Kingdome, that which ſhall not be deſtroied.</hi> This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſpoken of Chriſts comming to judgement, but then
the Text ſaith, <hi>he ſhall deliver them to his Father, 1 Cor. 15.</hi>
But the comming of Chriſt in the clouds here, is Chriſts
going up into Heaven, as it is in the <hi>1. Acts</hi> verſe. 9. <hi>And
when he had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, he was
taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> And
thus you have it by Propheſies confirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the Doctrine of Chriſts going up to Heaven,
is confirmed to you by Chriſts promiſes; Chriſt upon the
earth did promiſe that he would go up to Heaven,</hi> John
6. 62. What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up
where he was before? <hi>In</hi> John 20. 17. Jeſus ſaith unto her,
Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father, but
go to my brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to your Father, and to my God, and your God. <hi>Chriſt
did promiſe that he would aſcend,</hi> John 16. 5, 7. But now
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96119:71"/>
I go my way to him that ſent me, and none of you asked me,
whither goest thou? <hi>Nevertheleſſe, I tell you the truth, it
is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away,
the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I
will ſend him unto you.</hi> John 16. 16. A little while, and
ye ſhall not ſee me, and again a little while, and ye ſhall ſee
me, becauſe I go to the Father. <hi>I could quote you many
Scriptures, that Chriſt promiſed he would go away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, the Doctrine of Chriſts going up to heaven,
is confirmed by the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles, who
were eie-witneſſes of Chriſts Aſcenſion.</hi> Gerrard <hi>notes,
ſaying, Jeſus Chriſt did riſe inviſible, none ſaw him Riſe,
the Scripture telleth you that the Souldiers that watched
were aſleep, yet Chriſt gathereth all his eleven Apoſtles
that they might be eie-witneſſes of his aſcenſion, that
they ſaw him aſcend to Heaven,</hi> Acts 1. 9, 10. And when he
had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld he was taken up,
and a Cloud received him out of their ſight. <hi>And while
they looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaven, as he went up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
two men ſtood by them in white apparell; and ſo the
Apoſtle</hi> Peter, <hi>in</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22. Who is gone into Heaven, and
is on the right hand of God, Angels and Authorities, and
Powers, being ſubject unto him. <hi>So</hi> Paul <hi>tels you in</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
4. 10. He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.
<hi>So in</hi> Hebrewes 9. <hi>the Author of that book tels you, that</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt is not gone into the holy place, but is gone into
Heaven it ſelfe, <hi>In verſe 24.</hi> For Chriſt is not entred into
the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of
the true; but into Heaven it ſelfe, now to appeare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God for us. 1 Tim. 3. 16. And without controverſy
great is the myſtery of Godlineſſe, God was manifeſt in the
fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto
the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
<hi>And in</hi> Mark 16. 19. So then after the Lord had ſpoken
unto them, he was received up into Heaven, and ſate on the
right hand of God. <hi>I take the more pains to prove this,
becauſe of what ancient Hereſies there have been to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96119:71"/>
this great comfortable doctrin of Chriſts going bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
into heaven, having our fleſh in heaven this very day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, it may be proved by the concurrent Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Angels, who were witneſſes of this truth, <hi>Acts
1. 10. And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, as he
went up, behold, two men ſtood by them in white apparell.</hi>
Theſe two men were Angels, the Angels did give in their
concurrent Teſtimonies, that Jeſus Chriſt did goe into
Heaven, and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt that did go ſhall come
againe. Beloved, I know not any one point in all the
Bible, that is ſo proved and ſtrengthened, as Chriſts perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and bodily going up to Heaven: and thus much for the
ſtrengthning of you in the proof of the point. I lay that
for the foundation, becauſe if the proof of it be not well
grounded, then the fruit of it will not be well regarded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is the reaſon that Chriſt muſt have his
body and ſoul go up to heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt in his bodilie preſence muſt goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
leſt his Diſciples ſhould be taken too much with his
bodily preſence, and never look after the Communication
of his Spirit. Therefore they ask Chriſt, Lord, when wilt
thou reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> They expected that
Chriſt would take away the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour which was
a heathen, and expected that he would be King himſelfe,
<hi>Acts 1. 6. When they therefore were come together, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of him ſaying, Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> It is for this reaſon ſay In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
becauſe the Diſciples ſhould not dote on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, as to look on him as a temporall King, and look
on him for a temporall Kingdome, but that they might
look after the Kingdome where he is, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> hath
a paſſage in <hi>2 Cor. 5. 16. Wherefore henceforth know we no
man after the fleſh, yea, though we have known Chriſt after
the fleſh, yet now henceforth, know we him no more.</hi> As if
he ſhould ſay, it may bee thoſe that lived in Chriſts time,
that knew him according to the fleſh as a lovelie perſon;
but ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> we know him in a ſpirituall way, to look
after heaven by Chriſt to look after ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:96119:72"/>
Secondly, Chriſt muſt be taken up into Heaven in his
body to make a compenſation and a recompence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
for his ſufferings in his body, <hi>Phil. 2. 8, 9. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelfe, and
became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe.
Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him
a Name which is above every Name.</hi> Therefore God did
exalt Chriſt and raiſe him from the dead, and bring him
to Heaven, becauſe he obeied to the death of the Croſſe,
and took on him the form of a ſervant, <hi>Pſal. 110.</hi> laſt verſe,
<hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way, thersfore ſhall he lift
up the Head.</hi> Becauſe thou diedſt and ſufferedſt, therefore
thou ſhalt lift up thy head, therefore thou ſhalt aſcend up
to Heaven, <hi>Heb. 2. 9. But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
lower then the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God ſhould
taſt death for every man.</hi> For ſuffering of death hee was
crowned with Glory and Honour, and tranſlated bodily
into Heaven, that is a ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt was taken up bodily to heaven, it was
manifeſt to the world, that Chriſt was God as well as
man, to manifeſt the God-head of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore
taken up bodily to heaven, <hi>Eph. 4. 9, 10. Now that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
what is it, but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the
lower parts of the earth? He that deſcended, is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill
all things.</hi> There the Apoſtle proves that Chriſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Heaven, it was an Argument that Chriſt came
down from heaven; So in <hi>John 6. 62. What and if ye ſhall
ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> That
ſhews that Chriſt was in Heaven before, therefore muſt
he be God Coequall and Coeternall with God the Father,
and thus you have the ſecond point diſpatched to you,
ſhewing the reaſons why Jeſus Chriſt muſt go bodily into
Heaven.</p>
            <p>The third point is, I, but what benefit and comfort is
that to us, that Jeſus Chriſt is now bodily in Heaven?
what comfort was this to the Diſciples, that Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96119:72"/>
ſhould leave them, that he muſt go from them, unto his
Fathers houſe? There are ſeven particulars that it
is great ground of comfort to all the people of God that
Jeſus Chriſt is gone bodily to heaven.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground of comfort is this, Chriſts going to
heaven bodily, it aſſures you of Chriſts full Triumph
and compleat conqueſt over all your ſpirituall Enemies;
This the Apoſtle lays down as a ground of comfort upon
Chriſt Aſcenſion, <hi>Eph. 4. 8. Wherefore he ſaith, when he
aſcended up on high he led captivity captive, and gave gifts
unto men.</hi> That is, the Devill and ſin that carried you
captive; Chriſt by his going up to heaven hath led them
captive, that is, hath led your ſpirituall enemies that carried
you captive: Chriſt alluded to the cuſtome among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
when the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerour rode to the Capitol of
<hi>Rome</hi> to rejoyce in his victory over his enemies, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
did uſe to tie his Captives to the Chariots wheels;
So Chriſt did carry his captives by his wheeles as it were,
he led captivity captive; <hi>Coloſ. 2. 15. And having ſpoyled
Principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
over them in it.</hi> So that beloved here is one
great comfort, that Chriſt by going up to heaven doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
and declare to all the world that he hath overcome
the Grave, Death, Devill, and Sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſts going bodily to heaven, It is a pledge
to you that Chriſt will one day bring your bodys to heaven
I go to heaven that I may receive you to my ſelf, that you
may be bodily in heaven where Chriſt is. In <hi>Joh. 14. 19. Yet
a little while, &amp; the world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, wel, I muſt
leave you, and I muſt goe to Heaven before you,
but becauſe I live in heaven, and live there bodily you
ſhal alſo live with me in heaven with your bodies, <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
doth make this uſe of it to comfort the Chriſtians in
his dayes, ſaith hee, Jeſus Chriſt did carry our fleſh into
heaven with him, and he is of our fleſh and of our bone;
Now ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath carried fleſh into
heaven, and this is a good pledge unto us that our fleſh
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96119:73"/>
ſhall be in heaven where Chriſt is alſo. Therefore O
fleſh and bloud doe thou rejoyce, that haſt poſſeſt heaven
in Chriſt already. And Chriſt would be imperfect in
heaven, ſhould not the bodies of beleevers come there
alſo, becauſe he lives in heaven, you ſhall live there alſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts going bodily to heaven, it is a ground
of comfort to you in this, becauſe Chriſt is gone bodily
into heaven, to performe and accompliſh his Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall
Office, that is as a high Preiſt, hee is now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to performe the Office of a high Prieſt to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
to God his Father in your behalfe, that your
ſinnes might be pardoned, that your ſoules might bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that your bodies might he raiſed, and received into
heaven with him in Glory, <hi>Heb. 9. 24. For Chriſt is not
entred into the Holy places made with hands which are the
Figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelfe now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Chriſt is entred into
the very heavens, that he might appeare before God for
us, ſo in <hi>Heb. 7. 26. For ſuch an high Prieſt became us
who is holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled ſeparate from ſinners,
and made higher then the heavens.</hi> It became us to have
a high Prieſt in Heaven. Therefore obſerve, though it
was a great benefit to the Diſciples to have Chriſts bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Jeſus Chriſt could never have fulfiled
the office of the Prieſt-hood to make interceſſion for all
the Elect, if Chriſt had not gone bodily into heaven. Will
you obſerve one <hi>Text in Heb. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. For if he were on earth
hee ſhould not be a prieſt, ſeeing there are Prieſts that offer
gifts according to the Law.</hi> Chriſt muſt goe to heaven
and there hee is a Prieſt; now if hee were upon the
earth hee could not be a Prieſt for us, therefore we have
great advantage by CHRISTS going into heaven. O
beloved, then looke on this as a great comfort, that our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt is now in heaven in his body, fleſh
and bloud, appearing before God, making Interceſſion
for all his people; this was typified out under the Law,
<hi>Exod. 28. 9, 10, 11, and 12. verſes. And thou ſhalt take
two Onix stones, &amp; grave them on the names of the children
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96119:73"/>
of Iſrael. Six of their Names on one ſtone, and the other
ſix Names of the reſt on the other ſtone, according to their
Birth. With the work of an ingraver in ſtone, like the
ingravings of a ſignet ſhalt thou ingrave the two ſtones, with
the names of the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou ſhalt make them
to be ſet in Ouches of Gold. And thou ſhalt put the two
ſtones upon the ſhoulders of the</hi> Ephod, <hi>for ſtones of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
unto the children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall beare
their names before the Lord, upon his two ſhoulders for a
memoriall.</hi> This is a type of Jeſus Chriſt our high Prieſt,
who is gone into that which is ſo in it ſelfe, the Holy
of Holieſt and there he hath not onely the names of al
the elect of God throughout the world on his breaſt, but
hath them in his heart, and there he makes interceſſion for
them to his father. This is a third ground of comfort that
they have of Chriſts going bodily into heaven.</p>
            <p>A Fourth ground of comfort you have by Chriſts going
into Heaven is this, That Jeſus Chriſt is gone into heaven
to convey to you a fuller communication of the gifts and
graces of his ſpirit, which was beſtowed on his people
whileſt he was upon the Earth, <hi>Epheſ. 4 ver. 8. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
captive, and gave giftes unto men.</hi> It is an alluſion to
the Roman cuſtome, that when the conquerour rode
in Triumph towards the Capitoll; he did not onely lead
the Priſoners, by the Charet wheeles, but likewiſe ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
mony to the Spectators that ſaw him ride along in
triumph: ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt having by his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſpoiled death and the Devil; thus Jeſus Chriſt doth
caſt his gifts unto men, diſpenſeth his graces in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
meaſure into the hearts of his people; not that we are
to run into the <hi>Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ian</hi> errour, becauſe of this text they
gather that before Chriſts Aſcenſion into heaven there
was no ſaving gift of the ſpirit, and they ground it on that
text, <hi>Ioh. 7. ver. 38, 39. He that believeth on me as the
Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
water. But this ſpake he of the ſpirit, which they that
beleeve on him ſhould receive, For the Holy Ghoſt was not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96119:74"/>
yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> The
Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus Chriſt
was not yet glorified, but this <hi>Text</hi> is not to be taken
ſimply, then it will follow that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
had not the ſpirit, and then they could not bee in
Heaven, but the meaning is, that the gifts of the Holy
Ghoſt in that abundant meaſure was not given, becauſe
Chriſt was not yet aſcended; Chriſt did reſerve the full
giving of the Holy Ghoſt to the time of his Aſcenſion,
and untill he was glorified; therefore the Apoſtles ſoon
after his aſcenſion received the Holy Ghoſt in a greater
meaſure then was given to the people of old: and beloved,
not onely gifts, to bring you to Heaven, but alſo Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
gifts, to qualifie men fit for the Miniſtery, you are
to looke on this alſo as the fruit of Aſcenſion, <hi>Epheſians
4. 10, 11, 12. verſ. He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo
that aſcended up far above all heavens, that he might fill
all things. And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,
and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers; For
the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery,
for the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> So that you are to
looke upon not onely your own Chriſtian gifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God brings you to Heaven, but all Miniſteriall gifts are
the fruits of Chriſts going to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Chriſt is gone to Heaven, It is to comfort us
in this, that Chriſt being bodily in Heaven it might make
thee holy and bold and fiducially confident when ever
thou comeſt to God in prayer, when thou doſt come to
God in prayer, come to him as one that hath Jeſus Chriſt at
his Right hand in Heaven preſenting thy prayers to God
for thee, obſerveth it comfortable advice given, <hi>Heb. 4. 14,
16. Seeing then that we have a great high Priest, that is
paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold
fast our profeſſion, Let us therefore come boldly unto the
Throne of Grace, that we may obtaine mercy and finde grace
to help in time of need.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt being in Heaven
it ſhould work a holy boldneſſe in us to keep out fear and
diſtruſt when thou prayeſt; becauſe we have an high
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96119:74"/>
Prieſt that is paſt into the higheſt Heavens, Jeſus the Son
of God. Who would not come boldly to the Court when
he knows that the Kings Eldeſt Son is his friend, and
is aſſured of his love, that he will intercede for him to his
Father? Jeſus Chriſt is the King of Heaven, the eldeſt
Son, and he is bound by office to repreſent all our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
and make Interceſſion for us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, that Chriſt is gone bodily into Heaven, it
may be of comfort, that yet he hath the ſame relation
towards a Beleever, which he had to them whileſt he
was upon the Earth. When hee was on the Earth
Chriſt did ſay, go tell my Brethren that <hi>I</hi> am to
aſcend, and after he was taken up into heaven, he cals
them his brethren. <hi>Heb. 2. 11. For both he that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and they who are ſanctified are all of one, for which
cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.</hi> Though
Chriſt was crowned with glory and gone up to Heaven,
yet he was not aſhamed to call beleevers brethren; Now
in Heaven Chriſt is thy God there, and Chriſt is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there, Chriſt is thy Prince there, and Chriſt is thy
friend there, and this may adminiſter much comfort to
thee that Jeſus Chriſt retaines the ſame relation now hee
is in Heaven, that he had with thee in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Iob</hi> could ſpeak in a viſion, <hi>I know that my redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
liveth,</hi> I know my Kinſman liveth, (for ſo the word
ſignifieth) I know my kinſman liveth. Chriſt did call
his Diſciples Brothers when he was in the fleſh, and ſo
he calleth them brothers now he is in heaven. Suppoſe
thou art a poor woman that doſt marry a man that is
mean and poor in the world, why ſuppoſe this man
ſhould come to the dignity of a King, it would be a great
comfort to thee that thou who waſt but a beggar art now
become a Kings wife; ſo though thou art mean, in the
world yet Jeſus Chriſt doth preferre thee to be his brother.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly and laſtly, it may ſerve for comfort in this
regard, that Chriſt is gone to Heaven for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to prepare Heaven for thee; I goe to prepare a
place for you <hi>Heb. 6, 20. Whither the foreruner is for us
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96119:75"/>
entred, even Jeſus made an high Prieſt for ever after the
order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Chriſt is our forerunner, gone to
Heaven for us, Chriſt did not onely dye for us, but Chriſt
did go to heaven for us, <hi>Heb. 10. 19, 20. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
brethren, boldneſſe to enter into the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt by the bloud
of Ieſus; By a new and living way which hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
for us, through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh;</hi>
That is, having hopes to come to enter into Heaven by
the bloud of Chriſt, through Chriſts fleſh as dying on the
Croſſe. And thus much be ſpoken for the Doctrinall
part of this point, the point was this, That Chriſts Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onor
going up bodily to Heaven is a ground of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to Gods people whileſt they live here upon the
Earth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now draw out ſome inſtructions from ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in Chriſts going to heaven. There are five cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
from which you may gather ſome inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the time when Chriſt did leave the world
and aſcend up to goe to Heaven, if you read the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
they will tell you it was abote the 33 year of his
Age, he left this world and goeth up to Heaven. Learn
thus much from thence, that if Chriſt would leave the
world in the flower of his Age, a young man, then this
ſhould be faſtened to the Meditation of you young men,
that you ſhould not have your hearts too much glued to
the world, to hanker after a long life. Suppoſe God
ſhould take thee away now in the flower of thy age,
bee willing and ſubmiſſive, for God tooke Chriſt away ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you may learne ſome what from the place
whence Chriſt did aſcend, it is very obſervable: It was
Mount Olivet, <hi>Acts 1. 12. Then returned they unto
Ieruſalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
a Sabbath days Iourney.</hi> Luke <hi>ſaith, it was from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany,</hi>
Luke 2. 50, 51 <hi>And he led them out as far as to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany
and he lifted up his hands and bleſſed them. And it
came to paſſe while hee bleſſed them, hee was parted
from them, and carried up into heaven.</hi> It was all one, but
there is much of Gods minde in this, of all places in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96119:75"/>
world Chriſt did make choyce of <hi>Bethany</hi> by Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>
to go up to heaven: Beloved, the reaſon was, becauſe
that was the place where Chriſt was taken when <hi>Judas</hi>
came with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> to apprehend him;
from that place he was taken to be crucified, and ſeeing
it was from that place, he would make choyce of that
place from whence hee would take his riſe to go up to
Heaven <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>of</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Bethany</hi> in Hebrew, ſignifies a
houſe of affliction; Chriſt made that which was the houſe
of his affliction that <hi>Bethany</hi> to be the place of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
of him into glory. I would give you thence to
note, that God doth oftentimes make our ſufferings to
be Inlets to our glory. So it was with Chriſt, from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi>
hee was taken a Priſoner, and from that place hee
would aſcend up into Heaven, ſo if you ſuffer with him,
you ſhall alſo bee glorified with him, you may be carried
to Heaven ſometime in ways of ſharpe afflictions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not daunted at perſecution, for the Lord makes
<hi>Bethanics,</hi> the houſes of our afflictions to have a trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore
in them to let us into our Father Manſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the circumſtance in Chriſts aſcenſion,
that juſt as Chriſt did aſcend, hee was ſpeaking to his
Diſciples things that did appertaine to the Kingdome of
God, and as he was bleſſing of them, he was taken up
before their eyes. <hi>Acts 1. 9. And when he had ſpoken
theſe things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a
Cloud received him out of their ſight;</hi> Whileſt he was
bleſſing of his Diſciples, and whileſt he was ſpeaking to
them things appertaining to the Kingdome of God, hee
was taken away. I would give you this note from thence,
that when you come towards the time of your departure
out of this world, make Chriſt your example; Chriſt as
hee was going away, he ſpake of things appertaining
to the Kingdome of God; ſo let your hearts be full fraught
with Divine contemplation, do you leave good counſell
behinde you when you come to dye, that ſo ſome body
may ſay, theſe are the laſt words of a dying Friend. I
might extend this example of Chriſt before his departure
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96119:76"/>
out of the world, unto Maſter of families, that when you;
come towards your end, leave good counſel behind you;
Let not your ſpeech be filled about worldly affairs, but let
them bee ſetled before, but leave good counſell with your
children. <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was to die, he called all his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
about him &amp; gave good counſel unto them &amp; bleſſed
them. Likewiſe <hi>David 1 Chron. 28. 9. And thou</hi> Solomon
<hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, &amp; ſerve him with a
perfect heart, and with a willing minde; for the Lord ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all Hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of
the thoughts, if thou ſeeke him, hee will be found of thee,
but if thou forſake him, hee will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> And
thus wee ſee in the inſtances of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and many other
Servants of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> when he was to dye, I,
but eſpecially take Chriſts example, that when you are to
leave the world, you may have your minds poſſeſſed
with nothing elſe but with things appertaining to the
Kingdome of God, as Chriſt was.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there is inſtruction to be gathered from the
manner of Chriſts leaving the world, the manner was
in <hi>Act. 1. 9. And when he had ſpoken theſe things, while
they beheld, hee was taken up, and a cloud received him out of
their ſight,</hi> they ſaw him by degrees aſcend into Heaven,
this muſt not paſſe our Meditation, that a cloud ſhould
take Jeſus Chriſt out of our ſight, it is for a reliefe to your
Meditations, that when you ſee the clouds, to thinke
that theſe clouds that I ſee hover in the Heaven, they are
Chriſts Chariot that did once carry him to Heaven, and
they are the chariots that ſhall carry Jeſus Chriſt to judg
the world; O labour to have your Meditations on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, he went up in a cloud, therfore the clouds are
called Gods Chariots.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, note that circumſtance in Chriſts aſcenſion,
that he would call all his Friends about him, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid all the eleven Apoſtles were with him, <hi>Acts 1.</hi>
And an Interpreter doth think that there was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty with Jeſus Chriſt, when he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up into Heaven, and he gathered it from <hi>Acts 1. 15.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96119:76"/>
And in thoſe days</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and ſaid, the number of names together were about
an hundred and twenty.</hi> Now learned men doe thinke that
there was an hundred and twenty that did ſee Jeſus
Chriſt aſcend up to heaven, it is clear that there were
the eleven Apoſtles there, and if this be ſo that Chriſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
about him, his friends, when hee was to leave the
world, I gather thence, that when you are drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your end and departing out of the world; Labour
to have your friends about you that you might give them
the advice of a dying friend, and it is a great bleſſing for
to dye amongſt your friends; Chriſt before that he would
goe up to Heaven and leave the world, hee would
have his friends about him, and then he was taken up
from them.</p>
            <p>I now come to draw out more practicall application
of this point. If it be ſo that Chriſts going up bodily
into Heaven bee a ground of ſuch great comfort unto the
people of God upon Earth, the uſe that I ſhall draw, it
ſhall be to deduce four doctrinall and four practicall infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
from this point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this point confuteth the opinion of the <hi>Selucians</hi>
and <hi>Hermiani</hi> that hold that Chriſts Body is not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but that it is in the beautifull and ſplendent body
of the Sun, and they ſay, that is the reaſon the Sun doth
caſt ſuch a glorious light, o're that the Moon doth; and
truly this old Hereſie is again revived amongſt us, and I
have ſeen it in a booke called <hi>Divine Light,</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is nothing but darkneſſe; but Chriſt is above the
Sun, Chriſt is above all the viſible Heavens: Chriſt ſits
in the third Heaven as <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; therefore if Chriſts
Body bee gone into Heaven, they are in an errour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this point will confute thoſe who hold that
Chriſts Body hath been on Earth, ſince his aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven; ſome in <hi>Germany</hi> held, that they were the
very Chriſt, and thus in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights days,
there was one held that hee was the Chriſt, and his ſide
was pierc'd and there was the print of Nayles ſeen in his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96119:77"/>
hand, &amp;c. I, but if men ſay, lo here is Chriſt, and there is
Chriſt, believe them not, for Chriſt was never on the
Earth ſince his aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that Chriſts Body is now in heaven, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes
the Doctrine of the Popiſh Religion touching
Tranſubſtantiation, or the reall preſence, that Jeſus Chriſt
is bodily preſent at the Sacrament, ſay the Papiſts, we bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eat Chriſts fleſh and drinke Chriſts bloud, that Chriſt
is as bodily preſent at the Sacrament as hee was on the
Croſſe; If there were no other argument to overthrow
this opinion but this, that the body of Chriſt is now in
Heaven, it were enough, then that opinion of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statiation</hi>
is hereby confuted, Chriſts body cannot be in
Heaven, and on the earth both at one time.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the aſcenſion of Chriſt, it overthrowes the
opinion of the <hi>Carpacratiami</hi> that hold, that onely his
ſoule did goe to heaven, and his body periſhed as others;
and this cannot be, for the Diſciples ſaid that they ſaw
Chriſt aſcend, and this muſt bee his body, for they could
not ſee his ſoule, for the ſoule is a ſpirit. Now you ſee
the reaſon why I ſpent ſo much time in the morning in
giving you many <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture to prove this point:
becauſe there are ſo many Hereticks that doe oppugne
this Doctrine of CHRISTS Aſcenſion. I now come
to give you three or four practical deductions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, is Chriſts body now in heaven? then I infer;
O thou that canſt lay a well-grounded clayme for an
intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt: O be not thou afraid to dye,
becauſe thy Chriſt is in heaven, and when thou dieſt,
death is but a Trap-doore to let thee into endleſſe joy
where Chriſt is, why ſhould wee bee as children to
looke on death as a Bugheare, but looke upon death as
being a paſſage unto thy fathers houſe, as being a Trap-doore
to let thee in where Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>Gen. 45. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
27. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the
Land of Canaan, unto</hi> Jacob <hi>their father, and they told
him all the words of</hi> Joſeph <hi>which hee had ſaid unto
them, and when hee ſaw the waggons which</hi> Joſeph
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96119:77"/>
               <hi>had ſent to carry him, the ſpirit of</hi> Jacob <hi>their father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.</hi>
Did <hi>Jacob</hi> rejoyce to ſee a waggon or a chariot
that would carry him into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſee his Son <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
and wilt not thou rejoyce to think that death is a chariot
to carry thee to Jeſus Chriſt, to carry thee to heaven?
O therefore let not thy heart bee troubled to dye, becauſe
death is but a chariot to carry thee to heaven? Is Chriſt
gone into heaven?</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, labour thou whileſt thou liveſt on the
earth to aſcend to Chriſt in divine and holy Ejaculations
and Meditations. Is Chriſt in heaven? then why ſhould
not thy heart be where thy head is, why ſhouldeſt thou
bee grovelling on the earth ſeeing thy Chriſt is now in
heaven? It is a ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Canticles 3. 6. Who is
this that cometh out of the wilderneſſe like Pillars of ſmoke
perfumed with Myrrhe and Frankincenſe, with all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Merchant?</hi> Thou ſhouldeſt aſcend up to Chriſt
though thou beeſt in trouble in the Wilderneſſe of this
world; O aſcend up to Chriſt in Holy Meditations; this
uſe the Apoſtle makes of it, <hi>Coloſ. 3. 1. If yee then bee
riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where
Chriſt ſitteth on the right Hand of God.</hi> The argument
is, where Chriſt ſits at the right Hand of God, ſet your
affections there: and ſo in <hi>Phil. 3. 20. For our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is in heaven, from whence alſo wee look for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

               </gap>ore
our converſation muſt bee where our head is. It is
a notable <hi>Text, Mat. 24. 28. For whereſoever the Carkaſe
is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> That Chriſt

heavenward; It is true, there are ſome that wreſt theſe
words, and give this ſenſe of them, that they make the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſe
to be the Jewes, and the Eagles to be the Romans,
becauſe the Romans did uſe the Eagle in their Banner and
Enſigne of War, therefore they ſay, where the Jewes
were the Romans ſhould come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though this was a truth,
yet not the ſcope of the <hi>Text,</hi> it is generally overthrown
by moſt Interpreters; but <hi>Gerrard</hi> doth chiefly referre
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96119:78"/>
theſe words to the day of judgement, where the carkaſe
is thither will the Eagles reſort, that is, where Jeſus
Chriſt is in heaven, as the Eagles doe follow after the
carkaſe to feed upon that, ſo the people of God ſhall be
gathered about Jeſus Chriſt, and this I doe confeſſe is
the chiefe ſcope of the place, and doe beleeve it is the
chiefe intendment of the holy Ghoſt: but <hi>Gerrard</hi> hee
makes another uſe of it too, and referres it to the power
and efficacy of the Goſpell in this life; Chriſt is now in
heaven, ſaith <hi>Gerrard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Goſpel ſhal be ſo powerful
on men in the world, that it ſhal make men as eager to
come after Chriſt into heaven as the Eagle is after the prey.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I inferre hence, that before you preſume to
apply the benefits and the comforts of Chriſts aſcenſion
into heaven: labour to feele in your own hearts the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Chriſts Death and aſcenſion, every man applies
the benefit of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, and Chriſts
aſcenſion before they find the efficacy of his Death, &amp; the
efficacy of his reſurrection. It is the Apoſtles word, ſaith he,
I labor to find the power of his reſurrction; ſo do you labor
to find the power of his Death and the power of his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
before you find the comfort of it; It is to make thee leſſe
Earthly-minded, more paſſionately eager, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly
earneſt after the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> doſt thou feele
the power of the aſcenſion to make thee more heavenly
minded, and leſſe earthly minded; O labour to feele the
efficacy and power of it, elſe I might ſay to you as <hi>Iacob</hi>
ſaid to his mother in <hi>Geneſis 28. 12. My father perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veuture
will feele mee, and I ſhall ſeeme to him as a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and I ſhall bring a curſe and not a bleſſing.</hi> Nay,
without peradventure God will feele and try whether you
are the men or no that have right to the bleſſing; that
ſhall have any reall advantage and benefit by Chriſts
Death, by Chriſts aſcenſion. God will try whether you
doe not ſeek to deceive your Souls and deceive God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
if ſo, you will rather have a curſe then a bleſſing,
if you ſeeke to apply the comfort of Chriſts aſcenſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you feele the efficacy of it on your own hearts.</p>

diſtinct place from the Earth and Hell, Chriſt had a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of place from the Earth to the third Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith hee, the earth ſhall hold me no more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, hee did aſcend into heaven powerfully;
Indeed other men went to heaven bodily, not by their
own ſtrength, but it was by a borrowed ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Elias</hi>
had a fiery chariot to carry him to heaven, but Chriſt had
none, for he went to heaven by his own ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, Chriſt went to heaven eminently and ſingly;
There are three bodies in heaven, there is the bodie of
<hi>Enoch,</hi> the body of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all
elſe in heaven are onely Saints and Angels; <hi>Enoch</hi>
went to heaven bodily as a type of <hi>Chriſts</hi> aſcenſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> unde the Law and <hi>Chriſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpell. Divines ſay, that this ſhewes there
was ſalvation by Chriſt before the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſalvation by
Chriſt under the Law, and ſalvation by Chriſt in the time
of the Goſpell, but there is difference between their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to heaven,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> went to heaven, but they did
not die and riſe from the dead, and then aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but firſt Chriſt dyed, and then Chriſt was raiſed
out of the Grave, and then within forty daies hee did
aſcend into heaven, there was one difference. Again,
they did not aſcend to heaven by their own ſtrength, but
by the power of God, they did aſcend into heaven, but
we have got no good by their aſcenſion, no benefit nor
merit accrues unto us by their being in heaven, but there
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96119:79"/>
is great benefit redounding to us by Chriſts being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I goe to Heaven to prepare a place for
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Enoch</hi> went to heaven, but he could not give
the ſpirit, ſo <hi>Elias</hi> went to heaven but hee could not give
the ſpirit; I, but our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hee is gone bodily
into heaven, hee hath aſcended up on high, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
gifts unto men.</p>
            <p>Again, they went to heaven, ſaith <hi>Polanus,</hi> onely as
Citizens of heaven; but Chriſt went to heaven as the
Lord of heaven, who is there in his body and in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and theſe are the ſhort and tranſient hints that I have
given you on the firſt part of my <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond thing in the <hi>Text,</hi> to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that believers have by Chriſts going bodily into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> The obſervation is this; the fruit and benefit that all the
Elect of God have by Chriſts going into heaven, is to
prepare a place for them there, <hi>I go to prepare a place for
you.</hi> Now in the handling of this Doctrine there are three
particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſhal ſhew you in what ſenſe Chriſts going bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into heaven prepares heaven for believers,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you how can this ſcripture ſay,</hi>
that by Chriſts Aſcenſion heaven was prepared for us, <hi>when
other Scriptures ſay,</hi> that heaven was prepared for us, from
the beginning of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whether did the Patriarks and righteous holy
men of God, that lived before Chriſts aſcenſion goe into
heaven, whither went they when they dyed; therefore
the Church of Rome gather from this <hi>Text,</hi> that before
Chriſt went to heaven, there was none went into heaven,
but all went into a place called <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in what ſenſe may it bee ſaid, that Chriſt by
his going into heaven prepares a place for believers there?
I anſwer in theſe three regards Chriſt by going into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
prepares a place there.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Repreſentation, Chriſt is not gone
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96119:79"/>
to heaven as other men, as a ſingle and a private perſon;
but Chriſt is gone into heaven as a common and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
perſon; Chriſt is gone up to heaven with fleſh and
blood, and with our natures hee is gone to heaven, and
hee is gone there as a Repreſenter of all the Elect; <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> is gone to heaven repreſenting the perſons
of the Elect of God upon the earth. Hence it is
that you have a paſſage, <hi>Eph. 2. 6. And hath raiſed us up
together in heavenly places into Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Wee are
not in heavenly places, wee are in earthly places, but we
doe ſit in heaven; becauſe Chriſt is now in heaven, hee
being gone to heaven as a common and a publique perſon,
a Repreſenter of all the elect, <hi>Heb. 6. 20. Whither the
forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus, made an high Prieſt
for ever after the order of Melcheſodec.</hi> Hee did not goe
there for himſelfe, but for us. Chriſt did dye as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
perſon repreſenting all the elect of God, and Chriſt
did goe to heaven as a publique perſon, and hath taken
poſſeſſion of heaven in our ſtead; Chriſt keepes our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
there, ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to prepare
a place for us in heaven, juſt as a company of Travellers,
when they are going a journey; they ſend one man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be their harbinger to take up lodging in the Inne,
and make proviſion for them againſt they come to the
Inne, our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is gone to heaven before to
prepare a place for the elect there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt prepares a place for the elect by way
of interceſſion, <hi>Heb. 9. 24. For Chriſt is not entred into
the holy places made with hands, which are the Figures of
the true, but into heaven it ſelfe, now to appeare in the
preſence of God for us.</hi> That as the Prieſt under the Law,
when hee went to the holy places hee had the names of
all the Tribes on his breaſt, ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our
great high Prieſt, having the Names of all the elect not
onely on his breaſt but in his heart, prayeth to his Father
that we might come there, and this Interceſſion is another
way that heaven is prepared for the elect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is ſaid to prepare heaven for us by way
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96119:80"/>
of Operation in us, hee prepares heaven for us by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
us for heaven, and this is the ſence that <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives
of theſe words. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> prepares a Manſion for us
in heaven, when hee prepares us the Inhababitants for
heaven, here is the great evidence for heaven: are your
hearts prepared? then you may bee aſſured that heaven
is prepared for you, <hi>Col. 1. 12, 13, 14. Giving thanks
unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers
of the inheritance of the Saints in Light; who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us from the power of darkneſſe and tranſlated us into
the Kingdome of his deare Son. In whom wee have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
through his blood, even the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi>
An unconverted man is not a meet man for heaven, now
when Chriſt makes you meet for heaven, hee then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
a place for thee, <hi>1 Peter 1. 3, 4, 5. Bleſſed be the
God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which according
to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope, by the Reſurrection of Ieſus from the Dead, to an
Inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth
not away, reſerved in heaven for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who are kept by the
power of God through Faith unto Salvation, ready to bee
revealed in the laſt time.</hi> So that beloved if you be kept
for heaven, and made meet for heaven, that is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
that heaven is prepared for you.</p>
            <p>I now come to the ſecond Quere, which is this: how
can this ſcripture ſay that by Chriſts aſcenſion Heaven is
prepared for us, when other Scriptures ſay <hi>that heaven
was prepared for us from the beginning of the world? Mat.
25. 34. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right
hand; Come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the Kingdome
prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</hi> Now
if a Kingdome was prepared for them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, how doth this Scripture appropriate
a preparing of the Kingdome of Heaven onely from the
aſcenſion of Chriſt? Divines do anſwer, that you muſt
diſtinguiſh between the decrees of God, and the clear
manifeſtation and full execution of thoſe decrees.
Now if you reſpect the decrees of God, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96119:80"/>
is true, that the Kingdome of heaven is prepared from
the beginning of the world, for the decree and purpoſe of
God was, before the world was, that the elect ſhould
have heaven as an Inheritance, but if you expect the
clear manifeſtation of it, then it was not till Jeſus Chriſt
Aſcended, and the diſtinction this Scripture allows of,
eſpecially in the point of Juſtification, in this point the
Scripture doth clear this diſtinction, <hi>Heb. 9. 8. The Holy
Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the holieſt of all
was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle
was yet ſtanding.</hi> The meaning is this, that the way to
Heaven it was not manifeſt to the Jewes whileſt their
Tabernacle ſtood, that is, whileſt their Leviticall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
were in uſe, the way to heaven was not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
the godly went to heaven before Chriſts time, but
it was not manifeſted, for the common ſort of the Jews
did not underſtand that by <hi>Jeſus Chriſts</hi> Paſſion and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
they muſt come to heaven; therefore the Apoſtle
ſaith, the way to the holieſt of all was not yet manifeſted
whileſt their firſt Tabernacle ſtood; So my Text is true
that heaven was prepared for believers by the <hi>Lord Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> his aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The third Quere is this, but you will ſay, if Chriſt by
his aſcenſion into heaven did prepare heaven for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
then what became of all the people of God
and holy men of God under the old Teſtament? whither
went they?</p>
            <p>The Jeſuites raiſe the difficulty from the Text. They
ſay that before Chriſt aſcended none did goe to heaven,
therfore they make <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> with all the
Patriarkes and all the holy men of God, to be in the place
called <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> which was for the good men till
Chriſts aſcenſion; Then there is <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> a
place of receipt of Infants. Then there is <hi>Purgatory</hi> for
men guilty of groſſe ſins, heaven and hell they concurre
in to be a truth; <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> ſay they, was the place
to receive all the good men till Chriſts aſcenſion, and then
Chriſt tooke them all into heaven; Proteſtant Divines
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96119:81"/>
do take a deale of paines to vindicate this Text.</p>
            <p>If you will aske me what is become of the Patriarkes
and all good men of old before Chriſts going into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
how can they come to heaven if heaven be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by Chriſts aſcenſion?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I may ſay that of Chriſts aſcenſion, as <hi>Gerrard</hi>
doth of Chriſts Paſſion;<note place="margin">Beneficia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti valent non ſolum antror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſed retror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum. <hi>Ger.</hi> loc. com.</note> the Death of Chriſt it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable
before it was in being, ſo I may ſay of Chriſts
Aſcenſion, that it was availeable before it was in being.
<hi>Gerrard</hi> hee hath another paſſage, that the benefits wee
have by Chriſt, they are not onely to bee reſtrained to
ages that are to come after Chriſt, but to looke back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to all ages before Chriſt. <hi>Revel. 5. 9. And they
ſung a new Song, ſaying; Thou art worthy to take the
Booke and to open the Seales thereof, for thou waſt ſlaine,
and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi> Not onely
the Lambe ſlain decretively in Gods decree, nor onely is
the Lambe ſlaine Typically in the ceremoniall Sacrifices,
but alſo vertually, that there was vertue in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
that all the Godly Jewes had vertue by CHRISTS death;
there is my firſt Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, obſerve this; that the Scripture doth not
ſay that Chriſt by going up to heaven did open heaven
for us, he being our Mediator ſitting at Gods right hand
in heaven, heaven was opened before, but not ſo fully
adorned as it was by Chriſts aſcenſion, <hi>Heb. 9. 8. The
holy Ghoſts this ſignifying, that the way into the holieſt of
all, was not yet made manifeſt, whilest the Tabernacle was
yet ſtanding.</hi> The Grecians doe obſerve, that Chriſt
doth not uſe a word that ſignifies to open a thing that is
ſhut, but to open clear, and manifeſt a thing that is obſcure,
it was open before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, againſt the Jeſuits conceit of <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi>
there are cleare paſſages in the Scripture and undenyable
reaſons drawn from the Scripture that doth prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
under the old Teſtament went to heaven before
CHRISTS aſcenſion; As in <hi>Luke 16. 22. And it came
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96119:81"/>
to paſſe that the begger dyed, and was carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Boſome: the Rich man alſo dyed, and
was buried.</hi> Hee lived two thouſand years and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt was borne, heaven is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and the elect that dyed are ſaid to goe into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Boſome, and <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> are in heaven <hi>Heb.
11. 5. By Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated, that he ſhould
not ſee death and was not found, becauſe God had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
him.</hi> in the 16 verſe. <hi>but now they deſired a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Countrey, that is heavenly, wherefore God is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to be called their God, for hee hath prepared for
them a City.</hi> Hee is aſhamed to bee their God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have a City prepared for them by God, that
likewiſe, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſaid to be carried by Angels into
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome, this was before Chriſt dyed: then
frequent Scriptures there are, touching Chriſts tranſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that when Chriſt was taken up, that hee ſaw <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> from thence Divines gather that they muſt
bee in Heaven. There are foure undeniable Reaſons wil
prove that the godly before Chriſts Aſcenſion they went
to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it appears by this, becauſe it is ſaid, that thoſe
that were carried to heaven they were carried to Heaven
by the Angels, the Angels carried <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Boſome; now certainly Angels are not in <hi>Limbus Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
Luk. 16. 22.</hi> Againe if the Beleevers of old ſhould
not goe into Heaven, the Death and Merits of Chriſt
would bee extenuated <hi>Heb. 13. 8. Jeſus Chriſt the ſame
yesterday, and to day and for ever.</hi> Hee was the ſame
yeſterday, that is, before he was borne hee was of uſe
then, as well as to after time.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the Soules of wicked men bee in Hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts time, then the Soules of Godly men muſt
bee in Heaven before Chriſts time, that muſt clearly
follow by the Rule of contraries; now that wicked men
went to Hell is cleare, <hi>Jude 7. Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,
<hi>and the Cities about them, in like manner giving
themſelves over to Fornication, and going after strange fleſh,
are ſet forth for an examples ſuffering the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96119:82"/>
Fire.</hi> They went to Hell before Chriſts time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt follow clearly that the elect muſt go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before Chriſts time.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there is the very ſame reaſon why Believers
ſhould goe to Heaven before Chriſts Aſcenſion, as there is
why they ſhould goe to heaven after Chriſts Aſcenſion,
becauſe Beleevers under the old Teſtament, they had
the ſame Goſpell preached to them as now wee have,
and they had the ſame Spirit, the ſame Faith, and under
the ſame Covenant, and therefore why muſt not they go
to the ſame place? I ſhall clearly prove this unto you.
Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had the ſame Spirit and the ſame Faith that
we have, and this is laid down by the Apoſtle, in <hi>2 Cor.
4. 13. We having the ſame Spirit of Faith, according as
it is written, I beleeved and therefore have I ſpoken, wee
alſo beleeve and therefore ſpeak;</hi> and they with us had
the ſame juſtifying Faith. Their circumciſion was a
ſigne of righteouſneſſe by Faith. And then againe, they
had the ſame Goſpel that we have, <hi>Heb. 4. 2. For unto us
was the ſame Goſpell Preached, as well as unto them: but the
word Preached did not profit them, not being mixt with
Faith in them that heard it.</hi> The ſame Goſpell, onely
theirs is darke, for the ceremoniall Law was Goſpell,
meerely Types and Shadowes of Chriſt to come, Shadows
of Salvation by Chriſts Bloud; Nay, they had the ſame
Chriſt as wee have, <hi>1 Cor. 104. And did all drinke the
ſame ſpirituall drinke, for they dranke of that ſpirituall Rock
that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> And in
the Wilderneſſe it is ſaid, let not us tempt Chriſt as they
alſo tempted him, they ſinned againſt Chriſt in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
and they enjoyed Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe: ſo
that they had the ſame Chriſt as wee have; Againe, they
are under the ſame covenant that wee are, <hi>Jeremiah 31.</hi>
It is the ſame covenant with ours in <hi>Hebrews 8.</hi> Is there
not then the ſame reaſon why Beleevers under the old
Teſtament ſhould goe to the ſame place as Beleevers
under the new? for they had the ſame Spirit, the
ſame Faith, the ſame Goſpell, the ſame Chriſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96119:82"/>
the ſame covenant, therefore they muſt needs goe to
the ſame place, though heaven be prepared by Chriſts
Aſcenſion, yet heaven was opened before, yet not ſo
manifeſted before, as ſince Chriſt dyed, roſe and went up
to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>
               </label> I now come to the Application, the uſe is to draw out
a few practicall inferences from this Doctrine, which
are four. If it be ſo, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his going into
Heaven hath prepared a place for the elect there, then learn
by way of recompenſe, by way of compenſation and
gratification to <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> O prepare thou a heart for
Chriſt who hath prepared a heaven for thee. Shall Chriſt
go to heaven to prepare a place for thee, and wilt thou
afford Chriſt no corner in thy heart? thou letteſt thy luſts
ſit on the Throne of thy heart, yet you doe not give Chriſt
any roome there. We read in <hi>Revel. 19. 7. Let us be glad
and rejoyce, and give honour to him, for the Marriage
of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herſelfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
O bee thou as the Bride, make thy ſelfe ready for
the Marriage day, the betrothing day was when Chriſt
went up to heaven, thy Marriage day is thy dying day;
O againſt the Marriage day of the Lambe, doe thou who
art his Bride make thy ſelfe ready, doe thou prepare a
heart for Chriſt, who hath prepared heaven for thee.
<hi>Origen</hi> hath a good paſſage on <hi>Luke 22. 12. And hee
ſhal ſhew you a large upper roome furniſhed, there make ready,</hi>
though hee doth much abuſe the ſcope of the Scripture.
There were three properties of the Room wherein Chriſt
are the poſſover, a large, upper, and a furniſhed Roome,
hee makes this Allegory of it; I doe not give it to you as
the ſenſe of it, but take his gloſſe, that if thou wilt come
to ſup with Chriſt, thou muſt make thy heart as the upper
Roome, a heart raiſed in Divine contemplation, and
not onely an upper Roome, but a large Roome, a large
Heart, a furniſhed Roome, a Heart adorned with grace;
O do thou prepare a large Room, an upper Roome and a
furniſhed Roome for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Chriſt be gone into heaven to prepare a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96119:83"/>
place for the Elect, then we are rather gayners then
loſers by the want of Chriſts bodily preſence, wee ſhould
bee leſſe happy to have Chriſt upon the Earth, then now
Chriſt is in heaven; for wee are greater gainers by Chriſts
now being in heaven, then if hee were in perſon with us
upon the Earth; Divines illuſtrate this: ſay they, the
body of the Sun is fixt in the Firmament, and giveth light
over all the world, now ſhould the body of the Sun bee
taken from the Firmament and bee upon the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, it would not bee of that availe to us as now
it is, the Sun of Righteouſneſſe now hee is in the heavens,
hee is of greater availe to us, then if he were upon the
Earth; for if hee were on the Earth, all the World could
not ſee him at once, ſo that we are greater gainers by
Chriſts going up to Heaven, then if hee were in perſon
here amongſt us, as God ſaith in <hi>John 14. 28. Yee have
heard how I ſaid unto you, I goe away, and come againe
unto you: If yee loved mee, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I
ſaed, I goe unto the Father, for my Father is greater then
I.</hi> Truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was matter of joy and not of griefe that Chriſt
left this world and went to heaven, becauſe he went there
to prepare a place for us. I would faine know whether
<hi>Jacob</hi> would have been troubled for his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> if
<hi>Jacob</hi> had known this, that his Son was gone into <hi>Aegypt</hi>
to prepare a place for him and all his brethren, againſt
the famine: ſurely it would never have troubled him.
Truely your <hi>Joſeph,</hi> your <hi>Jeſus,</hi> hee is gone to Heaven,
to prepare a place for you there; therefore let it not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you, ſeeing you are more happy by Chriſts preſence in
heaven, then if you had his bodily preſence upon the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if Chriſt be gone Bodily into Heaven, it is a
ground of comfort to thee that though thou haſt no place
to put thy head here in this world, yet remember Chriſt
is gone to prepare Heaven for thee. It may be many of you
have poor cottages, ſmoaky houſes; why for all that, lift up
thy heart with joy, that Chriſt is gone to prepare a large

nor Land he ſhould be ſafe from his power, yet ſaith <hi>Baſil</hi>
for all the Emperours rage, I ſhall be either in Heaven or

ſafety to put thy head in, yet maugre the malice of Men
and Devils, thou ſhalt bee either in Heaven or under
Heaven. A Cardinall threatned <hi>Luther</hi> with this, that

that though thou mayeſt not have an abiding place on

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, is Chriſt gone into Heaven to prepare a place
for Beleevers? then all Chriſtleſſe and graceleſſe men
have no benefit by the paſſion or Aſcenſion of our <hi>Lord
Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt</hi> dyed, but not for thee; Chriſt roſe again,
but not for thee; Chriſt is gone up to Heaven but not for
thee; he will prepare no place in Heaven for thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy caſe is, as was ſpoken of <hi>Judas, Acts 1. 25. That
hee may take part of this Miniſtery and Apoſtleſhip, from
which</hi> Judas <hi>by tranſgreſſion fell, that hee might goe to
his own place.</hi> It was to no place of Chriſts preparing,
it was to a place prepared of old for condemnation; In
the phraſe of <hi>Jude, Tophet is prepared of old,</hi> it is a place
prepared of an angry God, and not a place prepared by
a Mediatour. This therefore ſhould bee matter of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to all Chriſtleſſe and Graceleſſe men: what
though Chriſt bee gone into Heaven? yet thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
follow after him. What though Chriſt prepareth a
place for all his Elect? yet hee prepareth none for thee,
thy place is prepared by an angry God, thou goeſt to
Hell, and not to a place prepared by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And
thus I have done with the ſecond Doctrine, to wit, that
the fruit and benefit that all the Elect of God hath by
Chriſts going into Heaven, it is to prepare a place for
them, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you.</hi>
            </p>

coming, ſo the Jewes underſtand it, (for ſome of them do
ſtudy the Evangeliſts, though they ſtudy to confute it, they
doe not beleeve that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come) they make it of his
coming in the fleſh, <hi>John 4.</hi> it was the womans ſence of

unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called
Chriſt, when he is come, hee will tell us all things:</hi> why, he
was come, but ſhee thought that hee had not been come;
O ſaith <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, I</hi> am hee, I am come already, ſo that

Chriſts coming again to judge the world is a Doctrine full
of comfort to every Beleever whileſt they are here upon
the earth; for the proofe of this ſee</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 15. <hi>To the end,</hi>
For this we ſay unto you by the Word of the Lord, that wee
which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord
ſhall not prevent them which are aſleepe. For the Lord
himſelfe ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the
voyce of the Archangell, and with the Trumpe of God,
and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. Then wee which are
alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the Ayre, and ſo ſhall
wee ever bee with the Lord; Wherefore comfort one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is by way of Objection, what comfort is
this to us, that Chriſt ſhould bid them they ſhould not
bee troubled, that hee might come againe, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the making of this promiſe and this time promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it hath run above 1600 hundred years already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt that Tract of time can neither interrupt
the accompliſhment of a promiſe, nor the comfort of a
promiſe, it is comfortable that what is promiſed ſhall
ſooner or later come to paſſe, <hi>Daniel 10. 1. In the third
year of</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>a thing was revealed unto</hi>
Daniel, <hi>whoſe Name was called</hi> Belteſhazzar, <hi>and the
thing was true, but the time appointed was long, and hee
understood the thing, and had underſtanding of the viſion.</hi>
It is a promiſe made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to comfort you againſt all
the troubles of the world, hee will come againe, and
though the time bee long ere hee doth come, yet the
time appointed will bee true, it is certaine, though it be
long.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the godly in ages before us could rejoyce

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96119:85"/>
and why ſhould not the Diſciples doe ſo then, and why
ſhould not wee doe ſoe now? I will give you two
or three inſtances, <hi>John 8. 56. Your Father</hi> Abraham
<hi>rejoyced to ſee my day, and hee ſaw it and was glad.</hi> The
promiſe was made to <hi>Ahraham</hi> above a thouſand years
before he ſaw him, and yet he was glad, <hi>Heb. 11. 13. Theſe
all dyed in Faith, not having received the promiſes, but
having ſeen them afarre off, and were perſwaded of them and
embraced them.</hi> They did embrace the promiſes, though
they were farre off in their accompliſhment. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Text you have in <hi>Iſaiah 9. 6. For unto us a child is
borne, unto us a Sonne is given, and the government ſhall
bee upon his ſhoulders, &amp;c.</hi> Behold, this is matter of

they might have ſaid, Lord what is that to us? wee

ſhall not bee till many yeares after? and yet the Prophet
doth thinke no fitter a promiſe to give them, then the
the promiſe that a Virgin ſhould conceive a Sonne. I
mention it for this, that though promiſes were made
long ſince, yet bear up your hearts, for that it will be ſure
and certain though it be long: and ſo much for the firſt
particular.</p>
            <p>The next particular is, I, but how doth it appeare that
<hi>Chriſts</hi> coming to judge the world is a Doctrin ſo full of
comfort to beleevers?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it appears by the beleevers longing and looking for
<hi>Chriſts</hi> coming to judge the world, it is the people of
Gods property to long for the appearance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when
it makes the heart of a <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble, it is a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Great comfort to a Beleever, it is called the day
of Redemption, and called by <hi>Peter</hi> the day of refreſhing,
and this made the Church ſay, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come

Doctrine ſo comfortable as the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

laid up for mee a Crown of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord
the righteous judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to
mee onely, but unto them all that love his appearing.</hi> A
crowne is laid up for mee, and not for mee onely, but
for all them that love his appearing. This ſhews that
ſurely it muſt bee a Doctrine of great comfort to the elect

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is a Doctrine of great comfort, becauſe
Jeſus Chriſt hath reſerved the full glorification of the
Elect for that time, though Chriſt brings ſoules to heaven
before his coming, yet hee doth not compleatly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any of his ſervants till his coming againe to Judge the
world, <hi>1 Iohn 3. 2. Beloved, now are wee the Sons of
God, and it doth not yet appear what wee ſhall bee, but Wee
know that when hee ſhall appeare, wee ſhall bee like him,
for we ſhall ſee him as hee is:</hi> and in <hi>Coloſ. 3. 4. When
Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appeare, then ſhall yee alſo

yee ſhall receive a Crown of Glory that fades not away.</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture there are, to prove, that the
reſerve that Chriſt hath of the full glorifying of the Elect,
it is at the time of his coming to judge the world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third particular is, but wherein is the Doctrine of
Chriſts coming again, ſo comfortable to Beleevers?
there are theſe foure particulars more eſpecially where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Doctrine of Chriſts coming againe to judge the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in caſe of any ſcandalous aſperſion, or any unjuſt
imputation which is laid upon them, it may ſerve for
great comfort to thee in this caſe. The Apoſtle gives
it you <hi>1 Cor. 4. 3, 4, But with with mee it is a very
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96119:86"/>
ſmall thing that I ſhould bee judged of you, or of mans
judgements, yea, I judge not my owne ſelfe. For
I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but hee that judgeth mee, is the Lord.</hi> Cenſure
me what you will, and judge of mee what you pleaſe,
for hee that judgeth mee ſhall be the Lord, therefore it is
a ſmall matter that I am judged of you. Suppoſe thou art
judged, thou art ſcandalized, and thou art aſperſed in
the world, appeale to Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, for hee
that judgeth thee is the Lord, and this wee finde Chriſt
did, <hi>1 Peter 2. 23. who when hee was reviled, reviled not
againe, when hee ſuffered, he threatned not, but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> When thou
art reviled, and aſperſed, and cenſured, doe not revile
again, doe not cenſure again, but doe as Chriſt did, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thy cauſe to Chriſt that judgeth all things righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Chriſt will come to over-judge all things that have
been judged amiſſe, <hi>Jude, 5. To execute Judgment
upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly amongſt
them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners
have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> Men have hard ſpeeches againſt
many, who are upright in the Land; it is a comfort then
that of Chriſts coming again, one end is, to convince
men of all their hard ſpeeches and ſcandalous aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſts coming again is a Doctrine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
in caſe of all perſecution thou undergoeſt from
men, for Chriſt, for the Goſpell, <hi>1 Theſſ. 1. 6, 7. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to them that trouble you: And to you who are
troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Ieſus ſhall bee
revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> As if hee
ſhould have ſaid, you are troubled and perſecuted about
the Goſpel, for Chriſts ſake, why, bee not troubled, for
Chriſt is coming from Heaven, <hi>1 Peter 4. 13. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
in aſmuch as yee are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings,
that when his Glory ſhall bee revealed, yee may bee glad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

with exceeding joy.</hi> when Chriſt comes to be revealed
and to judge the world, you ſhall be glad alſo with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
joy, that is a ſecond caſe wherein this Doctrine
may bee of comfort.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Doctrine may ſerve for comfort, in caſe
of any inward accuſation of conſcience from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of thine own guiltineſſe: it may bee thou judgeſt
thy ſelf that thou art a damned undone Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that there is a Judgement to paſſe on thee beſides
thy own miſtake and miſapprehenſion, Chriſts coming
to Judgement ſhould bee a comfort to thee againſt thine
own inward accuſation, becauſe hee that is thy Jeſus, is
thy Judge, hee is thy Advocate to plead thy cauſe, and
thy Judge to judge thy cauſe; Suppoſe thy conſcience
doth accuſe thee, and thou judgeſt thy ſelfe to Hell, yet
comfort thy ſelf with this, that thy Jeſus will afterwards
come to judge thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Chriſts coming againe to judge the would

and the uſurping hand uſeth waies of oppreſſion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

to judgement ſhall bee of great comfort to you. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
ſaith, that Chriſt ſhall come to judge things that are
not judged in the world, and Chriſt ſhall come to judge
things that are judged amiſſe in the world; Chriſt ſhall
judge all oppreſſions and violence which is done by an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping
hand; here is matter of comfort that Chriſt cometh
to judge them all over againe; an excellent paſſage which
<hi>Solomon</hi> hath, <hi>Eccle. 3. 16, 17. And moreover I ſaw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sun the place of judgement, that wickedneſſe was
there, and the place of righteouſneſſe, that iniquity was
there. I ſaid in my heart, God ſhall judge the righteous
and the wicked: for there is a time there, for every purpoſe,
&amp; for every work.</hi> That is, I ſaw into Courts of Judicature,
and I ſaw wickedneſſe was there, and I looked into the
place of righteouſneſſe, and behold iniquity was there
then I ſaid in my heart, ſurely God ſhall judge both the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96119:87"/>
righteous and the wicked; if there were no argument in
all the Scripture to prove Chriſts coming again, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it will evince that Chriſt ſhall come to judge the

Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, Come

2 Tim. 1. 16, 18. The Lord give mercy unto the houſe

to looke on the Doctrine of Chriſts coming to judgement
as a Doctrine to teach you duty, as well as to give you
comfort: it is a great abuſe of your priviledges when you
make any Goſpell-point to bee an inlet of comfort, and do
not make that very comfort to bee a ſpurre to duties, and
the Scripture putteth you upon this, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 7. So that ye
come behinde in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, 2 Theſſ. 2. 1. Now wee beſeech you Brethren
by the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that yee bee not

concluſions about this dark and obſcure Doctrin of Chriſts
coming to judge the world. There are many looſe and

touching the coming of the Lord in determining
that, which the Scripture determineth not: it is not my
intent to trouble you with ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ties, but onely to check the
frollick and bold attempts of ſome, who goe about to
determine that which the Scripture doth no way reveale,
to which end take heed of theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, take heed of determining the place from whence
Chriſt ſhould come. The Papiſts they are bold thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> way:
they hold you in hand that Chriſt ſhall come from the
Eaſt. Therefore our Churches, all of them were built
Eaſt and Weſt, and upon that ground, that Chriſt would
come from the Eaſt; the Scripture ſaith that Chriſt ſhall
come as lightning from the Eaſt, but that doth not ſhew
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96119:89"/>
the place from whence hee comes; but as Chriſt ſhall
come as Lightning, it notes the viſibility of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the celerity of Chriſts coming; Lightning it
is viſible, and ſo ſhall Chriſts coming bee, all ſhall ſee
him as yee ſee Lightning; Now this bold attempt hath
been the foundation to many Superſtitions Opinions; it
is the reaſon of bowing and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inging towards the Eaſt.
All roſe meerely from that ground of Chriſts coming
from the Eaſt; the Scripture onely ſaith, that hee ſhall
come downe from Heaven, and the Lord ſhall come
from Heaven, but from what part of the heaven the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh not.</p>
            <p>Againe, paſſe not bold conjectures in determining the
place where Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world: many
men where the Scripture is ſilent doe run into many ſtrong
conceits to determine that which the Scripture doth not,
many Books doe determine the place where Chriſt ſhall
come to judge the world, and that is in the Valley of
<hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and there is one Text which ſeemes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it that way; which is in <hi>Ioel 3. 12. Let the Heathen
bee awaked, and come up to the Valley of Iehoſhaphat, for
there will I ſit to judge all the Heathen round about.</hi> Here
they doe conjecture that Chriſt ſhall come to the Valley
of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and there hee ſhall judge all the world, and
I ſhall, to ſhew the vanity and wickedneſſe of theſe, give
theſe five demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is not ſpoken of God the Sonne, but of God
the father, to bee thy judge, therefore it cannot have a
reference to the laſt Judgement, for Chriſt judgeth
then.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, their Judgement here, onely referres
to the Judging of the Heathen round about; Now the
generall judgement is for the judging of the righteous
and the unrighteous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that it is impoſſible that the Valley of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi>
ſhould containe all the men that ever were, that
are, and that ſhall bee in the world to bee judged, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not profitable that this hath reference to the laſt
Judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:96119:89"/>
Fourthly, the time that this judgement, here is ſpoken
of, it is limited by the prophet himſelfe; for compare
this verſe with the ſecond verſe; <hi>I will alſo gather all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and will bring them downe into the Valley of</hi> Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,
<hi>and will plead with them there for my People,
and for my heritage Iſrael, whom they have ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nations, and parted my Land.</hi> The time is
ſpoken of when God ſhall turne againe the captivity of
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then God ſhould judge the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and thoſe heathen Nations that aſſiſted them for to
undo the people of God; therfore it refers to ſome time
after the captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; not to the general and laſt coming of
the Sonne of God: and thus much for taking off that Text
from yeelding patronage to that fond conceit of Chriſts
coming to judge the world in the Valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi>
and the Scripture is farre from giving you the place
where Chriſt ſhall come to judgement, either in the
Valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> or Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> out only in the ayre.
<hi>1 Theſſ. 4. 7. Then wee which are alive, and remaine,
ſhall bee caught up together with them in the clouds, to
meet the Lord in the Aire, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the
Lord.</hi> The Scripture doth make no mention of Chriſts
coming upon the Earth at all. Take heed of bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and conjectures about the place of Chriſts judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, take heed of bold attempts about the time
of Chriſts judgement, there have been them which have
ſhewne abundance of wickedneſſe in this. <hi>Gerrard</hi> doth
confute the folly of ſuch men that do gueſſe at the time
when Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth
make mention of ſome in his time, that held that Chriſt
ſhould come to judge the world a thouſand years after
his Death, but wee have ſeen their folly and ſhame,
for there is more time expired then that. Another ſaith,
that ſome held in his time that Chriſt ſhould come to
judge the world 365. yeares after his Death, that is a
folly likewiſe, for there is more time paſt then that. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
ſaith, that there were Anabapiſts which held that in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96119:90"/>
the yeare 1530 Chriſt ſhould come to judge the world
but wee have ſeen their folly likewiſe, for there is more
time paſt then then that. <hi>Napier,</hi> though a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nobleman in <hi>Scotland,</hi> hee was too frolick in this
way, for he doth boldly ſay that Chriſt ſhall come to judge
the world in the yeare 1688. But beloved, Chriſts coming
to judge the world cannot be determined, for Chriſt would
not gratifie his own Apoſtles to tell them the time when his
coming ſhould bee, <hi>Mat. 24.</hi> Hee would not tell them
when the end of the word ſhould bee; it ſhews then it
is great pride of heart to paſſe peremptory conjectures
upon the period of time, Chriſt did not thinke it meet
for to tell his Apoſtles of the time of his coming, <hi>1 Theſſ.
5. 1. But of the times and ſeaſons, Brethren, yee have
no need that I write unto you,</hi> nay, Angels in heaven, and
Chriſt himſelfe as hee was meere Man could not tell the
time, <hi>Marke 13. 32. But of that day, and that houre,
knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven,
neither the Sonne but the Father. Mat. 24. 36. But of
that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels
of Heaven, but my father onely.</hi> I onely mention it for
this, to ſhew the vanity of our age, of thoſe who will
undertake to ſhew the very day when Chriſt ſhould
come; Likewiſe to condemne the former Ages, who
run to things not revealed, I remember what a learned
Man ſaith, one that commenteth upon my Text, ſaith
hee, there is nothing that doth expoſe the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to more contempt, then that the Preachers, and the
hearers of it will run into nice queſtions, and bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
in their reſolves of that the Scripture ſpeakes
not of; And <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> may ſuſpect the whole
Goſpell, becauſe they ſee Men peremptory about things
which are not revealed in the Goſpell, and ſhall ſee their
falſe-hood appearing to all; bee not peremptory in your
determinations about the time of Chriſts coming, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the place where, for neither is revealed in Scripture
Chriſt did deny his Diſciples when they asked him where
hee ſhould come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Luk. 17. 37. And they anſwered and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96119:90"/>
ſaid, where Lord? And hee ſaid unto them, where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is, thither will the Eagles bee gathered together.</hi> Chriſt
told them of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the end
of the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld; then ſaid the Diſciples, but where Lord wilt
thou come? Chriſt onely gives them this anſwer, that
where the carcaſſe is, thither will the Eagles flee, that is
where Chriſt is, all the Elect ſhall bee gathered, as
Birds of prey flock together after a carcaſſet o feed upon;
ſo that Chriſt would neither tell the place where, nor the
time when, and this ſhould bee a check and a controle to
mens curious pryings about that which the Scripture is
ſilent in.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, take heed of bold and adventurous conjectures,
about the manner of Chriſts coming to judge the World
by vaine and carnall corruptions of a temporall Kingdome
of Chriſt. Many are very peremptory about it,
and there bee ſtrange Books, at leaſt in their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
that they can deſcry the very maner of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Chriſt ſhall come from heaven, and dwell a
thouſand yeares upon the Earth, and the Dead ſhall riſe
and live in the World, but theſe are ſuch things which
the Scripture doth never take notice of. I am to handle on
this promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>but I will come again,</hi> A perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Quere,</hi> which is this, whether Chriſt Jeſus in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to his Diſciples to come again, did meane
to come to Reigne upon the Earth here a thouſand years,
or whether it bee to bee meant of Chriſts laſt coming to
judge the world; this Scripture and others are made uſe
of and brought to prove that Chriſt ſhall come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

come to this perſonall Reigne, then hee ſhall raiſe all
the Martyrs that have loſt their Lives in his cauſe, and
the Divell ſhall bee bound up, that hee ſhall tempt Men
to ſinne no more, and wicked Men ſhall be ty'd up that

of the Apoſtle a fancy that Chriſt muſt bee an Earthly

that the time of reſtitution cannot bee till our bodies bee

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when Chriſt comes, then comes the end;
the Apoſtle tells us of his coming and the end of the
world; to note, that Chriſts coming and the end of the
world ſhall be together.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee delivers his Kingdome up to his Father,
whereas if Chriſt ſhould reigne a thouſand years here,
it could not bee ſaid to bee the giving up of a Kingdome,
but the taking of a Kingdome into poſſeſſion, hee muſt
reſigne all to God the Father. When the Scripture is ſo
expreſſe, it is a wonder that men can receive ſuch fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
thoughts that Chriſt muſt come as an Earthly
Monarch to reign here a thouſand yeares. A fourth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is in <hi>Heb. 9. 28. So Chriſt was once offered to beare the
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt of many, and unto them that looke for him ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation.</hi> From that
Scripture I will argue againſt Chriſts coming to reign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth for a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:96119:93"/>
Firſt, it is expreſly in the Scripture that Chriſts coming
there ſpoken of, referres to the day of Judgement in <hi>v.
27. And as it is appointed unto all men once to dye, but after
this the judgement.</hi> There Chriſts ſecond coming, it doth
refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e unto the day of Judgement; Now if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that the ſecond coming which is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to judgement? Then Chriſt cannot come before
that time to reigne upon the Earth, for if hee ſhould come
to reigne upon the Earth, then the Apoſtle muſt call that
his third coming; there hath been but one coming, which
was from Heaven to the wombe of the Virgin, and
there is no other coming to follow but a ſecond coming,
that is, to judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid, Chriſt ſhall come the ſecond time
to our Salvation, it cannot bee ſaid to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if his coming were to reigne a thouſand
yeares upon the Earth, that were onely ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
good; but Chriſts coming muſt referre to the laſt
and great coming, wherein the world ſhall bee judged
and the ſoules of the Elect ſhall bee ſaved; Beloved,
theſe Scriptures are very clear unto mee. The reaſons
are two; that Chriſt ſhall not come perſonally out of
Heaven to reigne upon the Earth for a thouſand yeares.
Firſt, becauſe the Scripture doth manifeſt that when Chriſt
comes perſonally out of Heaven, there are ſuch Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of his coming, that can bee referred to no other time
then his laſt coming to judge the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when Chriſt is ſaid to come out of Heaven, the
Scripture telleth you this concomitant, that the Saints
ſhall come along with him, <hi>Jude 14.</hi> And <hi>Enoch</hi> alſo
the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> Propheſied of theſe, ſaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints:</hi>
So that when Chriſt comes from Heaven he muſt come
with his Saints with him, nay, he muſt come with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>2 Theſſ. 1. 7. And to you who are troubled, rest
with us, when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall bee revealed from
Heaven, with his mighty Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Put theſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
together, Chriſt muſt come with his Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96119:93"/>
But thoſe that fancy Chriſts coming a thouſand
yeares, they cannot prove that Chriſt ſhall come with
his Saints and Angels, for the ſcripture that ſeemes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it that way; doth not ſpeak of Angels &amp; Saints coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid when Chriſts comes from Heaven
that good and bad ſhall bee gathered together, and all
ſhall bee judged by Jeſus Chriſt; now this cannot bee
of Chriſts perſonall reigne on the Earth; this you have in
<hi>2 Theſſ. 2. 9. Now wee beſeech you Brethren, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together
unto him.</hi> So that the coming of our Lord, and our ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together to bee judged by Chriſt, they are both
coupled together; becauſe when the Lords coming is,
then is our gathering time, <hi>Mat. 25. 31. 32. When the Son
of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with
him, then ſhall hee ſit upon the Throne of his glory. And
before him ſhall bee gathered all Nations, and hee ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them one from another, as a Shepheard divideth
his ſheepe from the Goats.</hi> And in <hi>2 Tim. 4. 1. I charge
thee therfore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who
ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead at his appearing, and
his Kingdome.</hi> The Scripture telleth you that when
Chriſt appeares to judge the world, hee ſhall have
this concomitant of his coming, <hi>he ſhal gather all together,
to judge both the good and the bad.</hi> Thoſe that pretend
that Chriſt ſhall come to reigne a thouſand yeares upon
the Earth, they cannot prove that then all ſhall bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, they onely plead for the Matryrs, and
none elſe, therefore it cannot be referred to his coming to
reigne a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when Chriſt comes, then the end of the world 
is, a period is put to this world, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 24. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to
God, even the Father,</hi> &amp;c. When Chriſt comes, then comes
the end; now thoſe who hold for Chriſts perſonall
reign, they hold that the end of the world ſhal not be till a
thouſand yeares after, becauſe Chriſt muſt Reigne a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:96119:94"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the reſurrection both of the juſt and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
is a concomitant of Chriſts coming, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 23.
But every man in his owne Order, Chriſt the firſt fruits,
afterwards they that are Christs at his coming.</hi> So that
at Chriſts coming the generall reſurrection of the juſt and
unjuſt is to be.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is to bee the Salvation of the Soules of all
the Elect, that is a fifth concomitant of Chriſts coming,
<hi>Heb. 9. 28. Chriſt was once offered to beare the ſinnes of
many, and unto them that looke for him, ſhall hee appeare
the ſecond time without ſinne unto Salvation.</hi> This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be referred to Chriſts Perſonal coming upon the earth
to reign a thouſand years, becauſe he doth not come then to
ſave the ſoules of all the Elect; that is the firſt reaſon why
Chriſt cannot come to reigne upon the Earth, becauſe
when the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts coming out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
it doth annex five concomitants with it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to any coming of Chriſt upon the Earth, but to
come to judge the world. A ſecond reaſon is this, that
Chriſt cannot come to reigne upon the Earth, becauſe
if it ſhould bee ſo, it would bee worſe for Chriſt, and it
would bee worſe for us then now it is, it would be worſe
for Chriſt, for to leave Heaven and come to the Earth, for
Chriſt to leave Saints and Angels and Heaven, for to
live upon the Earth among the wicked and the
good, for they themſelves confeſſe that wicked
men ſhall live upon the Earth then. Then beſides, they
fancy Earthly delights, that the fruit of the Vineyard
ſhall not fade, as now it doth, yet they would leſſen
Chriſts Glory, becauſe hee ſits this day at his Fathers right
Hand: againe, for to fancy this, that Chriſt muſt come
to reigne upon the Earth, it would bee a great loſſe to
all the Elect, for wee have the benefit of Chriſts everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Interceſſion; and were Chriſt upon the Earth, wee
ſhould loſe that benefit, <hi>Heb. 8. 4. For if hee were on the
Earth, hee ſhould not bee a Prieſt, ſeeing that there are
Prieſts that offer gifts according to the Law.</hi> So that
if hee were upon the Earth, wee ſhould loſe the benefit
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96119:94"/>
of his Prieſt-hood; therefore it would it bee a great
wrong to us, to have Chriſt here on the Earth, becauſe
the benefit of his Prieſtly Office would not bee ſo availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to us as it is in Heaven. Thus I have laid down ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and given you reaſons, why Chriſt cannot come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his laſt coming.</p>
            <p>Now there be eight Incongruities, and Abſurdities
that would follow in caſe you ſhould grant that Chriſt
ſhould come to Reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by thoſe mens Principles, this inconvenience will
follow, that people may exactly know the punctuall time
of Chriſts laſt coming to judge the world; for thoſe
who hold Chriſts perſonall Reigne, they doe as well
hold the time as the thing, they doe as well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
when this Reigne ſhall begin; Therefore ſome
have maintained that Chriſt ſhould come to Reigne on
the Earth in the year 1650. One ſaith, if it ſhall not be
in the yeare 1650, it ſhall bee in the yeare 1694. They
that go furtheſt gueſs at that time, if ſo bee they hold
the thing, and maintaine the time alſo when it ſhall
begin, then of neceſſity, wee muſt know exactly when
the day ſhal be that Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world,
for they grant it ſhall be immediately after the thouſand
yeares. Now beloved, that Opinion that carries this
abſurdity, to know the day of Chriſts coming to judge
the world, which Chriſt ſaith, none in the world can tell,
of that houre and day knoweth no man, <hi>Mark. 13. 32.
But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father,</hi>
is a falſe Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this incongruity will alſo follow, that it
will bee a great diſadvantage to Chriſt, in coming to
reigne a thouſand yeares on the Earth, to leave his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Heaven, and come, and onely poſſeſſe Earth.
Now Chriſt hath more happineſſe in the immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of his Father in Heaven, then hee can have
here upon the Earth; Then it will bee a loſſe to us, that
wee ſhould loſe the benefit of his Prieſtly Office, but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96119:95"/>
Chriſt the Sonne of righteouſneſſe being in Heaven, is
more available to Beleevers, then if he were upon the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve this, that if Chriſt ſhould come on
the Earth for a thouſand yeares, then Chriſt would leave
the Church after that thouſand yeares for a while, in a
worſe condition, then hee found it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I draw it from
that Text which they pretend to bee the ſtrength of their
Argument, <hi>Revel. 20. 5, 7, 8. But the reſt of the Dead lived
not again untill the thouſand years were finiſhed This is the
firſt reſurrection, and when the thouſand yeares are expired,
Satan ſhall bee looſed out of his Priſon; And ſhall go out
to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the
Earth, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g and Magog, to gather them together to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
the number of whom is as the Sand of the ſea.</hi> So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the thouſand yeares, the Devill ſhall bee let looſe
again, and there ſhall bee an innumerable company of
enemies, and they ſhall deſtroy multitudes of the godly;
Therefore Chriſt would leave his Church in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then hee found them, if this were true that Chriſt
ſhould reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, if Chriſt ſhould come to reigne a thouſand
yeares upon the Earth, then this incongruity will follow,
that there muſt bee three perſonall comings of Jeſus
Chriſt; for his firſt coming was his Incarnation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming, to theſe thouſand yeares. And his third
coming muſt bee to judge the world, that is, the laſt
coming, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes but two comings of
Chriſt; Firſt, his coming from heaven, when hee was
borne; his ſecond coming when he comes to judge the
world again.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, if Chriſt comes perſonally out of Heaven, to
reigne a thouſand yeares, this incongruity will follow, that
either the Saints and Angels muſt come, or not come
with Chriſt; if they muſt come with Chriſt, then it is
a loſſe to them, for them to leave the immediate preſence
of God, and come upon the Earth where wicked men
ſhall bee amongſt them: or if they muſt not come with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96119:95"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, yet it is a loſs to them to remaine there,
they ſhall loſe for a thouſand yeares the bodily preſence
of Chriſt; if Chriſt bee on the Earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee cannot bee in
Heaven the ſame time; Therefore it would be a loſſe to
the Saints and Angels for them to bee a thouſand yeares in
Heaven without the company of Jeſus Chriſt, not to have
the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt with them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A Sixth Incongruity will follow, that if Chriſt ſhall
come to reigne upon the Earth, then Chriſts Kingdome
muſt bee a worldly and terrene Kingdome, then it will
bee againſt the word of God, hee muſt be a viſible King
to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and a viſible King to all the world; beſides
this would follow then that Chriſts Kingdom muſt not be
aſpirituall Kingdome, but a Terrene, a worldly pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Kingdome, <hi>John 18. 36. Jeſus anſwered, My
Kingdome is not of this world, if my Kingdome were of
this world, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould
not bee delivered to the Jews, but now is my Kingdome not
from hence,</hi> Luke 17. 20. <hi>And when hee was demanded
of the Phariſees when the Kingdome of God ſhould come,
hee anſwered them and ſaid, the Kingdome of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not with Obſervation.</hi> Would not all the world ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this, for Chriſt to come bodily from Heaven, and
in the Majeſty of a Monarch? Now Chriſts Kingdome
doth not come with Obſervation. When the Diſciples
looked after an Earthly Kingdome, <hi>No,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<hi>my Kingdome is for to Rule and Reigne in your hearts,
you ſhall never ſee me for to be an outward Pompous King in
the world, for Chriſts Kingdome, it is a ſpiritual Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, that if Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to take a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
on the Earth for a thouſand yeares, then this would
intimate, as if Jeſus Chriſt had not a Kingdome, and
were not a King on Earth all this while hee is in Heaven;
they deny that place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all thoſe phraſes in the
new Teſtament, that the Kingdome of the world is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Kingdome of the Lord, they deny that Chriſt
is a King in Heaven. When hee was in the Cratch and
borne in the Stable, he was a King at that very hour,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96119:96"/>
               <hi>Pſalme 2.</hi> The Apoſtle referres it to Chriſts Birth and
Chriſts Reſurrection. Chriſt when hee aroſe from the
Dead, hee was a King then, and the Goſpell under Chriſts
time is called a Kingdome. It is remarkable, in <hi>John 18. 37.
Pilate therefore ſaid unto him, Art thou a King then? Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
anſwered, thou ſayeſt that I am a King.</hi> Chriſt was
a King, though hee would not bee an Earthly King to
deſtroy Earthly Governments, therefore when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in a tumult would have made him a King, yet hee
would not <hi>Zech. 9. 9. Rejoyce greatly, O Daughter of
Zion, ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem, behold thy King
cometh unto thee, hee is juſt, and having Salvation,
lowly, and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a Colt, the fole
of an Aſſe.</hi> Hee was King, when hee was on that ſlow
contemptible creature, ſo that now to ſay Chriſt ſhall
come to reigne as King, it is to intimate to the world,
as if Chriſt were not a King at this day, and whereas he
is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords in Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot come a thouſand years to reigne upon the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now I will deale fairely to ſhew you the ſtrongeſt
Scripture that hath moſt ſhew of reaſon, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of this Opinion; and ſhall labour to take them off
and cleare it to you. There are multitudes of quotations
that varieties of mens thoughts faſten upon to prove this
poynt, yet thoſe they moſt ſtand to, I ſhall faſten upon;
their chiefe Pillar is in</hi> Revel. 20. 2, 3, 5, 6. And hee laid
hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devill
and Satan, and bound him a thouſand yeares. And
I ſaw thrones, and they ſate upon them, and judgement
was given uuto them, and I ſaw the Soules of them that
were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the word
God, and which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither
his Image, neither had received his marke upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with
Chriſt a thouſand yeares; But the reſt of the Dead lived
not again untill the thouſand yeares were finiſhed. This is
the firſt Reſurrection, bleſſed, and holy is hee that hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96119:96"/>
part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath
no power, but they ſhall bee Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt,
and ſhall reign with him a thouſand yeares. <hi>Now from this
Text which is the chiefeſt in the Scripture they ſeeme to
build theſe two things upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt ſhall live upon the Earth, and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that were Martyrs by Antichriſt ſhall
riſe from the Dead, and come upon the Earth, theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeares to continue with Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>This they
build much upon, That</hi> Chriſt ſhall come to reign a thouſand
yeares upon the Earth. <hi>But I ſhall ſhew you this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee the ſenſe of it, and I ſhall give you Six An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that though the Scripture doth ſay that the
Saints that were beheaded, ſhould live with Chriſt
a thouſand yeares, yet the Text doth not ſay that Chriſt
ſhall come to reigne with them a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though the Text ſaith, that they ſhould live
and reigne with Chriſt a thouſand years, yet the Text doth
not ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhall reigne with him here upon the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that though it bee ſaid that the Saints ſhall
live, and reigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and reigning with Chriſt doth not neceſſarily imply
to bee in the ſame place where Jeſus Chriſt is, for then
you would pervert many Scriptures: <hi>For loe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I
am with you to the end of the World;</hi> it doth not therfore
follow, from that time hee will bee upon the Earth to the
end of the world, but Chriſt being with us, or wee with
him, it is by his ſpirit, <hi>Romans 8. 17. And if Children,
then Heires of God, and joynt Heires with Chriſt: if ſo bee
that wee ſuffer with him, that wee may bee alſo glorified
together.</hi> The Text it doth not denote the ſameneſs of
place, and the oneneſs of ſcituation, I give this to take off
that which is made of this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is evident that this Scripture cannot bee
a Foundation to build on, that Chriſt ſhall come to reign
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96119:97"/>
a thouſand yeares upon the Earth; becauſe then it will
not onely follow that men ſhall live ſo long, but ſhall
reigne with Chriſt ſo long on the Earth. <hi>Methuſelah</hi>
lived but nine hundred ſixty and nine yeares, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaith, <hi>the life of man is cut ſhorter,</hi> The Text ſaith,
they ſhall live and reigne with Chriſt; in that ſenſe taking
living properly, and all the phraſes properly, they muſt
neceſſarily ſay that men ſhall live when that time comes,
a thouſand yeares together. Againe, it cannot bee the
ſenſe of this Scripture, becauſe that cannot bee the ſenſe
of this Scripture which croſſeth the ſenſe of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to make this Scripture to affirme that Chriſt. ſhall
reigne on the Earth a thouſand yeares, and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
tell you that Chriſt ſhall ſtay in Heaven in perſon,
till all men ſhall riſe from the Dead, every man ſhall riſe,
then cometh the end, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 23, 24. But every man
in his owne order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they
that are Chriſts, at his coming. Then cometh the end,
&amp;c.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 1. <hi>Now wee beſeech you Brethren, by
the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering
together unto him.</hi> Then beſides it doth croſſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay that at Chriſts coming, onely ſome men ſhal riſe
but not all, <hi>Job 14, 10, 11, 12. But man dieth and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
away, yea, man giveth up the ghoſt, and where is hee?
As the waters faile from the Sea, and the Flood decayeth
and dryeth up; So man lieth down, and riſeth not, till
the Heavens bee no more, they ſhall not awake, nor bee
raiſed out of their ſleepe. Job</hi> telleth you expreſly, <hi>That
the Dead ſhall not bee raiſed till the Heavens bee no more,</hi>
and that cannot bee the thouſand yeares, for there will
bee a Earth, and a Heaven then; and in <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe,
<hi>The Heavens ſhall melt away like a ſcrowle. &amp;c.</hi> Now
to make a Reſurrection, before a Reſurrection, it is that
which the Scripture doth no where mention, <hi>John 5. 28,
29. Marvell not at this, for the houre is coming, in the
which all that are in the Graves ſhall heare his Voyce, and
ſhall come forth; they that have done good, unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of life, and they that have done evill unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96119:97"/>
of damnation.</hi> The judging of the juſt and unjuſt
ſhall bee the ſame houre, and upon Chriſts coming all
men ſhall bee judged, <hi>2 Tim. 4, 1. I charge thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before God and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge
the quicke and the dead, at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
So that Chriſts appearing, and Chriſts coming
is a judging of the quick and the dead. Now beloved,
then to make this Scripture to ſay that Chriſt ſhall come
on the Earth before his laſt coming, this is to croſſe other
Scriptures, then of neceſſity therefore it cannot bee the

               </gap>s, for there is no jarring between one phraſe
of the Scripture and another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, when the ſcripture ſaith here, <hi>That they live</hi>
               <hi>and reigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeares,</hi> it is not ſpoken
whether it bee a reigning with Chriſt in Heaven or on

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that hee ſaw the bodies of

now to ſay they muſt come to reigne on the Earth
for a thouſand yeares, it were a great inconveniency to
them; it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the ſoules of them;</hi> The thouſand
yeares cannot bee applied to Chriſts Perſonall Reigne.
For ſo Jeſus Chriſt hath an eternall Kingdome, he doth
not reigne a thouſand yeares on Earth or in Heaven,
but everlaſtingly, Kingdomes and States of this world
have laſted a thouſand yeares, and to make Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to laſt no longer, it is to give Chriſts Kingdome
too narrow a confine. I have conſulted with many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and I finde the current of Interpreters generally
runne this way, though ſome doe fancy that <hi>Text</hi>
ſpeakes of the binding of the Devill for a thouſand years,
and during this time, the Saints ſhould live and reigne
with Chriſt a thouſand yeares. The ſenſe and ſcope of
this place is this.</p>
            <p>The period of time, when this time began that the
Devill was bound; Interpreters doe unanimouſly give
this Opinion, that it began in the reigne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:96119:98"/>
the Great, hee being the firſt Chriſtian Emperour in the

Roman Emperours, who made great maſſacre and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
in the Church of God; in ſo much that in the booke
of Martyrs wee reade, that there may bee for every day
in the yeare five thouſand Chriſtians ſlaine, this is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Perſecution, and the Devill raged and ſtirred much.
Now upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Conſtantines</hi> reigne the Devill was bound up,
that is, the Roman Emperours, who were acted by the

Emperour came to reigne, hee gvae out imperiall Edicts
and Lawes for eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Religion,
and that put an end to the Perſecution of the Roman
Emperours, and to this Opinion many Interpreters give
in their conſent, <hi>Brightman, Napier, Gerard,</hi> and theſe
thouſand yeares when the Devill was bound did end 300
yeares ago and more, and this is given to be the ſcope and
ſenſe of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>

            <p>Two Objections by thoſe, who plead for a thouſand

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, is this, we read in the Century of the Church, that
the Church of God was peſtered by <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour

did greatly perſecute the Chriſtians, and how can this be

of the Roman Emperours, it was nothing ſo
long nor ſo tedious as the perſecution under the Roman
Emperours, for, for every day in the year, 5000 Chriſtians
were put to death; In <hi>Diocleſians</hi> reigne there were
17000 Chriſtians killed in one Moneth, there was ſome
ſprinkling perſecution in the time of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi>

that this is the firſt Reſurrection, that the Saints living and

Chriſts Power from the Idolatry of the times, and from

were not plunged into the wickedneſſe of the times: and
thus with conſulting of many Authors I finde this to bee
the trueſt account, in a few words in defending this Text
from giving any foundation to Chriſts perſonall reigne

               <hi>The ſecond</hi> Scripture <hi>that they doe urge for Chriſts

2 Peter 3. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13. But the Heavens and the

for a thouſand yeares reigne; this Scripture ſeemes to
give warrant that hee ſhall be on the Earth, they ſay
that the righteous ſhall onely have benefit of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall

            </p>
            <p>To take off this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, marke the ſcope and the context
how this Scripture is brought in, and it will ſomething
cleare the Text. it is brought in againſt ſome Epicurean
Principles that ſome ſcoffers had taken up in thoſe times,
<hi>ver. 3, 4. Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the
laſt daies ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying,
where is the promiſe of his coming? For ſince the Eathers
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell aſleepe, all things continue as they were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Creation.</hi> Wee ſee no change in providence,
therefore where is the promiſe of Chriſts coming? they
ſcoffed at Chriſt, that Chriſt was a contemptible man
in this world; this is the anſwer in the <hi>7 verſ. But the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the earth which are now, by the ſame word are
kept in ſtore reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgement
and Perdition of ungodly men. Peter</hi> ſpeakes directly
that the time of Chriſts coming (which they ſcoffed at)
was not the time of the thouſand yeares, but of the day
of judgment; therefore this coming here that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks
of cannot be meant of a thouſand years before the day of

            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve, that it is ſaid here that before this
new Earth is, the world ſhall bee burnt with Fire, the
Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a noyſe, &amp;c. Now before
a thouſand yeares there is no ſuch thing, as it is before the
day of Judgement. The burning of that world is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to judge the world, to his laſt coming, and not to any other
coming,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 2. For your ſelves know perfectly that
the day of the Lord cometh as a Thiefe in the Night. <hi>But
if Chriſt ſhould come to reigne upon the Earth, then he
cometh viſible, and obſervable,</hi> Mat. 33. 44. But know
this, that if the good man of the houſe had knowne in what
watch the Thiefe would come, hee would have watched
and would not have ſuffered his houſe to bee broken up.
<hi>Therefore be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an houre, as you

               <hi>A third Scripture, and that they deeme to have ſome
ſtrength in too; In</hi> Daniel 2. 44. And in the daies of

which ſhall never bee deſtroyed, and the Kingdome ſhall
not bee left to other People, but it ſhall breake in pieces,
and conſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for

            <p>Now beloved, to give you the ſcope of the Text, take
theſe anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It is true that a Kingdome is given by God to
Jeſus Chriſt, and that Kingdome was given by God to
Chriſt while hee was here upon the Earth in the forme
of a ſervant, and this <hi>Luke</hi> tells you, <hi>Chap. 1. verſ. 32, 33.
Hee ſhall bee great, and ſhall bee called the Son of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of
his Father David, and hee ſhall reigne over the houſe of</hi>
Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his Kingdome there ſhall be no end.</hi> So
that Jeſus Chriſt had a Kingdom, and he is now King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid here, that this Kingdome it was
begun in the daies of thoſe Kings. Now whoſe daies
doth this Text ſpeake of? It ſpeakes of thoſe that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Kingdome, who overcame the <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Perſians,</hi> it was divided betweene <hi>Ptolomy Lagides</hi> King
of <hi>Egypt, Zeleuchus</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> In that time Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt did ſet up a Kingdome, for he was born King
of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is apparent that this cannot bee referred to
Chriſts Kingdom in this world for a thouſand yeares. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it cannot bee ſaid that it ſhould bee a Kingdome for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96119:101"/>
ever and ever, for a Kingdome for a thouſand yeares
cannot bee ſaid to bee a Kingdome for ever and
ever, but it is ſaid in Daniel, <hi>It ſhall bee for ever and
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth Scripture, is in <hi>Eph. 5. 5. For this yee know,
that no Whoremonger, nor Uncleane perſon, nor Covetous
Man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> And this <hi>Text Gerrard</hi> quotes
and doth well reſolve it, they ſay there is not only a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God that is Heaven, but the Scripture doth
make mention of a Kingdome of Chriſt, as a Kingdome
of God; Therefore they build on this Chriſts reigne, and
of having a Kingdome here upon earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Firſt, I anſwer, it is true, Chriſt hath a Kingdome,
but hee ſaith expreſly, that</hi> his Kingdome is not of this
world, John 18. 36. Jeſus anſwered, my Kingdom is not of
this world. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though it be ſaid here that there is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this Kingdome of Chriſt Interpreters refer
it to the ſame with the Kingdome of God, and to bee
meant exegetically.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth Text they have, is in <hi>Mat. 26. 29. But I ſay
unto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the
Vine, untill that day when I drinke it new with you in my
Fathers Kingdome. Alſted</hi> quotes, from thence they
gather, it cannot bee meant of Heaven, why? becauſe
there is no eating and drinking there; here is a promiſe
by Jeſus Chriſt, to come to them no more, till he would
drinke with them Wine in his Fathers Kingdome, and
it cannot bee unleſſe Chriſt doth come in perſon amongſt
his people; and have a Kingdome to eat and drinke
with his people in this World. This they ſtand much
upon.</p>
            <p>Take theſe clear anſwers to theſe Quotations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this cannot be meant of a Kingdome in this world
for a thouſand yeares, my reaſon is this, becauſe the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96119:101"/>
Kingdome which is Chriſts perſonall reigne, ſhould bee
called Chriſts Kingdome, and not his Fathers Kingdom,
it ſhould have been called my Kingdome, and not my

give.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, obſerve this, that this may referre to that
time between Chriſts Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, for
after Chriſt did riſe from the dead, you know hee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
forty daies upon the Earth, and the Scripture tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
you, in <hi>Luke 24. 42. And they gave him a piece of broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fiſh, and of a hony-combe, and hee tooke it and did

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Firſt, it is built on the immutability of Gods decree</hi>
Acts 17. 31. Becauſe hee hath appointed a day, in the
which hee will judge the World in righteouſneſſe, by that
man whom he hath ordained, wherof he hath given aſſurance
unto all men, in that hee hath raiſed him from the Dead.
<hi>The immutability of Gods decree doth prove the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Chriſts coming, God hath appointed a day in which
he will judge the world.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly, the certainty doth ſtand upon the infallibility</hi>
               <hi>of Chriſts promiſe,</hi> Mat. 26. 64. Jeſus ſaith unto him,
Thou haſt ſaid, nevertheleſſe I ſay unto you, Hereafter
ſhall yee ſee the Sonne of man ſitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven, <hi>there is
Chriſts promiſe, to which three of the Evangeliſts doe
concurre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the certainty of his coming is grounded upon
the impartiality of his Juſtice, here every man hath not
right, and in <hi>Solomons,</hi> phraſe, <hi>a juſt man periſheth in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe,
and a wicked man prolongeth his dayes in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe;</hi>
therefore to ſhew Gods impartiality; there muſt
bee a coming of the Sonne of man to judge the world
righteouſly. The Doctrine of Chriſts coming is impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Atheiſts, therefore you read what <hi>Peter</hi> tells
you, <hi>2 Peter 3. 3, 4. Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall
come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own lusts
and ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming? For ſince
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96119:103"/>
the Fathers fell aſleepe, all things continue as they were from
the beginning of the Creation.</hi> And wee read of the men
of <hi>Athens,</hi> they queſtioned this, and would not beleeve
this, For Chriſt coming to judge the world, <hi>Acts 17.
32. And when they heard of the Reſurrection of the dead,
ſome mocked, and others ſaid, wee will heare thee againe
of this matter.</hi> Of old time, in the times of Jeſus Chriſt
or ſoone after, men did mocke at this Doctrine, that the
dead ſhall riſe, and Chriſt ſhould come to judge both the
quick and the dead; Herein <hi>Gerrard,</hi> reckons up abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Sects, as the <hi>Floriani,</hi> the <hi>Doſithiani,</hi> the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machiani,</hi>
and many others: Indeed there is one Scripture
that theſe Atheiſts do abuſe in making it to deny the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt to judgement, <hi>Joh. 8. 15. Ye judge after the
fleſh, I judge no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Beloved, to this Text that they make uſe of, to
to ſhake this great Pillar of our hopes, the coming of
Chriſt againe, take theſe two Anſwers, when
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I judge no man,</hi> that is, I judge no man with
a raſh and heady judgement, as you judge men that are not
of your Opinion, you judge things raſhly and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly,
but I judge no man as you doe, ſo <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in his
36. Tract on <hi>John,</hi> gives it to bee the ſence of the place,
it doth not exclude Chriſt from judging the world at the
laſt day, but from judging of men as the Phariſees, to wit,
raſhly and inconſideratly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſt doth here ſpeake, what was not the
end of his firſt coming in the fleſh, but the end of his
ſecond coming was to judge all men, but <hi>I judge no man,</hi>
that is, it was not the intent or the end of my firſt coming
in the fleſh to judge men, <hi>John 3.</hi> When God ſent his
Sonne to bee borne of a Virgin, hee did not ſend him
to judge the world, but to ſave the world, hee reſerved
his judging of the world till his laſt coming. <hi>John 12. 47,
48. And if any man heare my words, and beleeve not,
I judge him not, for I come not to judge the world, but to
ſave the world. Hee that rejecteth mee, and receiveth not
my words, hath one that judgeth him, the words that I
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96119:103"/>
have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> The
end of my firſt coming was not to judge, it was to bee
judged; and to be condemned by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and to
dye the curſed death. And that is the end of Chriſts
firſt coming, that is the firſt particular, <hi>hee ſhall come
certainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſhal not only come <hi>certainly,</hi> but he ſhal
come <hi>perſonally;</hi> It was the great miſtake of <hi>Origen,</hi>
though hee holds for the coming of Chriſt againe, that
hee pleades for the coming of Chriſt in ſpirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Text where it is ſaid, <hi>you shall ſee the Sonne
of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, Origen</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
by the Cloudes, to bee the <hi>Saints,</hi> becauſe
it is mentioned in Scripture, that the <hi>Beleevers</hi>
are called <hi>a cloud of witneſſes.</hi> Now this is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the whole letter of the Bible, and turne all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into an Allegory and Metaphoricall ſenſe; Now in
oppoſition of that, I lay downe a ſecond property, that
Chriſts coming ſhall bee a perſonall coming out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but the Scripture doth not ſpeake of Chriſts coming
on the Earth, but no further then the Aire, Chriſt in
his Body ſhall come perſonally out of Heaven. Now to
prove this ſecond property, or ſecond manner or way of
Chriſts coming, there are two Texts of Scripture to
confirme it. <hi>1 Theſſ. 4. 17. Then wee which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and remaine, ſhall bee caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meete the Lord in the Aire, and ſo
ſhall wee ever bee with the Lord,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>For the Lord
himſelfe ſhall deſcend with a ſhout from Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. If it
had been Chriſt in his ſpirit, then it would have been ſaid,
the Lord by his ſpirit ſhall deſcend, <hi>But the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout,</hi> it notes his
perſonall coming out of Heaven, that whereas Jeſus
Chriſt had a perſonall tranſlation, and as Chriſt had a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Elevation, he was in the eyes of his Diſciples lifted
up, ſo Chriſt ſhall bodily deſcend and come out from
Heaven, the Lord himſelfe, &amp;c. Therefore it cannot
bee the Lord by his ſpirit, <hi>Acts 1. 11. Which alſo ſaid,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96119:104"/>
yee men of Galilee, why ſtand yee gazing up into Heaven?
This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven,
ſhall ſo come in like manner, as yee have ſeen him goe into
Heaven.</hi> The ſame Jeſus that you ſaw Aſcend, ſhall
deſcend, ſo that it cannot bee Chriſt in his ſpirit, but in
his perſon. I onely mention this to confute thoſe that
follow the conceit of <hi>Origen,</hi> meerly to make Chriſts
coming to be but a ſpiritual coming, a coming in the hearts
of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his coming it ſhall be viſibly, <hi>Acts 1. 11. This
ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven ſhall
ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi>
That as Chriſts going up to Heaven bodily was viſible,
ſo Chriſts coming out of Heaven ſhall be viſible <hi>Mat. 26.
64. Hereafter ſhall yee ſee the Sonne of man ſitting on
the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds.</hi> Indeed
Chriſt did riſe inviſibly, for no man ſaw Chriſt riſe from
the dead, but Chriſt ſhall deſcend viſibly, <hi>you shall ſee
the Sonne of man, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 24. 30. <hi>And then shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
the ſigne of the Sonne of man in Heaven, and then
shall all the Tribes of the Earth mourne, and they shall ſee
the Sonne of man coming in the clouds of Heaven with
power and great glory.</hi> All men ſhall ſee the glory of
Jeſus Chriſt, the wicked ſhall ſee him to their Amazement
and conſternation, and the godly ſhall ſee him to their joy
and conſolation,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Chriſts coming ſhall bee <hi>gloriouſly,</hi> and
there ſhall bee many things that ſhall make the coming of
Chriſt to bee a glorious coming, hee ſhall come in the
clouds, theſe glorious bodies ſhall bee the triumphant
and ſwift Chariots of the ſonne of God, wherein hee will
come to judge the world; and his Atendance ſhall make
him glorious, <hi>Daniel 7. 10. A fiery ſtreame iſſued, and
came forth from before him, thouſand thouſands miniſtred
unto him; and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before
him, the judgement was ſet, and the bookes where opened,</hi>
Jude 14. <hi>and</hi> Enoch <hi>alſo the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
of theſe, ſaying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96119:104"/>
thouſand of his Saints.</hi> And in <hi>2 Theſſ. 1. 7. And to you
who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus
ſhall bee revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi>
O then behold the clouds to be the Triumphant Chariots
of Chriſt, the Innumerable company of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to bee attendants on the perſon of Chriſt to come
to judge the world, and that is the reaſon that hee is
called ſo glorious, <hi>Mat. 24. 30. And they ſhall ſee the
Sonne of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with power
and great glory.</hi> Mat. 16. 27. <hi>For the Sonne of man ſhall
come in the glory of his Father with his Angels.</hi> Luk. 9. 26.
<hi>For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, of him
ſhall the Sonne of man bee aſhamed, when hee ſhall come in
his own glory, &amp; in his Fathers, and of the Holy Angels.</hi> And
that is the reaſon of that Epithet given to Chriſts coming
<hi>Titus 2. 13. Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> Now beloved, Chriſts coming to have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
or this manner, the reaſon muſt bee to diſtinguiſh
his ſecond coming from his firſt coming; to take off the
contempt and reproach that was on Jeſus Chriſt in
his firſt coming, and he ſhall come in glory in the ſecond
coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, wee read in Scripture, that Chriſts firſt coming
it was in the forme of a ſervant, <hi>Phil. 2. 7. But made
himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke upon him the forme of
a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men.</hi> Now in the
ſecond coming, hee comes with that glory and Majeſty
of a King. In the firſt coming, hee had no reaſonable
creature to attend him, at the ſecond coming hee ſhall
have all the Saints and Angels in Heaven to attend
him. At his firſt coming hee was ſwadled with ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
bands, but at this ſecond coming he ſhall be as it were
cloathed with the Clouds of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Againe, his firſt coming it was in diſhonour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
every Traveller had more honour then Jeſus
Chriſt, for the Inne was for every Traveller, but there
was no roome for Chriſt there, hee was borne in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96119:105"/>
but his ſecond coming ſhall bee in great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Againe, in his firſt coming, Chriſt repreſenting the
perſons of the Elect came with ſin imputed to him, and
was the greateſt Beggar in the world, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith and
the greateſt ſinner in the world, not by way of inherence
but by way of imputation; therefore <hi>Luther</hi> calleth him
<hi>Peccator maximus,</hi> the greateſt ſinner: Chriſt incoming
into the the world, had all the ſinnes of the Elect of God
imputed to him; ſo hee came as a ſinner, as an evill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
though hee was not ſo, yet hee was looked upon
as ſo; But the ſecond time, hee ſhall come without
ſinne, hee ſhall not have our ſinnes by imputation caſt on
him, becauſe when hee comes againe hee ſhall make a
totall Abolition of ſinne; Therefore, there needs no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pution
of our ſinnes upon Jeſus Chriſt. Thus you have
a fourth way of his coming, he ſhall come <hi>Gloriouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>A fifth way of Chriſts coming againe, is this, he ſhall
come</hi> terribly; <hi>In</hi> Iſaiah 13. 9. Behold the day of the
Lord cometh, cruell both with wrath and fierce Anger, to
lay the Land deſolate, and hee ſhall deſtroy the ſinners
thereof out of it. <hi>Revel. 6. 17.</hi> For the great day of his
wrath is come, and who ſhall bee able to ſtand? <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Jeſus Chriſt, it is a terrible coming, that is a fifth
way of his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly and laſtly, Chriſt ſhall come <hi>unexpectedly;</hi>
though it is true, there ſhall be immediate warnings of
his coming, as the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken, the
Sun, Moon, and Starrs ſhall bee darkned, but that ſhall
bee but a little before his coming: but beloved, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt ſhall bee when men are not aware of it, as
in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> men were eating and drinking, and
marrying and giving in marriage when the flood come
and deſtoyed them, ſo ſhall the Sonne of man come.
Chriſts coming ſhall then bee to burne all with fire,
when men ſhall bee eating and drinking, poſſeſſing, and
adding muck to muck, when men are ſecure and never
thinke of Chriſts coming to burn all with fire; then the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96119:105"/>
powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken, and the world be ſet on
fire. Hence it is that you read in Scripture in five or
ſix places, <hi>Chriſts coming it ſhall be as a Thiefe in the night;</hi>
a Thiefe will come in the dead time of the Night, as
Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, in <hi>Luke 21. 34.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt it is an unexpected coming, thus you have ſix
Particulars of Chriſts coming.</p>

Doctrine, what great comfort it will afford to Godly
men, but remember the word is Salt alſo, and it is of a
ſmart efficacy to terrifie and fret the conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now the Doctrine of Chriſts coming, it is a terrible
Doctrine in theſe four things.</p>
            <p>To all wicked men Chriſts coming again it is a terrible
Doctrine, becauſe firſt al the ſecretſt ſins that ever a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

manifeſt to all. I confeſſe it is a conteſt among learned
men, whether the ſinnes of good men as well as bad
ſhall not be known, and there are ſtrong arguments that
all ſhall be made known, but the Scripture is full in this,
that at the day of Judgement, the ſinnes that a wicked
man hath done in this world, ſhall bee publiſhed to
all the Saints and Angels in Heaven, and all the men
that were on Earth. It may bee thou goeſt for an honeſt

been ſo, or thou haſt deceived in thy Trade, why

thy deceit and uncleannes; it is built upon that Text, <hi>Luk.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſts coming it ſhall bee dreadfull
in regard of thy Separation from all the Elect of God. In

and hee ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd

moreover, I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judgement,
that wickedneſſe was there; and the place of righteouſneſs,
that iniquity was there. I ſaid in my heart, God ſhall
judge the righteous, and the wicked, for there is a time
for every purpoſe, and every worke.</hi> That is, to judge
every purpoſe and every worke. When God ſhall come

there, and the deferring of the cauſe of the poor is there,</hi>
woe bee to all Oppreſſions of the poore, and grinding
their Faces in Courts of Judicature, many whereof are

ſhall come to judge things that men will not judge; men

to all them, who to ſave their worldly advantage, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to profeſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt. O! Chriſts
coming is a dreadfull time to theſe. In <hi>Mark 8. 38. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
therefore ſhall bee aſhamed of mee and of my words,
in this Adulterous and ſinfull Generation, of him alſo shall
the Son of man bee ashamed, when hee cometh in the glory

here are two anſwers to an Objection in theſe words.
Firſt, men might ſay, why bleſſed Jeſus, who would
bee aſhamed of thee? if Chriſt were on the Earth wee

though you might not bee ashamed of Chriſts perſon, yet
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96119:107"/>
you might bee ashamed of his words. Then men may
Object and ſay, why truly if it were a peaceable time, a

in a wicked place, and among a wicked people, will not
Chriſt bear with us, to hold down our heads a little, and
to ſleep in a whole Skin? no, ſaith <hi>Chriſt, whoſoever shall

thou marke one ſcripture, <hi>1 Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him bee Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
There is much of Gods mind in this darke expreſſion,
<hi>If any man love not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him bee an
accurſed man,</hi> that is the meaning of the word <hi>Anathema;</hi>
but the other word <hi>Maranatha,</hi> it is a word compounded
of two words, and it beares this ſenſe, <hi>Maran</hi> ſignifies
a <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Atha</hi> ſignifies <hi>venit, hee comes;</hi> ſo then when
the Scripture ſaith, <hi>hee that loves not the Lord Jeſus

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96119:107"/>
Atha,</hi> when the Lord Jeſus ſhall come to judge the

point touching the Reſurrection of mans Body,
that not onely the Soule ſhall goe to Heaven, but alſo
the bodies of the godly men ſhall goe to Heaven, Chriſt
ſhal come out of heaven for this end, to receive the bodies
as well as the Soules unto himſelfe. <hi>I will come again and
receive you unto my ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſome difference betweene a few Interpreters
touching the ſenſe of theſe words; one carrieth it this
way; that here the promiſe of Chriſts coming made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before hee was to die, referreth not to the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but they referre it to that forty daies that hee was
upon the Earth, after his reſurrection to the Aſcenſion;
they ſay, that this promiſe was accompliſhed, when
Chriſt after his reſurrection did come to his Diſciples, and
did eate a broyled Fiſh with them, and ſtayed forty
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96119:109"/>
daies with them. Why? what comfort would this bee to
the Diſciples to thinke of Chriſts going away and coming
againe, and ſtay but forty daies, and then bee ſeen no
more? this would have made them the more ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that they ſhould never have ſeen him more.
Here are two or three reaſons from the Text, why that
cannot bee the ſenſe of the place, becauſe here was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
before that hee was going to his Fathers Houſe to
receive them there; Now that living upon the Earth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
daies after his Reſurrection, cannot bee his Fathers
Houſe; this cannot therefore bee meant of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againe at that time to them. Againe, that it is ſaid,
where hee was to goe; hee was to prepare a place for
them, now if his meaning had been that hee would come
againe at forty daies, it ſhould have been an Earthly
place that hee had prepared for them: But the current
of Interpreters, ſeeing the weakneſſe of that, gives ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſequent reaſons why it muſt neceſſarily be referred
to Chriſts laſt coming, and everlaſting receiving of them,
when the Body ſhall bee raiſed, and at that coming he
hath promiſed the Elect, that hee will receive them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelfe; as if hee ſhould have ſaid, though I leave
your bodies behind mee in the world for a ſeaſon, though
they may bee mangled and maſſacred by cruell perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and though you may bee without my bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
for a while, yet I doe not goe to Heaven to ſtay
there for ever, but I promiſe you, I will come againe,
and then I will take you into Heaven with mee. They
would faine have had Chriſt to have received them into
Heaven, and that they might have gone with him. The
Diſciples when they heard Chriſt ſpeake of going to his
Fathers houſe, they were all on fire to go with Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven: O no, ſaith Chriſt, I will come againe to
judge the world, and then I will receive your very
bodies into Heaven with mee, that as my body is
in Heaven, ſo your bodies ſhall bee there alſo with
me.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation is this, that it is one great end of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96119:109"/>
Chriſts coming again for to receive the bodies of all the
Elect unto himſelfe into Heaven with him, <hi>I come again
and receive you unto my ſelfe.</hi> I ſhall not follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

ſhall onely handle this point practically, in ſhewing you
what the happineſſe of the Elect of God is in their bodies

I knew a man in Chriſt, above fourteene yeares agoe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I
cannot tell, God knoweth, ſuch an one caught up to the

lawfull for a man to utter. <hi>So that the Apoſtle by</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
<hi>doth meane</hi> Heaven, Revel. 2. 7. Hee that hath an eare
let him heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches; To

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it cannot be any Earthly Paradiſe, as the Paradiſe
<hi>Adam</hi> was in before his fall, for the Earthly Paradiſe was
deſtroyed by the Flood, therfore of neceſſity when Chriſt
tells the thiefe, <hi>To day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe,</hi>
it muſt referre to the thiefes going to Heaven at that day

               <hi>A ſecond inſtance it is in</hi> Luke 16. 22. And it came
to paſſe that the Begger dyed, and was carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into Ahrahams boſom; the rich man alſo dyed and was
buried. <hi>This is another inſtance, that the ſouls of the elect
after death they goe to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Evaſions made upon this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they ſay, that this Text it is a parable, and not an
Hiſtoricall Narration.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, though ſome men doe ſay it is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet many ſay it is a Hiſtory. <hi>Jerome</hi> and many
following him doth give many arguments to prove, that
it was a Hiſtory, and not a parable. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> is
confident that this is an exact Hiſtory of what was really
done; And <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth quote <hi>Tertullian;</hi> ſaith
hee, <hi>Tertullian</hi> is ſo confident that this is a Hiſtory, that
hee undertakes to tell you who were the men, ſaith hee,
the Rich man was <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Beggar was <hi>John the
Baptiſt.</hi> But Suppoſe it be a parable and not a Hiſtory, yet
parables doe carry the reſemblance of truth, parables take
their Foundations from truth, that there are ſome men in
Hell, &amp; ſome men in Heaven, that in Hell there is torment
and in heaven there is joy, that as the beggar went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
after death, ſo ſhall the godly, and as the rich man
went to Hell, ſo ſhall all the wicked.</p>
            <p>The other Evaſion is this, that this beggar is ſaid to be
carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; I anſwer, Firſt, it is
more then probable that <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome is Heaven;
now <hi>Abraham</hi> being in heaven all his children are in
Heaven, that are in his boſome: that is the anſwer that
<hi>Gerrard</hi> gives.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is ſaid, that they are carried by Angels into
<hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom muſt be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96119:111"/>
in Heaven: certainly the good Angels carry a good ſoule
into Heaven, and the wicked Angels carry a damned
ſoule into Hell, and thus you have two inſtances, that
immediately after death the ſoules of the Elect go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third inſtance is in <hi>Mat. 22. 31, 32. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <hi>the Reſurrection of the dead, have you not read that
which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God
of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob,
<hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> I argue
from that inſtance that therfore <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>
were living at that time, though not in their bodies; if you
marke the reaſon of that Text, it was not to prove a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the body only, which the <hi>Sadduces</hi> deny, but alſo
to prove the immortality of the ſoule. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Spirits and Angels too, <hi>Acts 23. 8. For the</hi> Sadduces
<hi>ſay that there is no Reſurrection, neither Angell nor Spirit,
but the Phariſees confeſſe both.</hi> Chriſt doth prove that
there ſhall bee a Reſurrection of the body, and hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſes
proves that the ſoule doth not dye when the body
dyeth. Indeed there is a quotation that I have read of
a learned man that doth make uſe of this inſtance, <hi>Gen.
25. 8. Then</hi> Abraham <hi>gave up the ghoſt, and dyed in a
good old age, an old man, and full of yeares, and was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
to his people.</hi> Abraham was not gathered to his
Fathers, nor to be gathered in the grave where his fore-fathers
were, how then can this be true that the Scripture
ſaith, <hi>Abraham was gathered unto his Fathers?</hi> Divines ſay,
it muſt be in his ſoule, that <hi>Abraham</hi> went to heaven as
his godly fore-fathers went, that is the meaning of that
phraſe, his ſoule was to be bound up in the bundle of Life,
to go to Heaven as their fore-fathers did. And thus much
for particular inſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond way to prove that the ſoules of the Elect
men goe to Heaven immediately after death; It is by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
expreſſions in Scripture. Two generall paſſages,
one is in <hi>Heb. 12. 23. To the generall Aſſembly, and
Church of the first borne, which are writen in Heaven,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96119:112"/>
and to God the judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt men
made perfect:</hi> thence I argue, that Apoſtle makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and proves that there were the Spirits of juſt men
made perfect; Now if their Soules did periſh with their
bodies, then the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, that their Spirits are
annihilated with the body, but it is <hi>the ſpirits of juſt
men made perfect;</hi> The Scripture takes notice in generall
expreſſions that juſt men have their Soules made perfect.
And then in <hi>Eccle. 12. 7. Then ſhall the duſt returne to the
Earth, as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who
gave it.</hi> Marke, here are two things</p>
            <p>Here is the end of Godly men, <hi>the body ſhall goe to the
duſt, and the ſoule to God.</hi> Then the time when it ſhal be is,
when that man goeth to his long home, when the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the houſe ſhall tremble, that is the hands, and
armes; and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelves, that is,
the feet and the thighs; and the grinders ſhall ceaſe, that
is, the teeth; and they that looke out at the windowes
ſhall bee darkened, that is, the eyes; when nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
and the body periſheth by Diſeaſes and dyes, <hi>then
ſhall the body go to the duſt, and the Spirit to God that gave
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I ſhall prove it to you from expreſſe paſſages
in the Scripture that doe confirme this, that the ſoules
of the Elect after death before Chriſts coming are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into heaven, for this I will give foure or five ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>The firſt is in</hi> Iohn 6. 40. And this is the will of him

beleeveth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe
him up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>Here are two diſtinct promiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a promiſe of everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a promiſe of raiſing up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a promiſe of everlaſting life is made diſtinct from
the other. Divines ſay, that before the raiſing up at the laſt

the laſt day, and his body ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt
day</p>
            <p>

Another Text is in <hi>Luke 16. 9. And I ſay unto you,
make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that when yee faile, they may receive you into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
habitations. Chemnitius</hi> makes great uſe of this
Text to prove what I am now arguing for, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after death, the ſoule of an Elect man is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into Heaven. Marke, <hi>make you friends of the
Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, of your wealth, called
ſo either becauſe it is unrighteouſly gotten, or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
kept; uſe your wealth well, <hi>that when you die you may
bee received into everlaſting habitations.</hi> It is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
whether it bee referred to Angels, or to the poor
which ſhall pray for us that wee bee received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but ſaith <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> uſe your wealth well, that
you may bee received into everlaſting habitations, upon
your failing, upon dying the Lord receives the Elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
everlaſting habitations. This <hi>Chemnitius</hi> doth build
on, that the ſoule doth goe to Heaven immediately after
Death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third Scripture is in <hi>Phil. 3. 23. For I am in a ſtrait</hi>
               <hi>betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to bee with
Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> The Apoſtle doth Conjoyne
theſe two concluſions, a departing out of the world, out
of this life, and a deſire to be with Jeſus Chriſt, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
no middle place for a good ſoul to goe to, he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
no <hi>Purgatory,</hi> nor <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe a fourth Text you have in <hi>2 Cor. 6. 8,
9. Therefore wee are alwaies confident, knowing that
whilſt wee are at home in the body, wee are abſent from the
Lord.</hi> Wee are confident I ſay, and willing rather to
be abſent from the body, and to bee preſent with the
Lord; wherefore wee labour, that whether preſent
or abſent, wee may be accepted of him. Marke, the
Apoſtle deſires, to be abſent from the body, and to bee
preſent with the Lord, ſo that the ſoule is preſent with
the Lord, whileſt abſent from the body.</p>
            <p>Then againe, that Prayer of <hi>Stephen</hi> proves it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in <hi>Acts 7. 59. And they stoned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96119:113"/>
upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> It
had been uncomfortable for him to have thought that he
ſhould have been ſtoned for Jeſus Chriſt and it muſt have
been above 1600 yeares before Chriſt ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his ſoule, but hee prayed, <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my ſoule,</hi> which hee would not have done, if hee
had not beleeved that his ſoul would have been received
by Jeſus Chriſt immediately after death.</p>
            <p>And thus I leave thoſe Scriptures to confirme you in
this, that the ſoule doth not ſleep in the body, but at
the departure from the body it doth immediately go to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I prove it to you by ſhewing thoſe groſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
and inconveniencies that will ariſe, in caſe it
ſhould bee denyed that God doth not receive the
ſoule of any Elect man, till he doth come to judge the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it will follow that the godly will bee in a worſe
condition after they are dead, then they were in when
they were alive, for when they were alive, to live is
Chriſt, Chriſt dwelt in their hearts by Faith; Now if
the ſoule doth ſleep with the body, and periſh with the
body, then Chriſt doth not live in them, Chriſt doth not
dwell there by Faith, ſo that this would be uncomfortable
that a beleever after death ſhould bee in a worſe condition
then during this life, for here hee lives in Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, then it wil follow, that God the Father would be
more cruell to his people, then he would have other men be
to their ſervants which have done their worke. Marke that
Text, <hi>Levit. 19. 13. Thou ſhalt not defraud thy Neighbour,
neither rob him, the wages of him that is hired ſhall not abide
with thee all night untill the morning.</hi> That the Maſter was
not to keep the hire of the Labourer long from him, that
the Maſter ſhould not keep the ſervants wages long from
him; Now will the great God keep from you, who are
his ſervants, that have ſerved him here in this world, and
have done him faithfull ſervice, any reward till his laſt
coming? No, but when you have ended your life, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96119:113"/>
done your worke; you receive your wages, when your
worke is done, you have your reward.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve this, if this ſhould bee true that the
ſoules of the Elect men doe not goe to Heaven after
death, then it will follow that the ſoules of wicked
men doe not goe to Hell after death, and how repugnant
this is to the Scripture you well know, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> That <hi>the men of</hi> Sodome
<hi>and</hi> Gomor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ha <hi>ſuffered the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi>
And of Judas, <hi>Acts 25. That hee may take part of
this miniſtery, and Apoſtle-ſhip, from which</hi> Judas <hi>by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
fell, that hee might goe to his owne place.</hi> I could
give you a multitude of inſtances where it is ſhewn the
wicked are in Hell, <hi>1 Pet. 3. 19, 20. By which alſo he went
and preached unto the Spirits in Priſon.</hi> Which <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of
God waiting in the daies of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Arke was a
preparing, wherein few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaved by
water.</hi> To ſay that a godly man doth not goe to
Heaven immediately after death, it will follow that
a wicked man doth not goe to Hell immediately after
death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it would follow, that there ſhould be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels in Heaven and no ſaints, whereas the ſcripture
ſaith expreſly, that <hi>Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven with his
Saints;</hi> and wee read in Scripture, that there are <hi>the
Spirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> as well as <hi>the innumerable
company of Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, this would follow that it would bee a great
diſcomfort to a godly man on his death-bed, to think he
ſhould bee ſo many hundred yeares ſoule and body in the
grave before Chriſt would bring him to Heaven; it would
bee a very uncomfortable Doctrine for a man to thinke
on, that I ſhall die like a beaſt, that my ſoule after death
ſhall not bee taken up into Heaven. And thus I have
proved that immediately after the godly die, their ſoules
are received into heaven: I have proved it by pregnant
inſtances in the Scripture, by generall expreſſions in the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96119:114"/>
Scripture, and by thoſe expreſſe paſſages in Scripture,
and have given you thoſe abſurdities, that will ariſe in caſe

            <p>A word now from what hath been ſpoken. If it bee
that Chriſt doth receive thee, O thou beleever, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

Therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit,
which are Gods. <hi>Now the ſpirit of God having a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worke in the body as well as the ſoule; Therefore
the body muſt be raiſed up from the dead as well as the
ſoule; and this the Scripture makes an Argument of
the reſurrection in</hi> Rom. 8. 11. But if the ſpirit of him that
raiſed up Ieſus from the dead, dwell in you, hee that
raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. <hi>So that ſpirit
that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, if that dwelleth in
you, and the graces of the ſpirit, that ſpirit ſhall quicken
your mortall bodies; therefore the bodies of the Elect
ſhall be raiſed from the dead and received into glory with
the ſoule.</hi>

co-operation with the ſoule in all gracious working, the
body ſhall bee partner with the Soule, being received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the body doth co-operate with
the Soule, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. For if yee live after the fleſh yee
ſhall die, but if yee through the ſpirit doe mortifie the deeds
of the fleſh, yee ſhall live,</hi> Now being that the godly doe
mortifie the deeds of the body, and do expoſe their bodies
to tortures and torments for Jeſus Chriſt; now becauſe
the bodies of the Elect, doe co-operate with the ſoule
in good, therefore the body ſhall be co-partner with the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond query is this, but what benefit is it to the

when Chriſt comes?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in generall I ſhall ſay this to you, that the body
ſhall receive more glorious endowments then ever it
could bee capable to receive, and enjoy here in this

feature, yet when Chriſt comes to receive thy body, it
ſhall bee endowed better then now it is. <hi>Chryſostome</hi>

yet there is a more goodly luſtre put upon it. Thy body

            <p>And thus much onely in the generall; now to come to
particulars. I ſhall reſolve this queſtion in theſe ſix Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>There are ſix glorious endowments that the body ſhall
receive from Jeſus Chriſt, at his ſecond coming, when he
receives the body to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, from being a naturall body as it is now it ſhall
bee made by Chriſt a ſpirituall body, that is the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment,
thou ſhalt caſt off thy old Apparell of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
fleſh and blood, and ſhalt bee cloathed with robes
of glory; it is no contradiction to ſay a ſpirituall body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Apoſtle uſeth the expreſſion, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 44. It is
ſowne a naturall body, it is raiſed a ſpirituall body. There
is a naturall body, and there is a ſpirituall body.</hi> The
meaning is, the body as it lives here, is a naturall body,
needing naturall refreſhments; but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is
ſhall be raiſed a ſpirituall body,</hi> it ſhall have no more need
of naturall refreſhments, which the naturall body requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96119:116"/>
when it is a ſpirituall body it ſtands in no more need
of meat, no more need of drinke nor ſleep, and other
naturall refreſhments, it ſhall bee raiſed a ſpirituall body.
<hi>Mat, 22. 30. For in the reſurrection they neither Marry,
nor are given in Marriage, but are as the Angels of God
in Heaven.</hi> The Angels have no need of food, and ſtand
in no need of outward helps, <hi>Rev. 7. 15, 16. Therefore are
they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and
night in his Temple, and hee that ſitteth on the Throne
ſhall dwell among them, They ſhall hunger no more, neither
thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sunne light on them, nor
any heate.</hi> Therefore O beleeving ſoule, behold thy
happineſs of ſoule and body in glory; they ſhall bee no
more ſtanding in need of naturall refreſhments then ſpirits
doe; when the Scripture ſaith that your bodies ſhould
be received by Chriſt. The Platonick Philoſophers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
the body ſhall bee turned into a ſpirit, into a ghoſt,
or into winde or aire, but that is not the reaſon of it, it
ſhall bee of the ſame ſubſtance as it is upon the Earth, but
it ſhall be refined.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly the bodies of the Elect when Chriſt receiveth
them to himſelfe, of vile bodies, they ſhall bee made
beautifull, it may bee thou haſt ſome deformity, but Chriſt
ſhall refine that body, and new varniſh and make it
beautifull, <hi>Phil. 3. 21. Who ſhall change our vile body,
that it may bee faſhioned like his glorious body, according
to the working whereby hee is able even to ſubdue all things
unto himſelfe.</hi> The body of Chriſt is a beautifull body,
neither ſpot nor wrinckle, nor any ſuch thing in it; thy
body ſhall bee like Chriſts glorious Body, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 43.
It is ſowne in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory, it is ſown in

            <p>Now before I come to the Application, there are two
Objections which lye in the way. As in the primitive
times there were the Sadduces that held there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and after Chriſts time there was <hi>Hymeneus</hi>
and <hi>Philetus,</hi> which ſaid that the Reſurrection was paſt
already, and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was tainted with
this Error, if Chriſt be riſen from the dead, how ſay
ſome amongſt you, that there is no Reſurrection of the
dead? Now in the Primitive and Chriſts time, there
was this Opinion, that there was no Reſurrection of the
Body, and ſo made this meerely but a poeticall fiction,
and to be no reall and undoubted truth.</p>
            <p>The Scripture which they urge is this, you talke of
the Body being raiſed by Chriſt, how can this bee when
the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, the Body is made of fleſh
and blood, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 50. Now this I ſay Brethren, that
fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, neither
doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> Therefore if fleſh
and blood cannot come to Gods Kingdom, how then can
the Body come there.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I anſwer, it cannot bee the Apoſtles intent to
impugne the bodies riſing, for the drift of the whole
Chapter is to prove that the Body ſhall be raiſed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not imaginable that in one breath the Apoſtle
ſhould deny, and affirme the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Apoſtle doth underſtand by fleſh and
blood, the bodies of men as they have ſinfull infirmities,
cleaving to them in this world, the body as it is now a
ſinfull body, an infirme body, a weak mortall body as it is
now ſhal never come to Heaven; the generality of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

run this way, by fleſh and blood is underſtood the
bodies of men as lyable to ſinne, as in this world they ſhall
not be raiſed up they ſhall not come to Heaven but we
ſhall bee changed, <hi>we ſhall not all ſleep but bee changed,</hi>
the Apoſtle proves this, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 50, 51. Now this
I ſay Brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,
Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery, wee ſhall not all ſleep, but wee
ſhall all bee changed.</hi> Our corruptible Bodies ſhall not
come to Heaven as they are corruptible, but come to
Heaven by being incorruptible, <hi>but we ſhall all be changed,</hi>
that is, our Bodies ſhall be changed from being mortall,
corruptible, and being weake and ſinfull, to bee holy and
Immortall, ſo that fleſh and blood as now it is ſinfull,
corruptible, till changed and made glorious and pure, ſhall
not come to Heaven.</p>

               <hi>Second Text which they urge againſt the Body being

            <p>There is this reaſon that may ſeeme to be againſt the

being thus confounded? Suppoſe a Man bee drowned

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Inference is this, will Jeſus Chriſt at his
comign raiſe thy body, and receive thy whole man unto
himſelfe? Then learne to have a thirſting and longing
ſoule after the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt; doe not
deſire to continue here upon Barth, but to bee diſſolved
and to bee with Jeſus Chriſt. will any man bee grieved
for changing of an old ſute for a new? Death doth this,
thou haſt here an old rotten ragge of flesh about thee,
Chriſt will put a new ſute on thee; therefore the Apoſtle
calls it the deſire of the body to bee cloathed upon, wee
doe not deſire to bee in Heaven without Bodies, but wee
deſire to bee cloathed upon, with thoſe glorious endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where with the elect shall bee clad in glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore bee not unwilling to die, doe not be unwilling
to leave an old rotten Carcaſſe, a ſickly Body, a Diſeaſed
Body. Put a Bird into a Cage, though the Cage bee
made of Silver, of Gold, yet the Bird had rather flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
then be tied up in the Cage. Whileſt in the Body
thou art in a Cage, thou hadſt better have thy Body in a
glorified capacity then now it is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, bee not afraid nor unwilling to die, becauſe
thy Body shall bee changed by Death, if thy Body should
not die, it would never be a glorified Body; keep your
Corne in your Houſe, and you will never have a Crop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but caſt your Corne into the ground and let it die there;
ſaith the Apoſtle, that thou ſoweſt is never quickened till
it die, let your Body bee kept alive here in the world,
and it shall never be raiſed to glory; O do not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to die, becauſe death to an Elect man is as a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Corne in the Earth. As Corne doth rot in the ground

Fourthly, if this be true that Jeſus Chriſt will raiſe thy
Body unto glory, O then doe not abuſe theſe Bodies of
yours; they are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, theſe
Bodies of yours ſhall one day bee raiſed, and received by
Jeſus Chriſt. It is an argument that the Apoſtle raiſeth,
<hi>1 Cor. 6. 14, 15.</hi> verſ. <hi>And God hath both raiſed up the
Lord by his own Power; know ye not that your bodies are the
Members of Chriſt? ſhall I then take the members of Chriſt,
and make them the Members of Harlots? God forbid.</hi>
This is the Apoſtles Argument. The Apoſtle would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
againſt Adultery and Uncleanneſſe in the body, what
argument doth hee uſe? <hi>Know yee this, Chriſt will raiſe
up our bodies, and ſhall wee take theſe Members of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and make them the members of a Where?</hi> So then
Beloved, let the Doctrine of your Reſurrection, and of
your bodies being raiſed and received to Jeſus Chriſt,
provoke you that you doe not abſe your Bodies. He that
keeps company with a Harlot, ſinneth againſt his owne
Body, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 18. Flee Fornication, every ſinne that a
man doth, is without the Body, but hee that committeth
Fornication, ſinneth againſt his owne body.</hi> For a man
to lie and ſweare, it is againſt his Soule, but for a
man to bee uncleane, it is to ſinne againſt his Body; O
doe not die with an uncleane Body, with an Adulterous
Body, and doe not abuſe thy Body, doe not abuſe thoſe
Eyes of thine to bee windowes of luſt, that ſhall one day
behold Jeſus Chriſt; do not abuſe that body that muſt
have a ſweet communion with Chriſt in Heaven.</p>

            <p>Theſe words they note unto you the Event, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,
what ſhall follow upon Chriſts coming againe,
and receiving our bodies unto himſelfe at the laſt day.
The Event ſhall bee this, an everlaſting enjoyment of

in the preſent Tenſe, as if hee were in Heaven already;</hi>
John 3. 13, And no man hath aſcended up to Heaven,
but hee that came downe from Heaven, even the Sonne
of man which is in Heaven. <hi>Chriſt was not in Heaven,
hee was ſpeaking on Earth to them in his Perſon, in

I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given Mee, be

            </p>
            <p>Why doth Chriſt ſay that he is in Heaven, when yet he

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that Chriſt ſaith <hi>I am,</hi> denotes the certainty

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the ſuddenneſſe of it, Chriſt was ſhortly
to bee in Heaven; there was but one day betweene

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, which is the reaſon the <hi>Gerrard</hi> gives;
Chriſt doth expreſſe it in the preſent Tenſe, <hi>where I am,</hi>
though hee were on Earth, to ſhew that Chriſt was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God as well as man, and in regard of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hee was truly in Heaven, as in regard of his Human
Nature hee was on Earth. Thus much for the manner
of expreſſion, that <hi>where I am, there you may bee alſo;</hi>
the latter part is this, that they might be with Chriſt
where hee is.</p>
            <p>One thing obſerve, that in Scripture Language, there
is a great difference between Chriſts being with us, and
our being with Chriſt. That Chriſt is ſaid to be with us, doth
not denote a perſonall preſence, but a preſence by his

all things whatſoever I ſhall command you, and loe,
I am with you alwaies, even unto the end of the World.</hi> It
was not in perſon, for hee left them, but I am with you
in my bleſſings, in my Spirit, but when the Scripture
ſpeaketh of our being with Chriſt, it notes a perſonall
preſence, a being with Chriſt in perſon, Therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>I deſire to bee diſſolved and to bee with Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt
was with <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe Chriſt converted him, but <hi>Paul</hi>
was not with Chriſt, but deſired to bee diſſolved and to
bee with Chriſt, our being with the Lord it notes a
perſonall preſence, an enjoying of the preſence of the
Lord.</p>

               </label> The Obſervation is this; That Chriſt at his ſecond

This Doctrine it is out of the common place. Here in

Chriſts great, and laſt coming to receive the Elect unto

ſhall ſhew you the great bleſſedneſſe in this condition
in theſe eight or nine particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that you will be more happy in being preſent
with Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, then if you had been preſent
with <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate of Innocency; wee ſhould have
thought our ſelves happy, to be as <hi>Adam</hi> was, to have
had the immediate preſence of God, wee ſhould have
thought this a very happy and glorious Eſtate. Indeed
ſo it was, but now, to bee preſent with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
thou art more happy ten thouſand times, then if thou

with him in Innocency.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was made by God in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
hee was inſtated only into an earthly Paradiſe, but
now, thou being with Chriſt art ſtated into an everlaſting
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Adam</hi> was placed in Innocency; yet ſo as to
bee lyable to loſe that bleſſed and glorious condition hee
was in, and did loſe it, though he were a perfect Creature,
yet hee lay under a capacity to loſe all his excellency, but
when God brings thee to bee preſent with Jeſus
Chriſt, thou art inſtated into a Kingdome that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, thirdly, when hee was made by God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
hee enjoyed onely the ſociety of Beaſts on the
Earth, and Birds of the Ayre; but when God brings thee
where Chriſt is, hee doth inſtate thee into a condition
where God the Father, God the Son, and all the Saints
and Angels are thy companions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is another part of thy happineſſe by
being where Chriſt is, that thou ſhalt enjoy the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Chriſt in his Humane Nature; where Chriſt is
thou ſhalt bee, the meaning of that expreſſion is, <hi>John
17. 24. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96119:122"/>
this referres to ſeeing the Glory of Chriſts perſon in his
Humane Nature, not the glory of his God head, but
the Glory of his Man hood, that they may behold my
glorified body, the Glory of my Humane Nature,
that was ſo contemned, and ſo deſpiſed when
I was on the Earth; I beſeech thee let all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

ſee him as he is glorified in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third thing that makes much for the bleſſedneſſe of
the Elect, that in thy being preſent with Jeſus Chriſt,
God gives thee more honour then ever thou couldeſt bee
capable of in former time, God gives thee Glory by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of thy being with Jeſus Chriſt, a notable Text, <hi>Joh.

and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant bee; If
any man ſerve mee, him will my Father honour.</hi> That is,
where I ſhall bee in Heaven. Beloved, the time is now
of giving honour to God, and giving Glory to God, but
thy being where Chriſt is, God then gives thee Glory and
gives thee Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, thy happineſſe in being preſent with Chriſt
where hee is, is that thou ſhalt ſtand in no need of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96119:122"/>
beloved, here the higheſt growne Chriſtian,
and the ſtrongeſt Beleever in the World doth ſtand in
more need of Ordinances then a lame man doth of
Crutches to goe by; but when thou comeſt to have this
accompliſhment, that thou ſhalt bee where Chriſt is,
thou then ſtandeſt in no need of Ordinances, then what
needs the Candleſtick of Sermons; what needs the
Candleſtick of Preaching, and the Candleſtick of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when thou art preſent with Chriſt the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe;
there is no need of conduit pipes, when thou
art by the Fountain head, thou needſt no Ordinances,
the conduit pipes are the Ordinances, there is no need
of Ordinances any longer then thou art abſent from the
Fountaine, which is Jeſus Chriſt, the ceremoniall Law
is all Goſpell, it is a darke Goſpell, the Evangeliſts are the
explained Goſpel the ceremoniall Law is a darke Goſpell,
<hi>Exodus 25.</hi> Meaning the holy place; There was to be
golden Candleſticks which Typified the Preaching of

Diſhes, to wit Chriſts Interceſſion, this was only in the
holy place, but in the holy of holieſt, there was no Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
no Incenſe Diſhes there, to ſhew, that whileſt you
are on this ſide Heaven in the Church of God, you need
the Candleſtick, you need Preaching and praying; but
in the holy of holieſt there was none of this, to ſhew that
it was a Type of Heaven, and when Chriſt beings thee
there, then thou art above Ordinances, and never till then;
this is a Fourth particular.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Priviledg, of thy being where Chriſt is, is
this, that thou ſhalt have a full communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with Jeſus Chriſt in Perſon. Beloved, here wee
have our communion with Chriſt, but it is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
far different from that which we ſhall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it ſhall bee different in regard of the manner of its

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in regard of the meaſure of your enjoyment;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it differs in regard of its time and duration;
Here you doe enjoy Chriſt, it is true, but it is by fits and
ſtarts, you injoy him now in an Ordinance, but you
have interrupted fellowſhip and communion with Chriſt;
but when thou art with him in Heaven, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
in thy communion with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is different in regard of its expectation,
herein Heaven thou enjoyeſt Chriſt by way of of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, in regard of place, here there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of place betweene Chriſt and us, here wee enjoy
Chriſt, hee in Heaven and wee on Earth; but then we
ſhall enjoy Chriſt in one place, hee in Heaven and wee

if thou wert nearer Chriſt, thou ſhouldeſt ſee and know
more of his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, there ſhall bee a difference in regard of thy

in Heaven, they are ſaints and Angels, but on Earth,
though thou doeſt enjoy Chriſt, yet thou art inforc'd to

            <p>A ſixth particular is this, thy being preſent with Jeſus
