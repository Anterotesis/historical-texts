         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REader, by the Letter

which immediately here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
thou wilt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
with what <hi>craft,</hi> and
<hi>artifice,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
endeavour to ſeduce the
people of our <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and generally all of
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Rome.</hi> They tell
them, that they are out of
St. <hi>Peters Fold,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of neceſſity, in a ſtate

            </p>
            <p>The firſt greatneſs of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64850:3"/>
was founded in the <hi>eminency</hi>
of the City, and the <hi>conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>indulgence</hi> of ſome of
the <hi>Emperors.</hi> But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Popes,</hi> perceiving, that
what former Emperors <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
others, in ſucceeding
times, might <hi>revoke,</hi> pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Text Mat. 16. 18.
Tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> Thou art
<hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this Rock,

<hi>ſpiritual Monarchy,</hi> and the
claim of both <hi>Swords, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi>
as well as <hi>Spiritual;</hi>
or, at leaſt the <hi>Temporal</hi>
in order to the <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
And all <hi>Jeſuited Papiſts</hi> (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that ſubmit to the third Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran

minded) hold that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>excommunicated</hi> may be
<hi>rejected</hi> by their own <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
What good effects this

<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange that all <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>

King <hi>James</hi> of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

an inſtance may fall out,
wherein they will be forced
to renownce their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
either to their <hi>Pope,</hi> or

            </p>
            <p>Take heed therefore, if
thou art diſengaged from this
<hi>ſeduction,</hi> of coming near to
ſuch ſnares; and if thou art
(as alas too many of late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

            <p>That fearful inſtance of

            <p>I Received your Letter, and,
though I cannot deſpiſe the
<hi>zeal</hi> of your Charity, yet (I
thank God) that, through his
goodneſs, I can now diſcern the
<hi>errour</hi> of it. I wiſh (and truly,
I account my ſelf bound thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in requital of the care which
you profeſs for my Soul) that
you were your ſelf in as good a
way for Salvation, in reſpect of
your <hi>communion</hi> with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I am, upon the account
of my <hi>return</hi> to my dear <hi>Mother,</hi>
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since I ſaw you, I have a little
better conſidered the <hi>Articles</hi> of
our Church, and in them I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nothing commended to my
Faith, but what is either expreſly
conteined in the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
or deducible, by very good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64850:7"/>
from them. But I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well aſſured by thoſe, that
know it, that in ſome <hi>Councils</hi>
lately held by your <hi>Church,</hi> and
particularly that of <hi>Trent,</hi> there
are divers <hi>Canons</hi> (to which you
will expect my conſent) neither
agreeable to the Holy Scriptures,
nor conſonant to the purer ages
of the Church, and yet your <hi>Pope
Pius</hi> the Fourth, curſeth all that
are not of that Faith, and exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all from Salvation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not according to the <hi>Tenour</hi>
of them. Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> was a
Learned man, and he took pains
to examine the grounds of the
peremptory decree of that <hi>Pope;</hi>
the Book wherein he did it, is
called the <hi>Grand Impoſture of the
now Church of</hi> Rome. I pray per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
it <hi>heedfully</hi> and <hi>candidly,</hi> and
ſubmit to the truths conteined
therein.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>my promiſe in the Long
Gallery,</hi> whereof you re-mind
me, I confeſs my <hi>errour</hi> in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64850:7"/>
it; and I am told that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unlawful in the matter (I
mean to adhere to your <hi>corrupt
Church</hi>) my ſin of <hi>raſh engagement</hi>
would be heightned by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
whereas it is ſo far from
being any, to break it, that 'tis
my <hi>obligation</hi> ſo to do. <hi>David</hi>
raſhly ſwore to deſtroy all the
Males in <hi>Nabals</hi> Family, but, by
the good counſel of <hi>Abigail,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
broke his oath, than proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to add <hi>murder</hi> to his <hi>paſſion.</hi>
And truly, Sir, though you may
think it <hi>preſumption</hi> in me, to give
advice to a perſon of your <hi>calling</hi>
and <hi>gravity;</hi> yet when I conſider
that <hi>David,</hi> a great <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a
<hi>King</hi> then anointed, deſpiſed not
the good counſel of a <hi>woman,</hi>
but ſaid with all meekneſs, <hi>Bleſſed

(1 Sam.</hi> 25. 33.) I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that I prompt theſe <hi>intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
unto you, but rather <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi>
yet <hi>humbly</hi> requeſt you,
ay, and <hi>adjure</hi> you in the fear of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64850:8"/>
God, to break your engagement
to that <hi>peſtilent Society,</hi> to which,
perhaps you are as ſolemnly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the bond of an Oath, (for

            <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (I have heard) was

Both theſe came, by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

            <p>Sir, I deſire to emulate your
own Charity to my ſelf, and ſay
in your behalf, as you ſay in mine,
<hi>I ſhould be glad to ſuffer death, that
you would accept of life. No loſs
you ſay</hi> (and you ſay truly in it,
for you ſpeak in conformity to
the language of Chriſt himſelf,
<hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he
ſhould gain the whole World and
loſe his own Soul?) like the loſs of
a Soul.</hi> Precious it is to God,
and ſhould it be vile to our ſelves,
to whom the <hi>damage</hi> will be only
prejudicial? God the Father ſent
his Son to redeem it, God the
Son ſhed his blood to ranſom it,
and the Holy Spirit is plaſed to
ſeal it with <hi>his</hi> ſignature, as the
peculiar <hi>treaſure</hi> of God.</p>

Pen in the little Note, which you
ſent me; <hi>Sweet Jeſus, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
Mother, grant you grace to
do well, by St.</hi> Francis Xaverius
<hi>his Interceſſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had you commended me to the
grace of Chriſt alone, you had
done it with good warranty from
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom you boaſt.
Thus ſpeaketh he, Epiſt. I. 5. 10.
<hi>The God of all grace, &amp;c. make you
perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle
you.</hi> Chriſt with the Father and the
bleſſed Spirit are one God you
know; from any of the bleſſed
<hi>Perſons,</hi> we may ask Grace, and
wiſh it for others, ſecurely. But
to crave it from <hi>Creatures</hi> (ſuch
is the Bleſſed Virgin, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo glorious) is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
if not blaſphemous.</p>
            <p>If I be not miſtaken, Divines
make it an argument of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of the ſecond, and third
Perſons in the Holy Trinity, that
in the Scripture ſtile, Grace is
wiſhed from them, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64850:11"/>
with the firſt. Thus the reſt
of the Apoſtles ſalute, and thus
they frequently take their leave
of the Churches to which they
write.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 13. 14.</note> No mention in theſe
<hi>forms</hi> of the Bleſſed Virgin, ſhe
is never joined to the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in ſuch prayers for Grace;
and indeed if God (as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeaks) be the Author <hi>of all Grace,</hi>
what <hi>Grace</hi> need we ask of the
Bleſſed <hi>Virgin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then again, I am a little
ſtartled at theſe words, <hi>unſpotted
Mother,</hi> if you mean no more by
it, than that the Bleſſed Virgin
ſince her death is diſcharged from
all ſin, and defilement incident
(through the fall of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)
or rather unavoidable to
our humane Nature, I can eaſily
admit the term <hi>unſpotted;</hi> but if
by the word <hi>unſpotted,</hi> you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
our Ladies <hi>immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi>
I expect better reaſons,
than ever yet I have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
before I can ſign ſuch an

Article with my faith. I am told,
that Saint <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſaith, that the
Mother of our Lord was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſin, and why we ſhould not
believe him, ſpeaking ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the language of the Holy
Spirit, which exempts none, but
our Lord himſelf, from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Contagion,</hi> I ſee no reaſon.</p>
            <p>What were the Vertues of
your Saint <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> (to
whoſe <hi>interceſſion</hi> alſo you think
fit to commend me) to me is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
but this I am moſt ſure
of, that the <hi>interceſſion</hi> of our
Bleſſed Saviour with his Father,
is ſufficient for me; that he hath
commanded all, <hi>that labour, and
are heavy laden, to come unto him.
Mat.</hi> 11. 28. and that ſuch as <hi>do
come unto him, he will in no wiſe
caſt out, John</hi> 6. 37.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, when I made my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to you, I was in great
trouble; and for my ſudden eaſe,
was ready to flie unto any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that would offer me <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64850:12"/>
relief.</hi> Alas, you know, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
falling from an high place,
catch at any thing within their
reach; if ſharp <hi>Swords,</hi> or <hi>red hot
Irons</hi> were in their way, they
would lay hold on them. It was
(I now perceive) no ſmall <hi>ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi>
and <hi>blindneſs</hi> in me, that I
did not ſo fully, as I ſhould have
done, conſider the <hi>excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and pure doctrine of our
Church of</hi> England. For therein
I now ſee all the comforts, that
can be imagined requiſite unto
<hi>diſtreſſed Souls,</hi> are abundantly
offered unto me. I have the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> accurately tranſlated;
I have the ſenſe of my dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in exact conformity to
them, laid before me in our 39
<hi>Articles;</hi> I may have acceſs unto
my <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> in all caſes of my
perplexities, and I find ſuch of
our Prieſts, to whom I have made
my <hi>applications, compaſſionate,
grave,</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> unto me. But
they tell me (and I am very well
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64850:12"/>
pleaſed to hear it from them) that
I muſt not be diſcouraged,
though I find not that preſent eaſe
that I long for. Upon my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of repentance, and faith
in Chriſt, they are ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
unto me the benefit, and
bleſſing of their abſolution, but if
I find not preſently that <hi>tranſport</hi>
of rejoycing, which (it may
be) I too haſtily catch at; they
adviſe me, not to be too much
diſcouraged, but to wait the
Lords leiſure; who will have us,
even after he hath received us to
pardon, ſometimes by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
find the truth of that ſpeech
in the Holy Prophet <hi>Jerem. 2. 19.
It is an evil and bitter thing that
thou hast forſaken the Lord thy God
and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith
the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſupport me with this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that if I <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi>
the Goſpel, <hi>I ſhall certainly be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and if any offer me <hi>Conſolation</hi>
upon other terms, they do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64850:13"/>
me. Whatſoever my diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
are, they exhort me to
<hi>patience,</hi> and the doctrine is the
more ſatisfactory unto me, becauſe
I ſee it to be agreeable to that
meek reſolution of the Church in
the holy Prophet <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. Where,
in her affliction, I ſee her pitching
upon this concluſion, and ſaying,
<hi>I will bear the indignation of the
Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not at all affrighted at
your denial of <hi>Salvation to all out
of Saint</hi> Peter<hi>'s Fold;</hi> I am ſure
that all <hi>penitent Believers are of
the Fold of Christ,</hi> in which, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had been a
<hi>Sheep,</hi> as well as a <hi>Paſtour</hi> under
the great <hi>Shepherd,</hi> he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
periſhed. He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well, and as good <hi>doctrine</hi>
at other <hi>places</hi> as he did at <hi>Rome;</hi>
and the reſt of the Holy Apoſtles,
whereſoever they preached, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the ſame truths, that he
did, to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64850:13"/>
If <hi>Rome</hi> in ſucceeding times
(by being the ſeat of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours)
became a more eminent
City than her <hi>Siſters,</hi> and the
Biſhops of it obtained any <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
priviledges</hi> by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
all theſe things are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal</hi>
to the ſubſtance of the
Chriſtian Faith; which, when
<hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed to deliver in that
<hi>purity</hi> wherein St. <hi>Peter</hi> taught it,
ſhe can with no better <hi>pretenſions</hi>
lay claim to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> than the
<hi>Jews</hi> of old did to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whom
Chriſt tells (notwithſtanding all
their <hi>boaſting</hi> in him) that they
did not believe his <hi>writings.</hi>
And truly I think the ſame might
now be ſaid in ſeveral inſtances,
to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> in reference
to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of whom ſhe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Had they believed St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
writings, they would never
condemn thoſe Churches, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,</hi>
which in no point deny
them.</p>

able to conteſt with one of your

names of all the Twelve were
written in the twelve <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Jeruſalem, Apocal.</hi>
21. 14.) becauſe we adhere to

Jacobus Latomus <hi>was in exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great reputation amongſt the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64850:15"/>
Divines of our time, becauſe he

               </p>
               <p>This Perſon, when he drew near

And truly, Sir, though you may
perhaps condemn it, as a <hi>Fable,</hi>

wonder, that many of your beſt

            <p>AFter my Letter was <hi>written,</hi>
but before it was <hi>ſealed,</hi> I
conſidered a little, what your
Saint <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> his merits
might be, unto whoſe <hi>Patronage</hi>
you are pleaſed to commend me.
I am informed, that he is a Saint
of a late <hi>Canonization;</hi> firſt a
Proſelyte of, and then a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
with <hi>Ignatius de Loyola;</hi>
and truly, I think, not far from
ſome of his <hi>Enthuſiaſtical rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
He, with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> indeed
got Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the thirds <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be allowed with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as a <hi>Religious Society,</hi> in
the year 1540. But there is an
expreſſion in that Popes Letters
<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul. Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</note> (of <hi>Grant</hi>) which may beget
a <hi>jealouſie,</hi> that the Pope had an
eye to the ſervice he might have
from them, as well as to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
of the men, if at leaſt he
thought them <hi>devout.</hi> His words
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64850:17"/>
I hear, run thus. <hi>We have lately
heard, that</hi> Ignatius de Loyola,
<hi>and</hi> Peter Faber, <hi>and</hi> Francis
Xaverius, &amp;c. <hi>inſpired (as 'tis
piouſly believed) with the Holy
Ghoſt, coming from ſeveral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the World, met together,
and being confederate into a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
have renounced the ſnares
of this World, and for ever devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their lives to the ſervice of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of us, and
of our ſucceſſours, the Biſhops of</hi>
Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the Pope might
have ſo much of <hi>humane frailty</hi>
in him, as to take all in good
part, that ſuch <hi>ſworn Servants</hi>
of his ſhould enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds I believe
the following Popes, <hi>Gregory</hi>
the fifteenth, and his ſucceſſor
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> the eighth, had ſuch <hi>high
eſtimation</hi> of this <hi>Francis;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the one declared him
a <hi>Saint,</hi> and the other <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64850:18"/>
him. I am told, that he had
ſo behaved himſelf in preaching
to the <hi>Indians,</hi> that he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> But truly, to
ſpeak my mind freely to you,
<hi>his atchievements</hi> there, ſeem to
me very difficult to be believed.
I doubt, whether all the <hi>miracles</hi>
of Chriſt, and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scripture may be equal
to thoſe mentioned in <hi>

               <hi>'Tis ſaid in them</hi> that he defix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>and he would cry out,</hi> it is
enough <hi>Lord,</hi> it is enough. <hi>And,
when he ſaid Maſs (the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as 'tis now celebrated,
of your</hi> Romiſh <hi>Service, as the
Learned Doctor</hi> Brevint <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64850:18"/>
ſhews us</hi>) he would be
ſo alienated from his ſenſes
(which indeed I believe) <hi>that
the Miniſters preſent</hi> in the
ſervice could not, in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time, by pulling his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
excite him to his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the Work he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
hand. <hi>And otherwiſe,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could obſerve him advanced
(wondring at the miracle) a
Cubit above the earth. He wore
ſuch tattered <hi>Rags (and is this
a piece of merit?</hi>) that the
Boys ſometimes would mock,
and deride him. Of the like
nature is his frequent walkings
on the hot Sands, and on Thorns
themſelves, drinking the polluted
waters, with which he had waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſoars of diſeaſed people.
<hi>And then,</hi> his ability to ſpeak
the Languages, which he never
learnt, and to be underſtood,
ſome times, by men of ſeveral
tongues, when he ſpake one, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64850:19"/>
was ſtrange to the Auditours, till
he began to preach, is as much,
if not more, than what was
granted to the bleſſed Apoſtles at
the Feaſt of Penticoſt. <hi>'Tis
ſtrange to me, that</hi> he ſhould
caſt a Crucifix into the Sea, to
ſtill the Waves, <hi>and ſtranger
yet, that</hi> having loſt it by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the ſtorm, it ſhould be
brought to him, as he walked on
the Shore, in the mouth of a Sea-Crab.</p>
            <p>I marvel (though you read
this, and much more as <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
in the Popes Letters) that
you can credit all this done by
a perſon, about an <hi>hundred</hi> years
ſince; eſpecially ſeeing the
<hi>Learned Fathers</hi> about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after Chriſt, judged
the age of miracles to be paſt,
and our belief of thoſe only,
that are recorded in the Holy
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> to be ſufficient now
for our preſent <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64850:19"/>
Beſides, were the <hi>miracles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have been done by
him <hi>true,</hi> and the man as good,
as you think him to have been,
I conceive his <hi>interceſſion</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular perſon to be a
point <hi>uncertain,</hi> and truly, as
long as we have the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt, altogether <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am reſolved therefore, to
leave your <hi>Xaverius</hi> to the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
enjoyment of the <hi>felicity,</hi>
which he hath obtained (if at
leaſt he be in a ſtate of <hi>bliſs</hi>)
and to give him no <hi>interruption,</hi>
in any concerns of my Soul.</p>
