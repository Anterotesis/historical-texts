         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Hotch-Potch.</hi> This cobling kinde of Artifice hath that <hi>Botcher</hi> uſed, who
compoſed the Pamphlet intituled, <hi>The Fallacies of</hi> Mr. <hi>William Prynne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and refuted:</hi> who inſtead of diſcovering and refuting any <hi>Fallacies,</hi>
or <hi>Falſities</hi> of Mr. <hi>Prynnes,</hi> in an orderly or Scolaſticall manner, hath taken
much unneceſſary paines, to cull out here and there a word or line, out of
his wrightings on ſeverall ſubjects, and then patched them up together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
inferences and arguments of his owne forging; fighting onely with his
owne ſhaddow, and mangling, miſreporting, perverting all the paſſages he
recites, (as the Reader may at firſt view diſcerne) inſtead of anſwering, or
refuting any thing which he hath written.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall deſire the ingenious Reader, only ſeriouſly to peruſe
the ſeverall <hi>Quotations</hi> this <hi>Cobler</hi> hath botched together, in my Bookes
themſelves, as they are there urged, applyed, connected with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

<hi>Fallacies, Falſities, and Calumnies</hi> of this <hi>Anonymous Patcher,</hi> (who is ſo
penurious of matter, ſubſtance, that he produceth not one text or Author of
his owne) will be ſo apparently diſcovered, as they will need no further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
            <p>This is not mine owne ſolitary opinion, but the judgement of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
men, who have read this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to which I was minded to give
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159151:3"/>
no anſwer, as unworthy anything but contempt. Yet being deſired by ſome
friends to reply ſome-what to it, leaſt this Champion ſhould deeme his
<hi>Patched Fardle</hi> irrefragable, and overmuch abuſe the Reader and my ſelfe
with his ſlanderous falſhoods, I ſhall returne no other anſwer to his charge
<hi>of Calumniating falſhoods, wreſting of the ſcriptures, Points of Popery, groſſe
abſurdities, meere contradictions, hainous Treaſons, and plaine betraying of the
Cauſe,</hi> but onely this, that the <hi>Pamphletter</hi> is moſt groſly miſtaken, and hath
moſt falſly aſperſed me in all theſe particulers, as the mangled pages of my
books, which he recites by fragments, will manifeſt to all who ſhall doe me
ſo much juſtice as to appeale unto, and ſeriouſly peruſe them, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
or prejudice.</p>
            <p>There are onely two or three more conſiderable Calumnies he would
fix upon me, that need ſome anſwer, and in anſwering them alone, you may
clearely diſcover, both the palpable <hi>Falſities, Forgeries, Fallacies of this
Slanderer,</hi> who is aſhamed to ſet his name to his ſhamefull worke.</p>
            <p>The firſt and principall charge againſt me is, <hi>falſe Quotations,</hi> witneſſe

of <hi>Bodines</hi> words, as will appear by turning this accuſation into arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Prynne</hi> in reciting <hi>Bodines words,</hi> concerning the Kings of <hi>France</hi>

with an, &amp;c. (as this very Momus himſelfe in his Cenſure omits <hi>Turkie, Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,

Kings,) <hi>Ergo</hi> he hath falſly quoted, and wilfully perverted Bodine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Prynne</hi> recites and refutes <hi>Bodines</hi> opinion, of the abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of thoſe Kings, in the objected and other places. <hi>Ergo</hi> he miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
<hi>Bodine.</hi> If theſe be not moſt abſurd Arguments, and calumniating
falſhoods, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> hath<note n="*" place="margin">Part. 1. p. 39. 50. 93. 104. 105. 106.</note> frequently quoted <hi>Bodine,</hi> and this very <hi>Chapter</hi>
of his, in ſundry pages of his Bookes, but miſquoted him in no place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:
<hi>Ergo</hi> this Botcher hath miſquoted, miſreported <hi>Mr. Prynne,</hi> and

            <p>This Champion having thus manfully played the ſlanderer in this one
<hi>Quotation,</hi> which he in vaine labours to prove <hi>falſe,</hi> would willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to others, p. 7. but he there ingeniouſly confeſſeth, <hi>he wants his tooles
to doe his worke, and I have not</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the bookes cited by him.</hi> Certainely
if he <hi>wants his Books, and the Books I cite,</hi> to examine my quotations by, it
muſt needs be an impudent apparent ſlander in him,<note place="margin">Apendix. p. 4. 10. 11. 23. 89. 100</note> to tax me of <hi>miſquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
of thoſe Authors he confeſſeth, he never ſaw nor read: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he writes in the ſame page, <hi>that my Quotation out of Speed ſeemeth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

it, nor heard it, till I read it in Mr. Prynnes Book,</hi> and that he never read
Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> How dares he then terme it, a <hi>ſeeming Miſquotation?</hi>

            <p>For the pretended <hi>Falſhoods, Paradoxes, Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Abſurd opinions</hi>
he would faſten on me, p. 8. to 14. they are moſt of them his owne miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citals,

Pages whence they are tranſcribed, will ſufficiently manifeſt them to be
<hi>neither Falſhods, Paradoxes, Abſurdities, nor abſurd opinions.</hi>
