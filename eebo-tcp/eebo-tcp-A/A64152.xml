         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch is the all-daring and Lewd Licentiousnesse of these
last and perillous dayes of the World, that with their
Faction, Schisme &amp; confusion of contradicting and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Sectaries, the Church of England (not long
since the Reformed Religion) is promiscuously shaken,
deplorably enervated, miserably torne and distracted.
Religion it selfe is now crucified, as Christ was between two thieves,
<hi>viz,</hi> Superstition and Irreverence, which is a spice of Atheisme, and of
the two extreames is worse peccant in the defect, than in the excesse.
The World is growne into a new confused Chaos, full of new wine
lately come from <hi>New England,</hi> a new Spirit, new Revelations, &amp; new
Formes of Prayer. There is such a giddinesse in the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that every one almost is led by his own opinion, and most men
in matters of judgement are divided one against another. 'Tis too
true, that many places in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and in this Citty of
<hi>London</hi> are too much <hi>Amsterdamnified</hi> by brainelesse opinions, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
senses, which indeed are senselesse senses in Religion. Religion is
become common Table-talke, the ordinary discourse at very our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Ordinaries, where a man shall hardly find foure together
of one mind. The <hi>Papists</hi> will have their way; the <hi>Atheists</hi> will have
their way; the <hi>Brownists</hi> their way; the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> their way, the
<hi>Familists</hi> their way; and the <hi>Sisters of the Fraternity</hi> their way: So
that in these various and irregular wayes, they make such an intricate
Labyrinth of Religion, that few or none scarce can find out the right
way. A man may with more facility reckon up all the species and
kinds of Nature, then describe all the Sects, Divisions and Opinions
in Religion that are at this time amongst us. Some approve of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
because Ignorance is the mother of Devotion; Others affect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their own silly fancyes, esteeming all things else prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and superstition. One at the receiving of the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not kneele, another will not stand, a third will sit downe, a
fourth will not bow; One holds reverence to be Popery, another that
Rayles before the Communion Table are <hi>Romish,</hi> and that all decency
is Superstitious. Some say it is lawful to kneele at receiving the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the sacred <hi>Eucharist,</hi> others argue and plead for it, as expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
some again do presse it as necessary; and there are others (indeed
too many of that Sect amongst us) who abhorre it as Idolatrous. One
out of zeale, somewhat inconsiderate, cryes down Episcopacy, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58900:3"/>
Another very moderate, wishes earnestly Episcopacy
were reformed and purged from the <hi>Romish</hi> and Tyrannicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that incumbers it: A third kind of men carryed by a contrary
wind, maintaine Episcopacy to be <hi>Iure Divino:</hi> Thus <hi>quot homines,
tot Sententiae,</hi> So many men, so many minds. From these premisses of
Discord and Faction, needs must there proceed much tumult and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
to the great disgrace and scandall to the true Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to the encouragement of the wicked, who seeing that there are
so many Sects and Separatists, will therefore be of no Religion:</p>

            <p>Well may we take up that exclamation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator, <hi>O
tempora! O mores!</hi> Bad times, wherein there are worse men, and worst
of all manners. <hi>Plenitudo hominum, sed solitudo bonorum;</hi> a plenty of
men, but a scarcity of good men. There is such a multitude of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in all places, both in our Cities and Countries, that we may justly
feare this little Island will be turned into a great <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hinc illae lacrymae,</hi> One would reconcile Popery and our Religion
together, another would introduce faction and innovations into the
Church: So that between the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Separatists,</hi> the Church
strangely suffers. This latter sort of late days hath been very impudent
and turbulent, both to the Church and Common-wealth. They were
never more insolent at any time, then they are now at this time, and
never more frequent and resident in any place then in the two famous
Cities, <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and this of <hi>London.</hi> They are the Separatists, or
Brownists; the Libertines or Anabaptists; who are grown to a great
head, (for indeed they are <hi>Bellua multorum capitum</hi>) a giddy headed
multitude, &amp; are so common amongst us, that they are commonly call'd
the <hi>Round-heads.</hi> The <hi>Fraternity</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and the <hi>Brownists</hi> in
Town, are brethren of the same Tribe. They are nominated <hi>Brownists</hi>
from one <hi>Browne;</hi> as we usually terme the <hi>Lutherans</hi> from <hi>Luther,</hi> the
<hi>Calvinists</hi> from <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Arminians</hi> from <hi>Arminius.</hi> These are
the late up-start Sectaries of this age, the new crept in Caterpillers of
our Kingdome, that do more mischief dayly, than any sect whatsoever.
These are the <hi>Ionahs</hi> that have raised the tempest; these are the <hi>Achaxs</hi>
that do trouble our <hi>Israel.</hi> They are so many for their multitude, that
like Bees they swarme amongst us. Indeed the time was when they
crept in corners, but now they are like the Egyptian Locusts, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whol land, ye may know them by their frequent and far fetcht
sighes, the continuall elevation of their eyes, their meager physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
solitary countenances, sharp noses, by the cut of their hayre, made
even with the top of their prick-eares, (for their haire is as short as
their eye-brows, though their consciences be as vast as the Ocean) yee
may further discerne them by their broad hats and narrow <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufs, which
they usually weare, the putting of their gloves under their girdles, and
the folding of their hands one within another. Indeed they are painted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58900:3"/>
sepulchres, whited walls, whose Religion consists in frequent fasting,
and long prayers, which devoure widdowes houses, the outside of
whose vessels are pure and washed, but within full of filth and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
under sheep-skins are ravenous Wolves. They hold that Religion
ought to be guided by the motion of the Spirit, not reason; therefore
they will rule Religion, Religion shall not rule them, or else they will
go against Religion, as the Iewes did in meeting Christ with swords
and staves. They pretend sanctity, but intend impiety; much they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
but little good they expresse: Their Piety is altogether dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and what that is, tis sufficiently known; for <hi>simulat a sanctitas est
duplex iniquitas.</hi> Religion is of it selfe pure, unspotted, immaculate, and
undefiled; but they by their private malice, do endeavour to pollute
and contaminate the purity thereof. They say they would have Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
reformed, but their ayme is to have it deformed. These were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Hebrew <hi>Paratzim; viz.</hi> Separatists, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men they accounted profane people of the earth, but themselves
the only holy men in the Land; therefore with others they would
not converse for feare of defilement. In a precise manner they looke
down with their eyes, when inwardly a whore is not more deceitful.
They are double-minded, hollow-hearted, and wil as nimbly swallow
up at a bit, another mans estate, as our <hi>Dutch</hi> will pills of butter, and
never purch for it, All is fish that comes to their net. <hi>Vnde habeant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
quaerit, sed oportet habere.</hi> They make it no matter how they come
by it, so they have it. Their mouths are replenished with yeas, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lyes, but their tongs and hearts do as much differ as truth and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
though they do seldome damnably sweare, yet they will most
abominably lye. For lying, falsehood, and hypocrisy, these are their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
experssions. They are much addicted to prayer and fasting; for
they frame a long Babel-like prayer, made up with hums and hawes;
and though they affect fasting well, yet they love their flesh better,
They much delight in private conventicles, and secret and obscure
places, in which voluptuous wantonnesse has her meeting, where the
Spirit enlightens the understanding to see a sister in the darke: though
they are superciliously rigid and censorious, yet they seem very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
for rather then their sisters shall want food, they will fill their
bellies, and rather then they shall be naked, they will cover their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.
Brothers they are, but not of the blade; for they cannot endure
our Cavaleers; yet they are lovers of the sisters of the scaberd. Brethren
they are, not of the Corporation, but the separation; like <hi>Simeon</hi> and
<hi>Levi,</hi> they are <hi>fratres in malo.</hi> They are altogether ignorant, therefore
they despise all learning: for the tongues and languages, they utterly
abhorre and detest them as profane, and for our ordinary Latine, they

The Crosse they account the marke of the beast, and though it be the
ancient ensign of Christianity, yet by them it is contemned, All Crosses
they dosie as may-poles; the one they hold profane, and the other
they averre to be superstitious. They can endure no Crosse but that on
Silver or Gold; and for the Crosse in Cheapeside, it is the pillar of
golden superstition, the abomination of the City, the City Idoll, and a
supporter of Idolls, having so many images about it, which is as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to their sight as the Counter in Woodstreet is to an indebted
Citizen. All Ceremonies they account Popish, a Surplesse the snock of
the whor of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the sight wherof is as terrible to them in a Church
at noone, as the apparition of a Ghost in a Church-yard at midnight,
An orthodox and lawfuly called, and allowed Minister is not minded
amongst them; for they hold it as lawfull for Artificers, and Laymen,
to preach in publike, and those that are most inferior, as Coblers, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Leather-sellers, Box-makers, Iron-mongers, Felt-makers, and
such mechanick fellowes. These and their holy sisters (for they may wel
be linkt together) are they, who by their unreverent gestures in the
Church disesteeme of Church-Prayers; These are they who contemn
the publike service of God, and cry down the Lyturgie of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> that solemne Lyturgie, celebrous by the piety of
Bishops, and Martyres, hallowed with the blond of some of them
who composed it, established by the Lawes of this Land, by severall
Acts of Parliament in this Kingdome, attested and approved by the
best of all forraigne Divines, confirmed by the subscription of all the
Clergie, accepted of by the most and best of all the Laity, and hath
continued since in the raignes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>lames,</hi> and
our gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the service of
God these 90. yeares; that this holy exercise of Religion should be by
them vilified, interrupted, and depraved, what doth it tend to, but the
advancing of Heresie, Schisme, Profanenesse, Libertinisme, Anabaptisme, and Atheisme?</p>
            <p>We acknowledge, that some parts of our publike Liturgy, may be
very well corrected, (and thankes be to God the great Counsell of the
King, and the Kingdome have consulted and determined about it) but
the clamours now go very high: Impudence or Ignorance is at this

            <p>They affirme that that which is called the Liturgy is the same with
the Masse, either a Lethargy of worship, or a Masse of Idolatry; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is no purity, but all papistry. In the Service-booke they say there are
foppish and foolish Tautologies, as in these words, <hi>The Lord be with
you and with your Spirit:</hi> And in the <hi>Letany,</hi> there are vaine and <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

to heare us good Lord;</hi> which they are not ashamed to say are ridiculous
Invocations like magick spels, and no better than conjuring. These
moderne Zealots (forsooth) are offended at the vestments and habits
of the Clergie; every thing though never so laudable, decent, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
if contrary to their opinion, is by them accounted profane, or
superstitious. They make no reckoning of the Church of God, than of
a barne, or a stable, either of these is all alike to them. Barnes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are for threshers and hostlers: the Church is the House of God:
yet they are so base minded, as to conjecture a barne or stable good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough
for him, whom the heaven of heavens cannot containe, the high
and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity. They account their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as holy as the Church; Tis strange Divinity, and yet I hold no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
holinesse in either. I have read of a sort of Hereticks about the
yeare of our Lord 1126. who would have all Churches defaced and
demolished as needlesse Fabricks, and unnecessary structures; for God
dwels not in temples made with hands. Sure these Separatists are of
their minds; If they were not, they would mind the Church better
then they do; But these love to stand without at the Church doore:
I am sure they have no president for it out of the Word of God, that
whilst the preacher and people are praying, within, they should stand
prating without. That description of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be properly predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
of them: they are lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, disobedient, unthankfull, unholy, without naturall affection,
truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of others,
heady, high minded, <gap reason="foreign">

they have the Spirit, the subject of this small Tract doth sufficiently
declare, the Separatists. They are offensive to God in the contempt of
his Ordinance, whose commandement is, that every soule should be
subject to the higher powers; and they are injurious to the King and
State, whose power they despise, and government they affront. Their
lives are hypocriticall, their positions schismaticall, their thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous,
their words malicious, their Acts mischievous, and their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
impious. They hold it a matter arbitrary or indifferent, which
they dispense with at their own wils &amp; pleasures, to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
irreverently, unmannerly, undecently, and disorderly in Gods

motions and commotions in our Churches of late dayes, in
the Cathedrall of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> within these few months, and in S. <hi>Olaves</hi>
Church in the old Iewry, on Sunday in the afternoone being the 8. of
<hi>May,</hi> I know not by what unhappy fate, there was at that present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated
a company of rude Rascals, to the number of above 100, who
as soon as the right Rev. pious and learned Bishop came up into the
Pulpit in his Lawn sleeves and other vestments suitable to a Prelate,
they presently like an unmannerly and ill-bred crue of unruly curres,
made such a hideous clamour in the Church of God, crying joyntly,
most impudently and with one accord, <hi>A Pope, a Pope, a Pope,</hi> to the
astonishment of the man of God, &amp; to the admiration and amazement
of the L. Major, the <hi>Parliament</hi> Gentlemen, and other noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
auditors that were then present. Some of the varlets ran out of the
Church, others by the L. Majors officers were thrust out of the Church,
and the doore shut upon them: And I wish this cursed Sect may bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
excluded as from our Churches so from our Cities, Assemblies and
societies: I am sure, in the purest times of the Primitive Church, there
were <hi>Ostiarit,</hi> Doore-keepers, to debar from ingresse into the Church
notorious Hereticks, obstinate Idolaters and profane livers. I would
not be accounted uncharitable, therefore my opinion is, that these sons
of tumult bare no violent malice to the Right Reverend Bishops per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(for he is the object of every mans love) only I imagine their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
spleene aymd at his function. A Pope and a Bishop are all one
with them, when these turbulent Schismatickes were in the street,
they fell to picking of quarrels, and broke many glasse windowes in
the Church, in the time of the Sermon, they were so audacious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as to say, that they who were in the Church were at Masse,
and that the Lord Major was a Papist, whom God and the world
knowes to be a Gentleman of an approved and unblemished integrity
and an unfained Protestant of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> One thing I have
more to relate, that on of the rascals was the same day apprehended, &amp;
examined by some of the Parliament Gentlemen after Sermon in the
Lord Majors house, &amp; was by his Lordship committed, of whom here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ye shall heare more; for the present, I am sorry that such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is offered me to trouble the Readers patience so much, with the
relation of this viperous generation, and with such unsanctified sons
of mischiefe as these are; Only give me leave, before I leave them, to
leave this wish to them, that these Brothers of Schisme and Sedition,
with their Sisters of Faction and insurrection (for they of that sexe
are as bad, being of the same sect) may in due time (as I hope shortly
they will) suffer exemplary and condigne punishment according to
their demerits.</p>
