            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>One praies for God, and another for goods, and it may be neither are heard: becauſe the former wants his <hi>heart,</hi> and the latter his head. He that would finde God, let him ſéeke God for God, and other things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God.</p>
               <p>God is found of one that ſought him not, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſéekes and craues him, but cannot finde him at the firſt. Why? God will haue the former ſerue and praiſe him, and the other to ſéeke
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2637:8"/>
him ſtill. Sometimes hée ſhewes vs the libertie of his grace, and ſometimes he tries the ſtrength of our faith, and the truth of our loue.</p>
               <p>One man praies long, an other is but briefe, and both obtaine alike: for God meaſures his gifts by his loue and not by the length of our praiers, by his owne benignitie, and not by our breuitie.</p>
               <p>One praies at length &amp; loſes for lacke of deuotion: another is but ſhort, and yet receiueth: becauſe his affection is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arge &amp; feruent.</p>
               <p>One being long in his praiers is counted briefe, while another being briefe is counted tedious: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2637:8"/>
is long, but vehement: the latter is ſhort and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as cold, as briefe, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and too-long, becauſe his praier is too-ſhort for deuotion, without ſenſe &amp; ſoule.</p>
               <p>One is very violent and importunate, and another is not ſo earneſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet this ſecond only is heard. Either for that the former knowes not Chriſt, or becauſe his violence is rather from his ſtrong ſides, then true ſenſe, or a labor of lip ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than of loue; or elſe perhaps cauſed by ſome horrid apprehenſion of hell, and not of loue to God, or godlineſſe for God.</p>
               <p>Two men pray for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2637:9"/>
kingdome of God, one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatly, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſly: the violent caries it away: the cold ſuiter goes away empty. For God loues the laborious, and contemnes the lazie: if men pray, as if they praied not: he alſo will heare, as if hée heard not: pray féelingly if thou wouldeſt be heard fauourably: &amp; if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt taſte of Gods beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, be thou ſure to preſſe him with all violence.</p>
               <p>One praies chiefly for grace, and God giues him both grace and peace: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praies only for <hi>peace,</hi> and God giues him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, nor peace: not peace, becauſe hée wants grace to vſe it: not grace,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2637:9"/>
becauſe peace is all the grace, hée cares for: not peace becauſe hée will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for not begging or eſtéeming grace: and not grace, becauſe he ſéekes not for it.</p>
               <p>One praies for Gods bleſſing vpon his meat, drinke, phyſicke and labor, and God heares him not: another proſpers in theſe things without praier. What is the reaſon? Is it in vaine to pray? No, pray for a bleſſing, and leaue the euent to God. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a bleſſing to want ſuch a bleſſing. By this dealing God ſhewes hée is tied to no man by deſert, hée ſhewes he will do with his owne what he liſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2637:10"/>
hée will exerciſe thy faith &amp; fortitude, perhaps he meanes to haſten thée to better fauors: and for the other, that reſpects not praier, and yet proſpers, God doth it to allure him to him, or elſe (it may bée) to fatten him vp for the ſlaughter: in which caſe that proſperitie is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, and that ſéeming bleſſing a true curſe.</p>
               <p>One praieth conceiuing, an other reading: the one frames words to his mind, which is more eaſie: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frames his minde to words, which is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: yet both the one and the other praieth &amp; obtaineth, if they pray with good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and godly

I doe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them both, but am loath to compare them: I ſée not how the one can wel ſtand without the other. This will ſay; hée that is not fit to pray, is not fit to preach: and he that hath not a good care to héere, can not haue a good heart to pray: &amp; he that hath no deuotion to pray, hée cannot haue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout affection to heare: for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2637:23"/>
ſurely hée, that with a good will can ſpeake vnto God, will alſo with a good will heare God ſpeak vnto him: and hée, that hath an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and obedient care for the voice of God, cannot want an honeſt and humble heart to poure out his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo he, that is fit to bée Gods mouth to his people, is not vnfit to bée the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouth vnto God: and hée that is vnfit for this, cannot but bée vnfit, for that.</p>
               <p>Some pray being halfe a ſléepe, but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Watch and pray.</hi> I thinke a man may do well to pray, when others ſléep, and that a man in caſe may ſléepe,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2637:24"/>
when others pray. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, he that praies ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, ſhall be heard ſléepily. If thy heart be dead, Gods eare is deafe: his eare is much after our heart. I wil therefore watch, when I pray, and pray when I watch.</p>
               <p>One, when hée praies, cries a loud, another ſpeakes very low. But both are loud enough, if their hearts be loud: but if their hearts open not, both are too low.</p>
               <p>Some pray for this, and ſome for that, but I will pray for God. For hée that hath God, wants nothing: but hée, that wants God, hath nothing.</p>
               <p>A man may giue ſo

much, as that he may leaue himſelf nothing: but God, though hée giue neuer ſo much, is nothing the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. A man may perhaps turne away beggars, leſt hee ſhould begge himſelfe: but God delightes in the number of beggars, if their behauiour be good, and can giue content to all without detriment vnto himſelfe. I will therefore goe with my pitcher to this <hi>well,</hi> that can neuer bée drawne dry: I will borrow my light at this ſunne, that cannot but continue: I wil begge of this King, whoſe Exchequer is neuer but full, &amp; whoſe gates are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies open for any of his <hi>Subiects,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this is a certain truth, God giues

nothing to any, which is a true bleſſing vnto him, but he giues him grace truly to deſire it.
