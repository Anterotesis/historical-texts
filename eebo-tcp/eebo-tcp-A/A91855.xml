            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A proud, ſelf-rich, ſelf-full ſpirit is very inconſiſtent with a broken ſpirit, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church that proudly bragged, that he was <hi>rich, and encreaſed with goods, and had need of no thing;</hi> was as farre from brokenneſſe of heart, as he was from apprehenſiveneſſe of his own miſery, not knowing that hee was <hi>wretched and miſerable and poore and blind and naked,</hi> Rev. 3. 17. Where now is thine humility and ſpirituall poverty? if thou beeſt hardened in ſpirituall pride, ſelf-conceit, &amp;c. how ſhould a broken ſpirit lodge in thy breſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Love to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A broken ſpirit is a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate loving ſpirit, and the love of ſuch a ſpirit flames out <note place="margin">3.</note> moſt ardently towards Chriſt.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113927:19"/>
from its ſin in his own blood,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5. how it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes, affects, embraces the Lord! ſaith, thou art my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the land of the living—<hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and in earth ther's none that I can deſire beſides thee?</hi>—All things are but <hi>loſſe and dung</hi> to the wining of Chriſt, Phil. 3. one Chriſt is worth ten thouſand worlds, &amp;c. See how ſtrong the love of that penitent broken-hearted woman was to Chriſt. Her bathing his feet in her tears, wiping them with her hairs, kiſſing them with her mouth, and annoynting them with coſtly oynment, palpably proclaime her love to Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelf teſtifies, that <hi>ſhe loved much,</hi> Luk. 7. 37. 38. 44. to 49. ſhe could not chuſe, for Chriſt had loved her much; he forgave her her ſins which were many, and ſhe gave him her affections and teares which were many. No wonder that a broken heart is a Chriſt-loving-heart; for, its Chriſt that gives the broken heart; Zech. 12. 10, 11. its Chriſt that loves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and binds up the broken heart, Iſai 61. 1, 2, &amp;c. with Luk. 4. 18, 19. ther's much of Chriſt in the broken heart: how then can a broken heart chuſe but be endeared to Chriſt? As the ſoaking April ſhowers make the fields ſend forth a ſweet ſmell, or as the bruiſing of Camomil makes it the more fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grantly odoriferous: ſo Chriſt ſoftening and bruiſing the heart, makes the heart expreſſe a ſweet fragrancy of love to him. See now what tender affection thou beareſt to Jeſus Chriſt, to his Perſon, preſence, office, Honour, Ordinances, image in his members, &amp;c. if thou wouldſt read brokenneſſe in thine heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Obedience.</hi> A broken ſpirit is a dutifull tractable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiall <note place="margin">4.</note> ſpirit. Thus theſe two are coupled together,—<hi>And I will give them an heart of fleſh,</hi> (ther's brokenneſſe of ſpirit) <hi>That they may walke in my Statutes and keep mine Ordinances and do them,</hi> (ther's obedience aſſociated to brokenneſſe of heart,) Ezek. 11. 19, 20. and the like Ezek. 36. 26, 27. ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned waxe will receive any impreſſion; melted mettle will runne into any mould: thus a melted ſoftned heart, will bend and bow as God will have it: Then a Perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> can ſay, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9. 6. as if hee ſhould ſay, Lord do but thou command, I am ready to obey.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113927:20"/>
Then the betrayers and murderers of Chriſt can ſay, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Act. 2. 37. as if they had ſaid, we ſee we are undone in our ſelves by our ſins, but now we are ready to take any courſe for remedy, which the Lord by you ſhall preſcribe. Such an heart is fixed and reſolved upon all dutifull compliance with Gods commands: can ſay as <note n="a" place="margin">Da quod ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, &amp; jube quod vis. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.

               <hi>Auguſtine, Lord give me ability to do what thou commandeſt, and then command me whatſoever thou pleaſeſt.</hi> Haſt thou ſuch a flexible dutifull ſpirit? a broken ſpirit is an obedient ſpirit. But an hard heart, like a ſtone, will not bow or bend, may ſooner be ground to powder. Hardned <hi>Pharoah</hi> profeſſed, <hi>he would not let Iſrael goe,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. Hard-hearted <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and the people would not hearken to Gods meſſages, 2 Chron. 33. 10. The ſtubborn and ſtony ſpirited <hi>Jewes,</hi> tell <hi>Jeremiah</hi> plainly, <hi>As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not harken unto thee: but we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our owne mouth,—</hi>Jer. 44. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By the Adjuncts or Properties</hi> of a truly penitentiall broken ſpirit, we may further diſcover whether our ſpirits be broken, and thereupon the gratefull ſacrifices of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many <hi>Properties</hi> that might be inſiſted upon, take a taſte of theſe few that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A broken ſpirit grieves and mourns for the ſins of others,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>eſpecially for the publique abounding ſins of the times wherein it lives.</hi> A ſoft heart is like the moiſt elements water and ayre, which are very hardly kept in and contained within their own bounds; it ſatisfies not it ſelfe onely within the bounds of its owne ſins to lament them, but runnes abroad alſo in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for others. This as <note n="b" place="margin">Pia eſt iſta triſtitia, &amp; ſi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci poteſt, beata miſeria, vitiis alienis tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri: dolore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahi, amore non attrahi, &amp;c. <hi>Auguſt.

King <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods owne heart, and his heart was habitually tender and broken, and how was he affected and afflicted at the ſins of others, <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the tranſgreſſors and was grieved; becauſe they kept

Here, Right Honourable, you may ſee in theſe two gracious Kings, that it's a beame of true honor and nobility becoming Peers, or Princes, to have broken ſpirits, that can relent for others offences. And this is the Periphraſis of thoſe tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints in Jeruſalem,—<hi>Men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midſt thereof,</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. Whereas an hard heart troubles not it ſelfe at others ſins, but rather <hi>doth the ſame, and takes pleaſure in them that do them,</hi> Rom. 1. 32.
