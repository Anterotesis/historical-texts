            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the preſent Solemnity of Your Lordſhip's Inauguration; never was Entry made to that fair Poſt of Honour, under more Expectations than from Your Lordſhip, nor more Confidence of ſeeing thoſe Expectations anſwered. 'Tis not only the more unthinking Crowd of Homagers, thoſe cheaper Lips, ſalute You; but Judgment and Senſe have their Eyes fixt upon You, as fully ſatisfied that You bring thoſe ample Qualifications for Our Metropolitan <hi>Royal Repreſentative,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chapplet more fitted the Brow that wears it.</p>
            <p>And as no little Illuſtration to the eminent Figure that ſo much Worth muſt make, I may juſtly ſay of Your Lordſhip, That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as it never approach'd a <hi>Fairer,</hi> ſo it never entred under a more <hi>Prideleſs</hi> Roof than Your Lordſhip's. For never certainly was Power more affable, nor Command more familiar. Your <hi>State</hi> and Your <hi>Regalia</hi> wait You no farther than Your <hi>Chair;</hi> which more troubleſome formal Attendants of <hi>Office</hi> are inſtantly diſmiſt, and Your more genuine ſofter Train, all Your Sweetneſſes of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> and the condeſcending Graces of <hi>Courteſie, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> are called in as Your gentler and nearer Menials. And to all theſe there runs that <hi>Bravery</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> through You; a Glory ſo particularly Your own, that in all the Knees that bend before You, You give an occaſion to <hi>Thank</hi> wherethey Pray. Your Lordſhips more generous Goodneſs is not worſhipt by empty Gazers only, but by a more ſenſible Zeal and Devotion. But not to inſtance the acknowledgments of Duty and Gratitude, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and Panegyricks You receive where You have beſtowed Smiles and ſhowr'd Favours: Thoſe are no more than the payment
<pb facs="tcp:42299:3"/>
of Debts that are owing You; and Greatneſs and Power every day meet ſuch Homage. No, my Lord, Your Lordſhip's Virtue ſoars a pitch yet higher, a Virtue ſo attractive, as creates You Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries at a much farther diſtance: For Your Lordſhip has reacht a Character ſo univerſally Grateful, that You are every where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, even where you never obliged.</p>
            <p>And indeed 'tis no more than the Common Juſtice of mankind to pay that Eſteem to ſo <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>publick ſpirited</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> as Your Lordſhip's; Your Lordſhip, that think Your ſelf made for the World, as well as the World for You, and conſequently (not like too many riſing Favourites of Fortune that look no higher than home; to be Rich to themſelves, and Poor to all mankind beſides,) You make it an equal, if not larger part of Your Ambition to hoard a <hi>fair Name</hi> as well as a <hi>fair Maſs</hi> to leave behind You.</p>
            <p>But in all Your Perſonal Accompliſhments to furniſh out the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> Your Lordſhips innate Gallantry and Honour are in a high meaſure owing to Your <hi>Generous Extract,</hi> and as <hi>Generous Education,</hi> Derivative from Your Veins, and ſuckt in from Your Cradle: Your Lordſhip that poſſibly has that extraordinary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that Additional Weight in your Scale, a Blazon ſo rare, or at leaſt not in every City Coat, as to deſcend from that fair <hi>Original,</hi> the <hi>Aſhurſts</hi> of <hi>Aſhurſt,</hi> a Family that brought in the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their Blood, and the <hi>Normand Fleur de Lis's</hi> in their Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon, with the Firſt Great <hi>William;</hi> and have ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that unbroken Chain both of Fortune and Reputation, as has trod as near the Heels of Nobility as any Firſt Rank Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in <hi>England.</hi> And as one Honorable Derivative more of Your Lordſhip's, Your Anceſtors have been conſtant Aſſertors and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Religion and Virtue, Witneſs Your Lordſhip's Uncle in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, who then <hi>High Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> had the hardy Chriſtian Courage as to lay a Criminal by the Heels for the violation of the Sabbath day, though a Tranſgreſſor in that kind and at that time within the Verge of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> under the Umbrage and Protection of the then newly publiſht <hi>Metropolitan Canterbury Licenſe</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>

But whilſt my weak Oratory, the meaneſt Trumpet of a Renown ſo conſpicuous, is only repeating of what all Tongues are already filled with; I beſeech You to believe, That this Epiſtle is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt to the Right Honourable Your <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> but the <hi>Right Worthy,</hi> Sir <hi>William;</hi> not any tributary Devoir to the Greatneſs You wear for a Year, but the great Soul You wear always. For as Your Lordſhip's preſent Dignity is not preſented You as a Gift, but paid You as a Reward; under that conſideration, to level at the true Object of our Veneration, we muſt look beyond the Robe You wear, to the <hi>Merit</hi> that put it on. For the Foundation of <hi>True Honour,</hi> is like that of the <hi>Pyramide:</hi> The Baſis is always larger than the Pinnacle that Crowns it. 'Tis in that capacity, as both an Honour to the City, and an Ornament to Your Country, I Congratulate Your Lordſhip's Acceſſion to Your <hi>Praetorian Chair,</hi> and our proud <hi>Metropolis</hi>'s Happineſs in ſuch a <hi>Member,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> being with no little Pride,</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE COMPANY OF <hi>Merchant-Taylors.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I addreſs to You as <hi>Merchant-Taylors,</hi> that very Name alone, without my particular Survey of the collected Body of ſo Honourable a Company, is enough to take up no little part both of my Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Veneration. For do we viſit the utmoſt Reach and Extents of Land and Sea: make the very boundleſs Ocean a Tributary to the narrower <hi>Thames,</hi> and bring home the Wealth of the Univerſe to our own Doors? Who but the Merchant is that commiſſion'd Purveyour, and travelling Treaſurer! What's the whole Maſs and Wealth of Ranſact Nature, but his rich Hoard! The very Jemms of Crowns and Robes of Kings, Their Ermyn, and their Purple, their Pearls, and their Rubies, are all but his Richer Cargo. Do the glittering Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Monarchs in all their Luſtre and Magnificence ſo dazle our weak Eyes? Their Splendor is no more than the Oar refined from the Merchants Mint; and their Embroydery but his Drapery; being all firſt the Riches of His Wooden Walls, before they are the Ornaments of their Marble Roofs.</p>
            <p>What is the Merchant but the Surrounder and Circler of the ſpacious Globe, that draws the only Lines of Communication betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing and Commercing Regions of the Earth. Were it not for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, we had lived altogether in an unſociable World: Our very next Neighbourhood had been a downright <hi>Terra-Incognita</hi> to us; whilſt pent up in their own narrower untraffiking Precincts, whole Kingdoms
<pb facs="tcp:42299:4"/>
and Nations had been little leſs than a larger ſort of Cloyſters and Cells. Then the product of our own Glebe only muſt have furniſht both our Kitchin and our Wardrobe. Nay our very Monarchs themſelves muſt have been contented to have taken up with a homlier mettald Crown, poſſibly ſuch another as the <hi>Iſle of Mann</hi>'s Diadem; and their very Coronation Mantle, (though no Diſparagement to our own native Growth, the Fleece of the Sheep that buys the Jewels of the Crown) inſtead of the richer Orient Embroydery, the Silkworms ſofter Spinſtry, and the Ermins whiter Down, muſt at higheſt have reacht but to Wooll and Lambskins. Thus the <hi>Pavilion Royal</hi> is but juſtly a part of the Merchant-Taylors Scutcheon: For whilſt the Imperial Hero marches to the Field, and ſweats in Arms all Day; he ſleeps at Night under Your Umbrage, whilſt not only his Tent of War, but his Canopy of Peace is all Your own.</p>
            <p>Thus the Great <hi>Columbus</hi> in his Diſcovery of a new World, only open'd a new Door to the Merchants Glory; whilſt after their long Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and Viſits to their <hi>European, Aſian,</hi> and <hi>African</hi> three old Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; they had found out a new fair <hi>American</hi> Siſter to pay their new Court and Devoirs to; and to plume themſelves in the Wealth of the rich Dowr She brought them.</p>
            <p>We may juſtly rank the whole Induſtry of mankind under theſe two Claſſes, That of the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> and this of the Merchant. And indeed there's ſo far an Allyance and proportion betwixt both their Toyls and Labours, that 'tis all but the <hi>Work of the Plough:</hi> His that turns up the Glebe of the Earth, and Yours Your Keele that ploughs the Main. And as the Fruits of Bountiful Nature are his Harveſt; So the Riches of it are Yours: Only with this Difference between You, That the Husbandman is but the Subminiſter or Underfactor of the Merchant. The ſweat of His Brow gets the Bread: But Your Gold pays that ſweat; and indeed drives both Plough and Ploughman</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ſeveral Pageants of the Day, all ſuited to the Luſtre and Renown of Your Honourable Foundation, the Fair <hi>Minerva</hi> in both her Capacities, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goddeſs of Arts and Arms, is but the true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem and Portrait of Your Glory. For Arts are all ſo intirely Your own, that You reſemble the Ocean, on which You Trade. For as into that all the Leſſer Rivers flow: So the Toyls and Induſtry of the whole Land, from the Spinſtry of the Cottage, to the Loom of the Burgh, and the Woof
<pb facs="tcp:42299:5"/>
of the City, all Center in the Merchant. And as the Wealth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Peace are ſo juſtly Yours, no leſs are the Proweſs and Strength of Arms Your own too. For as the Nerves and Sinews of Trade are the Life and Soul of War; 'Tis only as the Merchant leads the Battle moves.</p>
            <p>And now Gentlemen, having brought You thus far in Your fair Chace of Honour, here Ile leave You, and heartily wiſh, ſo may You all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly lead, and make the Battle ſo ſucceſsfully move; That <hi>England</hi> may live to ſee her long Effeminacy ſhook off: and have yet a Race of the Third <hi>Edward</hi> and Fifth <hi>Henry</hi> Boys, as may ſtill carry Terror to the too powerful neighbouring Lillies, and raiſe up the Heads of her own Royal Lyons.</p>
