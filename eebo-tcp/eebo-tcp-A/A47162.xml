         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them, openly ſaid, as many can bear witneſs, in one of theſe Meetings,
<hi>That he did not find Chriſt without in all the Scripture,</hi> further poſitively

Friends, G. K. hath many hundreds to bear him witneſs, that he is
In unity with Truth and faithful Friends, not only in <hi>Old-England,</hi> but
in all places where they are; and they have heard him on all occaſions
earneſtly, to declare his being in unity with all faithful Friends every

she ſame that Antient Friends had from the beginning, and which all

Names and Words to any, it was but conditional, upon ſuppoſition of
their holding ſuch Errors, which they did ſeem to favour &amp; argue for,

<hi>G. K.</hi> might well ſay ſo concerning them that have oppoſed him here,

G. K. preſſed him again and again to ſhow in any one particular, but he

Queſtion, viz. <hi>Whether to believe that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and roſe

denyed, well knowing what is in his own Books. And it may be noted,
that <hi>T. Lloyd, S. Jenings, J. Delavall</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Richardſon,</hi> came to the ſaid
Meeting to countenance the reading of their Papaer of falſe Judgment
againſt G. K. and his Friends, having put it into the hands of <hi>W. Preſton</hi>

forbad the reading of it, declaring, <hi>That nothing ought to be read in their
Meeting without the general conſent of the Meeting;</hi> but this unruly and
diſorderly man, (who hath otherwiſe ſhowed his Prejudice againſt <hi>G. K.</hi>
&amp; particularly that when G. K. was declaring at another Meeting, <hi>W. P.</hi>

referring it to the Yearly Meeting here, there being a Faction that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

break his Promiſe; and therefore he refuſed to come under any ſuch tye,

when it is well known, and can well be proved, many did deny them.

Some brief Obſervations on their ſeeming Condemnation of <hi>William Stockdale,</hi>

Affair, for whom, and for his Glory, (if they had any zeal for him) they
ought to have been as much concerned as G. K. but it is fullfilled in them

               </gap>udgment given to

be tryed for reviling his Brethren, which <hi>G. K</hi> fervently and earneſtly
contradicted, crying out againſt their Injuſtice, and Arbitrary Method,
contrary to the way of worldly Courts, in the like caſe, though ſome
time after <hi>S. J.</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That Courts allowed of Diſcount;</hi> So
that according to <hi>S. J.</hi> the Blaſphemy of <hi>W. S.</hi> ſhall be diſcounted for,
and ſet off, againſt <hi>G. K</hi>'s reviling his Brethren, if he had been guilty
thereof, which they can never prove. And whether <hi>A. Cook</hi> was not
guilty of extream Paſſion, who did in a Quarterly Meeting, whereof
many can bear witneſs, pronounce a Curſe againſt G. K. ſaying, <hi>George,
thou hast made this Breach, and Wo be to thee from the Lord,</hi> and yet none
of that Party reproved him for ſo doing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherereas they give their Judgment, <hi>That</hi> W. S. <hi>is reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and blame-worthy for uttering the ſaid words</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> That G. K's
preaching Chriſt within and Chriſt without, was preaching two
Chriſts) <hi>they being an Offence to many ſound and tender Friends, and that
be condemn the ſame.</hi> It doth plainly appear, that their Judgment is but
a bare ſhadow, or formality of Judgment, rather than any ſubſtantial,
effectual, weighty and ſollid Judgment againſt him, which if it had been,
they would have aggravated it with other words and expreſſion, and
principally blamed him for his words of Unbelief and Blaſphemy againſt
the Son of Man, greatly offenſive to God; but inſtead of that they ſay,
<hi>They being Offenſive to many ſound and tender Friends:</hi> Why are they ſo
ſevere to G. K. againſt whom they cannot juſtly charge any thing, either
in Doctrine of Life, ſaying of him, <hi>He being a Man without the Fear of
God before his Eyes, &amp;c.</hi> Is it a greater Offence to them, that they are
diſhonoured, or that the worthy Name of Chriſt is diſhonoured, by as
open denyal of him, as <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> did, by ſaying, <hi>To preach Faith in
Chriſt within and Faith in Chriſt without, is to preach Two Chriſts;</hi> for at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95816:12"/>
this rate, Chriſt without is to him but a falſe Chriſt; and this to them
is ſo ſmall a fault, that to deny Chriſt without us, they will not ſay in
their Judgment, <hi>it is an Offence to God,</hi> but they ſay, <hi>It is an Offence to
many ſound and tender Friends;</hi> Oh! great Hypocriſie, and want of Zeal
to the Glory of God and Chriſt, though they are full of Zeal to their
own Honour, that will ſtink, and doth already ſtink for this their great
Partiality and Injuſtice, as well as their great Ignorance, Error and
Unbelief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But why do not the words of their Judgment run thus, <hi>That</hi>
W. S. <hi>did ſay, to preach Faith in Chriſt without, and in Chriſt within, was
to preach two Chriſts, &amp;c.</hi> but that they are guilty themſelves of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Faith; for not long ago, <hi>A. Cook</hi> queſtioned G. K. at a Mens
Meeting, which many can witneſs, <hi>Where we did read in Scripture, that
we are to believe in Chriſt within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in Chriſts without us?</hi> And tho'
of late, ſome of them ſay, they have a reverend eſteem of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
of his Death, Sufferings, Reſurrection and Aſcention, yet none
of them preach at a neceſſary matter of Salvation, to believe it, that
ever we heard of, except <hi>John Delavall,</hi> who hath of late changed his
Faith, and got a far worſe. And it cannot be ſuppoſed, that they hold
Faith in Chriſt without them to be neceſſary to their Salvation, ſeeing
many of them that belong to the Monthly Meeting, have given their
Judgment, <hi>That the Light is ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe,</hi>
which is a plain excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus from having any part in
our Salvation, and leaving him only the bare Name or Title of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
and if ſo, then they had as good have wholly cleared <hi>W. S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is great Confuſion and Contradiction in theſe of that ſide,
to condemn <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi> if they were in good earneſt, and to clear
<hi>Tho. Fitzwater;</hi> for if the Man Chriſt Jeſus be our real Saviour, and that
his Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention and Mediation for us without us
in Heaven, hath any part in our Salvation, then the Light doth
not ſave us without ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>what elſe; and therefore <hi>T. F.</hi> is guilty of
Condemnation; But if <hi>T. F.</hi> be cleared, then the Man Chriſt without
us is no real Saviour at all, and ought not to be preached, nor Faith in
him, but only the Light within, and <hi>W. S.</hi> at this rate is in the right
of it, and they have done ill to paſs Judgment againſt him. I know no
way to reconcile this, but to ſay, their Judgment againſt <hi>W. S.</hi> is a
Mock-Judgment or ſhow, without any Reality.</p>

Law or Goſpel, accuſing him falſly behind his back, without ſpeaking
to himſelf; whereas G. K. gave him good Goſpel Order, but that their
Prejudice blinds them that they ſee it not. <hi>William Stockdale</hi> gave not
Offence to <hi>G. K.</hi> alone by himſelf, but to him in the preſence of two
others that were with him; and for what he had by Hear-ſay from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was no juſt ground of Offence to him, until it was confirmed by
<hi>W. S.</hi> himſelf, as it then was; and therefore not being to him alone,
it was no Tranſgreſſion of Goſpel Order, that he did not ſpeak to him
alone afterwards. But why ſhould <hi>Samuel Jenings</hi> blame G. K. for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

by their own Principle, to be called a <hi>Heathen</hi> is no Reviling, and to be
