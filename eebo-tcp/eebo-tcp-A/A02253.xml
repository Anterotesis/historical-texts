            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Was that distressed Church, in the midst of her distractions about matter of Doctrine, so wily in her intentions, as to make preposterous use of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors assistance, and to draw them in for concurrence, in matter of Discipline, with a forreine sister against their owne Mother? Were those, that hence ayded that Church, <hi>tam naris obesae,</hi> so dull of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7924:3"/>
apprehension, as not to perceiue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of their owne? Or did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themselves <hi>tam sublesta fide,</hi> so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously, as to suffer the government of this renowned Church, so much as upon the Bye, to bee condemned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there, and to sit downe by it?</p>
            <p>Had there been any colour for such sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, it might have pleased the <hi>Appealer,</hi> or <hi>Appeacher,</hi> before he Recorded in print such his odious Information, tendered to his Majesties owne hands, to have demanded in private such a question of some of those, from whom in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood hee might have received particular satisfaction.

               <hi>plead for themselves.</hi> Wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who have hereto subscribed our names, being interessed in that Synode, and withall deeply in this crimination of Puritanisme, can doe no lesse then answere, and cleare in some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique manner this slander published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</p>
            <p>And first in generall to remove the often objected suspition of complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene <hi>foreine Doctrine and foreine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Page 56. &amp; 72.</note> 
               <hi>Discipline,</hi> wherby is intended, that there is a kinde of naturall consanguinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that Doctrine (which odiously hee styleth <hi>foreine)</hi> subscribed unto by that Synode, and the <hi>Presbyteriall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> established in that and other forein Churches: wee answer, that in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:7924:4"/>
the party opposite unto that <hi>Synode,</hi> and most aggrieved with the Conclusions thereof concerning the Points controverted, are notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as vehement and resolute maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Ministeriall Parity, as any that concluded, or accepted the judgement of that <hi>Synode.</hi> Moreover, in our private conversing with the most eminent of the Ministery there, wee found divers times, upon occasion of our declaring unto them the order and manner of our Church-government, that they were more ready to deplore, then defend, their owne estate, and wished, rather then hoped, to bee made like the flourishing Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor were these therefore the lesse ready to concurre for the <hi>Dort</hi> Conclusions, but were rather of the principall and forward actors therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly in speciall we plead against a supposed act of damning our owne Episcopal discipline. Which inditement,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7924:5"/>
in fayre accusation, should have beene layed more particularly, what action, what Session, what Conclusion. Now are wee put to seeke, not so much our defence, as our fault. And for such sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise wee can finde no other footing, then (possibly) in the approbation of the <hi>Belgique Confession,</hi> propounded to the Consideration of the Synode about a weeke before it brake up.</p>
            <p>This Confession (composed <hi>an:</hi> 1550, and received in their Church, and in the <hi>Wallon</hi> Churches, ever since the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of Religion) is unto them, for consent in Doctrine, a Rule not much unlike to our <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished. Which as it was formerly <hi>anno</hi> 1583 accepted and approued by the Reformed <hi>French</hi> Church in a Nationall Synode at <hi>Vitree,</hi> so upon the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of this Nationall Synode the State and Church there recommended the same to more publique judgement for further establishment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7924:5"/>
And because two or three Articles therof concerned Church-discipline, and avowed a Parity of Ministers, they, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently fore-seeing that the <hi>Britaine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> would never approve, but rather oppose the same, did therefore provide that before the examining or reading thereof, protestation should be made by the <hi>President</hi> of the Synode, that nothing, but the Doctrinall points, was to be subjected to their consideration and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages: and for the surer preventing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or dispute, the Articles concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Discipline were accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched and suppressed in the reading of that Confession to the Synode.</p>
            <p>If therefore the <hi>Britaine Colledge</hi> had in their suffrages onely answered <hi>ad quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita,</hi> concerning Doctrine, and uttered no opinion at all <hi>de non quaesitis,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Discipline, they thinke they had not herein beene wanting to their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall duty and calling. The rather for that</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7924:6"/>
1 They were sent thither to endeavour the peace and composure of that distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Church, by expressing their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Points there already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, not by intruding in matters not at all questioned among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Among the Instructions given them by his Majesty, they had none to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Discipline there established, but had charge to use moderation and discretion, and to abstaine from multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of questions beyond necessity.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In that subject there was no hope, on possibility of prevayling by argument or perswasion; especially in that Church, where the Civill government is popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and so complyeth more easily with Ecclesiastique Parity.</p>
            <p>Yet wee thought not fit to content ourselves with warrantable silence; but, upon our returne from that Synodicall Session to the place of our private Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate meeting, wee diligently perused the <hi>Confession,</hi> not onely for points of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7924:6"/>
Doctrine; referred to our judgements, but also for those excepted Articles tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Discipline. And consulting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what was fit to bee done in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our opinions the next day, wee joyntly concluded, that, howsoever our Church discipline had not beene Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically taxed, nor theirs avowed, yet it was convenient for us (who were assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our consciences that their <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Parity, and Laicall Presbyterie</hi> was repugnant to the Discipline established by the Apostles, and retayned in our Church) to declare in a temperate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our judgement as well concerning that matter, though by them purposely excepted, as the other expresly referred to us. Accordingly the next morning, when suffrages were to passe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine comprised in that Confession, wee (having by our place the prime voyce in the Synode) gave our approbation of the substance of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall Articles, with advice touching
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7924:7"/>
some incommodious phrases; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (contrary to the expectation of the whole Synode) wee added expresse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against the suppressed Articles, with some touch also of Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Which our Contestation, or Protestation (for so may it bee styled) was principally performed by him, whom for prioritie of age, place, and dignitie it best became, and from whose person, and gravitie it might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken by the Civill <hi>Deputees of the States</hi> there present.</p>
            <p>Therein he professed and declared our utter dissent in that point: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewed that by our Saviour a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Ministers was never instituted, that Christ ordained twelve Apostles and seventy Disciples; that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the twelve was aboue the other: that the Church preserved this order left by our Saviour. And therefore when the extraordinary authoritie of the Apostles ceased, yet their ordinarie authoritie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7924:7"/>
in Bishops, who succeeded them, who were by the Apostles themselves left in the government of the Church to ordaine Ministers, and to see that they who were so ordained, should preach no other doctrine: that in an inferiour degree the Ministers, that were gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Bishops, succeeded the 70 Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: that this order hath bin maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church from the time of the Apostles. And herein he appealed to the judgement of Antiquity, or of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Ignat. Epist. ad Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph. Tertul. de Baptismo. Hieronym. Epist. ad Marcellam. Aug. in Psal. 44. Epiphan. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 75.</note> man now living, if any could speak to the contrary, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In giving our severall suffrages the same exception was seconded by the rest of us <hi>Collegues,</hi> partly by other allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and partly by briefe reference to this declaration made <hi>communi nomine</hi> by our Leader. To this our exception and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations not one word was answered by any of the Synodiques either Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Provincialls. So that herein we may seeme to have had either their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

implied by silence or at least appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our just and necessary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our bounden duty to that Church, whereunto they all afforded no small respect, though differing in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from their severall Churches.</p>
            <p>Herein perhaps by some we might be deemed rather to have gone too farre in contestation and upbraiding, <hi>quasi in as,</hi> the Civill Magistrate, and Ministery there with undue forme of government of that Church, whose doctrine onely was offered to our opinions.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary part it hath bin suggested here at home by some, that herein wee came short of our duty, that we ought to have stepped yet farther by exhibiting in writing a formall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station to bee entred, and kept by the Actuary of the Synode. Whereto we answer.</p>
            <p>First that the course there taken for the manner of delivering our judgements, was not (as in the 5 Questions contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7924:8"/>
by subscription, but onely by vocall suffrage: which gave no opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of putting in a written Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas, if we had subscribed our names unto that Confession, we would infallibly have added with the same penn our exception against the Articles concerning Discipline.</p>
            <p>Secondly in that vocall proceeding had we been overborn by the multitude of their voyces, or receiued any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or affront from them touching Discipline, we would have releeved our just cause either by written Protestation, or better meanes. But when as neither the Civill Magistrate (in whose hearing our exceptions were constantly uttered) did gain-say us, nor any of the Divines in the Synode once opened their mouths either in offence of our government, or defence of their owne, what needed we to redouble our stroke upon those, that turned not upon us?
<hi>Rixa suam finem, cum silet bostis, habet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7924:9"/>
Peradventure some hot spirit would not have rested in a formall recorded Protestation neither: but would have charged those Churches to blot those Articles out of their Confession, and forthwith to reforme their government; otherwise not have yeelded approbation to any Article of Doctrine, as there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised: but renounced the Synode, and shaken off from his feet the dust of <hi>Dort, I have nothing to doe with your Conclusions. I have no part nor portion in them. What ends you have, how things are caryed, I cannot tell; nor care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We confesse, we were, and are, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde; our owne dispositions, and the directions of our blessed Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making King, kept us from kindling new fires; where we had worke enough to quench the old. We then thought (and so still in our consciences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident) that we forgat not our duty to our venerable and sacred Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but tooke a course
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7924:9"/>
conformable to the rules, as wel of filiall observance, as of Christian moderation.</p>
            <p>And even then (according to our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of weekly transmitting into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> briefe narrations of the proceedings in each severall Session to be imparted to his Majesty) we by the next messenger sent our relation hereof, as no whit asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our deportment herein. Which, because it was then framed, when we did not imagine that any quarrell would be picked against us, for more impartiall and unpassionate attestation, is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, as much as concerneth that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

               <hi>Belgicam diligenter examinasse, nihilquÃ¨ in ea deprehendisse, quod ad fidei qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem dogmata attineret, quod verbo Dei non consentiret. The Divines of great Britaine declared, that they had diligently examined the Belgique Confession, and that therein (for as much as concerned dogmaticall points of faith) they found nothing, that agreed not with the Word of God.</hi> Which reservation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that somewhat else (which did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerne point of faith, but other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) received not their approbation. It may be sayed (and so wee our selves say) that the disposers and publishers of these Synodicall Acts had done more right to the Britaine Divines, if speciall mention had beene made of that other matter not approved by them, and of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar exceptions against the Articles, which concerned Church government. But, it seemeth, (as in most other vocall passages in this Synode) the Actuary here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abridgement in what he set downe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7924:14"/>
and meant not to expresse in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular what was sayd by any concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning points not propounded to Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call deliberation; especially touching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so tender a string as the open im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of their owne established Discipline. And so they thinke that they have given us our due herein, partly by thus pointing afar off to what we did in our owne defence, leaving the reader to finde it by implication, and partly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording that all Synodicall proposition and approbation of this Confession was confined to matter of Doctrine onely.</p>
            <p>According to which reserved forme of expression the <hi>President</hi> of the Synode, in the great Church of <hi>Dort</hi> (immediately after the publication of the Synods Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the five Controversies) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the approbation of this <hi>Confession</hi> sayed (not that the whole, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, was approved, but) <hi>doctrinam in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessione comprehensam, in Synodo relectam,</hi>

               <hi>that Confession, read over in the Synode, and examined, was approved as orthodoxe.</hi> Which style of speach excludeth whatsoever is there comprised concerning, not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but Discipline, whatsoever was not examined Synodically, nor so much as read in the Synode, whatsoever in common understanding admitteth not the title of <hi>Orthodoxe,</hi> which attribute is proper unto dogmaticall points. In this sense, and of this subject they did, and well might, there alleadge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cording judgements <hi>omnium tÃ m exterorum, quÃ m provincialium Theologoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, of all the Divines, as well strangers, as Provincialls.</hi> Nor had we cause to expect, that in such publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Synods doctrinall consent they should trouble their owne people with expressing the dissent of some few of the <hi>Exteri</hi> in matter of Church-discipline. Which our dissent they have delineated in this Record of their Acts, though over-veyled for their owne peace, yet transparent enough for our defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7924:15"/>
But our ill happ belike it was, that he, who turned over all the leaves of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique Confession</hi> there set forth, to finde the Articles concerning Discipline, could not intend to cast his eye upon the page next fore-going that <hi>Confession,</hi> to view the limited manner of both propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and approving that body of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Which limitation had he seene and considered, (so confident are we of his ingenuitie) he would not have cast this harsh imputation upon us.</p>
            <p>And now being better informed by this our true account of the cariage of that businesse, he, that hath traduced us, will (we hope, and crave) make us some competent satisfaction, by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his over-sight, and recalling what he hath unadvisedly written to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Which reparation we have the more cause to expect, for that, upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence yeelded to this his Information, this imputation hath of late bin further, upon the Bye, grated on and upbrayded in the audience of divers personages of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7924:15"/>
note, whose opinions of us we have great cause to respect.</p>
            <p>As for our selves, in the integritie of our consciences we herein doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the judgement of any indifferent unpassionate man; and such, we hope, this true and plaine Narration will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.

And as in that Synode our speciall care, and perpetuall endeavour was to guide our judgements by that sound Doctrine, which we had received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Church of <hi>England:</hi> so were we farre, and ever shall be, from usurping our Mothers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or attempting to obtrude upon her children any of our Synodicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, as obligatory to them: yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
