            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not onely sorry and troubled, but afflicted, to see so many Persons standing there, who (could they but quit themselves of one or two needless scruples, pardon me Gentlemen, if I use that term) were fit to sit here and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affaires of the Country.</p>
            <p>Realy, I would not wish any of you (upon the meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt either of your purses or Persons) to turn your backs of one Fundamentall Doctrine, that appears such, upon a serious and impartial enquirie; but even in consideration of those your temporal concerns, you may have just occasion, to review your Notions, and after due search easily find.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That that sort of Supremacie which the Laws require, on the behalfe of our Kings, doe's no way violate, or invade the Priestly Function.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That that sort of Supremacie, which the <hi>Pope</hi> now clayms, was vtterly unknown to the Primitive Church; and is neither consistent with, nor at all becoming the Priestly Function.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this sort of Supremacie has stragled, in the world,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29697:5"/>
to the cost of many Crowned-heads, and the destruction of numberless Christian People.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this sort of Supremacie was (first) founded in bloud, and so fostered ever since; having been formerly, and formally (in direct, plain words) declared against, both by a Council, and a Pope.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the chief and most celebrated Authors, in the <hi>Romish Church</hi> have writ in defence of their exorbitant supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, after such a manner, as does rended it rational, yea necessary (especially it being compared with their former known actings, and the posture of this day) to keep on foot the old, and perhaps to make new Laws, in prejudice of Recusants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may discover the truth, or falsehood of this Proposition, it will be requisit to know distinctly,
<list>
                  <item>What the challinges of the King are.</item>
                  <item>What he absolutely and freely disowns.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>He expects then to be <hi>Custos urius<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Tabulae</hi>; this was no more then all the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> exercised; and those of them that were most zealously active in the purging the Temple, in the preserving, or restoring the true worship of God, (as <hi>Iosiah</hi>) we find most commended, most Celebrated in holy Writ: we find too, (to Note that by the way) they still called to the Law, the written Law, and to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, making them their Rule. 2. <hi>Chorn.</hi> 17th. <hi>Iehosophat</hi> 29 <hi>Hezekiah</hi> 34. <hi>Iosiah,</hi> he expects further, that all the Members of the Church within his Dominions, should be subject to his Courts; and Clergie-men, as well others, (in case of notorious Crimes) tryable there. He expects to nominate, appoint, and call to any spiritual preferments, what persons he please, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interposition of any Forraign power, or Potentate:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29697:5"/>
this is no more then every Patron of a Parish-Church looks at, as his own right. The whole of this is no more, then <hi>Elutherius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> declared to be in <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> when he sent to him to desire, not his leave, but advice, in the <hi>Resetling</hi> a Christian Church; for the Gospel had been both Preached and owned here before; and without any help from <hi>Rome</hi>; tho, at that time sadly over-run again with <hi>Paganisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now negatively, Let us see what the King pretends not to; Not the conferring of Orders; not Administration of Sacraments; not to Preach the Word; not (of himself) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Articles of Faith; and herein, both the preamble of the Statute, and the Injunctions which were afterwards purposely framed, (to satisfie such as seem'd to mistake the point) are so plain, that it's a wonder how a considering man, can have any religious fear or scruple about it. These together, are such an innocent kind of Supremacie, so just and so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exercised by Christian Emperors, and Kings of <hi>England,</hi> (even all that had any thing of Judgement, spirit, or good fortune) as certainly none that has lookt at all into Historie only, will deny his Prince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doubtless if our Blessed Lord had meant, That this prodigious sort of Supremacie (joyned with a never failing Infallibilitie) should ever have been the main Article of our Faith, he would not have answered his inquisitive Disciples so unsatisfactorily, as he he did; <hi>Mark</hi> 9.34, 35. <hi>ver.</hi> nor would he have left the world without a clear direction, in a matter of so vast concernment (to all it's future Generations) Now that he did not so, is evident, since St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he sadly foretold the Church, <hi>How, after his departure, grievous Wolves should enter in</hi>; and amongst them, many should arise <hi>speaking perverse things</hi>; advises them not, to make their addresses to any one that should (then) happen to be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; but commends them <hi>to the word of Gods grace, to be built up
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29697:6"/>
thereby</hi>: as we read <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.29, 30, 31, 32. A shrewd signe, that the Apostle did not understand <hi>Tu es Petrus</hi> in the <hi>Popish</hi> sence; nor in that other place, which has a minatorie exhortation to <hi>Rome</hi> (as well as to other <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches) least she also might be cut off, <hi>Romans</hi> 11.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What think you, Would all the Eastern Bishops have stood out so vigorously, and so long (in that controversie about the celebration of <hi>Easter</hi>) if it had ever been received as a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule, <hi>That your Vniversal Monarch, in the West, was Gods Plenepotentiarie, in all Causes Ecclesiastical.</hi> Would the third Councill of Carthage (wherein St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was present) have past a Decree, <hi>That none should be stiled Head, or Prince of Priests</hi>? Would the great <hi>Gregory</hi> (even when he sat in the Pontifical Chaire) have pronounced such a pretender the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Anti-Christ. Even St. <hi>Peter</hi> (from whom you seek to derive it) demonstrates, <hi>That he neither had, nor desired any such Lordship, or Superiority,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Would <hi>Heirome</hi> have said, <hi>Pari omnes, inter se Authoritate fuisse Apostolos?</hi> Would <hi>Ambrose</hi> have slipt so, as to have writ, <hi>Non habent haereditatem Petri, qui fidem Petri non habent?</hi> Would <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sil</hi> have assigned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> a better title to the succession of <hi>Peter</hi>? Would he, and so many other old Fathers, have blamed, chid, derided; nay, even contemned the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> pride, if all the world had been obliged to be led by the Nose, what way he should please?</p>
            <p n="3">3.4. It is in vain then to seek after the sort of Supremacie, now contended for during the first six hundred years; But I shall presently lead you it's rise: And that leaning upon the Authorities of such Authors, as you will not refuse to call your own; Know then, That not halfe an Age after <hi>Gregory</hi> was gone off this stage: A certain Man that went by the name of <hi>Boniface</hi> had a mind to be Paramount in the Church, and there (luckily) fell out to be at the same time, a Person of great Power, who long'd to be <hi>Emperor</hi>; these two, struck a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29697:6"/>
bargain; <hi>Mauritius</hi> (the rightfull Master of them both) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his whole family, cruelly was murder'd: <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cas</hi> got the Scepter; and <hi>Boniface</hi> was by him constituted Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Bishop: From hence, all men must date the Original of this fatal Supremacie; Fatal, I say, because it has been so fruitfull, and teeming in slaughters, Rebellions, (you must bear with the term, since matter of Fact, in almost every Age bears testimonie thereof) and Massacres. It was indeed a fine cast of this new Office, which <hi>Anno</hi> 747. was given to <hi>Chilpric</hi> (the last of the First Royal house in <hi>France)</hi> by the then Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi>; poor <hi>Chilpric</hi> was an unactive, easie Creature, and therefore must be sent into a Monasterie (where you may suppose, he lived not long after.) But <hi>Pepin</hi> was a brave Young blade, and <hi>Zacharie</hi> stood need of such an one: he presently absolves him from his sworne Allegiance, and mounts him up to the Throne. But tush! this was nothing to the Freaks; the subsequent Holinesses play'd all the Empire, (nay well-nigh) all <hi>Europe</hi> over, by pulling, yea kicking off Crowns <hi>(Anno</hi> 1080, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7th. by arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects (yes sonns) against their Princes <hi>(Anno</hi> 1110. <hi>Paschal</hi> second.) The two last <hi>Henry's</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> felt the weight of the two Swords, which the <hi>Pope</hi> clayms as his own, though they fell but by two sorry knives in the hands of two wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but both Disciples of the <hi>Iesuits</hi>; And all to make room for this Monstrous Supremacie; at the cost, not only of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Waldenses, Hussites,</hi> (and such as they will call Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) but even of their own Children, who mistook that Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame of <hi>Rome</hi> for their true Mother.</p>
            <p>Tis true, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (pretty, early when the Discipline of the Primitive Church was yet in it's right state and just vigor) did stave off the hands of the Emperor, from touching the sacred Elements, when he found them polluted with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood. But, I beseech you consider (for this very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular may serve to rectifie your judgements.)</p>

Let honest <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> (the Monk of Saint <hi>Albans)</hi> tell you, How common it was for every Priest, Prelate, or Fryar, <hi>transalpinare,</hi> to hite away to <hi>Rome,</hi> and bring back with them an Interdict, (or not unfrequentedly, an Excommunication) against the King, and whole Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> But let him tell you too, How often the Legate (a later) and other Domineering, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting Agents from that proud See, have been kept on the further side of the Dike, and not suffered <hi>transfretare,</hi> unless upon such Terms, as our Governours would admit of, and prescribe, notwithstanding all the power they pretended, or produced from his holiness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to this last Charge (wherein much of the present occasion seems to lie) Whether your Church in her Head, in her Members, in her Decretalls, in her Canon-Law, in some of her approved Councills, have not made such Declarations as must warn (nay compel) all Princes and States, to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29697:7"/>
Laws against such Encroachments? Doe but (I beseech you) peruse what the present Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> has both candidly, and charitably, offered you: I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with instancing in a few; Let the Language of <hi>Clement</hi> the eights <hi>Brevis</hi> (when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had (now) one foot in the Grave) be first heard; He strictly (therein) <hi>Forbids all his Catholicks to suffer any to succeed (how near soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Bloud, or Right) unless such as should preingage to become a Vassal to this</hi> Romish <hi>Church.</hi> And (to see the luck of a thing) these <hi>Breves</hi> were directed to the hand of one <hi>Henry Garnet</hi>; who, not long after, was found to have, more then a finger, in the Powder-plot: With one Arm he would have kept King <hi>Iames</hi> from; with the other, he would have blown Him out of His three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Next, be pleased to consult <hi>Bellermine</hi> (who was made, in his time, and I think esteemed so ever since, but a little lower then the very <hi>Pope.)</hi> Ask him, <hi>How we can be assured that his Catholicks will prove good Subjects?</hi> His answer is legible <hi>(Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Clericis) They stand not bound to the Laws of any Prince coactively; but directively onely?</hi> Ask him further, <hi>What if they will not be directed, but tread those Laws under their feet? Yet</hi> (says he, with the same front, and truth) <hi>they may by no means receive punishment, by any secular Magistrate, nor at all be brought before His Trybunal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if they should chance (and what has been may be) to be found ingaged in Treason? The words of <hi>Zimanca</hi> (in his <hi>Aphorismes, de Confessione)</hi> are positive, <hi>A Clerks Rebellion is not Treason; for he is not Subject to the King:</hi> This is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well for the Clergy, the Notion being extended (as they intend it) to all their several Orders of Monks and Fryars. But what say they to the Laity? Take the summ of the whole matter from <hi>Creswell,</hi> who, in pure love (no doubt) to his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29697:8"/>
Country-men, gives this Forraign Advice; <hi>It is an undoubted point of Faith</hi> (says he) <hi>that any Christian Prince whatsoever, if he have manifestly swarved from the Catholick Faith, and would draw others to do so, falls immediately from His Power, and Dignity; and that, even before the Pope have given Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, His Subjects may, and ought, if they have power, to remove Him: (Andr'. Philopat'. page</hi> 109. <hi>Edit.</hi> 1592.)</p>
            <p>It were no hard task, here to rake together, more then a good many of such Dictates as these, from men of this stamp, whose Works have been Licensed, Approved, Printed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and generally sold through all <hi>Popish</hi> Countries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction; and in this case, it may well be said, <hi>Qui malum non prohibet, cum prohibere potest, perpetrat.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Mariana's</hi> shameful Book, was once at a Crittical season (for fear of a worse clap) censured at <hi>Paris</hi>; but it was never so at <hi>Rome</hi>: And I doe verily doubt the common Doctrine of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (with their Adhaerents) will be found, that the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Knots, of Promises, Oaths, or Vows, made for fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to temporal Princes, may be cut asunder by their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Alexander,</hi> who (unjustly) would usurpe both the Swords; and (perhaps) is sorry he hath not more Worlds to conquer.</p>
            <p>Suffer me now, for a Conclusion, and to abate a little the surprise you may be in, at the severities, at present, exercised towards you, (though the late Proclamations, as well as the Statutes, must needs quit us from any blame in that behalf) to remind you of one or two things, in which I have proof, more then abundant; and of which, some (yet living) can give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. 'Tis confest, some of you gave signal, and very brave Assistances to Our late Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the First, in those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Warrs, (upon what Accompt, or Motive, let it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided at the last day;) but, that the whole Body of <hi>Romanists,</hi> could have been content to have sat down under a very Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29697:8"/>
in stead of the true Oake, was manifest from the Addresses pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come from them all; wherein the <hi>Catholick</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (in a Book Publish't presently after <hi>Anno</hi> 1652. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, with a great many Arguments for his favour) tells <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, They had generally taken, and punctually kept the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>(In that <hi>Page,</hi> towards the latter end; which, in that I have, is mark't 41. but should be 127.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, it would make one admire, how (after the good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices Mr. <hi>Huddleston,</hi> the honest <hi>Pendrills</hi> &amp;c. had done His present Majesty) the <hi>Irish,</hi> of the same Communion, and Creed, could be perswaded to lay aside, their own commendable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. The Natives of that Kingdom were (most of them) upon the accompt of the bloudy Insurrection, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Call, and subject to grievous paenalties at His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Restauration: But He, according to His Princely clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, required them, onely to let Him have new <hi>Tests</hi> of their future Loyalty, under the Obligation of those Oaths, you now stick at: He was pleased to allow them (since they seem'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the thing, but onely were dissatisfied in certain expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and those Formes were not Establish't in <hi>Ireland</hi>) after Consultation with their own Priests, to offer Him, what might be Equivalent thereto: They did so, and after some time, shew'd it to the King: He was willing to accept it, according to that Draught: But one of the Popes best be-trusts, then at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> hastens (in that nick of time) to School them better; and they neither durst (it seems) nor would proceed further in that business: And what use then) can a through Paced <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> make of his own Conscience? if, after such means, being arrived at settlement, he must yet throw away all, and implicitly give up his Faith, to the most imperiously Politick Dictates, of an old (perhaps) doting mortal-man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29697:9"/>And, now Sirs, methinks I hear you say, what I have heard some of you say often (and I verily think sincerely.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you are wholly ignorant (which is, in this case, the best sort of innocency) of any Design against His Majesties Person, or Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That, if the Pope himself should Invade this Land, and Warr against the King, you would fight under the Royal Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and endeavour to cut His throat as soon as any mans.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it's a sad thing, if a few hare-brain'd fellows have imbarked in a desperate Action, the whole Communion (though innocent) should be involved in the suffering part.</p>
            <p>As to the two first, I can say little, but this: If I were a Papist (and durst consider the true state of things, and the wilde Expectation of the <hi>Roman See</hi> in these matters) I should not know, how to make my due Obedience to my Soveraign, and my necessary submission to the <hi>Pope's</hi> commands, lodge in one Breast? And for the last, I doe concurr with you. 'Tis, indeed, a very sad thing; but (Gentlemen) if you will not do it your selves, Who can distinguish you? What I have now said, I have said with clear intentions, with an ardent desire to serve you; and after a long dilligent Search (to which no man living could be more Engaged then my self.) If any of you desire a farther Discussion of things here briefly touched (either in order to clearer satisfaction, or with a Design of Opposition) they shall at any Opportunitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, from</p>
