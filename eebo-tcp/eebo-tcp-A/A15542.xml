            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <item>First the propertie is that which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to some kinde only, although not to euery persone comprehended vnder the same kind.

As to haue the gift of reason doeth signifie the minde, whiche is one parte of man, for man himself is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pact of body and minde.</p>
               <p>A Propertie doth signifie a certaine thing, Whiche is attributed to Man when he is made, and as a man woulde say, doth come after, when man is holy made, as to be able to speake, to laugh, to go vpright.</p>

               <p>RElatiues are those, whiche are comprehended with other, or the whiche are named, one with another, and (as a man

would say) haue a mutuall respect, one to another.</p>
               <p>The other predicamentes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed, were absolutely spoken, so that we maie vnderstande by one, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same woorde, what it meaneth. As we may perceiue what a man is, although we ioyne nothyng to hym, wee knowe what Iustice is, although we compare hym with none other thyng. But these Relatiues, cannot bee so well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standen, excepte we ioyne some thyng to them. As when I saie a father, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not so call hym, excepte I vnderstande a so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne that he hath. So that euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is called a father, in respect that he hath a sonne, or els not. Again, no body can be called a Schole Master, except he haue scholers. There is no husband except he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e a wife.</p>
               <p>Therefore we maie se, that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues are referred euermore to another, neither can thei bee taken absolutely, without hauyng respect, to some other worde. There is no worde, but we maie considre thesame to bee a Relatiue, if we referre it to some other thyng, and
<pb facs="tcp:2929:29"/>
therefore wee maie go throughout all the predicame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, with this one place, and finde relacion in euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Those that are referred to some thyng, are of two sortes. First thei are properly so called, as the father, and the sonne, the master, and his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neither can thei be considered, excepte thei bee compared with some other, for when one is called father, he is proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly so called, because he hath a sonne, and thereof hath he his proper beyng.</p>
               <p>Again relatiues, vnproperly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are those seuerall woordes, whiche are knowen, &amp; haue their beyng, euen when thei stande alone: and yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with other, thei haue diuerse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes. as loue, is the loue of the thyng loued. Or thus, loue beholdeth the thyng loued. Faithe beholdeth that thyng, whervnto it leaueth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where as Paule saieth, we beyng iustified by faithe, haue peace before God, it is asmuche to saie, that we are not receiued for the worthinesse of the qualitee, but for his sake, that is the sonne of God. For I praie you, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2929:29"/>
leaueth faithe, or what thyng doeth it els behold? Sauyng onely our Lorde Iesus, that died freely once for al. Or els thus, Relatiues are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, (and yet vnproprely) whiche are not accordyng to their propre beeyng, but accordyng as thei are so named, whereof the .vj. predicamentes that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, beare the name.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2929:35"/>A diuision, is either the deuidyng of a worde, or of a thyng.

               <p>A diuision of the thyng is .iij. wayes considered, for either it is whan the generall is deuided into his kynde, the whole into his partes, or els whan the substaunce is deuided into his acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. The generall is deuided into his kynde thus, as an Element is deuided into the fier, the aier, the water, and the yearth. A common weale is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the state of people whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are rule, &amp; also into that powre where the beste, and wisest haue the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and thirdly into ones hande whiche alone beareth the stroke and is chief magistrate.

The whole nature of suche que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stions are thoroughlie sene by vsyng of this order. Euery single question is eight waies examined, first to aske whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the thing be, or no. As thus. Is there any one man that maye be called wise? Is there any lawe? Is there any frendship vpon yearth? This question is often proued, either by experience, or els by authoritee of the wise. Therfore in questionyng what the thyng is, we muste declare the very nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as if I shall speake of frendshippe, I will
<pb facs="tcp:2929:38"/>
first be at a pointe of what frendshyp I must speake. For frendship is of two sortes. The one is true &amp; perfect frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe, whiche commeth from the hart for vertues sake, and is onely among good men: the other is fay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed fauour, when one for lucre beareth a fayre face outwardely, and fedeth inwardly a maliciouse stomake. And this is the commune frendshippe, wherof the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked onely are partakers. The seconde question is, to aske what a thyng is. And this cometh from the definition, whiche is of two sortes. either of the substaunce of any thyng, or els of the name. Of the name as thus, a realme is that countrey whiche is ruled by a kyng. Of the substance thus. A realme is a gatheryng of people together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng able to liue, and withstande other for preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, abiding se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall.

                  </gap>ce which commaundeth thynges in ordre, to be done, and forbiddeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. The third question is, when the partes, and euery seuerall kynde is considered, &amp; for this question the deuision and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb facs="tcp:2929:39"/>
dooe much good. As the lawe of the Gospell and the politicall lawe. The fourthe question is to aske what are the causes, and especially what is the efficient cause, and what is the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cause, or the ende of any thyng. The efficient cause of all good lawes, is God, and his minister. The finall cause, or the end, is to liue vprightlie in the feare of God, and to walke all the daies of our life in the obseruacion of his holy will. The fifte question is, when the effecte, the office, or propre workyng is examined. As the effecte of the lawe is, to conserue the state of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to continue peace vniuersally, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace wealth, and make loue betwixt all. The syxt question is when thinges be asked that happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after, or the which haue great affinite, or likelyhode toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As if lawes be kept and folowed, we se our childrens children waxe to welth. We se muche neyghbourhode and good will to helpe the needie, &amp; so forth. The seuenth is to aske what are disagreyng. As from the lawe, dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth rebellion, stubbournesse, pryde,
<pb facs="tcp:2929:39"/>
with other. The eight question is to bryng in witnesse, &amp; to showe by whose authoritee the lawe taketh place. The scripture teacheth that God gaue the lawe to Moses, and Poule with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also, and Christ himself commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euery man to obeye the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in all thynges, that are not direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely repugnaunt from the wil of God.

As I maie thus reason, that theft should be punished, because it is a vice, or a mischeuous deede, and
<pb facs="tcp:2929:49"/>
then thus I knit vp myne argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Euery vice or mischeuous diede is to be punished.</p>
                  <p>Theft is a vice, or a mischeuous diede.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thefte is to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here we se thre proposicions, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, whereof the first is called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,</hi> that is to saie, the proposicion at large. the seconde is called <hi>Minor,</hi> that is to saie, the seuerall proposicion. the thirde is called <hi>conclusio.</hi> that is, the lappyng vp of all. And here we muste note, that like as there be thre Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, euen so there bee thre diuerse endynges, called in Latine, <hi>Termini,</hi> of the which, thone is called the terme at large, in the first proposicion onely, and afterwarde is referred, to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the conclusion, called <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conclusionis.</hi> The second terme is called the seuerall, whiche is in the second proposicion, &amp; this is the worde whereof the question is made, &amp; is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the conclusion. The thirde is called the double repeate, whiche is
<pb facs="tcp:2929:50"/>
twise rehersed, before the conclusion, and therefore it is twise rehersed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the knitting together, of the ij. proposicions, and the cause, why the former part of the proposicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (wherof a thyng is saied,) and the last rehersed part, (beyng attributed to the part go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng before,) are ioyned together in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. As to make the thyng plain by the former argument, I will proue this conclusion. Thefte is to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Thefte is called the former parte whereof this worde (punished) is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and this worde (punished) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called the last rehersed part, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause it is spoken of theft, which went before. Now to make my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to proue this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce true, I must seke a worde, whiche is more generall then that, whiche is proued. And that worde that commeth to my mynd, &amp; is pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to the cause, beyng more vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall: (for euery thyng that is proued, is proued by a thyng more knowen) that same worde or reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is called the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repete. whose propertie is twise to be rehersed in an argument, and that
<pb facs="tcp:2929:50"/>
in the first and seconde proposicion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enteryng into the conclusion, as thus. Euery vice is to bee punished, (vice) is the double repete, which must be rehersed in the seconde proposicion, (for I saied before) it must be twise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed because it maie be euident, that the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <p>Euery vice is to be punished</p>
                  <p>Theft is a vice.</p>

               <p>That whiche I am, thou art not</p>

               <p>Here is ambiguite in this verbe (I am) far if it be vnderstanded in the first propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this worde (I am) is not considered accordyng to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall substaunce, but according to the qualitie, or rather propre beyng, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuersitie of men, as when I liue, I haue mine own bodie, my flesh, and mine owne bones, thou hast thyne also propre vnto the, and not that I am thou, nor thou art I. Then it is well sayde, that whiche I am, thou art not. But if I vnderstand this word (I am) in the first proposition as a substaunce vniuersall, or rather generall copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to be rehersed of the inferiors, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not good. For as I may saie, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Aristotle</hi> is a man, so I maie saye of al men. Whereby we may see here also foure partes, or endinges, and therfore the argument must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied at the first, geuyng this reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue shewed before.</p>
               <p>Nowe that I haue set forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes whiche are to be obserued in an argument, I will declare howe to seat
<pb facs="tcp:2929:56"/>
be &amp; place an argument, that any bodie may geue a reason, why euery worde is set in an argument, in this, or that place. First therfore we must considre, there be foure figures, whiche serue for the makyng of an argument, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des also, whiche teache the ordering of propositions whether they shalbe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal, particular, affirmatiue, or nega<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue. I wil define them both after this sorte.</p>
               <p>A figure is a lawfull placing of the double repeate, in the twoo proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and euen as the double repeate is placed, so we maie iudge with ease in what figure the argument is. The first figure is such an order of proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate must be the former part in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first proposition, and the last rehersed parte in the second proposition, where vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion doth folow. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that it must be so, is because that where as in this figure the argument is euermore made from the generall, to the kynde vniuersally, (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position euermore in these two figures
<pb facs="tcp:2929:56"/>
must be vniuersal, either affirmatiue, or negatiue) and because of the general worde, there is sumwhat rehersed of the kynde: one of the propositions must be so placed, that it may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the kynde is encluded in the general. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the seconde proposition of the kynde.</p>
               <p>A mode, is a lawfull placing of propositions in there due qualitie, or quantitie. I call that in the propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a qualitie, when it doth affirme or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. I call it a quantitie, when it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniuersal, or particular. Unto the first figure belong foure modes, which may be perceiued by these .iiij. wordes.</p>

               <p>We answere to the matter, ij. wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, either generally, or particularly. A generall answere is made thre wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes.

As thus, the libertiues reason.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>What soeuer is naturall, that same is not euill.</p>
                  <p>To synne is a thyng naturall.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The seuerall or seconde proposicion is not true. And therfore the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, when the fault is bothe in the matter, &amp; in the maner of makyng, we must refuse the argument, &amp; shewe the faultes plainly. As thus.</p>

               <p>And now will I tell particularly, euery deceiptfull argument, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suche a subtle argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe vsed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in disputacion, or priuate talke: any one may espie the fault out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and shewe in whiche of these capcious reasons, the subteltie resteth.</p>
               <p>And first, a false conclusion, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte vsed in an argument, whereby one vnder the colour of truth, goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute, to inuegle the hearer, or thus, a false conclusion is an argument, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng to the ignorant, as though it wer true, and yet is nothyng true at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle doth deuide them into two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.

and maie be taken two waies, and that the fault is rather in the kynd and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speakyng, then in the matter or very thyng it selfe.

When Christ bad those which were healed of the leprosy: Go &amp; shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfes to the Priest, our forfathers applied this saiyng to confession, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that euery one was bonde in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science vnder payne of damnation, to confesse his sinnes to the priest euerye yere ones, whereas Christes meanyng was nothynge so, &amp; therfore they ware moche deceyued in the maner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng. This order was in the olde lawe as we maye read in <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers came not into the towne, but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happened to be whole, and amended, he was first commaunded to shew him selfe to the priest, that the curate seing his bodie cleane, might be a witnesse to
<pb facs="tcp:2929:130"/>
the parishe of his amendement, and so the man after that, might the rather be suffered to go abrode, and be in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with other men.</p>
               <p>But euen as they haue fondely wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted this place to confession, euen so might light women, and euil disposed wyues, abuse their husbandes fondely, expoundyng sainct Paules wordes in the .vij. of the first, to the Corinthians, where he saith. The wife is bonde to the lawe, as longe as her husbande ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, but if her husbande slepe, she is at lybertie to marie wyth whome she wyll. God forbidde, women shoulde take this aduauntage of theyr husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des slepyng, as the Romish folke haue abused all men wakyng. Slepe in this texte, signifieth nothyng but death, and yet, might women aswell abuse this texte, as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue abused christes saiyng, for the maintenaunce of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Therfore the propretie of euery speche, and the maner of speakynge ought alwaies to be obserued: we say in Englishe some time, to some one with whom we are offended, Ah sirrha ye are
<pb facs="tcp:2929:130"/>
an honeste man indede, and yet we do not meane that he is honest indede, but thinke rather that he is a naughty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. So likewyse, Christe when he should be taken of the Iewes saide to his Apostles, <hi>Dormite &amp; requiescite,</hi> slepe one syrs, and take your rest, not that he would they should so do, but to ther rebuke and shame he spake it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were careles, and toke there rest. So Paule rebukyng the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, bycause thei made heathen men their iudges, and pleaded there causes vnder them, said, if there be no body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge you to heare your owne causes, make vile persons and abiectes, to be Iudges emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst you. Not that he wold it shoulde so be, but to their shame, he spake it, as he saith hymselfe. Also vnto this place maye be referred the kynd of phrase propre to euery tonge. As where it is in the gospell. <hi>Non exibit, donec vltimum quadrantem soluerit,</hi> he shal not go out, vntil he hath payd the las<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:2929:131"/>

Although the papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes referre this place to purgatory, most vainely and vnlearnedly. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent causeth ambiguite, by reason of the affinitie in wordes, as when one hath lost al the money in his purse, and for lacke of coyne is fayne to holde the candel: for an other man when he seeth the same bodie doe his duetie with his cappe of, to his better, to say merely by the waye of a sute to the worthiest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: I praye you syr let this good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe be couered, he is bare, where as bare signifieth a bare purse: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as a bare heade, and is properlye so sayde. Againe and moste aptely this subtiltie taketh place, when sentences be euill pointed, and the sense therby

depraued, as some that mainteine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by workes, haue strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused a texte of sainct Augustine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the point plaine, whereas it shuld be an interrogatiue, and hath bene of late yeres so founde in an olde writen hand.

Therefore errors doo often chaunce, when we comprehende the whole, speakyng onely of the part, or when we make the signe, to bee the very self thyng, and although ye haue had childishe examples before, onely to make the matter plain, ye shall se that in weightie matters, this deceiptfull argument hath been vsed.</p>

               <p>By this meanes we shall haue no kyngdome, no lawe, no political order, no trade, no discipline, no iudgement for offendours. But this argument is to be reiected, because it is deryued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the part, to the whole. For although many thynges be amisse in a politicall bodie, yet the whole therfore must not be dissolued, the lawes must not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, nor yet good order aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned: for the chiefe thynge that is in euerie empire is a thing, ordeined of God, and a righteous thyng, as for an example. Political order, lawes, statutes, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, execution, and punyshyng of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours, and therefore they reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, that saye there is an abuse in a politicall ordre, therefore we shal haue no order at all in anie common weale, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:2929:138"/>
agayne ye shall perceyue, that there is more in the conclusion, then was reher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed in the two former propositions. Therfore we ought diligently to note the circumstaunce of the thyng, if we will auoyde this subtiltie, and when a thyng is spoken in parte, we must not thereby iudge the whole: or measure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuersall, by that whiche is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder the generall.</p>

               <p>This is from the inferior to the vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersall, whiche is not well gathered, as it standeth here: for although a man maie forsake his wife, beyng naught of her bodie, yet maye he not forsake an honest woman, when it liketh hym to change. for this worde (wife) in the first proposition, is hedged with her circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therfore Plato in his .iiij. booke where he framed his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale, doth well mitigate this <hi>Hiperbola,</hi> in this sentence whiche semeth credible (God doth al thynges, &amp; orders euery action) saiyng, I do wel allowe this sentence, that God ruleth al thynges, but so not withstandyng I allowe it, if it be well vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

There be foure thynges (saieth he) which should not be examined by reason. And first no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to argue of those thynges wherein if any one put doubte, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth punishement. As to reason whether there be a God or no. And therefore Tullie sayeth very wel, it is a wicked and an vngodly custome, to dispute or talke against God, either in
<pb facs="tcp:2929:172"/>
earnest, or yet in sporte. Again it is fond<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, to reason of those thynges which our senses iudge to be true. As to know by reason, whether fire be hote, or no. the whiche were madnesse to aske, and surely, if any one should so reason with me, I would bidde hym putte his fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it. Thirdely, it is euell to reason of those thynges, whiche can not bee knowen by mans witte. As to knowe what God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father is in persone, what the holy ghoste is, howe they sytte and are placed in heauen, or of what makyng the soule of man is. Fourthlie, to talke and dispute of those thynges, whiche are vndoubtedly true. As in Arithmetike .iii. and .iij. are syx. In Philosophie. The whole is greater then the parte. In all whiche matters to moue any earnest questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ouermuch in thinges nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull, is either starke madnesse, or els playne foolyshnesse.
