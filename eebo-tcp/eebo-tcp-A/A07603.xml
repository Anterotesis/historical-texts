            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
                  <p>THat which here I offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy view, courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is, as the title doth shew, the translation of a booke imprinted certaine yeares since, and published in the Arabicke tongue: Yet when, or where, or by whom, is not, as vsually the manner is, in the same any where expressed or declared. It was first written, as the Author himselfe seemeth to intimate, about 600 years since. Who he was, and what, I dare not for certaine affirme; Many of the obiections, demands, answers, arguments, and speeches are too good to be thought to come from the breast of an Heathen, Turke, or Saracen: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of them many scarce good enough to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vpon a well grounded Christian. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration first mooued me to iudge it framed by some Christian, in disgrace and confutation of
<pb facs="tcp:13066:3"/>
that fond and foolish religion. Yet when I called to mind, that I had heard many Merchants, and especially M. W. G. a worshipfull Gentleman, who did spend the better part of his youth continually resident amongst them, That it was a common thing to heare from themselues such like obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doubts made against their law. Againe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I considered, that whatsoeuer is here alledged and layd downe, though neuer so good and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianlike; Or contrariwise absurd and monstrous; is notwithstanding found and read in that their law: And lastly, seeing that my selfe can testifie that from their owne mouthes I haue heard; and can shew in their bookes and tractates the like morall sayings, and zealous exhortations vnto vertue, and holinesse of life; I then altered that mine opinion, and did verily beleeue it to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by some Saracen or Mohametane, who did in truth make these doubts and demands, as being desirous of better satisfaction. If any man shall obiect and say, as the consistorie of Rome did by the Talmud, That it were better that such foolish fables and blasphemies were concealed and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppressed, then made publike and common to all: I answer, I haue done no more, nay not so
<pb facs="tcp:13066:3"/>
much, as the ancient Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Epiphanius, Augustine,</hi> and others, who haue taken vpon them to confute the errors and opinions of Heretiks, haue done. <hi>Nullum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim est dogma, insigniter impium &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersum in Alcorano, quod non extet in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris eorum quos antea indicaui, Irenaei, Tertulliani, scriptorum Ecclesiasticae histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, Epiphanij, Philastrij, Augustini; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum libri saepius foetant propè quàm cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi: Et Typograghi quaestum inde non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguum tolerant, &amp; rem studiosis bonae lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturae inprimis gratam faciunt. Quaedam etiam absurdiora in veterum haeresium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptionibus reperiuntur, quà Alcoran protulerit, &amp;c.</hi> For in the Alkoran, saith a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuine, there is no one opinion so impious &amp; wicked, which may not be found in the bookes of those writers which I haue before spoken of; to wit, <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> the Ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, <hi>Epiphanius, Philastrius,</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>; whose bookes do breed wellnere as oft as conies: And the printers do thereby reape no small gaines, and withall do deserue very well of all good students. Some things also, in the discoueries
<pb facs="tcp:13066:4"/>
of old heresies, are met withall, more absurd and grosse, then the Alkoran doth afford any. But the examples following, being of the same nature, &amp; practised by graue iudicious Diuines, are more proper to our purpose. Peter, Abbot of Cluniak, a man highly commended in his time, for learning, religion, and Christian charitie, did well nere 500 yeares since, cause Robert of Reading our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, to translate the Alkoran or lawes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed into the Latine tongue; Which translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was by the said Peter dedicated vnto S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, that famous Abbot of Clareuall. At the end of which his translation you shall find this which followeth; <hi>Illustri glorioso<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

The Councell of Vienna, celebrated by Pope Clement the 5, in the yeare of our Lord 1311, hath an act enioyning certaine Vniuersities to maintaine Professours of
<pb facs="tcp:13066:4"/>
the Arabicke tongue, for the translating of books out of that language into Latine. Now, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man truly gathereth, those holy Fathers had no care of Physicke and Astronomie, but of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie onely: and therefore they meant of the Alko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran and such others concerning religion. Not long after this, Iohn Bishop of Segouia, offered vnto the Councell of Constance, the Alkoran by him translated and confuted. In the yeare of our Lord 1543, Theodorus Bibliander, (animated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto and commended by Philip Melanthon) did publish and imprint the aforesaid version of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinensis</hi> the English-man. Within foure or fiue years after this edition, Andreas Arriuabene tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Alkoran, as he saith, out of Arabicke into Italian: The title by himselfe praefixed to that his edition is thus; <hi>L'Alcorano di Macometto, nel qual si contiene la Dottrina, la Vita, i Costumi, &amp; le Legge sue, tradotto noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente dall'Arabo, in lingua Italiana; Con Gratie, e Priuilegij,</hi> M.D.XLV II. The Alko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran of Machomet, in which is contained his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Life, Customes &amp; Lawes, translated new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Arabicke into the Italian tongue. When as in deed that translation of his is nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:13066:5"/>
                     <hi>Retinensis</hi> Italionated; neither do I thinke that he vnderstood much Arabicke. Thus you see what presidents I haue, for that which is done: Such as I doubt not, but will fully satisfie the learned and indifferent: the peeuish and froward, I weigh not: this paines was not taken for them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I know may please them that is not of their owne breeding. Neither do I see what benefite the vnlearned may reape by it. Now concerning the thing it selfe, I do giue the Reader to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, (the louers of these studies, and such as haue seene the booke can testifie that I speake the truth) That the copie that I haue followed, was so badly imprinted, that in verie many places I was constrained to diuine and guesse. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if in any place I haue failed, it is not much to be maruelled. Notwithstanding, although I will not say, that I haue failed in any particular: yet I dare boldly affirme, that I haue hit the generall scope and purpose of the Author, which for the thing it selfe might haue bene sufficient. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this generalitie, for the benefite of students, which I especially aimed at, I haue so set it foorth that they might be bettered by it: And therefore I haue tied my selfe, as neare as the English
<pb facs="tcp:13066:5"/>
phrase would suffer me, vnto the words of the Arabicke. Wherefore for their sakes, which are desirous to vnderstand that language, and for that purpose do please to vse this our labour, we haue, in the margent of this our booke, set downe the numbers answering to the pages of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicke copie. Truth it is, that in that booke you shall find no such numbers expressed: but that want any man with his pen may easily supply. If I haue added any thing to helpe the English, that we haue caused to be imprinted in an Italica letter.</p>

                        <p>There is no question of that: For the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ, and his Apostles combined together with one consent, carried them, and by preaching <hi>spread</hi> them into euery corner of the world.</p>

                        <p>It must be confessed that this did arise out of the ignorance of the Scribe: And that it ought to be corrected, and that text be made to agree with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther texts agreeing betweene themselues, especially with those texts, and most ancient bookes which were the first, and best corrected, that is, with <hi>those written in</hi> the languages of Abraham, the Syrians, Greekes, and Latines.</p>

                        <p>So in the same manner therefore the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do say, That Christ was the Sonne of God: Because he is his word; and God is the Father: For he was begotten of him; as the speech is begotten of Reason; and as of the Sunne, the beames. Now as reason and speech are of one &amp; the same essence; And the nature of the Sunne, and of his raies are one and the same: So Christ the <hi>Sonne,</hi> with the Father hath one and the same nature; And the essence of <hi>them</hi> is one and the same: And therefore <hi>they are</hi> but one God, and not two Gods. Now because that our Prophet in the Assora intituled <hi>Annesa,</hi> saith, That Christ is the word of God; we must needs, in regard of the former demonstrations a little before <hi>premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> also confesse, That he is the Sonne of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is his word, and is borne of him: it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth therefore, That there is but one God. For the essence <hi>of both</hi> being but one; also the diuine nature is but one <hi>and the same.</hi> And to say without any ground, That God almightie should not haue a Son without a Wife, were mere madnesse: For God is a very spirit: and in this diuine generation there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no vse of a woman. Whosoeuer denieth this, denieth also <hi>and saith,</hi> that God is not an essence. For in God there is no dimension. He denieth also <hi>and
<pb facs="tcp:13066:21"/>
saith,</hi> that God doth not liue. For he doth not eate. Now this is mere ignorance and a great madnesse.</p>

                        <speaker>AH.</speaker>
                        <p>This is plaine, that God doth not eate to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine life, as man doth: otherwise he should not be God.</p>

                        <p>But this is a foule error, for this reason one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If the Mosaicall bookes and the Gospell had bene altered; or if they should haue bene one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to another, our Prophet would not haue said, That his writings should bee corrected by those bookes. And in like manner it cannot be said, That they were corrupted, for this one other reason also: For the Christians and the Iewes are contrary <hi>one to another,</hi> and there was <hi>alwaies</hi> enmity betweene them: But the text to them both is but one and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> same. In a word, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of the Iewes, doth agree with the Greeke and Latine <hi>texts</hi> word for word. Furthermore, after <hi>the daies</hi> of our Prophet, which was after Christ, somewhat more then 600 yeares, as I told thee yesterday, there were alwaies hereticks, as Arians, Nestorians, Iacobites, &amp; others; seeing that they all haue one Gospell agreeing in all points: And for that because in diuerse languages, in the which they are found written: And that in all corners &amp; kingdomes of the world, the text is found so to agree, that not so much as in one <hi>iot or</hi> title they do disagree; seeing it is thus, <hi>I say,</hi> it cannot be iustly said, that the Iewes and Christians haue agreed, throughout the whole world, of such diuerse nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to blot ought out of the bookes aforesaid. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it satisfie reason to say, That they haue blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> out the name of our Prophet, who in the Alko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, in many places doth commend Christ, and the Virgine Mary his mother. Therefore if the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had put out any names, they would haue put out
<pb facs="tcp:13066:22"/>
the name of the Iew, which was the cause of his death; or the name of Pilate, who crucified Christ; not Mohammed, that commendeth <hi>him.</hi>

                        <p>We do also say, he is a generall Prophet to all Prophets.

                        <p>Because I do see that God Almighty would first that the Gospell should be for a generall law to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> all men: And therefore God of all goodnesse gaue the knowledge of all tongues miraculously to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and to his Disciples and Preachers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they by &amp; by preached it throughout the whole world: and the Gospell was written in all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Now this thing was requisite for vs also to do, both for the honour of God, and his praise, as also for the saluation of our soules, throughout all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world; seeing that our Prophet doth say in the Chapter Amran, That no one man shall

                        <p>I told thee, that our Prophet saith, that himselfe doth not vnderstand his owne law; but God onely <hi>doth vnderstand it</hi>: for he is most skilfull. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can teach it, or know how to preach it?</p>

                        <p>Because that in the Alkoran there is in truth no sentence written, but it may be vnderstood of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that vnderstandeth the Arabicke tongue: Yea and thou knowest it: for thou had read much.</p>

                        <p>But let vs leaue all other demonstrations, and let vs consider this one sentence onely, to wit, that saying, (That God gaue his law in the world, which may not be vnderstood, especially of those which follow i,t) it is beyond the <hi>reach</hi> of reason, and <hi>compasse</hi> of faith.</p>

                        <p>Truth it is, that this is strange: yet it may not be spoken of God Almightie. For an vnderstanding and iust man, doth not command to another man, any thing but that which he doth vnderstand, which is within his abilitie, &amp; is possible for him to do. And so if God be most wise and iust, he will not force the soule to any thing, but that which is within compasse of it. This confession is sound, and thus we ought to

Now seeing that our Prophet did not onely write that he had many wiues: but he writeth also that he loued his maide, and lay with her; and thereupon when Aïsha his wife was angry <hi>with it</hi> and rebuked him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised with a great oath, that he would abstaine from her bed: Yet afterward in the Chapter Atta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> Moreouer it is read also, that God willed him to lie with the wiues of the faithfull; that Prophets might be begotten by him; when as notwithstanding it is cleare, that there was
<pb facs="tcp:13066:25"/>
no Prophet begotten by him: For he did not leaue any issue male <hi>behind him.</hi> Seeing then that our law and the Alkoran is the law of God, which is iust and holy, how could our Prophet be absolued from that oath, which he did make concerning the lying with his maid, to saue himselfe from the breaking of the promise to <hi>his</hi> wife? And wherfore did God dispense with him, that he might haue the wife of Zeid; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this is not matrimonie, but fornication, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and iniquity? In the Chapter Bakara, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, That the wiues of men are <hi>as it were</hi> the seed-fields of the men, and euery man doth sow his wife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> as pleaseth him <hi>best.</hi> Moreouer he saith, That he is lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and is as strong for carnall copulation, as 40 men are. Item, that it is not lawfull for a woman after her separation and diuorce, the third time to come vnto her husband againe, except first she haue lien with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man once. Now this is a thing more vile then may be spoken: although we do obserue it, like as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precepts of our Prophet.

                        <p>The comming of the Angell vnto his gate, was a great miracle: Item, the conference also of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barak with him; Item, that in one moment and the twinkling of an eie he went that iourney, to wit, from Mecha vnto Ierusalem; where he found all the Prophets which long since were at rest: where our Prophet did call vpon them, and pray for them. Item, his visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Stayres from the earth vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

                        <p>Seeing that thou callest these things, miracles; answer me to this one other question of mine, which may be demanded of any skilfull and vnderstanding man, which is this; Our Prophet saith, All that before is spoken of, was done in one night, and yet neither his wife nor his maide did see Gabriel. Moreouer he saith also, That the Prophets which came, were the dead Prophets: Neither doth he say, that some of them were liuing. Wherefore if one should now say, That none of all these things were true; but were fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, that men might beleeue him, &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; what shalbe for an answer vnto this? For we haue no witnesses nor confirmation from the liuing; but he onely doth speake, and record, and also write so of him selfe.</p>

For he saith, This is solitary, and no man euer saw it; neither can we aske of any of them, whether this be true or false.</p>

                        <p>This also is necessary and worthy to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood &amp; considered of, how hee describeth the orbes from the beginning of the sphere vnto the end of the same: where he sayth, The first spheare is made of pure siluer: and the Starres are hanged vpon the first spheare by chaines <hi>made</hi> of brasse: The second spheare of pure gold: The third of precious stones <hi>or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="86"/> pearles:</hi> The fourth, of a Smaragd: The fifth, of pearles: The sixth, of <hi>Alahal.</hi> Now all this is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:13066:29"/>
by the Astronomers, and Philosophers: for Gold, Siluer, and Gemmes, <hi>or pretious Stones,</hi> are thicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and our eyes do not see through them, <hi>per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum transparentiae:</hi> that is, it is not possible that our sight should passe through them, from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is apparent: For the body of the Sun is in the fourth spheare, and yet it enlighteneth all the world: And Mercury is in the second; Venus in the third: Mars, in the fifth: Iupiter, in the sixth: Saturne in the seuenth: The Starres in the eight; which by reason that <hi>they</hi> go into certaine clouds they are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not seene of vs; as the Sun also, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Moone falleth betwen it &amp; vs. Now if our Prophet were true in this saying of his; that is, if the spheares were of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="87"/> Gold, and siluer, &amp; Gemmes; those things could not be seene of vs. But we do see the Starres, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest of the <hi>Planets</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as we haue said, this is false, and he is not true in his word.

therefore if the words bee <hi>so</hi> perspicuous, I say to thee againe the second time in sober sadnes, that thou and all such as thou art ought to obserue <hi>it</hi> well, and that for good reason: for our Prophet speaketh these words, and yet we do not translate <hi>them.</hi>

                        <p>We according to the saying of our Prophet are more abhominable then the Iews and Christians: for in the Chapter <hi>Baccara</hi> he saith, That the Iewes &amp; Christians shall go into Paradise.</p>

                        <p>With me that is firme and good that is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongst the learned in generall, and of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the world; that is, That the Iewes were afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and were dispersed, as it doth appeare plainely, 1000 yeares ago and more; and that they are without a Temple, without sacrifice, and without a Priest, for this sin of apostasie onely, which they did do against Christ, which was the Word of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="112"/> God, and his eternall Sonne, as I shewed thee yesterday.</p>

                        <p>This is not like vnto the misery of the Iewes: for in all that religion, the Christians haue a Priest, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13066:36"/>
Churches: and they do sacrifice their sacrifices, praise God, and his glorious name, not onely in the place where they haue the sole command; but also in Constantinople, Egypt, Arabia, in Ada the new,<note place="margin">

                           </note> in the Sea, and in all quarters of the world. Therefore we ought to say, that their miseries do testifie the loue of God toward them, as Salomon the wise doth affirme, <hi>when he sayth,</hi> That a good father doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise his sonne whom he loueth, very much: and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid the Prophet saith, The good through many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp; great tentations shall enter into the kingdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="113"/> of God: And moreouer, That the good are tried of God, as the gold which is tried in the fire. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I, when I do see man in felicity in this world; and according to his desire to <hi>enioy</hi> worldly matters, without any crosse at all, euen at that instant I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him. For Dauid the Prophet also saith, I haue seene the wicked exalted and magnified; and I went out, and he was gone; and I asked after him, and he was not to be found, and there was no signe of his place in the which he had bene. Therefore the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are in the Chapter Almaïda, cannot sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that the Christians, by reason of the misery which at some time they do suffer, are not the sonnes nor friends of God: but it doth teach the contrary; &amp; that by the testimony of Dauids owne words: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="114"/> is there any thing else that I am able to say <hi>to it.</hi>

For the confession of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not denied of the Iews, no nor of the Christians.

<pb facs="tcp:13066:38"/>
lofty matters as those precedent things, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are. And because he saith, Those books were giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="120"/> by God, he signifieth, that those bookes do containe all perfections and goodnesse.

                        <p>Yea, &amp; I do confesse, that from all eternity those bookes were holy: and therefore I do know that all the Musslemans do offend: and I do pity the case in which I do see they <hi>are</hi>: because I do see that we might finde those bookes, and reade <hi>them,</hi> and yet we do not. As it is said, we do leaue the white bread, &amp; that which is most pleasing: &amp; we do eat brown bread which is no way so pleasing in tast, nor so good for the body. And this difference there is betwene words of verity and truth, and falshood: For this is pleasant vnto the vnderstanding, and profitable to the soule: and that is no way pleasing, but hurtfull: for it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="121"/> vaine thing, and it hath no commodity in it, because it is false. But let this suffice: for I see the the rest do take downe <hi>their</hi> tents.

                  <p>THE booke of the famous impostour Mohammed the Arabian, called in that language the <hi>Koran,</hi> or, with the article, the <hi>Alkoran,</hi> is, as the word doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the Text, that is, the authenticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their law, and ground of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

For that interpretation deliuered by Robert of Reading our countreyman, and receiued for good by Peter Abbot of Cluniak, Ricoldus Florentinus, Demetrius Cydonius, Cantacuzenus the Grecian, Cardinall Cusa, and others, who would haue it to signifie <hi>Collectionem praeceptorum,</hi>

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>A collection of holy precepts,</hi> doth not expresse the true originall, or Etymology of the word. For the theame or roote, as they call it, from whence it is deriued, is not <hi>Karan,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne or knit together: but <hi>Kara',</hi> to reade, as all men skilfull in the Grammars of these Easterne tongues can beare me witnesse.</p>
                  <p>This booke is deuided into sundry sections or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which they call <hi>Assurats,</hi> or Azoara's, after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinensis expression.

The reason of this difference is thus: Some interpretours do not account the first for any Chapter, but make it a kinde of Preface or preamble. Retinensis of the second chapter, maketh foure: of the third, three: of the fourth, foure: of the fifth, two: and of the sixth, three: That is, the fiue first Chapters he deuideth into 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
