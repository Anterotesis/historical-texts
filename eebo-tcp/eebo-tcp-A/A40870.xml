            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, JOHN, Earl of ROCHESTER. Gentleman of His <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Bed-chamber.</head>
            <opener>My LORD,</opener>
            <p>OFFenders, long conniv'd at, come at last to be try'd for their Lives, and are forc'd to call upon their fatally indulgent friends to bring them off: for Volunteer Poets are at least as mad as those who, out of wantonness play themselves into the Gallies. 'Tis high time to cast my self at your Lordships, Feet, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg your Protection to this ride Piece, which grew the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by your incouragement. All Poems in their Dedications, ought to return to your Lordship, as all Rivers to the Sea, from whose depth and Saltness they are season'd and supply'd: none of them ever coming to your Lordship's hands, without receiving some of the rich Tinctures of your unerring Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and running with much more clearness, having past so fine a strainer. If this receives any approbation in the World, I must ascribe it principally to your Lordship's partial recommendations, and impartial corrections. Your Lordship is the first person in the World, by whom I have been Highly and Heroically oblig'd: and if the first Impressions of Gratitude, may be as strong and captivating, as those of the first Love; they must needs be much more lasting and immutable, in my Passion for your Lordship; since the World affords no object so high and admirable, ever
<pb facs="tcp:98113:3"/>
to work a change; your Lordship being the most accomplish'd of all Mankind, that I ever knew, read, or heard of, by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane testimony. Eminent Beings are as hard to be believ'd, as they are to be understood: and no Man can speak Truth of your Lordship's Superlative Endowments, without suspicion of Flattery; nor conceal them without conviction of Ignorance. That famous Temper of weight, so rarely found in Bodies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears most Illustriously in your Lordship's Mind. Judgement, and Fancy, seldom concurring in other Men, in any small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, are possest by your Lordship in the highest degree that ever was allow'd the Soul of Man; yet with so happy and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious a mixture, that neither of them predominate nor usurp; but, like two peaceful Colleagues in Empire, agree within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and govern the rest of the World; acting in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships noble, and elevated Mind, like Fire and Air in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Region, whose Purity makes them easily convertible, and mutually assistant, whilst they are always quarrelling and prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon each other, in gross inferior Bodies. What was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably said of my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his time, may much more justly be affirm'd of your Lordship, in yours; That if ever there were a beam of Knowledge, immediately deriv'd from God, upon any Man, since the Creation, there is one upon your self. Others, by wearisome steps, and regular gradations, climb up to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; your Lordship is flown up to the top of the Hill: you are an Enthusiast in Wit; a Poet and Philosopher by Revelation; and have already in your tender age, set out such new and glorious Lights in Poetry, yet those so Orthodox and Vnquestionable, that all the Heroes of Antiquity, must submit, or <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> be judg'd Nonconformists. For my part, I account it one of the great felicities of my life, to have liv'd in your age; but much greater, to have had access to your Person, and to have been cherysh'd and enlighten'd by the influences, and irradiations of so great a Luminary. For, I must confess, I never return from your Lordships most Charming and Instructive Conversation, but I am inspir'd with a new Genius, and improv'd in all those Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. I ever coveted the knowledge of: I find my self, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a better Poet, a better Philosopher; but, much more than these, a better Christian: your Lordship's-miraculous Wit; and
<pb facs="tcp:98113:3"/>
Intellectual pow'rs being the greatest Argument that ever I could meet with, for the immateriality of the Soul; they being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est exaltation of humane Nature; and, under Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, much more convincing to suspicious Reason, than all the Pedantick proofs of the most Learnedly peevish Disputants: so that, I hope, I shall be oblig'd to your Lordship, not only for my Reputation in this World, but my future Happiness in the next. Reflect then, my Lord, I beseech you, on your own sublime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the profuseness of your Favors, my powerful (though presumptuous) inclination to your Person, and judge if it be possible, for any other Man living to pay your Lordship so sincere and affectionate a Veneration, as</p>

                     <l>Its grosest part, but that which keeps it working:</l>
                     <l>Fame is my waiting-Woman, everywhere so officious,</l>

                     <l>A new-born Passion, for an unknown Lady.</l>

                     <l>Which might securely lye in its own Haven.</l>
                     <l>Mens minds, like Kingdoms, never so much flourish</l>
                     <l>As when they raise the price of Native Goods,</l>

                     <p>Why, there are several that have staid in the other World a little time: as some that have been in long Swoons, Apoplexies, and praeternatural Sleeps; others, that have been halfe-hang'd, cut down again, and recover'd. The other world, they say, is just such another place, as the Countreys of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, Brazile, Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi>: there are few that venture to go there, but such as can live here no longer; but, when they come thither, they find every thing so good there, that they never think of coming back again.</p>

<stage>Aside.</stage>
Why, thou shalt speak with one presently. I'm a dying man, thou know'st, and if I were hang'd out-right now, 'twere but some hours sooner; and a toy takes me i' th'head, to have thee put my Garter about my neck, and half hang me, that I may see what the other World is, we're going to: but be sure you leave pulling when I make signs to give o're.</p>

                     <p>Oh that would be fine, and pleasant, indeed, if I did not hurt you. But, Master, if I should hang you in good earnest, I should be hang'd for you.</p>

Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laudable custom of Malefactors, will I give this wicked World a short exhortation.</p>

                     <p>Good People, I am come hither to be a spectacle to Men and Angels, Criticks, and Devils; I am to pay a debt to Nature, which she has made over to a greedy Huswife call'd Fortune,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98113:42"/>
who calls for it in before the day of payment. But Death is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, Advantageous, and Necessary: Honourable in old Men, to make room for younger; Advantageous to those that get Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by it: and Necessary for Married people, that have no other Jayl-delivery. I am most justly brought hither to suffer this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death, and as my Legacy, do beqneath you an useful cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning that horrid and crying sin, that has brought me to this most Tragical end. My Godly Parents brought me up most virtuously, in hopes to have sold me to a Wife to the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: but at fifteen years of age, the Devil, the Devil grew pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in me, and tempted me to a sin, Nature would never have thought of (good people: I tremble to name it)

getting my Mother's Maid with Child. Ah, <hi>Bettina, Bettina,</hi> thou taughtst me a trick I could never leave since. Thy Sweet-meats, and thy Sugar-plums, have brought me to the Gallows. Hangman, I freely forgive thee; and more freely, than ever any dying man did. Do thy Office.</p>

                     <p>Oh the blessed sight!

                     <l>These invisible fools are the destruction</l>
                     <l>Of private Families, as well as States.</l>
                     <l>Nor are they easily to be prevented</l>
                     <l>By wiser men, because their follies are</l>

                     <p>Right. This sort of fools walk always with dark Lanthorns; and they ought more to be fin'd for wearing Vizors over their follies, than others over their faces.</p>

                     <l>I think, indeed, they ought to be as punishables</l>
                     <l>By Law, as men that cover their Wells and Coal-pits</l>

                     <p>Gentlemen, 'tis time to adjourn: There only rests, What punishment upon this grave offender?</p>

                     <p>Troth, Gentlemen, my opinion is, That all extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fools ought to have Pensions, instead of Punishments, especially those that bring up a new Mode of Folly. There is Honor due to Eminence in all things, and rewards for new inventions.</p>

                     <p>True; if all men were wise, there would be none to make sport with. Fools serve for honest men to laugh at, as well as Knaves to prey upon.</p>

                     <p>I, more than that; if there were no Fools, there would be no Wits. Every new Fool begets a new Play; either as the Subject, or the Composer.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE, As it was spoke by Mr. <hi>Haines.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>AS Charms are Nonsence, Nonsence seems a Charm,</l>
            <l>Which hearers of all Judgment does disarm;</l>
            <l>For Songs and Scenes, a double Audience bring,</l>
            <l>And Doggrel takes, which Smiths in Sattin sing.</l>
            <l>Now to Machines, and a dull Mask you run,</l>
            <l>We find that Wit's the Monster you would shun,</l>
            <l>And by my troth 'tis most discreetly done.</l>
            <l>For since, with Vice and Folly, Wit is fed,</l>
            <l>Through Mercy 'tis, most of you are not dead.</l>
            <l>Players turn Puppets now at your desire,</l>
            <l>In their Mouth's Nonsence, in their Tails a Wire,</l>
            <l>They fly through Clouds of Clouts, and showers of Fire.</l>
            <l>A kind of loosing <hi>Loadum</hi> is their Game,</l>
            <l>Where the worst Writer has the greatest Fame.</l>
            <l>To get vile Plays like theirs, shall be our care;</l>
            <l>But of such <hi>awkard</hi> Actors we <hi>despair.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>False taught at first‚Äî</l>
            <l>Like Bowls ill byass'd, still the more they run,</l>
            <l>They're further off, then when they first begun.</l>
            <l>In Comedy their unweigh'd Action mark,</l>
            <l>There's one is such a dear familiar spark,</l>
            <l>He yawns, as if he were but half awake;</l>
            <l>And fribling for free speaking, does <hi>mistake.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>False accent and neglectful Action too</l>
            <l>They have both so nigh good, yet neither true,</l>
            <l>That both together, like an Ape's mock face</l>
            <l>By near resembling Man, do Man disgrace.</l>
            <l>Through pac'd ill Actors, may perhaps be cur'd,</l>
            <l>Half Players like half Wits, can't be endur'd.</l>
            <l>Yet these are they, who durst expose the Age</l>
            <l>Of the great <hi>Wonder</hi> of our English Stage.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:98113:53"/>Whom Nature seem'd to form for your delight,</l>
            <l>And bid him speak, as she bid <hi>Shakespeare</hi> write.</l>
            <l>Those Blades indeed are Cripples in their Art</l>
            <l>Mimmick his Foot, but not his speaking part.</l>
            <l>Let them the <hi>Traytor</hi> or <hi>Volpone</hi> try,</l>
            <l>Could they‚Äî</l>
            <l>Rage like <hi>Cethegus,</hi> or like <hi>Cassius</hi> die,</l>
            <l>They ne'er had sent to <hi>Paris</hi> for such Fancies,</l>
            <l>As Monster's heads, and Merry <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Dances.</l>
            <l>Wither'd perhaps, not perish'd we appear,</l>
            <l>But they were blighted, and ne'er came to bear.</l>
            <l>Th'old Poets dress'd your Mistress Wit before,</l>
            <l>These draw you on with an old Painted Whore,</l>
            <l>And sell like Bawds, patch'd Plays for Maids twice o'er.</l>
            <l>Yet they may scorn our House and Actors too,</l>
            <l>Since they have swell'd so high to hector you.</l>
            <l>They cry, Pox o' these <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Men,</l>
            <l>Dam 'em, not one of them, but keeps out Ten.</l>
            <l>Were they once gone, we for those thundering Blades,</l>
            <l>Should have an Audience of substantial Trades,</l>
            <l>Who love our muzzled Boys, and tearing Fellows,</l>
            <l>My Lord great <hi>Neptune,</hi> and great Nephew <hi>Eolus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Oh how the merry Citizen's in love</l>
            <l>With‚Äî</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Psyche,</hi> the Goddess of each Field and Grove.</l>
            <l>He cryes i' faith, methinks 'tis well enough,</l>
            <l>But you roar out and cry, 'Tis all damn'd stuff.</l>
            <l>So to their House the graver Fops repair,</l>
            <l>While Men of Wit, find one another here.</l>
