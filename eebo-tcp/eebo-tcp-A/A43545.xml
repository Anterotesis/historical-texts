            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read your <hi>History of the Reign of King CHARLES,</hi> and am sorry I had not so mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you, as to see your Papers, before you put them to the Presse: which had I done, I should have advertised you of many things, wherein I finde, that either your intelligence, or your diligence failed you, or your judgment is not well informed, or that you have been byassed from the mark of truth, by the excesse and transport of your own affections. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is, I beseech you to accept with a friendly hand, that which with ingenuity mixed with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is here offered to you, and hope you will not be offended, if your History is become the text of so free a Commentary. I know full well <hi>quam facile sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis addere,</hi> how easie a thing it is to adde to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans indeavours, and raise a superstructure upon that foundation, which hath been layed without
<pb facs="tcp:54826:3"/>
our trouble; but I am not ignorant withall, that many times the pains of the Commentator, are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their were whom he doth illustrate. Without which helps to guide us to the understanding of most antient Writers, how many of them had been thrown aside with disdain and scorn (as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have dealt with the <hi>Satyrs</hi> of <hi>Perseus</hi>) because no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> easily intelligible even to Learned men. I doubt not but it was your purpose, <hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> to inform your Reader in the truth of things; in which if you have failed by reason of any of the respects before recited, these following <hi>Observations,</hi> will serve both as a <hi>Supplement,</hi> to make good some points wherein. I finde your Booke defective, and a <hi>Correction</hi> of some other passages, in which I finde you are mistaken. Between us both the History will be made more perfect, and consequently the Reader will be better satisfied: which makes me somewhat confident, that these few Notes, will be so farre from making your History lesse vendible than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they will very much advantage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the sale. And if I can doe good to all, without wrong to any, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ope no man can be offended with my pains and industry. For my own part, as I first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this businesse with a minde free from love, or hatred, or any of those other affections, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingagements in a party doe possesse men with, so I have carried it all along with such impartiality and confidence, as may witnesse for me that I preferre Truth before Interesse; and that none of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54826:3"/>
his three great Gyants, that is to say, <hi>Gyant-Fear, Gyant-Selfe,</hi> and <hi>Gyant-Relations,</hi> (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obstruct the passage to all good intendments) have been able to prevaile upon me. And for your self, I desire you would please to know, that I have your parts and person in an high esteem, and have not took this task in hand, to detract any thing from those just honours which you have acquired, but onely to rectifie your judgments, and lay before you and your Reader the true state of things. That modest <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> I have used, in these <hi>Observations</hi> (especially the first and last) many perhaps at the first sight seem unpleasing to you. And yet so farre I am from d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>spair of pardon, that I conceive my <hi>ingenuity</hi> at the last may deserve your thanks: it being ordinary with most men, who are under the hands of the <hi>Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to be impatient with him, and exclaim against him whilst their Wounds are dressed, and yet to honour and commend him when the Cure is wrought; howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you will gain this by it, that if you doe proceed to the end of the Story, as you somewhere intimate, you will be hereby made more carefull of the grounds you go on, and render the Second Part lesse capable of such <hi>Animadversions</hi> than the First hath been: which I more earnestly desire, than to engage my self in a second trouble, to which I hope you either will give no occasion, or pardon me if I doe.</p>

            <p>And first for the <hi>Arminians</hi> (as you call them) they were a branch of the Sect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to whose Discipline in all particulars they conformed themselves, and to his <hi>Doctrines</hi> in the most, differing only in the matter of <hi>Predestination,</hi> &amp; the points subordinate; but managing tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54826:26"/>
had the Duke proved his Charge of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the Earle, he had both power and opportunity enough to have wrought his ruine; or had the Earle proved the like Charge against the Duke, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons needed not have troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a new <hi>Impeachment,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Encroachments on the Royall favour, and some miscarriages which at another time, and in another man would have been connived at.

            <list>
               <item>1. That having certified King <hi>James</hi> by several Letters out of <hi>Spain</hi> that the Treaty of the Match was in a very good forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the Prince at his arrivall there, found it nothing so, there being little done in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it.</item>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54826:27"/>2. That in the time of his negotiation by Letters unto his late Majesty and otherwise, he counselled and perswaded the said Kings Majesty to set at liberty the Jesuits and Priests of the Romish Religion, and to grant and allow unto the Papists and Professours of the same, a free toleration, and silencing the Laws made and studing in force against them:</item>
               <item>3. That at the Princes coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> the said Earle of <hi>Bristol</hi> cunningly, falsly, and traiterously moved and perswaded the Prince (being then in the power of a forreign King of the Romish Religion) to change his Religion, and used many dangerous and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile insinuations to that effect.</item>
               <item>4. That in pursuance of the said trayterous designe, he used these words unto the Prince, That the State of <hi>England</hi> did never any great thing, but when they were under the obedience of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it was impossible they should doe anything of note otherwise.</item>
               <item>5. That a Proposition being made by the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> touching the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which was, That the eldest Son of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> should marry with the Emperours Daughter, but must be bred up in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court: the said Earle delivered his opinion, That he thought it unreasonable.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54826:27"/>
And when the danger was presented, in regard of the <hi>alteration</hi> of the young <hi>Princes Religion,</hi> which must needs follow thereupon, the said Earle answered, That <hi>without some great action the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome would never be had.</hi>

Secondly, the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or <hi>supposed irregularity</hi> of the said Archbishop was not touched upon in this Commission, as the impulsive cause unto it, the Commission saying onely in the Generall, That <hi>the said Archbishop could not at that present in his own person attend those services, which were otherwise proper for his Cognizance and Jurisdiction, and which as Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>he might and ought in his own person to have performed and executed, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, this supposed irregularity was not incurred upon the casuall killing <hi>of the Keeper of his</hi> (the Archbishops) <hi>game,</hi> as our Authour telleth us, but for the casuall killing of the Lord <hi>Zouches</hi> Keeper in <hi>Bramhill</hi> Parke, where the Archbishop had no game, nor

no Keeper neither. Fourthly, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by many pious and Learned men, that there was something more incurred by that misadventnre than a <hi>supposed irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> onely; insomuch that neither Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> Elect Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> nor Dr. <hi>Carew</hi> Elect Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> nor Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> Elect Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> (besides some others) would receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have heard that K. <hi>James</hi> once said in a time of Parliament (but whether in the way of jeare, or otherwise, I am not able to say) That there were now five hundred Kings besides himselfe. And I know well what great advantage hath been made of those words of His; whereof to any man that rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the Constitution of an English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Commons are so farre from being either Lords or Kings, that they are not so much as a part of the Supreme Councell; it being easie to be evidenced out of the <hi>Writ</hi> which commands their attendance that they are called onely to consent and submit to such resolutions and conclusions (<hi>ad faciendum &amp; consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendum his quae tum ibidem de communi Consilio dicti regni nostri (faciente Deo) contigerit ordinari,</hi> So the <hi>Writs</hi> instruct us) as should be then and there agreed on by the Kings great Councell, or the great Councell of the Kingdome.

you that men no otherwise impowred than so, could take upon them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or be reputed by our Authour, as Lords and Kings? And yet it may be I may wrong them, for our Authour telleth us that</p>

The thing I doubt of is that the <hi>Estates</hi> of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men assembled in the House of Commons howsoever estimated, should be able <hi>to buy the House of Peers,</hi> though it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>thrice</hi> as many as it did, that is to say, three hundred fifty four of the <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nobility.</hi> Assuredly the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54826:35"/>
with another, the which I think no wise man can imagine. The first thing I consider of is, why our Author should leave out the Bishops for Spirituall Lords in this <hi>va. luation,</hi> as if they were no Members of the House of Peers: for that he doth not reckon them into the bargain is evident enough by the <hi>calculation,</hi> there being at that time an hundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Laws could give them. And it was ill done of our Authour to exclude them now, and not well done (by him that should have kept them in) to exclude them afterwards. The Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of holy Church, confirmed in the first Article of the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and sworn to by all Kings succeeding, were never so infringed as by that <hi>exclusion.</hi> But the King soon found the sad effect; and consequents of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

subsequent Laws and Ordinances without His consent. And by this meanes, they brought to passe another point, which, as it seems, was aimed at from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Parliament; it being told Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> (as he himself informs us in the <hi>Collection of his Speeches</hi>) That <hi>if they could bring the Lords to sit in the House of Commons, and the King to be but as one of the Lords, then their worke was done.</hi> This brings me to the second thing which I am to consider of, and that is why our Authour should make the King to be no other than a Member of the House of Peers; for when he tells us that the Gentlemen in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were able to buy all the House of Peers, <hi>except the King,</hi> it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the King must be accounted of as one of that House, the said exception notwithstanding.

Nor did many of the Kings owne party see the danger of it, who taking it for granted that the King was onely one of the three Estates (a Member of the House of Peers, as our Authour makes Him) were forced to grant in pursuance of the said disputes, that the two Houses of Parliament were <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with the King, not <hi>subordinate</hi> to Him: and what could follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but that they might proceed (as they did) without Him, that of <hi>co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat a se invicem supplent,</hi> being a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Maxime</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>

and being so done and sent accordingly to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baro</hi> found himself so discouraged and discountenanced, that at the end of his first three years he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished his Professourship, and retired not long after <hi>into France;</hi> leaving the University in no small disorder for want of such an able Instructor to resort unto. We are to know also, that amongst others of <hi>Baro</hi> his followers, there was one Mr. ster <hi>Barret,</hi> who in a Sermon preached in St. <hi>Maryes</hi> Church, not onely defended <hi>Baro</hi> his Doctrine, but used some offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive words against <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and some others of the <hi>Reformators,</hi> for which he was convented before the Heads of the University (amongst which Doctor <hi>James Montague</hi> then Master of <hi>Sydney</hi> Coll. and a great stickler in this quarrell, was of great authority) and by them <hi>May</hi> the 5th next following, was enjoynd to recant, and a set form of Recantation was prescribed unto him: which though he read publickly in the Church, yet the contentions and disputes grew greater and greater till the coming down of the nine Articles from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> hastened with greater earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon this occasion.</p>

to their no-authority. It is not the meeting of a few B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, in the last place we are to see what moved King <hi>James</hi> to recommend these Articles to the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and afterwards to the Assembly at <hi>Dort.</hi> And herein we must understand that Dr. <hi>James Montague,</hi> at that Kings first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on this Crown, was made <hi>Dean of the Chappell,</hi> (which place he held not onely when he was Bishop of <hi>Wells,</hi> but of <hi>Winchester</hi> also) who being a great stickler in the quarrels at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and a great master in the art of <hi>Insinuation,</hi> had cunningly fashioned King <hi>James</hi> unto these opinions, to which the Kings educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> had before inclined him.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54826:46"/>
credible report, that any such <hi>fixed Altars</hi> were erected, as he chargeth on them. So that I might here end this observation without farther trouble. But because the placing of the <hi>Communion Table Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> did carry some resemblance to the <hi>Altars</hi> used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that some such thing was done in some Churches much about this time; I shall here shew upon what reasons it was done, and how farre they that did it might be justified in it. The Reader therefore is to know that by the late neglect of <hi>decency</hi> and good order in most Parish Churches of this Land, the Communion Table had been very much profaned by sitting on it, scribling and casting hats upon it in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-time; at other times by passing the Parish accompts, and disputing businesses of like nature, to the great scandall and dishonour of our Religion. For remedy and redresse whereof, it seemed good unto some <hi>Bishops</hi> and other <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> out of a pious zeal to the Churches honour, and for the more reverent administration of the holy Sacrament, to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54826:46"/>
place and posture as the <hi>Altars</hi> had been scituated in the former times: For which permission I doubt not but the <hi>Bishops</hi> and other <hi>Ordinaries</hi> had sufficient ground both from <hi>law</hi> and <hi>practise.</hi> And first for <hi>Law,</hi> there passed an Act (and it was the first Act of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of Christs mysteries and Sacraments.</hi> And in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Act there came out first a Book of Orders, <hi>Anno</hi> 1561. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Booke of Advertisments, <hi>Anno</hi> 1565. so made and authorized as the Law required. In the first of which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, That in such Churches where the steps were not taken down the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table should be placed <hi>on the steps where the Altar stood, and that there be fixed on the wall over the Communion boord the Tables of Gods precepts, imprinted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or the said purpose.</hi> And in the second it was ordered, That <hi>the Parish should provide a decent Table, standing on a frame for the Communion Table, which they shall decently cover, &amp;c. and shall set the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the East wall over the said Table.</hi> Lay these together, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> will be briefly this, that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table was to stand where the Altar stood, above the <hi>steps,</hi> and under the Commandements, and therefore to bee placed <hi>Altar-wise</hi> all along the wall. And that this was the meaning of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the constant practise of the <hi>Royall Chappels,</hi> many <hi>Cathedrals</hi> of this Land, the <hi>Chappels</hi> of great men, and some <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> also, in which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54826:47"/>
the <hi>Communion Table</hi> never stood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than in the posture of an <hi>Altar</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> without the least suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Popery,</hi> or any inclinations to it: But of this more hereafter in another place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the next thing here objected is <hi>bowing or cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ging</hi> (as my Author calls it) <hi>toward the said Table</hi> so transposed and placed Altar-wise, which many of the Bishops used, but none of them ever did obtrude upon any other, who in this point were left unto the liberty of their owne discretion. That adoration towards the Altar, or Eastern part of the Church (be it which it will) was generally used by the best and most religious Christians in the Primitive times, our Authour (if he be the man he is said to be) being well versed in the Monuments and Writings of most pure Antiquity, cannot chuse but know; and therefore must needs grant also that it is not Popery, or any way inclining to it: or if it be, we shall entitle Popery unto such Antiquity, as no learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant can grant it. Tis true indeed, that this bowing toward the East, or Altar, had been long discontinued in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And I have been informed by persons of great worth and honour,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54826:48"/>
that it was first revived again by Bishop <hi>Andrews;</hi> of whom our Author telleth us, <hi>Fol.</hi> 64 <hi>that he was studiously devoted to the Doctrine of the Antient Fathers, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, not onely in his aspect and gesture, but in all his actions.</hi> This in a man so Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive in all respects, so studious of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as our Authour mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s him; so great an enemy to the Errours and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of <hi>Rome</hi> as his <hi>Apologie</hi> against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> his <hi>Answer</hi> to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Peron,</hi> and his <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> have declared him to be, would blast his Fame by the reviving of a <hi>Popish ceremony:</hi> and if it were no reproach nor dishonour to him to be the first that did revive it, I see no reason why it should be counted an <hi>audaciousnesse</hi> in the rest of the <hi>Prelates</hi> to follow the <hi>Primitive</hi> and uncorrupt usage of the Church, countenanced by the Example of so rare a man: though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <hi>audaciousnesse</hi> had been a term too modest, had they obtruded it on the Clergie by their sole authority, as is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them in this place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the next <hi>audaciousnesse</hi> here spoke of, is the <hi>obtruding</hi> of another Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>standing up</hi> at <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> Never <hi>obtruded</hi> I am sure, nor scarce so

If it be asked why <hi>standing</hi> at the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> should be discontinued in some places when <hi>standing</hi> at the <hi>Gospels</hi> was retained in all, there being no more authority for the one than the other; I will give the Reader one Answer, and my Authour shall help him to another. The answer which I shall give is this, that though the <hi>Rubricks</hi> did require, that the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> should be said at the end of every <hi>Psalme,</hi> throughout the yeare, and at the end of <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and the <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> yet was this order so neglected in most parts of the Realm, as <hi>Puritanism</hi> and <hi>Innovation</hi> did gain ground upon it that it was very seldome used. And when the Form it self of <hi>giving glory to God</hi> was once layd aside, no marvel if the <hi>gesture</hi> which attended it was at last forgotten. If this suffice not, I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lamours, the Book was soon after <hi>called in,</hi> in which I am sure our Author is extremely out: that Book being never <hi>called in,</hi> though the execution of it (by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now for the <hi>motives</hi> which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that King to this Declaration, they were chiefly four: 1.

The hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the conversion of many <hi>Papists,</hi> who by this means were made to think that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> was inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with all harmlesse and modest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations. 3.

And 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That men being hindred from these open Pastimes, betook themselves to Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houses, and there abused themselves with Drunkennesse, and censured in their cups His Majesties proceedings both in Church and State. Next the <hi>Restrictions</hi> were as many: First, that these Pastimes should be no impediment or let to the publick Duties of the Day. Secondly, that no <hi>Recusants</hi> should be capable of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>vine offices which the day required. And fourthly, that the benefit thereof should redound to none but such as kept themselves in their own Parishes. Now to the <hi>Motives</hi> which induced King <hi>James</hi> to this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, our Author adds two others which might move King <hi>Charles</hi> to the reviving of the same; That is to say, 1. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>Dedication Feasts</hi> of Churches in most places upon that occasion. And secondly, an inclination in many unto <hi>Judaisme,</hi> occasioned by a Book written by one <hi>Brabourne,</hi> maintaining the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensible <hi>morality</hi> of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

It was a pious saying of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> (reported by <hi>Theodoret, lib.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> II.) that the offences of the Priests were to be hidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the common people, <hi>Ne illis assensi ad delinquendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reddantur audaciores,</hi> lest else they should transgresse with the greater liberty.

               <hi>the day when a</hi> Minister <hi>should be as good a man, as any</hi> Jack Gentleman <hi>in</hi> England.] This is a heavy charge indeed, the heavier in regard that the fault of this one man (if such men there were) must lay a brand of <hi>Insolencie</hi> on all the rest of the Clergy, thereby to render them obnoxious to the publick hatred. And though our Author hath not told us by name who this one man was, yet telling us that he was a <hi>high Flyer,</hi> and that this high Flyer was deplumed, he gives us some conjectures at the man he drives at, a man (I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) of an undaunted spirit, and strong resolutions, but neither so intemperate in his words, or unwise in his actions, as to speak so contemptuously of the <hi>English</hi> Gentry. For first, we are not sure that such words were spoken, our Author offering no proof for it but onely his own word, or some vulgar <hi>heare say;</hi> too weake a ground for such a heavy accusation to be built upon. But secondly, admitting that

such words were spoken, I hope our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath heard long since of an antient by word, that every <hi>Jack</hi> would be a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and therefore cannot choose but know that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Gentleman of <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> a true <hi>English Gentleman</hi> and such <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And such <hi>Jack-Gentlemen</hi> as these, as they are commonly most like (either for want of wit, or of manners, or of both together) to vilifie their Minister, and despise the Clergie; so if the poor party said what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he was, <hi>that he hoped to live to see the time, when a Minister should be as good a man as any Jack-Gentleman of them all,</hi> I hope the antient and <hi>true-English</hi> Gentry will not blame him for it. Our Author having thus arraigned the whole body of the <hi>English Clergie,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops,</hi> and those of the inferiour Orders, is now at leisure to proceed to some other businesse; and having brought his Reader thorow the Disputes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments about the <hi>Ship-money,</hi> he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him on to the Combustions raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> occasioned, as he telleth us, by

And this he did against the opinion and advice of many of the Lords of that Kingdome, that is to say, the Earle of <hi>Sterling</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Secretary of State, the Bishops of <hi>Rosse</hi> and <hi>Breken</hi> privie Counsellors both,

               <hi>Sweden</hi> without doing any thing, and no occasion being offered to advance ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he fell upon more secret and subtile practises to effect his ends: First, drawing all the <hi>Scots</hi> which were about the Court of <hi>England</hi> to be his Dependants, and rest at his devotion wholly: and next by getting himselfe a strong partie in that Kingdome, whose affections he had means enough to restraine and alienate from the King, and then to binde them to himself, insomuch as it was thought by the wisest men of both Nations, that the first Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult at <hi>Edinborough</hi> was set on by some of his <hi>Instruments,</hi> and that the <hi>Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which ensued, were secretly fomented by them also.

By all which Acts (I cannot say of <hi>grace,</hi> but) of condescension, the Marquesse got as much in <hi>grosse,</hi> as His Majesty lost in the <hi>retaile,</hi> making himself so strong a partie in that Kingdome, that the King stood but for a <hi>Cipher</hi> in the calculation.

But then there were some other forces embarqued in a considerable part of the Royall Navy, with plenty of Coine and Ammunition, which were put under the command of <hi>Hamilton</hi> (the King still going on in his fatall over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sights) who anchoring with his Fleet in the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For never did so many of the Lords and Gentry attend a King of <hi>England,</hi> in an expedition against that people, nor never did they carry with them a greater stock of <hi>Animosities,</hi> and indignation, then they did at this present. But first, I have been told by some wise and understanding men about the King, that he never did intend to fight (as they afterwards found) but onely by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of so great on Army, to draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to doe him reason: And this the

Covenanters knew as well as he, there being nothing which he said, did, or thought (so farre as thoughts might be discovered by signes and gestures) but what was forthwith posted to them by the <hi>Scots</hi> about him.

No marvell if things standing in this condition, the King did cheerfully embrace any <hi>overture</hi> which rended to a Pacification; or did make choice of such persons to negotiate in it, who were more like to take such termes as they could get, then to fight it out.

But he had done thus once before, that is to say, at the returning of his Forces and Fleet from <hi>Rochel, Anno</hi> 1628. at what time He was in no good termes with His Subjects, and in worse with His Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, having provoked the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the invading of the Isle of <hi>Gadas,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> by invading the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> which might have given Him ground enough to have kept his Army (and His authority withall) and when an Army once is up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will keep it self; <hi>necessity of State</hi> ruling and over-ruling those Concessions and Acts of Grace, to which the Subjects may pretend in more setled times.

a posture of Warre, in case the Parliament should faile him; but then the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience was as great on the other side, that intervall of four Moneths time, giving the discontented party opportunity to unite themselves, to practice on the Shires and Burroughs, to elect such members, as they should recommend unto them, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, not onely to consult, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on such particulars, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to insist on when they were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.

any such favours to the <hi>Popish Faction,</hi> as he stands here charged with: which is, that seeing the <hi>Puritanes</hi> grown so strong, even to the endangering of our Peace, both in Church and State, by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and remisnesse of the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he thought it necessary to shew some countenance to the <hi>Papists,</hi> that the ballance being kept even between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the Church and State might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served (as indeed they were) in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter safety.

               <hi>collected such a disposition in him to their Tenets, as they began to cry him up for their Proselite.</hi> In this passage there are many things to be considered, first that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>tampered</hi> to <hi>introduce,</hi> are not here said to be <hi>superstitious,</hi> but onely to border upon <hi>superstition.</hi> Secondly, that

those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are said to be <hi>disused,</hi> which shewes that they were <hi>still in force,</hi> though not <hi>still in use,</hi> as our Author tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of the Statute concerning Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Thirdly, that these <hi>Ceremonies</hi>

rather tended unto the ruin, then advancement of the Catholick Cause; that by this meanes the Church of <hi>England</hi> coming nearer to the antient usages, the Catholicks there would sooner be drawn off to them, then any more of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would fall off to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <hi>Whereof</hi> (that is to say, the Dissolution<note place="margin">Fol. 184.</note> of the Parliament) <hi>many laid the blame upon the Bishop of</hi> Canterbury.] Though <hi>many laid the blame on him,</hi> yet all the <hi>blame</hi> was not laid on him, some part thereof being laid upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> but on neither rightly: both of them avowing in their Answers to that part of their Charge in the following Parliament, that it was done by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vote of the Privie Councell, not a man dissenting. Certaine I am, that the Archbishop was so farre from having any such thoughts, on Munday morning, <hi>May</hi> 4. being the day before that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py accident, that he was taking care to provide some materialls in a businesse which concerned the Church, of which he was resolved to speake in the House of Peers, on the Wednesday following.

the Warre with <hi>Scotland,</hi> then which there could be nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the Kings affaires. And it was probable enough that it was so meant.

And some there are not altogether of so good affections, who have done the like. And first the <hi>Lincolne-shire</hi> Minister, so much cried up for writing against <hi>Altars,</hi> or rather against placing the <hi>Communion Table Altar-wise,</hi> doth affirme expresly,

pag. 64. <hi>that the calling of</hi> Bishops <hi>is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Apostolicall, and (for all the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts thereof) on Divine Right.</hi> And secondly, the Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> (no great friend to Bishops, as was shewed before) in a Tract of his against Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> before he squinted toward the Court, doth affirm as positively, that there is more to be found for <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> in the holy Scripture, than either for the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or for <hi>Infant-Baptism.</hi> And thirdly, we shall finde, the learned Mr. <hi>John Selden</hi> is not totally against us in this particular, as appeareth by his retortion of the Argument of Mr. <hi>Grimston</hi> in the House of Commons. Mr. <hi>Grimstons</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was this, 1. That <hi>Bishops</hi> are <hi>Jure Divino</hi> is of question. 2.

Now if Bishops which are questioned, whether <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and Archbishops which out of question are not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> shall suspend Ministers that are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> I leave it to you Mr. Speaker.

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54826:99"/>
is out of question. 3. That Religion is <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino</hi> there is no question. Now Mr. Speaker that the Convocation, which is questioned, whether <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, which out of question are not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> should meddle with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which questionlesse is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> I leave to you Mr. Speaker.

without it. And this, our Author, and the witty Gentleman, and he that pulled down the Crosse in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, and others which writ against this Oath could not choose but see; but that they were not willing to see any thing which might make against them. But whereas our Author telleth us, that neither the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers</hi> nor the <hi>Jurors</hi> (that is to say, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the men that voted to the Oath, nor they that were required to take it) <hi>were able to decipher what it meant,</hi> I finde by that, that our Author hath talked with very few of that Convocation. The truth is, that in many Canons which were made before this (as all of them in a manner were) there was a particular enumeration of all persons vested with any Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Jurisdiction, that is to say, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54826:100"/>
But the King being weary of the charge and clamour, which the keeping of a Guard on the Convocation did expose Him to, did hasten them to a conclusion by so many Messages, brought by Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Vane</hi> and others, that in that haste this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was forgotten, and so commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Presse accordingly.

Besides there were but few of the Convocation whose consent was likely to be asked, when any change of <hi>Church-Government</hi> should be set on foot, so that their dissenting or assenting was not much materiall, but as by their readinesse of consenting to such <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the publicke Government, they might encourage others to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.

But whereas our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor puts it down for a Rule in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That no Convocation hath power to grant any Subsidies or aide without confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Parliament;</hi> I must let him (and all that shall reade him) know, that never was any rule more false, nor more weakly grounded; The Clergie in Convocation having as much power to give away the money of the Clergy, by whom they are chose to that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as the Commons in Parliament have to give the money of the Cities, Towns, and Counties, for which they serve. For in the choosing of the Clerks for the Convocation there is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn up and sealed by the Clergie, in which they binde themselves to the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> or <hi>Archdeacons</hi> of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Diocesses, upon the pain of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their lands and goods, <hi>se ratum, gratum &amp; acceptum habere, quicquid dicti procuratores sui dixerint, fecerint, vel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituerint,</hi> that is to say, to allow, stand to, and perform whatsoever their said Clerks or Proctors shall say, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Greater authority than this, as the Commons have not, so why the Clergie in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should not make use of this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they see occasion, I can finde no reason. Nor is it a speculative authority onely, and not reducible unto practice and authority which was then in <hi>force,</hi> but not then in <hi>use,</hi> as our Author hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in another place; but very safely praecedented in Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:54826:109"/>
as our Author telleth us: which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as it begun in the fall and ruine of the Archbishop himself, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the totall dissipation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining rites and priviledges of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Clergy; so did it not end till it had subverted the Episcopall Government, dissolved all Capitular bodies, and left the Cathedralls of this Land (not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently ruined I confesse, but) without meanes to keep them up for the time to come. I am no superstitious observer of dayes and times, and yet am apt enough to thinke, that the beginning of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise in a lucky houre, may much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a fortunate and successefull end. Certaine I am, that <hi>Machiavel</hi> hath told us in the first book of his History of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ment sate, he telleth us not, though there be all the reason in the world why he should have told it: for who could rationally suppose that a Parliament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at such a time, and on such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (that is to say, the over-running of the Northern parts of the Kingdome by a <hi>Scottish</hi> Army) should be held at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi> when <hi>Yorke</hi> (where the King was there in Person) lay nearer to the danger, and the scene of action, and to the place of treaty betwixt the Nations. These Reasons were sufficient to have moved the King to hold this Parliament at <hi>Yorke,</hi> and not at <hi>Westminster,</hi> had He known nothing of the disaffections and engagements of the neighbouring City, as He knew too much. And He had some good presidents too, which might have added no small weight to those weighty Reasons, for when King <hi>Edward</hi> the first was busie in the Conquest of <hi>Wales</hi> He called His Parliament to <hi>Acton-Burnell,</hi> being in the <hi>Marches</hi> of that Countrey; and when He turned His Forces to the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54826:110"/>
Conquest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> He called His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> (if my memory faile me not) being on the <hi>Borders</hi> of that Kingdome. Had the King made choice of the like place for this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which he did afterwards indeavour to alter when it was too late) he had undoubtedly prevented all those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences (or rather mischiefes) which the Pride, Purse, Faction, and tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet as if he had not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enough in calling his Parliament so neer <hi>London,</hi> the Commissioners for the Treaty must also be brought thither by especiall order, that they might have the greater opportunity to inflame that City, and make it capable of any impression, which those of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, should thinke fit to imprint upon them.

Some thinke he failed in point of wisdome, in regard hee could not chuse but know, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and scoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>English,</hi> had most infallibly resolved upon his destruction; and that Innocency was no armour of proof against the fiery darts of malicious power; that seeing such a storm hang over his head, he rather
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54826:111"/>
should have kept himselfe in the <hi>English</hi> Army (being then under his command) which he had gained upon exceedingly by his noble carriage, or have passed over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Army rested wholly at his Devotion; or have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported himselfe to some forraine King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, till faire wether here (in reference to his owne safety, and the publick peace) might invite him home; that it was no betraying of his Innocency to decline a triall, where partiality held the Scales, and selfe-ends backed with power, and made blinde with Prejudice, were like to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance Justice: that if sentence should be passed against him for default of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (which was the worst that could befall him) yet had he still kept his head on his shoulders untill better times, and in the meane time might have done his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as good service in the Courts of many forraigne Princes, as if he were siitting in <hi>White-Hall</hi> at the Councell table. On the other side it was alledged, that all these points had been considered of, before his leaving of the Army; that whilst he lay so neer the <hi>Scots</hi> in the head of this Army, he had gained (as he thought) certaine and assured evidence that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army came not in, but by imitation; that there was a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54826:111"/>
confederacy made between the Heads of the Covenanters, and some of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Members of both Houses, his most capitall enemies, to <hi>subvert</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and innovate in that of the Civill State; that he had digested his intelligence in those particulars into the form of an Impeachment, which he intended to have offered in the House of Peers, assoon as he had taken his place amongst them; that Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> whom it concerned as much as any, fearing or knowing his intendments, followed him so close at the heels, and had his Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so ready in his mouth, that he was ready to give, and did give the blow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> could have time and leisure to effect his purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This therefore being left undecided, it was said by others, that the Earle shewed not that <hi>praesentiam animi,</hi> that readiness of courage and resolution which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had conducted him through so many difficulties, in giving over his designe; for though he lost the opportunity of striking the first blow, yet he had time enough to strike the second, which might have been a very great advantage to his preservation. For, had he offered his Impeachment, and prosecuted it in the

Certain I am, it was much wondred at by many, that a man of so great spirit and knowledge should yeild himself up so tamely, on a generall Accusation only, without any particular Act of Treason charged upon him, or any proof offered to make good that Charge, not only to the losse of his liberty as a private person, but to the forfeiture of his priviledge as a Member of Parliament; all which points

But being all these considerations were not thought of or passed over by him, and that the Commons sped so well in their first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, it was not wondred at, that they brought the Archbishop (within few weeks after) under the like generall Charge of Treason, or that he yie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In regard of the great
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54826:114"/>
learning and integrity of the man, by whom it was first set on foot. 2. Because all the Judges had subscribed unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lawfulnesse of it in time of danger, of which danger the King was declared to be the Judge. 3. Because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to a publick tryall, after it had been argued by the Councel on both sides in the Courts of Justice, and by all the Judges in the Exchequer Chamber, there passed a definitive sentence for it in behalf of the King. 4. Because voted down by the Houses of Parliament in a meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> way, than was expected without being brought to a review, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings Councell being heard, nor the Judges called to shew the Reasons of their opinions. 5.

to the King, for obtaining of an Act of Parliament to secure them from it for the time to come. In the mean time it was thought fit to impeach the Judges of high Treason, that having such a rod over them, they might be sure that nothing should be declared for Law, but as they would have it.

And this appeareth both by the Statute made in the 26 of <hi>Henry</hi> 8th, and the constant practise ever since. But whereas it was voted also, <hi>that the Canons are against the Fundamentall Lawes of this Realme, and against the Kings Prerogative, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:54826:115"/>
I am to tell my Author, that before the <hi>Canons</hi> were subscribed, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the King, and by Him commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Lords of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the Judges, and the Kings Councell, learned in the Laws of this Realm, being then attending, in the hearing of all which they were read, and by all appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: which had been strange, if any thing tending unto <hi>faction</hi> and <hi>sedition,</hi> or to the diminution of the Subjects <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> and the Kings <hi>prerogative,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise against the known Laws of the Land, had been found in them. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas our Author doth inform us, that this censure passed upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, upon a full debating of the Cause on both sides, I would faine know by whom it was debated on the behalf of the Clergie. I have some reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that none of the Clergie of that Convocation, who best understood their own businesse, were called to the deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, or that they did appear there, by their Councell learned, sufficiently au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, and instructed to advocate for them; and therefore if any such deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was, it must be managed either by some Members of their owne House, or by some <hi>London</hi> Ministers, purposely

               <hi>to his son Sir</hi> Henry Vane <hi>the key of a Cabinet to fetch some papers layed therein, &amp;c.</hi>] What this <hi>occasion</hi> was is easie to be seen by the sequell of it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if compared with those Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and displeasures which the Secretary had harboured against the Earl. Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane</hi> had obtained of the King not long before, the Manour of <hi>Rabie</hi> in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> not without hope of being made Baron of that place by His Majesties favour. On the other side the Lord Lieutenant deriving his descent from the <hi>Nevils,</hi> Earles of <hi>Westmor land,</hi> whose Honorary Seate that was, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself to be created Baron of <hi>Rabie</hi> in those Letters Patents, by which he was invested with the Earldome of <hi>Strafford.</hi> This gave the beginning to that fire which consumed the Earle, but not till it had been much increased on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. There was a thrifty designe in Court to save the King the charges of a publick table; and to that end it was advised that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> then Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54826:119"/>
of the Houshold should be made one of the principall Secretaryes in the place of Sir <hi>John Cooke</hi> then weak with age, but so that he should still hold the Treasurership in the way of <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Scarce was <hi>Vane</hi> warm in his new Office when the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, alleaging to the King, that he had no other Correspondent in the Court for the businesses of <hi>Ireland</hi> but Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Cooke,</hi> and that if he should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, His Majesties affairs in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might extremely suffer. On this, a sudden stop was made, and <hi>Cooke</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, continuing in his former Office till the <hi>Queen</hi> openly appeared in behalf of <hi>Vane,</hi> who so prevailed that <hi>Vane</hi> was setled in the place, and <hi>Cooke</hi> dismissed into the Countrey, as no longer service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; which fewell being added to the former fire, made it flame so high that nothing but death or blood could quench it. Insomuch as it was thought by many understanding men, that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> did purposely misreport the Kings Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the former Parliament for abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Ship-money in hatred to the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who had undertook to manage that Parliament to the Kings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and that seeing him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54826:120"/>
still both in power and favour, he fell upon that speeding project which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath related in that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the story; that by such a cunning piece of malice, he might rather seem to offer him up as a sacrifice to the publick justice, than to his own particular hatred, <hi>Ah ult io magis publicè vindictae quam pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato odio dato videatur,</hi> as in the like case the Historian hath it.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder.</hi>] The Commons had now spent a Moneth in prosecuting their Acousation against the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and seeing how little they had gained in order to the point they aimed at, resolved to steer their course by another winde. For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their proofs amounted not to a <hi>Legall evidence,</hi> and that nothing but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall evidence could prevail in a way of Judicature, they called the <hi>Legislative</hi> power to their assistance; according unto which, both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> might proceed by the light of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, without any further proof or testimony. And so it is affirmed expresly by Mr. St. <hi>John</hi> then Sollicitor Generall in his Speech made at a Conference in a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54826:120"/>
Committee of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>April</hi> the 29. 1641. where it is said, <hi>That although single testimony might be sufficient to satisfie private consciences, yet how farre it would have been satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in a</hi> judiciall <hi>way where Forms of Law are more to be stood upon, was not so clear; whereas in this way of Bill, private satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to each mans conscience is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, although no evidence had been given in at all.</hi> Thus they resolved it in this Case, but knowing of what dangerous consequence it might be hereafter, to the lives and fortunes of the Subjects, a Clause was added to the Bill that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> should not be drawn into example for the time to come: which because it may seem somewhat strange to them that know it not, I will here adde so much of the said Bill as concerns this point: In which said Bill the heads of the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being reckoned up, it followeth thus, viz: <hi>Be it therefore enacted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Kings most excellent Majestie, and by the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that the said Earle of</hi> Strafford <hi>for the heynous crimes and offences aforesaid, stand and be adjudged and attainted of high Treason, and shall suffer such pain of death,</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54826:121"/>
               <hi>and incurre such forfeitures of his Goods and Chattells, Lands, Tenements, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments, of any Estate of Free-hold, or Inheritance in the said Kingdomes of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which the said Earle or any other to his use, or in trust for him, have, or had the day of the first sitting of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament, or at any time since. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that no Judge or Judges, Justice or Justices whatsoever, shall adjudge or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret any act or thing to be Treason, nor hear or determine any Treason, nor in any other manner, then he or they should or ought to have done before the making of this Act, and as if this Act had never been made.</hi> Thus have we <hi>Treason</hi> and no <hi>Treason</hi> in the selfe-same action; that being judged <hi>Treason</hi> in this one man, which never was to be judged <hi>Treason</hi> in any other. But whatsoever it was, it was conceived that many of the Lords began to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more forwards to comply with the Commons, then they had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>

sleightly over) there are many things which gave great occasion of discourse to discerning men: 1. That the King having sped so ill by his last addresse unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on the first of <hi>May,</hi> should put himselfe upon the hazard of another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse. 2. That he should send this Letter (of which he could not rationally expect a contenting answer) by the hands of the Prince, as if he would accustome him from his very childhood to the <hi>Refusalls</hi> of his Subjects. 3. That he should descend so much beneath himselfe, as to be a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant</hi> to his People, and yet be in such a diffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ence with them, as not to move his owne desires, but by the mediation of his <hi>Peers.</hi> 4. That he should put himselfe to such a hopelesse trouble, as to write to them for the altering or anulling of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence passed but the day before, which they had gained with so much danger, and so many artifices; or to desire the Respit of two or three dayes, for the condemned Gentleman, which was a power he had not parted with by the Act of Attainder. 5. That in the <hi>subscription</hi> of the Letter he should give himselfe the name of their <hi>Friend,</hi> as if by passing the Act for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That he should give himselfe the title of <hi>unalterable,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that he had publickly declared not long before, <hi>that neither feare nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour should make him doe a thing so much against his Conscience,</hi> as to act any thing in order to the Condemnation of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with reference to the matters which were charged upon him, and yet should signe the Bill for his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder within ten dayes after. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (not to say any thing of the <hi>Militia</hi>) with the Forts and Navy wherein they had not his consent.</p>
            <p>But that which gave matter of most amazement, was, that he should subscribe at all, it being a thing so contrary to his owne custome, and the custome of his Predecessors, who used to write their names on the heads of those Missives, which were directed to their Subjects: And then that when the Letter was brought back to him without any effect, he ordered that it should be <hi>registred</hi> in the House of Peers, on a wan <hi>hope</hi> that <hi>they would use to his honour.</hi> Assuredly this under-writing of his name in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to this last Parliamement, was of as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54826:129"/>
bad presage to him, as the <hi>vailing of his Crowne</hi> to the first; and his desire to have it put upon the register, did serve as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento to them, that they should keep him <hi>under,</hi> now they had him down. For having reduced him to this passe, how easily did they gaine from him severall <hi>Acts</hi> for suppressing the Authority of the <hi>Clerk of the Market,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Stannaries,</hi> for intrenching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation of the Forrests, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the old <hi>Acts</hi> for Knighthood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with what a strong hand did they draw him to the abolishing of <hi>Ship-money,</hi> the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the <hi>High Commission,</hi> the Courts of the <hi>Marquesse</hi> on the <hi>North,</hi> the Jurisdiction of all the Ecclesiasticall Courts, some priviledges formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by the Councell Table; besides the many Concessions at the Treaty in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which either should have been soon granted, or not at all. All of them certaine Testimonies of his being brought under, and all of them incouraged by so strange a submission of himselfe to the Power and Courtesie of his People, as he caused to be registred in this Letter.</p>
