            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

 there is onely one expedient; and that is by hollowing and breaking up the ground 3 or 4 foot deep, beginning with a <hi>trench</hi> 4 or 5 foot large, the whole length of the place that you will thus open, casting the several
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45415:9"/> 
                     <hi>moulds</hi> all upon one side; and thus when your <hi>trench</hi> is voyded and emptied to the depth which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, you shall cast in long dung, of the <hi>Marc,</hi> or husks of the <hi>wine-presse,</hi> or <hi>Cider,</hi> and fearne (which if you can commodiously procure is of all other composts the best) leaves of trees, even to the rotten sticks and <hi>mungy stuffe</hi> to be found under old wood piles, mosse, and such like <hi>Trash;</hi> in fine whatever you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure with the most ease and least charge: for all the design in this stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ground is onely to keep it hollow, that so the moysture beneath may invigorate the <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>plants</hi> during the excessive drouths.</p>
                  <p>You shall therefore lay it halfe a foot thick at the bottome of your <hi>Trench;</hi> and afterwards dig a second of the same proportion, casting the mould which lies uppermost (and which is ever the best) upon the dung, and so making this <hi>Second
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45415:10"/> trench</hi> as deep as the <hi>former,</hi> you shall fill your <hi>first trench;</hi> and the mould which you found <hi>undermost,</hi> shall now lye on the top, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing your <hi>Trenches,</hi> till you have finished the whole piece.</p>
                  <p>Peradventure you may object, that the earth which you take from beneath, will be barren? I confesse with you, that for the <hi>first</hi> year, the goodnesse of it will not appear, but when (with that little amendment which you bestow upon it) it shall be <hi>mellow'd</hi> by the <hi>rains,</hi> and <hi>frosts</hi> of one <hi>Winter,</hi> it shall produce abundantly more then what before lay above, which being exhausted and worn out through the long usage, hath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost a great part of its vertue.</p>
                  <p>Neither are all <hi>Seasons</hi> proper for this <hi>Labour;</hi> because during the great <hi>heats,</hi> This earth is so extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard and bound, that neither <hi>Crow,</hi> nor <hi>Pick-axe</hi> can enter it. The <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is then the most convenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45415:11"/> of all other; for as much as the <hi>Autumn</hi> raines, having well moystned the earth, it is dug with the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; and besides, the <hi>rain,</hi> the <hi>snow,</hi> and the <hi>frosts,</hi> which are frequent in that <hi>season,</hi> contribute much to the work; nor are <hi>Labourers</hi> (being at that time lesse imployed) so charga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as when they work in the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi> and during <hi>August,</hi> when they are hardly to be procured for money.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the bottom, where you encounter with <hi>Gravell,</hi> you shall husband it as we have allready described, by breaking it, and the stones that are mingl'd in the ground shall be carried out of the <hi>Garden.</hi> But in case the <hi>gravell</hi> lie not very thick and that when it is broken up you arrive at sand, or to another smaller loose <hi>gravell,</hi> it shall suffice that it be broken up without flinging out of the <hi>trench:</hi> since the <hi>Trees</hi> will shoot sufficient rootes amongst this smaller <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45415:11"/> moysture which the duug lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them will coutribute.</p>
                  <p>You must remember to lay excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>dung</hi> half consumed at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of such <hi>Trenches</hi> out of which you have cast the <hi>gravell,</hi> to the end that the <hi>rain</hi> and all other <hi>refreshings</hi> may the more easily passe through it; especially if it be of the <hi>huskes</hi> of the <hi>presse, fearne</hi> and the like, such as we have already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>You will object (I suppose) that to <hi>trench</hi> and dresse a whole <hi>Garden</hi> in this manner is to engage one into an extraordinary expence? I grant it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it is once for all, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument which will result from one such <hi>Labour,</hi> will recompence the charge an hundred fold: since the <hi>Trees</hi> will be more beautifull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mosse, or galls, and without comparison produce their Fruits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more faire then those which are planted in a ground which is not thus dressed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45415:12"/> 
                     <hi>Artichocks, Leekes,</hi> and other rootes grow there to a monstrous bignesse: briefly you will finde your self so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely satisfied perceiving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to what your <hi>Garden</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before it was thus loosened, that you will have no cause to regret your expences.</p>
                  <p>However if you would be yet more thrifty, I shall instruct you how by another expedient you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your <hi>Garden</hi> with lesse charge, but withall, as the expence will not be so great, so neither will the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct be so faire. Of this I purpose to treate hereafter, in the planting of <hi>pole-hedges</hi> and the <hi>Kitchen-garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many that are curious do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely exceed all this: for they passe all their Earth through a <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> to cleer it from the stones, which is done by placing the <hi>Hurdle</hi> or <hi>Cive</hi> upon the margent of the <hi>Trench,</hi> and so shoveling the mould to the top of the <hi>Cive,</hi> the earth passes, and

 and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily maintained, is to place in the <hi>wall</hi> the ends of woodden blocks, about the bignesse of a strong <hi>rafter,</hi> which are to be placed at eight equidistant squares, <hi>projecting</hi> onely six inches from the <hi>wall,</hi> in which you shall boar <hi>holes</hi> with an <hi>Auger</hi> an inch and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45415:17"/> an half deep, and some two inches from the ends: be sure to place them at equal distance, for height, and breadth; and in the middest of every <hi>square,</hi> there shall be also one block, resembling the figure of a <hi>quincunce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then you shall provide <hi>Lathes,</hi> or <hi>poles,</hi> which you shall cause to be made exactly of the length, that your blocks-ends are placed, which <hi>Lathes</hi> or <hi>poles</hi> you shall shave and fit at both ends, to enter into the holes made in the extreames of the <hi>blocks,</hi> and to fix them well you shall bend them alittle like a bow, putting the two ends into the opposite <hi>holes</hi> and letting the bow goe, they will force in themselves so strongly as that they shall need no other fastning. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which is at the beginning of the <hi>treatise,</hi> will sufficiently informe you.</p>
                  <p>When your <hi>Trees</hi> are now a little strong, they will not need to be spread with so much <hi>wood,</hi> as when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45415:17"/> they are young; it shall suffice in these kinds of <hi>Espaliers</hi> to stop the strongest branches onely. And when any of these <hi>poles</hi> shall chance to be rotten, another may easily be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, reserving alwaies provision of them in your house.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> is, to take <hi>quarters</hi> of wood, a little bigger then your <hi>poles,</hi> and to accommodate them to your Iron hooks, or <hi>horses</hi> bones (as we have said above) and bind them with <hi>copper</hi> or brasse wyre which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a very long time.</p>

 to plie or <hi>palisade</hi> your <hi>trees</hi> (and which is the handsomest and most ageeable, but cannot easily be made, save where the <hi>walls</hi> are plastred over) is to take shreads of <hi>Leather,</hi> or <hi>Lists,</hi> of <hi>Cloath</hi> with which you shall stay the tender branches, fixing the <hi>list</hi> of the <hi>cloath</hi> to the <hi>wall</hi> with a naile, and so the <hi>boughs</hi> will take their plie as they grow bigger, without either casting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45415:18"/> forwards, or loosning the nailes, which will rust within the <hi>wall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three last manners of <hi>Espa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> are in greatest practise, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>trees</hi> from snailes, <hi>Earewigs, Stotes,</hi> &amp; other noxious infects which creep into the withy twigs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the rinds of round poles, which are not quarter wood.</p>
                  <p>Be carefull not to plant any <hi>Tree</hi> in the <hi>coines</hi> or <hi>Angles</hi> of your <hi>Walls;</hi> since they can there come but to half their nourishment; and besides in so doing it will marr the <hi>figure</hi> of your <hi>Garden,</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> shooting forth all his branches forward, to come at the aire.</p>

                     <label>Pruning.</label> Touching the <hi>pruneing</hi> 
 of <hi>Trees,</hi> the just <hi>season</hi> for those which are old planted, is in the <hi>decrease</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at which time <hi>Grafts</hi> for the <hi>cleft,</hi> and <hi>crowne</hi> are to be gatherd and provided: and for such as are newly planted, they must not be disbranched till the <hi>sap</hi> begins to rise, that the wound may the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be cured, for if you cut them in <hi>winter,</hi> the wood will be dried by the frost in place of the scar and make a stubb of dead wood to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bud, which should else shoot neer to the cut.</p>
                  <p>I could scarcely resolve with my self how to teach this art of <hi>pruning:</hi> since it would merit an express Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse to instruct you perfectly: but having in my <hi>Preface</hi> resolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal nothing from you as a <hi>Secret,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:45415:24"/> I had rather hazard the censure of captious persons, then hide the art from you, how you may attain the most excellent and fairest <hi>Fruit:</hi> in description whereof I shall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless be as succinct and brief as I can; teaching in a very few lines (by way of <hi>Maximes</hi>) what would employ more then two sheets, if I should give a contexture to my <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</hi> Therefore</p>
                  <p>You shall begin to prune, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all the shoot of <hi>August</hi> where ever you encounter it, unless the place be <hi>naked,</hi> and that you su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the next old branch will not suffice to cover it, without cutting it off, which would exceedingly spoil and deform your tree.</p>
                  <p>Those <hi>young</hi> branches which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>old,</hi> and shoot lustily, must be <hi>stopped</hi> at the second or third <hi>knot;</hi> for they would attract all the <hi>Sap</hi> which ought to nourish the branch: and in case the Tree be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45415:24"/> plentifully garnished, you may cut them off at their first peeping; and such as you would spare are to be conducted where you would have them continue.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Branch</hi> which sprouts as well before as behinde the Tree must be cut off, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Buds</hi> that will be <hi>Fruit</hi> shall be spared; yet if there be any at the top of a branch which you desire should fortifie and spread, cut off that branch near a <hi>Sprig-bud,</hi> rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing off the <hi>Fruit-buds</hi> which are on the new shoot.</p>
                  <p>Every branch which is to spread and fortifie, must be <hi>prun'd,</hi> be it never so little: but on the stronger you may leave more buds, then on the weak and feeble.</p>
                  <p>Every branch forceably plyed to garnish any void place, doth never bear the fruit fair: but in case it be guided thither from its prrimary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45415:25"/> shooting, it will do well enough.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Bud</hi> which hath but a <hi>single</hi> leaf produces only <hi>wood:</hi> that of fruit hath many, and the more, the sooner it will bear, and the greater its fruit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fruit-bud</hi> which grows on the body of the Tree produces fairer fruit, then such as break out of the <hi>collaterall</hi> twigges, and tops of branches.</p>

                  <p>If you desire to have your tree soon furnished on both sides, hinder it from shooting in the middle.</p>
                  <p>The more you prune a Tree, the more it will shoot.</p>
                  <p>You should prune but little wood from trees that are graffed on the <hi>free-stock,</hi> and which do not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>fruit-buds:</hi> but afterward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing passed their effort, they will bear but too plentifully.</p>

                  <p>Cut your branches alwayes <hi>slant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> behind a <hi>Leaf-bud,</hi> to the end they may the sooner heal their wounds without leaving any <hi>stubs,</hi> which you shall afterward cut off to the very quick, to avoid a second skar, and a great eye-sore.</p>
                  <p>When your Trees form into crowns or bunches, the tops of your branches that have been too much pruned, or that have cast their fruit, leaving the knots of the stalks, they are to be discharged of it, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Tree.</p>
                  <p>You shall also disburthen your trees that are too <hi>fertil,</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with the <hi>smaller,</hi> by cutting the <hi>stalks</hi> in the middle without <hi>unknot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> them: the <hi>fewer</hi> the tree doth nourish, the <hi>fairer</hi> will be your fruit.</p>

                  <p>But you shall by no means sow any seeds which produce any large <hi>roots,</hi> not so much for that they require a longer <hi>sojourn</hi> in the ground to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to their full growth, as because they will suck, emaciate, and dry much of the mould about them.

 &amp; that they have plenty of <hi>sap,</hi> graft on them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther difficultie. My opinion is that a man cannot <hi>Inoculate</hi> either on <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>free-stock</hi> too young; provided they be large enough to receive the <hi>Scutcheon;</hi> and my reason is, that the <hi>stocke</hi> and the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> taking their growth proportionably the incision of the <hi>stock</hi> will the sooner be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they will shoot with a great deale more vigour, then those which you shall <hi>bud</hi> upon stronger <hi>sets,</hi> which are 2 or 3 years recovering the place from whence you tooke the dead part, and of which at the other side of the <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> the barke of the <hi>wild</hi> stock does frequently die three
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45415:30"/> or four Inches below the <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> so that it will require three or four years to heal the defect: Adde to this: that the <hi>Bark</hi> of an old <hi>stock,</hi> will not unite so well with that of of the <hi>Scutcheon;</hi> but is apt to make a great wreath, subject to peel and unglue; a thing which never arrives when the <hi>Rinds</hi> are both of them young and tender.</p>
                  <p>Some observe yet, that <hi>tall Stocks</hi> are to be graffed together, affirming that they grow <hi>equally:</hi> but chosing my Plant at half a foot, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that all should prosper, and be taken up together separated, but with difficulty, and without violating the <hi>Roots:</hi> and therefore it is better doubtless to graff <hi>young,</hi> for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses already specified, since the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger must needs master the weaker: and those likewise which are most <hi>vigorous</hi> will surmount the other; and a small compasse will furnish you with a sufficient quantity of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45415:31"/> good trees, provided you suffer them not to grow there too long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Quince-stocks.</label> You shall likewise Provide you a <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Quince-stocks</hi> 
 like to the other, and order them in the same manner.</p>
                  <p>There are three sorts of <hi>Quinces:</hi> That which is <hi>poynted</hi> before; The Pear or Female Quince, which hath the fruit like a Callebasse; The great <hi>Portugall Quince</hi> pointed at both extreams. The <hi>first</hi> is the least, the <hi>ordinary</hi> is next, that of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> much more excellent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Sap.</p>
                  <p>The right <hi>Quinces</hi> (which is that which I name the wild-stock) are such as have their fruit resembling a <hi>Gourd</hi> or <hi>Callebasse,</hi> and not such as be great behind and pointed before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Peaches.</label> For the <hi>Peaches</hi> 
 which proceed from the <hi>stones</hi> that you set, I advise you to prepare a quarter in your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a part, for the reasons already alledged: because that if you range
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45415:31"/> them in <hi>hedges</hi> or <hi>walls</hi> some of the branches perishing every year, will prove a very great eye-sore: And therefore my counsell is that in one of the <hi>quarters</hi> most distant from your house (toward the north where they will not impeach the <hi>prospect</hi> of your garden) Plant the <hi>Peach-trees</hi> which you shall take out of your <hi>Seminary,</hi> Placing them six foot from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>equidistant</hi> on every side in the <hi>quincunx,</hi> and thus they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you a world of fruit, by reason of their multitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dressing.</label> You must be carefull to give them <hi>four</hi> dressings 
 or <hi>diggings, prune</hi> off the dead wood, and to <hi>cut</hi> off at the second or third <hi>joynt</hi> the young shoots, which growing too <hi>exuberant</hi> will draw all the <hi>sap</hi> of the <hi>tree</hi> to themselves, and <hi>starve</hi> the old bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which in defect of nourishment will shortly perish; for observe this as a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that the <hi>sap</hi> does allways apend to the most tender shoots)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45415:32"/> You may also intermix some <hi>Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots</hi> in the same place, which are to be governed after the same manner of the <hi>Peaches.</hi>

                     <label>Nursery.</label> You shall Plant your <hi>Nursery,</hi> 
 in some large <hi>bed</hi> or <hi>quarter</hi> of your garden, which lyes most remote from your <hi>dwelling,</hi> least when it shall appear like a <hi>grove</hi> or <hi>Copse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> it hinders your prospect.</p>

 one may set them four fingers lower then the Soil, the better to refresh them; and without any peril of striking out small roots, by reason of the drouth; yet in case there should sprout any, the <hi>Gardiner</hi> searching with his Spade may cut them away, and give the knot a little air to stop their growth for the future.</p>
                  <p>You shall likewise remember that (if during the extream <hi>Heats</hi> you will benefit your Trees) you put some mungy <hi>Fearn,</hi> or half rotten <hi>Dung</hi> about all their feet; yet so as it do not touch the Stemme: and thus you may spread it for a yard compass, and about four fingers thick; This will both shade the Roots, and exceedingly refresh the <hi>Mould</hi> about them, preserving the earth from gaping in extremity of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45415:33"/> weather, by which oftentimes the Tree languishes, and the small roots become dry: but if you a little stir the ground before you apply this dung, you will render a double ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to your <hi>trees,</hi> for the earth will by this means maintain it self supple, and put forth no weeds through the dung.</p>
                  <p>It will be requisite to have a <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi> for three main considerations. The <hi>first</hi> is, that you may always have provision of <hi>trees,</hi> fit to supply the places of such as accidentally dye, or languishing do not thrive. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is, to dis-incumber your <hi>Seminary</hi> which will otherwise be too full and thick of young <hi>trees.</hi> And <hi>thirdly</hi> that you may spare some for the <hi>market,</hi> to recompence the expence of your first Plantation; and besides, they may yield you some fruit where they stand, which will extreamly please you; add to this, that a <hi>tree</hi> which has been frequently <hi>transplanted,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

                  <p>The best <hi>Grafts</hi> are those which grow upon the strongest and master branch of a <hi>tree,</hi> which is wont to be a good bearer and such a one as does promise a plentiful burden that year, and is thick of buds; for hence it is that your young <hi>grafted trees,</hi> have fruit from the <hi>second</hi> or <hi>third</hi> year, and sometimes from the very first.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary, if you take a <hi>graft</hi> from a <hi>young tree</hi> which has not as yet borne <hi>fruit,</hi> that which you shall propagate from such a <hi>tree</hi>

 by making <hi>incision,</hi> and <hi>lancing</hi> the bark with a <hi>Pen-knife,</hi> and lifting it up; if it quit the wood, there is Sap suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; but if it will not move rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45415:37"/> you must attend, till it ascend; for it will else be but labour in vain, and prejudice your Tree. The <hi>other</hi> is, when at the <hi>extremities</hi> of the branches of the <hi>wilde stock,</hi> you see the leaves of the <hi>new Sap</hi> appear white and pallid, it is a <hi>Symptome</hi> that the tree is in case, and fit to graffe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Choyce.</label> A <hi>Graffe</hi> for the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> shall be chosen 
 from a <hi>Shoot</hi> or <hi>Syen</hi> of that year, mature and very fair; for there are many which are thin and meagre at the points, and upon such you shall hardly finde one or two buds that are good: gather it neer to the Shoot of the precedent year, cutting the upmost point in case you may not take off the Scutcheons, and cut away also all the leaves to a <hi>Moyety</hi> of the <hi>stalk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reason why I oblige you to cut off the <hi>top</hi> of the <hi>Graffe,</hi> and its leaves so far, is, because if you <hi>spare</hi> them they will wither, and so drie all the graffe, that it will not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45415:37"/> be possible to separate the <hi>Escutcheon</hi> from the wood, and besides all the leaves are worth nothing.</p>

                  <p>You shall gather your <hi>Graffs</hi> at the <hi>top</hi> of the fairest branches, as I have formerly said, and you shall leave three fingers length of the <hi>first Sap,</hi> or old wood, that you may cut your graffe with the greater case.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>conserve</hi> them till you <hi>graffe,</hi> it is sufficient to cover them by bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles half wayes in the earth, their <hi>kindes</hi> distinguished, least if you should mingle them, and should <hi>graffe</hi> of two sorts upon the same same tree, you be constrained to cut one of them off; since two several <hi>kindes</hi> of fruit do never agree well upon the same <hi>Stem,</hi> the one hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the other from arriving to its perfection by robbing it of the <hi>Sap.</hi>

                  <p>I Have never observed above <hi>four</hi> several necessary manners of <hi>graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing,</hi> and from which you may hope for an assured success, the rest being more <hi>curious</hi> then <hi>profitable,</hi> seeing that by these <hi>four</hi> a man may <hi>graffe</hi> all sorts of Trees and Shrubs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.

                  <p>The <hi>Escutcheon</hi> holds the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency; for as much as it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable upon all sorts of trees, the most easy to do, and the soonest that bears fruit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cleft</hi> or <hi>Stock</hi> followes, and that as practicable upon the <hi>greater</hi> trees, and also upon the <hi>smaller,</hi> even to those of one inch <hi>diameter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Crown</hi> is not much in use, save upon trees of the largest size.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Approch</hi> is not ordinarily
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45415:39"/> practised, except it be upon <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, Limmon</hi> trees, and other rare <hi>Plants,</hi> such as we conserve in <hi>Cases,</hi> and are therefore joyned with the more facility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</label> To begin therefore with the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scutcheon.</hi> 
 Your <hi>Stock</hi> being stripped of all its small twigs the height of half a foot, or a little more, from the season that they use to cut trees; or else deferred till <hi>graffing</hi> time, you shall choose out the fairest part of the <hi>Bark</hi> of your <hi>Stock,</hi> and if it be possible upon the quarter which is exposed to the most impetuous <hi>windes;</hi> because they come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so furiously, that they loosen the Shield, being yet tender, and charged with branches and leaves; which <hi>accident</hi> does not happen so frequently, when they are thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as when they are graffed on the other side, though you should set supporters to uphold them.</p>
                  <p>Cut your <hi>Escutcheon</hi> long enough,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45415:39"/> an inch or thereabout, and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly large, that it may derive suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nourishment; be sure to take it off <hi>dextrously,</hi> and look within it, whether the <hi>sprout</hi> of the <hi>Bud</hi> hold to it; for if that stay behinde with the wood from whence you took it, it is worth nothing: You shall hold this in your mouth by the end of the <hi>stalk</hi> of the leaf, which I ordered you to reserve expressly when you gather your graffs; then make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision upon your stock, and gently loosen the bark with the pointed handle of your <hi>Knife,</hi> without rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it against the wood, for fear of scraping the Sap which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; this done, place your <hi>Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> between the wood and the bark, thrusting it down till the head of the <hi>Shield</hi> joyn with the incision at the top of your <hi>Stock,</hi> and that it be even and flat upon the wood, which being performed, you shall binde it about with <hi>Hemp,</hi> beginning to tie it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45415:40"/> very close above, neer the <hi>Bud,</hi> then turning it below, leave the <hi>Eye</hi> but a very small compass, and thus you shall finish your binding with a knot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Season.</label> Be careful when you <hi>graffe,</hi> 
 that it be neither during the excessive <hi>heat</hi> of the Sun, nor in a <hi>rainy</hi> season, for the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> will not endure to be wet, and it will be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of not taking, if it rain the first four or five dayes immediatly after your <hi>inoculating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are some who take off part of the wood with the Shield, which they do with one cut of the <hi>knife,</hi> which manner of <hi>inoculating</hi> I do not disapprove: I have succeeded well in it my self, and besides in so doing, there is no danger of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching the <hi>Bud</hi> of your <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> that is, of leaving the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Bud</hi> behinde you. Those which have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trees to inoculate use this way because it is more <hi>prompt</hi> &amp; <hi>expedite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45415:40"/> Three weeks after you have <hi>ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated</hi> (or thereabout) you may cut the knot of the <hi>Ligature,</hi> that the sap may enjoy the freer <hi>intercourse. Winter</hi> past, and the <hi>Bud</hi> beginning to open, cut your <hi>Stock</hi> three or four fingers above the <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> and cut likewise the <hi>binding</hi> behinde it, and the <hi>Rinde</hi> it self to the very <hi>wood;</hi> this must be done at one gash of the <hi>knife,</hi> from the bottom to the top.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit you shall not take off the <hi>Tow</hi> from about the <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> but let it fall of it self; for there is danger in quitting it, lest you press the <hi>Bud,</hi> which is then extreamly tender: You shall not cut off the <hi>Stub</hi> which remains beneath the Scutcheon, till you prune the Tree, which must be in <hi>February</hi> the year following.</p>
                  <p>After your <hi>Scutcheon</hi> has put forth its first Sap, you may prune it at top, that it may shoot out branches about the <hi>Eyes</hi> below, otherwise it will
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45415:41"/> mount without forking, and so your <hi>Dwarf</hi> will have no grace or beauty.</p>
                  <p>The just <hi>season</hi> to <hi>stop</hi> them is in the <hi>decrease</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> when the <hi>Sap</hi> of <hi>August</hi> shoots out; you may then also, if you please, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If you will attend the issue of the <hi>Winter</hi> following to cut the heel of your tree, you need not be obliged to wrap it up, and secure it thus, because the ascending sap will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cure it.</p>
                  <p>I have observed, that a <hi>Scutcheon</hi> set on a <hi>wilde</hi> or <hi>free-stock</hi> of about an inch Diameter or more, does not prosper and shoot so well, as upon one that is younger, and besides, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45415:41"/> is more subject to unglue. Some there be that <hi>inoculate</hi> from the very first rise of the <hi>Sap,</hi> but they do not much advance; for the <hi>Scutcheon</hi> not shooting till <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>sprout</hi> is nothing so fair as that of the close <hi>Eye</hi> or shut <hi>Bud,</hi> since it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found that the wood of the new <hi>shoot</hi> never ripens, and the <hi>Winter</hi> approaching kills it; and therefore I counsel you not to <hi>inoculate</hi> so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unlesse the necessitie be very urgent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>In the Cleft.</label> In the <hi>Cleft</hi> 
 or <hi>Stock,</hi> all sorts of trees from one inch bignesse to the greatest that are may be <hi>graffed:</hi> The most proper <hi>Season</hi> for it, is from the beginning of the new <hi>moon</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> till the Sap (becoming too lustly in the tree) separates the <hi>wood</hi> from the <hi>bark;</hi> for then you shall leave off graffing.</p>
                  <p>When you <hi>graffe</hi> in the <hi>Cleft,</hi> if it be to make <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> you must first saw your Stock four inches, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45415:42"/> above ground, and then with your <hi>Pruning-Knife</hi> pare off the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the wood, where the saw has passed, about the thicknesse of a <hi>Six-pence,</hi> because the <hi>Track</hi> of the <hi>Saw</hi> leaving it rugged will hinder the <hi>Sap</hi> from healing the grated wood; nor can the <hi>graffe</hi> joyn to its trunk unlesse the <hi>rinde</hi> be <hi>refreshed,</hi> and cut to the <hi>quick</hi> with the knife. When this is done, you shall cleave the <hi>Stock</hi> where the Bark appears most even, and least knotty; and <hi>observe,</hi> that you never place your knife exactly in the <hi>middle</hi> of the tree, where the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> of the wood is, but a little towards the side. Then cut and fit your <hi>Graff,</hi> sharpning all the old wood, as far as the new in fashion of a <hi>wedg,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual on both sides, yet leaving the two <hi>rindes</hi> fast to the wood in the narrowest parts; for if once they be separated, your <hi>Graff</hi> is good for nothing: Then top your <hi>Graffe</hi> three
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45415:42"/> or four inches, more or lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it will bear it; for as much as upon a small stock one would not leave them so long, as upon a great tree. Thus prepared, you shall open the <hi>Stock</hi> with a small <hi>wedge</hi> made of some tough wood, such as <hi>Box, Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> or the like, striking it in gently, and then lodge your graffe at the edge of your <hi>Stock,</hi> sinking it down as far as the new wood, and place it so that the parts through which the <hi>Sap</hi> has intercourse (which is mutual
'twixt the wood and the bark) do exactly correspond.</p>
                  <p>Having thus lodged your <hi>Graffe,</hi> you may place a second on the other end of the <hi>Cleft,</hi> alway <hi>remembring</hi> to put two <hi>Graffs</hi> into every <hi>Cleft,</hi> provided that you can so place them that they be not <hi>contiguous;</hi> for by this means they will sooner recover their <hi>stock,</hi> then if there were but one, because the <hi>Sap</hi> ascends equally on both sides, and preserves the back
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45415:43"/> side of the <hi>rinde</hi> from withering, as we have already said: After this you shall cover what remains of the <hi>Cleft,</hi> 'twixt the two <hi>Graffs,</hi> with a little of the thinnest and most tender <hi>Bark,</hi> joyning it <hi>accurately</hi> to keep the water from entering in: then you shall make the <hi>Hood</hi> with fine earth and Hay; some cover the <hi>hood</hi> with <hi>mosses,</hi> and with two short <hi>Willow-rinds</hi> laid 'thwart one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bind them on with an <hi>Ozyer</hi> to the foot of the <hi>Stock,</hi> to maintain them the more fresh, and preserve them from the water.</p>
                  <p>When you <hi>graffe</hi> upon great Trees, you shall choose the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most even branches to place your <hi>Graffs</hi> upon, if they be very big you may lodge <hi>four</hi> upon it, making the Cleft in forme of a <hi>Crosse,</hi> yet without touching the <hi>Pith</hi> of the tree, the remanent branches which you do not <hi>graffe,</hi> must be sawed off within half an inch of the <hi>Stem,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45415:43"/> then paring away the wood which the saw may have grated, you shall <hi>swathe</hi> it about with Loam till the Bark have healed the <hi>wound,</hi> to guard it from the scorching of the <hi>Summer,</hi> and the frost of the <hi>winter,</hi> which would exceedingly prejudice it, by penetrating to the very <hi>heart</hi> of the tree. It will be good to apply some <hi>stayes</hi> to the branches which are graffed, to strengthen the young <hi>shoots,</hi> and secure them from the <hi>windes,</hi> till the second year be past, and that they are well established; and if you finde any that grows dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, you shall cut it off, as also if they come too thick, and choke one another, by this means giving free Air to the tree.</p>
                  <p>Upon your small <hi>wilde stocks,</hi> which will support but a <hi>single graffe,</hi> you shall cut the <hi>hinder</hi> part where you might place a <hi>second,</hi> to the very heart of the stock, <hi>slanting</hi> it in, like that part of a <hi>Pipe</hi> which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45415:44"/> to the nether Lip, this will greatly contribute to its recovery. And</p>
                  <p>When you <hi>graffe</hi> small <hi>stocks,</hi> which have not strength enough to fasten their <hi>graffs,</hi> you shall assist them, by binding them about with some tender twig of an Ozier.</p>
                  <p>Now, albeit I did oblige you to choose a <hi>graffe</hi> with the <hi>old wood,</hi> yet I would not have you to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which is but of <hi>one Sap,</hi> nor the <hi>cuttings</hi> of those where you took the graffes of the <hi>two Saps,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>excellent,</hi> however they produce their fruit something <hi>later</hi> then the oher, nor do they bear so great a burthen; and therefore unless it be in case of necessity, I would only use those which are of two saps.</p>

 I shall only deliver the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and most ordinary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, which is to sowe their <hi>Repins</hi> in <hi>Boxes,</hi> and when they are two years old, transplant them in <hi>Cases,</hi> every one in a <hi>Case</hi> by it self, filled with rich <hi>Mellon-</hi> bed-mould, mingled with <hi>Loam</hi> refined and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd by one winter, and when they can well support it, you may either <hi>inoculate,</hi> or <hi>graffe</hi> them by <hi>Approch</hi> in the <hi>Spring</hi> of the year: Above all things, be diligent to secure them from cold, and commit them early to their shelter, where, that they may intirely be preserved from the <hi>Frost,</hi> you may give them a gentle <hi>Stove,</hi> and attemper the Air with a fire of <hi>Charcoal,</hi> during the extream rigour of the <hi>Winter,</hi> in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45415:53"/> case you suspect the Frost has at all invaded them.</p>
                  <p>But so soon as the <hi>Spring</hi> appears, and that the <hi>Frosts</hi> are intirely past, you may acquaint them with the <hi>Air</hi> by degrees, beginning first to open the doors of the <hi>Conservatory</hi> in the heat of the day, and shutting them again at <hi>night,</hi> and so by little and little you may set open the <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,</hi> and shut them again in the evening, till all danger is past, and then you may bring them forth, and expose them boldly to the <hi>Ayr</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the <hi>Summer</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>As these trees grow big, you may change and enlarge their <hi>Cases,</hi> but be sure to take them out earth and all, razing the stringy and <hi>fiberous</hi> roots, a little with a <hi>knife,</hi> before you replace them, and supplying what their new <hi>Cases</hi> may want, with the fore-described mould: Some when they alter their <hi>Cases</hi> denude them of all the earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45415:53"/> it exhausted and <hi>insipid:</hi> but it is to the extream prejudice of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and does set it so far back, that a year or two will hardly recover it.</p>
                  <p>You may gather the <hi>Flowers</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, to prevent their <hi>knotting</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fruit, or (being too luxurious) their languishing; it will suffice therefore that you spare some of the <hi>fairest,</hi> and best placed for <hi>fruit,</hi> and of them as many as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the tree can well nourish.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spiders</hi> do extreamly affect to spread their <hi>Toyles</hi> among the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and leaves of this Tree, because the <hi>flies</hi> so much frequent their flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and leaves, which attract them with their <hi>redolency</hi> and juice, and to remedy this, use such a <hi>Brush</hi> as is made to cleanse <hi>pictures</hi> withal, from the dust, but treat them tenderly.</p>

 which invades trees proceeds commonly from some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and hidden cause, which is, when the roots encounter with a gravelly, sandy or other bad mould, so that they cannot penetrate to search for refreshment; this burns

                     </gap>s. For this, there is only this expedient. If it be a small tree, you must take it up with as much mould about its root as possible, and make a Pit for it four foot square, filling the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with <hi>Mellon-bed-dung,</hi> and the rest with rich earth, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the tree, observing what I have already said; and thus the tree may be taken up without any damage, and will <hi>take</hi> again with ease, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that you be careful to preserve its <hi>Rootes</hi> from languishing and taking Ayr. But in case the tree be <hi>old,</hi> you must <hi>bare</hi> the root before <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>dis-interre</hi> the greatest roots half their thickness, making a large <hi>Trench</hi> about the foot of the Tree, and so let it remain all <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (that the earth may become mellow) till the <hi>Spring,</hi> when you must fill the <hi>apertures</hi> with well consum'd dung mixed with earth,

The properest season for this work is after a soaking <hi>rain,</hi> or great <hi>dew</hi> in the morning; for whilst the great heats continue, it cleaves so obstinatly to the trees, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not scrape it off without prejudicing the <hi>Bark,</hi> if you would utterly era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it: Neither ought you to neglect this <hi>cure,</hi> for the <hi>Mosse</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed doth daily augment, and is the same inconvenience to Trees that the <hi>Itch</hi> is to <hi>Animals.</hi> If you water your Trees during the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive heats, and cover the roots with <hi>Fern,</hi> or other mungy stuff, it will preserve them from this disease.</p>

                     <hi>Caterpillars</hi> 
 are easily gathered off during all the <hi>Winter,</hi> taking away the <hi>Packets</hi> which cleave about the <hi>Branches,</hi> and burning them; but if you neglect this, till they are <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,</hi> you will not be able to destroy them without much difficulty: but in case you have not prevented it, be diligent to take them whilst they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45415:61"/> are yet young, when either through the coldnesse of the <hi>Night,</hi> or some <hi>Humidity,</hi> they are assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaps; for otherwise; when the <hi>Sun</hi> is hot, and that it is <hi>high day,</hi> they will have over-spread your Trees.</p>
                  <p>And the destruction of these <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is so absolutely necessary, that you shall quit all manner work to accomplish it; for a <hi>Garden</hi> anoy'd with this plague but <hi>one year</hi> only, shall resent it more then <hi>three years</hi> after.</p>
                  <p>And now we will shut up this Treatise with the Receipt which I promised to give you of the <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> to cover your <hi>Graffs.</hi>

                     <label>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to hood your Grafs.</label> Take then half a pound of new <hi>Wax,</hi> 
 as much <hi>Burgundy Pitch,</hi> two ounces of ordinary <hi>Turpentine,</hi> melt all these Ingredients in a new earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Pot, glazed, sufficiently stirring it; then let it <hi>cool</hi> at least twelve hours, then break it into pieces,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45415:62"/> and hold them in warm water half an hour, where you must work it with your hands, till it become very pliable. Or you may dip any <hi>Clouts</hi> in this <hi>Composition,</hi> and afterwards cut them out into <hi>Plasters,</hi> fitted to the <hi>wounds</hi> of your <hi>Trees,</hi> which will lesse waste your store, and not take up so much of your Composition as if you applyed it in morsels; and you may make use of this <hi>Cerecloth</hi> to cover the Clefts of your <hi>Trees,</hi> which gape between a <hi>Stock</hi> that hath two <hi>Graffs,</hi> and secure it from the <hi>rain;</hi> and you may winde it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Hoods,</hi> before you daub them with <hi>Loam</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> and this will certainly preserve your graffs from all injuries of water whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

 such as you may procure out of <hi>Italy,</hi> from <hi>Lions, Tours, Anjou, Champagne,</hi> and other places, where men emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late one another who shall have the best <hi>Melons.</hi> Also to have of all the kindes, <hi>Sucrin, Morin, Melonnes, Grenots,</hi> white, wraught, or Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'red, Ribb'd, and others, even to the locking up of those <hi>seedes</hi> whose <hi>fruite</hi> has pleased you; for some affect them of one <hi>tast,</hi> which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will reject, and hold worth nothing.

 you shall begin to prepare a <hi>bed</hi> for the seeds, taking <hi>dung</hi> hot from the stable, and of that of your foresaid heape, mingling them together, that the heat of the fresh may communicate it self to the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Beds.</label> Make your <hi>Bed</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>bed</hi> handsomly made, and <hi>trodden</hi> with the feet to excite the heat, you must cover the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But if your <hi>seeds</hi> burn, by reason of the too great heat of your <hi>bed,</hi> (which you shall soon perceive, for they ought not to be long in the ground) you shall <hi>sow</hi> them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, and heat the <hi>Bed a new</hi>

                  <p>When your <hi>plants</hi> begin to peep you shall cover them with pretty large <hi>Drinking-Glasses,</hi> leaving a little passage for the <hi>Ayr</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Glasse</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> least otherwise, they suffocate and <hi>tarnish.</hi>

                  <p>To lodg them well, you must make <hi>trenches</hi> four foot large, and

                  <p>
                     <label>Seed.</label> We have <hi>seede</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To discover the goodnesse of the <hi>seed</hi> (which is the newest) it ought to be of a lively <hi>colour,</hi> full of <hi>oyle,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly round neither <hi>shrivled, small</hi> or <hi>dried,</hi> which are all <hi>indications</hi> of its <hi>age,</hi> but of a <hi>broun hue,</hi> not of a <hi>bright red</hi> which shews that it never ripened kindly upon the stalke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Sowing.</label> Being thus provided with good <hi>seede,</hi> sow it as they do in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> 
 The <hi>Italians</hi> sow it in <hi>cases</hi> and shallow <hi>tubes</hi> in the full <hi>moon</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:45415:95"/> It comes speedily up, and will be very strong before <hi>Winter:</hi> when the <hi>Frosts</hi> come <hi>remove</hi> them into your <hi>Cellar,</hi> or <hi>Garden-house,</hi> till the <hi>Spring,</hi> and that the <hi>Frosts</hi> are gone, and then <hi>transplant</hi> them into good mould; thus you shall have <hi>white,</hi> very fair <hi>heads,</hi> and well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before the great heats of <hi>Sommer</hi> surprize them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> stay not so long, as till their <hi>heads</hi> have attained their utmost growth, but pull them <hi>up</hi> before, and lay them in the <hi>Cellar, interring</hi> all their <hi>roots</hi> and <hi>stalks</hi> to the very <hi>head;</hi> ranging them side by side and shelving, where they finish their <hi>heads,</hi> and will keep a long time; whereas if they left them abroad in the ground, the heats would cause them run to <hi>seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> are satisfyed to have them by the end of <hi>Autumn</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to eat in the <hi>Winter:</hi> not but that (being early raised) they

And therefore I counsel you to sowe but a few up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your first <hi>Bed</hi> in the <hi>Meloniere</hi> thinly, sowing them thinly in <hi>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es,</hi> four fingers asunder, and covering them with the mould. Two or three ridges shall abundantly suffice your store.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> when your <hi>Melons</hi> are off from their beds and <hi>transplanted,</hi> you may renew your sowing of <hi>Coleflowers,</hi> (as you were taught before) these will <hi>head</hi> in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the <hi>Frosts,</hi> to be spent during the <hi>Winter.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</label> You must stay before you remove 
 them till the leaves are as large as the <hi>Ralme</hi> of your hand, that they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45415:96"/> may be strong. Pare away the <hi>tops</hi> of them, and earth them up to the very <hi>necks, that is,</hi> so deep that the top leaves appear not above three fingers out of the ground, or to be more <hi>intelligible,</hi> you shall interre them to the last and upmost <hi>knot;</hi> Moreover you must hollow little <hi>Basins</hi> of about half a foot <hi>Diameter,</hi> and four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers deep at the foot of each <hi>stalk,</hi> that the moysture may passe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Root</hi> when you water them, it being unprofitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting.</label> The just <hi>distance</hi> in <hi>transplanting</hi> 
 is three foot asunder; two ranges are sufficient for each <hi>Bed:</hi> But be careful to keep them weeded and dug as often as they require it, till the <hi>leaves</hi> cover the ground, and are able to choke the weeds that grow under them.</p>
                  <p>If you make <hi>Pits</hi> in the places where you remove them, aud bestow
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45415:97"/> some good Soil (as I described in <hi>Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers)</hi> they will the better answer your expectations, for they will produce much fairer heads.</p>

 whatever they be, must be carefully watred at first, for a few dayes after their planting that they may take the better <hi>root,</hi>
 which you shall then perceive, when their leaves begin to <hi>erect,</hi> and flag no longer upon the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Sowing.</label> All kindes of <hi>Cabbages</hi> are to be <hi>sown</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>April</hi> you shall sowe fresh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same bed and place where your <hi>Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers</hi> stood.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45415:97"/> they bear the <hi>husk</hi> of it upon the tops of their leaves; I will teach you how you may preserve them. Some spread a <hi>Net</hi> over the <hi>Beds,</hi> sustaining it half a foot above the surface: others stick little <hi>Mills</hi> made of <hi>Cards,</hi> (such as Children in play run against the winde with) and some make them with thin <hi>Chips</hi> of <hi>Firre,</hi> such as the <hi>Comfit makers</hi> boxes are made withall, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tree or <hi>Pole</hi> which bears it some <hi>Feathers,</hi> or thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually trembles; this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely affright the <hi>Birds</hi> in the day time, and the <hi>Mice</hi> in the night; for the least breath of <hi>winde</hi> will set them a whirling, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the mischief.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Those of <hi>Aubervilliers</hi> are very free, and a delicate meate.</p>
                  <p>There is another sort of <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage</hi> streaked with <hi>red veines,</hi> the stalk whereof is of a <hi>purple colour</hi> when you plant it, and they seem to me, the most naturall of all the rest, for they <hi>pome,</hi> close to the ground and shoot but few leaves before they are headed, growing so extreamly close, that they are almost flat at top.</p>

                  <p>A man may <hi>transplant</hi> them confusedly in whole quarters, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the paler sort, for the frosts; but it is neither so commodious as in <hi>beds</hi> for the ease of watring them, nor for the distinction of their <hi>species:</hi> Be carefull to take away

They affect a <hi>sandy</hi> ground well soyled, and turned up two or three times, and so they will come very fair, there are some that are as big as a <hi>twopeny loafe:</hi> You must draw them out of the ground before the <hi>frosts,</hi> and conserve them in a warme place, as you do your <hi>Turneps.</hi>

 may be sown at every decrease of the <hi>Moon,</hi> from the time you begin your hot <hi>Melon-Bed,</hi> to the very end of <hi>October.</hi> They are several wayes ordered: for if you desire them very fair, <hi>transparent,</hi> clean and long, you must when you sowe your <hi>Melons</hi> in some part of the <hi>Bed,</hi> (whilst it yet remains warm) make <hi>holes</hi> as deep as your <hi>finger,</hi>
 three inches distant from each other. In every of these <hi>holes</hi> drop in two <hi>Radish seeds,</hi> and covering them with a little <hi>sand</hi> leave the rest of the <hi>hole</hi> open: thus they will grow to the whole length of your finger higher then otherwise they would

                  <p>To be excellent, they must not remain above <hi>six-weekes</hi> in the ground, least they become <hi>worm-eaten,</hi> withered, ill meat, and full of strings.</p>
