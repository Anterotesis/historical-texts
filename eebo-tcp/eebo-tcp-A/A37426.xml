            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Englishman's Choice,
AND TRUE
INTEREST.</head>
            <p>WHEN I find those very Men, who in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reigns, had Sacrificed our Religious
and Civil Rights, to the pleasures of their Princes,
or Humours of a Governing Party; now to set up
for <hi>Patriots,</hi> in Opposing, or undervaluing, one
of the best Princes that ever sat on the <hi>English-Throne;</hi>
Indignation, if not the Love of my
Country, were enough to make me Write.</p>
            <p>Who, says the Wise <hi>Satyrist,</hi> could endure the
<hi>Gracchi</hi> talking against Sedition? And what true
<hi>Englishman</hi> can with Patience hear them Declaim
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54995:3"/>
against Taxes for carrying on the War against
<hi>France,</hi> who were Eager to give what the Court
could ask, in a War against Protestants? Who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and connived at the <hi>Late King</hi>'s Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Seizing the Customs; and would rather we
should be at the Mercy of <hi>France,</hi> to take all
if it pleases, than to part with what bears no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the vast Benefit which we have, in the
security of our Religion, Estats, and Lives, from
the Barbarity of an Inhuman Enemy: Who may
be very good Companions for those <hi>Well-bred
Gentlemen,</hi> which are so fond of them; but would
be ill Masters of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall those Men Complain, that <hi>English-Blood,</hi>
or Treasure, is spent in so necessary a War; who
were Accessary to the solemn Murders in Form of
Law of the Best and Noblest of the <hi>English-Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
Such as would gladly have dyed in that cause,
which our Degenerate <hi>Englishmen</hi> now start
from.</p>
            <p>Is not danger in the Field, much more desirable
than to be at the mark of a Bloody <hi>Ruling Party,</hi>
which after their breaking in upon the <hi>City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s
Liberty of Electing <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> could never
miss of having any Man's Life in their Power, nor
ever spared where they thought it their Interest
to destroy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54995:3"/>
Shall those Men, who by Surrenders of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and other Sordid Compliances, Prostituted
the Constitution of the <hi>English Monarchy</hi> to the
<hi>Papists</hi> behind the Court-Curtain; deny the Right
of their <hi>Present Majesties,</hi> and set themselves against
the passing any Law which may oblige Men to
acknowledge their Right, out of pretended Zeal
for the Constitution?</p>
            <p>Shall these Men hope to Convince the World,
or do they themselves believe, that the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
places all Authority unalterably in the first
upon the Royal Line, without any regard to
Laws? If it be so, what make they of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
it self? How did any become Lawful
Governours? And how came it to pass, that the
pretended Martyrs for a false Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> the Paper which he pressed the Bishops to Sign, to assure him and the Nation, that they were not for the Prince of <hi>O.</hi>
               </note>
refused to give the <hi>Late King</hi> any
assurance, that they would adhere to
him? And that, upon our <hi>Present
King</hi>'s Advancing towards <hi>London,</hi>
they invited him to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
before the <hi>Late King</hi> left <hi>England?</hi> Did
they make no Scruple to turn him out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and yet, after others are settled, are they
troubled with Qualms of Conscience about the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54995:4"/>
former Right? Is it tollerable for them to say, they
would not have had his <hi>Present Majesty King,</hi>
when they had assisted so truely to <hi>Vnking</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and no reall Medium was left, but <hi>King
William</hi> or a <hi>Common-wealth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But can they pretend Conscience, who have
none against Pensions and Places, from a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Right of which they disown? and they
above all, who not only declare against the <hi>Right</hi>
of those <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom they have Sworn <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi>
but, after enriching themselves beyond
measure, in Offices of the greatest trust under
them; have betrayed their Trust so manifestly,
that there is hardly any body, now, who does
not see it? The <hi>Notorious</hi> and <hi>Publick</hi> Marks of
which <hi>Treachery</hi> may be so Traced Step by
Step, and set in so True a Light, that no
Body who is not a Party with them, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
Blinded, should question it.</p>
            <p>I must needs say, if such there are in the
World, who have Read Scripture, and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to that great Advantage, and so good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as to apply to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> what is spoken
of a forced Submission, saying, <hi>We submitted to
him in the day of his Power;</hi> Or what some Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
speak of <hi>H.</hi> 4th's scruple when he had loss'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54995:4"/>
his Senses, about his Supposed Usurpation; such
must be thought, like Men of Honour, to have
given fair warning of what were to be expected
from them.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>His Majesty</hi> has run the hazard of lose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Affections of his best Subjects, by that
only fault, of being too good to his Enemies;
who can doubt, but he who has ventured so much,
and done such great things, for the good of
the Nation, will do this one thing only, yet to
be desired, which is, to take from his Enemies
the Opportunities of betraying him.</p>
            <p>At his first Landing the Serpents lay expiring
under his feet, but his Goodness, which like
the Sun Communicated warmth to all, gave
them new life, and power to Sting. How happy
a thing it is, that they have shewn so much of
their Natures! Had they been less open, they
might still have upholden that Credit, which the
pretence of zeal for <hi>The Church,</hi> and the <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
had buoyed up so long; and we might still be wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a lingring War with <hi>France;</hi> which by
Vigorous and Speedy Supplies, honestly Managed,
may soon be ended to the Glory both of <hi>Prince</hi>
and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54995:5"/>
It was observed of the <hi>Old Romans,</hi> that they
were the more formidable by their losses to
the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> Which made them more U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
at home; more Active against the Enemy;
and Careful to find out Persons able to serve
the <hi>Common-Wealth:</hi> Nor can we expect less, from
the Wisdom and Resolution of the <hi>English Nation:</hi>
which will own the <hi>King's Title,</hi> and serve him;
without respect to a few Men, who have no
Power in <hi>England</hi> but from the <hi>King.</hi> They
pretend, indeed, to be <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi>
while they are undermining its Foundations:
And would make the <hi>Church</hi> of an Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Divided Party; Dissenters</hi> from the <hi>True
Church of England,</hi> the best of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and
<hi>Gentry,</hi> and the <hi>whole body of the People:</hi> Who are
entirely for <hi>His Majesty,</hi> as he has Redeem'd
them from <hi>Popery:</hi> Against which the <hi>Church of
England</hi> has long been a known Bulwark.</p>
            <p>They talk high for <hi>Monarchy;</hi> but are not for
the <hi>English Monarchy</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> And conjure up the
Phantasm of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> to divert the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the Power of <hi>France:</hi> Nothing
but the worst <hi>Ministry</hi> ever made a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
tollerable in <hi>England:</hi> Nor has the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it been raised of late for any better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54995:5"/>
than the discrediting them who are not for
the Government of the <hi>Late King,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who have laboured under that imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are the Men who declared for their <hi>Present
Majesties,</hi> when the others would have <hi>King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
only a <hi>Regent;</hi> a <hi>Protector</hi> of a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi>
or Officer under <hi>King Iames,</hi> during his pleasure;
or rather under them, till their turn were serv'd;
without any sense of Gratitude for the <hi>Deliverance</hi>
wrought for 'em.</p>
            <p>While our blind Zelots for <hi>Monarchy</hi> shew, that
<hi>King Iames,</hi> and the <hi>French King,</hi> are the only
<hi>Monarchs</hi> they would serve; interest, as well as
Inclination, and Duty, carry the <hi>supposed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-Men,</hi>
to do their utmost for a <hi>Prince,</hi> who
Revives to them the Memory of the best of those
<hi>Kings,</hi> which have Headed <hi>English</hi> Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>When they consider, how much <hi>This King</hi>
does in his own Person, beyond any example of
this Age, unless of the <hi>Great Gustavus,</hi> who rais'd
and supported the <hi>Protestant</hi> interest in <hi>Germany;</hi>
how truly he makes good the Character of His
<hi>Illustrious Family,</hi> in being the <hi>Deliverer</hi> of oppressed
Nations; how well he performs his part, how
much soever his Affairs the Clogg'd at Home;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54995:6"/>
with what Wisdom he Unites, and Keeps toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Confederates</hi> against the <hi>Disturber</hi> of the
Peace of <hi>Christendom;</hi> what Life he gives to their
Troops; and what reall Advantages he causes them
to obtain, not suffering <hi>Flanders</hi> to be over-run
by so powerful an Army, of Soldiers long Train'd
up to War, under the same Discipline, and Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Examples of the Flower of their <hi>Nobility,</hi>
and <hi>Gentry;</hi> these suppos'd <hi>Commonwealths-Men,</hi> are
ready with their Estates and Persons to make War
in good earnest, and put the <hi>French</hi> under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of waiting upon our Designs, and not we
upon theirs; and of Disgorging their Usurpations
upon our <hi>Allies,</hi> if they will preserve what more
truly belongs to them.</p>
            <p>I well know, some there are, who, as they desire we
should fall by our selves, Suggest that we may stand
so; that our Navy may Guard our Coasts against
Invasions; or our <hi>Militia,</hi> and other Forces at
home, may be enough to preserve us if Enemies
Land.</p>
            <p>These Men cannot but own, that it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for <hi>England</hi> to be at Charges in keeping the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
at a distance, than to be the Seat of War: And
that if any one of those <hi>Allies,</hi> which they underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
joyn'd with <hi>France,</hi> it were such an Accession
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54995:6"/>
to its power, as the <hi>French</hi> Party here would be very
glad of: nor is there any one of them, which would
not in such Case, be as much Magnified by that
Party, as now they are Lessened.</p>
            <p>But it is evident, that if the <hi>French</hi> should swallow
<hi>Flanders</hi> (which they had certainly done before now,
if it had not been for the <hi>Confederacy) Holland,</hi> which
has lately set us so good an Example since the Battle
of <hi>Landen,</hi> must necessarly truckle, and their Navy
be at the Command of <hi>France:</hi> And how could
we expect a Fleet able to secure us against both;
when, hitherto, we and <hi>Holland</hi> in Conjunction,
have done so little against the Naval Force of <hi>France?</hi>
Excepting that Memorable time, when <hi>Admiral
Russel</hi> (whose Victory was by some Men held a
crime) to his Eternal Honour and Glory, so well
maintain'd the Reputation of the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>If <hi>France</hi> had no Enemy but <hi>England,</hi> and were
at liberty to employ against it all their Armies in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
and in their Garisons (which together amount to
near 400000 Men) while so many here shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready to declare for them; what could <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hope for, but to be a Field of Blood? And how
could we think that the <hi>French</hi> Swords would be
sheathed, while there were one <hi>Protestant</hi> remaining?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54995:7"/>
Nay, when we consider, how Barbarously they use
the People whom they subdue, tho' of their own
Religion, without regard to Religious Houses, or
Churches, or the Sepulchres of Princes; we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the <hi>English Papists</hi> should find little better
quarter than others. They who have had such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
proofs of the <hi>English Valour,</hi> and Enmity to them,
would take care never more to be in fear of their
ancient Enemies: Nor is it to be thought, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing less than our total Extirpation would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie 'em.</p>
            <p>When on the other side we consider, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Treachery of those among us, who
by all manner of Tyes have been obliged to do their
utmost against <hi>France;</hi> notwithstanding the Union
and Fidelity in that <hi>King</hi>'s Counsels; and his greatest
Efforts which he design'd should be decicive this
last year; yet our King has stopt the progress of his
Arms, and has given that Reputation to the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
that where he is in Person <hi>France</hi> will never
Attack them without double their number; what
less can be expected, from the Gratitude and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
of a brave People, to so Great a Prince; but
that they will put him into a Capacity to meet the
<hi>French</hi> with equal numbers; which is to be assuredly
the Arbiter of a secure and honorable peace; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54995:7"/>
that the more Glorious, by how many the greater
Difficulties the Treachery of his pretended Friends
has obliged him to struggle with.</p>
            <p>How impatiently did this Nation bear the private
Caballing Designs, of former King's, which have
kept them in against <hi>France?</hi> What is it that they
more coveted for this last Age, than to have a <hi>Prince</hi>
firm, beyond all possibility of doubt, in the Nation's
Quarrel; and who would be sure to endeavour to
chuse such under him, as would Second, if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
the universal bent, and desire, of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Iugurth,</hi> in ancient times, was known with
presents to have corrupted the greatest part of the
Council of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have kept them from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
their <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Ally,</hi> when a vigorous War
had been for their honour and interest: Nor did
that <hi>bribing King</hi> ever think, in good earnest, of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
himself, till <hi>Metellus,</hi> a Man of known pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
courage, and integrity, was at the head of affairs.</p>
            <p>Nor can we hope to bring <hi>France</hi> to reason by <hi>French
Pensioners,</hi> if any such there be: We may learn from
their faithful Historian <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> that <hi>French</hi>
money us'd to be very currant in the <hi>Enlish Nation:</hi>
It is not for me to say it has had any influence of late:
But I may say, there has been such a chain of Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
somewhere, that every step looks as if the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54995:8"/>
were taken from <hi>France.</hi> Yet all the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be feared is not only from Money: For ill
habits, natures, or principles, do equally corrupt, and
turn Men from the service of this Government.</p>
            <p>I must needs think it no undue Censure to say,
that no Man, who understands the Constitution of
this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> can be against the <hi>present Government</hi>
out of <hi>principle:</hi> For whoever questions the right of
it, either has not used due means of informing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
how fully the settlement is warranted by the
Constitution; or has that want of Judgment, which
makes him a dependant upon the Judgment of others:
and the practice of them, who give Rules to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Vulgar, has been so inconsistent with it self,
as well as with their profess'd Principles; that they
must be asham'd of pretending to any thing but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy;
and deserve the same credit with the <hi>French</hi>
King, when, with his Fleet upon our Coasts, he so
Graciously declared for the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to them who come in to the Government, and
yet deny its Right; or place it upon such an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
bottom, as is a Virtual denyal of it; whether
<hi>Conquest,</hi> or such a <hi>Providence</hi> as gives one's Purse to
a <hi>Robber;</hi> it must be said, that we find not this <hi>fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Party</hi> the same Men in one station that they are
in another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54995:8"/>
But what ever party they are of, through whose
hand the Administration has pass'd; they ought to
remember that Old Saving, <hi>The Publick Affairs
will not be ill Administred.</hi> In this Case bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion,
or inadvertency, or want of Intelligence,
is a crime of an high Nature. And if any Man
has arrived to that height, to own himself the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of laying aside a <hi>Victorious Admiral,</hi> because
he has been against him in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
this would be to assume more than Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and such Insolence, if there were no more it it,
would deserve equal punishment with the most
<hi>Notorious Treachery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any in the Government have held out a
Flag of Truce to its Enemies; If being against
the Right of their Majesties, has with them been
a Recommendation to Preferment; and zeal for
their Right a Cause of Disgrace; what in others
might pass only for <hi>Mismanagement,</hi> cannot but
be judged <hi>Treachery</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>Whatevever is given under the Management
of Men of an other Allegiance, is but providing
Cannon to be turned upon our selves. But when
Men are assured that they who hold their <hi>present
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54995:9"/>
Majesties</hi> to be our <hi>Lawful,</hi> and <hi>Rightful,</hi> King
and Queen (which is the True Test of Loyalty)
shall be the only Persons entrusted under them
with the Administration; Who is he that
Wishes well to <hi>England,</hi> that will not Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Contribute to his Power, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Right of a Prince, without whom
we cannot hope to be long a People?</p>
            <p>They who have asserted his Right from the
first Settlement of it, as they have therein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the <hi>Late King,</hi> we may be sure
can have no Merit to plead upon another
change; Nor will they Act to their own Apparent
Ruine, and hold the Bason at the cutting of their
own Throats.</p>
            <p>Others, tho' they cannot long enjoy their
Crimes, may Fancy, that what they have done
for a <hi>French Tyrany,</hi> and their fitness to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of it, may continue to them the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
they are now possessed of: or, at least,
they may be assured of the Ill-natured Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
of seeing those whom they have long
trampled on, destroyed before them,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54995:9"/>
And, indeed, were it not for the inhumane plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Malice and Envy, it were impossible that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
and they men at ease in their Fortunes, should
engage in Plots against a Government, which is the
only Security of their Religion and Estates. And the
good of <hi>England</hi> is so bound up in the Life of <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
that it can hardly be thought that numbers of any
Party should engage against him. The Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
owe to him that Protection, and Security, which
<hi>King Iames</hi> could not have given them; besides the
restitution of those Fundamental Laws, in the defence
of which their Fore-fathers had signaliz'd themselves:
when they so truly distinguished between the <hi>Church
of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very <hi>good Catholicks,</hi> when they maintain'd
their Liberties, by <hi>resisting</hi> the <hi>Usurpations</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> and
of <hi>Princes,</hi> as no part of <hi>Gods Ordinances.</hi> The
High Church, and Passive-Obedience Men, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the most sensible of the mischief of the <hi>late Reign;</hi>
as they found such advances towards turning them
out of all Offices in <hi>Church</hi> and State and their most
celebrated Heads had, while under that Sense, in
their Proposals to <hi>King Iames;</hi> their refusal to sign an
abhorrence of any design against him; their closing
with the <hi>Deliverance,</hi> if not inviting the <hi>Deliverer;</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54995:10"/>
joyning to put him into possession of the Power of the
Nation; acted so contrary to all their former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
that one would have thought they had
all of a sudden, become <hi>Englishmen;</hi> and would have
vindicated the <hi>Reformation</hi> from the Reproach under
which it has suffer'd, as if we lost in Civil Rights while
we gain'd
in Spiritual; and that to be true Christians,
we were to lay all our Worldly Goods at the feet of
our Princes, that they might distribute them among
these <hi>Successors</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>moderate true Church Party,</hi> could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
to find such a return of their Endeavours, in
the Settlement of the Government upon a Bottom,
for which they had ventured so far, and so long, to no
purpose. But if any of them who have suffered in the
Publick Cause, or sympathiz'd with them that did,
now fall off from a Settlement, call'd for by the
Voice of the People, and the Necessities of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
what do they but condemn themselves; or those
their Friends, who by their laudable Endeavours for
the <hi>Bill of Exclusion,</hi> shewed that their Religion was
more Sacred to them, than the suppos'd <hi>Divine Right</hi>
of Succession vested in a Popish Prince. But if such
men desert this Government, the Blood of the <hi>Lord
Russel, Colonel Sydney, Sir Thomas Armstrong, Alderman
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54995:10"/>
Cornish,</hi> and many other Sufferers for the Publick, will
in great measure lye at their doors, as accessaries <hi>ex post
facto</hi> to their Murders, and <hi>partakers</hi> of the Crime:
with whatever pomp they <hi>adorn</hi> their <hi>Sepulchres;</hi> what
do they but pay honour to the memories of <hi>Iefferies,</hi>
and of those willing <hi>Iury-men,</hi> who helpt to dispatch so
many Traytors to God and their King?</p>
            <p>But certainly it would be very strange if any of
them, who have so justly exploded the Doctrine of the
Bowstring, should become Proselites to it: and if
any one of their Spiritual Guides should now be for
<hi>King Iames,</hi> or <hi>King Lewis;</hi> I should think him worse
than <hi>Father Peters;</hi> who may be said to have acted
with uniformity to a Principle; when such men must
be destitute of all colour for their Actions, and indeed
of Common Sense: unless they can think to bring
back <hi>King Iames</hi> without <hi>French</hi> Forces; or to restrain
those Insolences, which the <hi>French</hi> Faction would
give them the opportunity to commit. Should they
think to supplant this Government, and set up an other,
without such selp, the vanity and madness were past
cure, or pity; nor, considering the power of <hi>France,</hi>
and how little vertue is left in those who should take
cure for the Nation; can <hi>Englishmen</hi> see any anchor
for their hopes and expectations of Good to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
but in <hi>King WILLIAM.</hi>

            <p>

Is there any man who, tho' he set out well<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is
weary of the race of Glory; not finding the Reward
due to his Merit, or not enough to satisfie a boundless
ambition? let him consider how many, like the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenian
Brethren</hi> of old, contentedly suffered themselves
to be buried alive, to maintain the boundaries of their
Country: and that Perseverance in a Good Cause
gives a Pleasure equal to the greatest Rewards; and
and is more honourable than the highest promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Let him not envy those men whose rise has been a
publick calamity; but those <hi>Volunteers</hi> in the Cause of
<hi>God,</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Conntry,</hi> whom constancy, and
the general Voice, advance to the notice of their <hi>Prince.</hi>
Can it be thought that when he comes, to know what
men have adhered to their Countries Cause in the
worst of Times, and what men served for the sake of
that, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes;
that this great mind will leave it in the power of some
few to keep such men down, by their misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
when he knows, that these might have been
as great as their Expectations, or Desires, if they
would have joyn'd with the Enemies to the <hi>English
Liberties<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> who can believe, that he who refus'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Liberties of <hi>Holland,</hi> when <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54995:11"/>
tempted him with a Crown, and <hi>a carte blanche;</hi>
will not reward such virtue where ever he finds it.</p>
            <p>Courage is, if not the Source, at least the sign of all
other vertues, in Princes especially: nor can a Nation
ever apprehend an Invasion of their Liberties, but
from pusillanimous Princes; whose fears make them
grasp at false securities, instead of what they might be
certain of; in the prosperity and affection of their
Subjects: they who read the History of this Kingdom,
and mark the Characters of those Princes who have
been encompassed with Armies of Mercenaries at
home, and them who have headed the <hi>English</hi> abroad;
may be satisfied, that Examples to warrant this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
need not be fetch'd from foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>And as we have reason to believe, that <hi>our King</hi>
can desire nothing more than the good of his People;
we ought, as we love our Country, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Station and Capacity, to contribute
our Endeavours, that <hi>England</hi> may not be wanting to
its self, or in gratitude to him: and, indeed, it must be
said, it has had so few good Princes, that it has always,
till now, acted as in a transport upon the very expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such an one; not need we go farther back for
an instance than to the beginning of the last Reign.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, our King has no quarrel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54995:12"/>
upon his People; and has manifested that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to unite all Parties, and Interests, against the
Common Enemy; which if <hi>King Iames</hi> had in the
least inclined to, all the Blood and Treasure which
has been spent in this necessary War, would have been
spar'd; and Christendom might have enjoyed that
settled Peace, which can be expected from nothing,
under <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>King WILLIAM</hi>'s Arms.</p>
            <p>Let it never be said, that we have neglected an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
for the use of which late posterity will
praise; as, otherwise, they will curse us, for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>French</hi> Slavery to them.</p>
            <p>Whoever will come into the Standard, perhaps the
last that will be set up against <hi>France,</hi> is to be embraced
as a Friend to <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> But many, it must be confess'd,
ought to go through a state of trial, before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into any place of Trust. The most gentle, the most
safe <hi>(like the Military Sacrament among the</hi> Romans) must
needs be an Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to Their <hi>present Majesties:</hi>
not an Oath, which either can bear a doubtful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
or, at least, has been interpreted into air, by
Men who seem to think, that as long as they do not in
words acknowledge the Right of Their <hi>present Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties,</hi>
there can be no Perjury by Implication: But
such an Oath as may rise in judgment, even in this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54995:12"/>
World, against every body who shall act any thing
aginst the Right of <hi>Their Majesties:</hi> An Oath, which will
leave no Loop-hole; and by which, as by the Word
to an Army, we may know who and who are together.</p>
            <p>It will never be well, till the generality are
engaged to be for the Government in all events.
Some, for certain, there are, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
desperate in this Cause; and, as they never
thought of making peace with the other side, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of pardon. They abhor a double Game,
and leave it to others, to be Heads of a Party which
is against the Government, and to support its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
under colour of getting into their Secrets, or
bringing them over from their Principle, or Faction.
They give Men Characters according as they find
their affections to the Publick, whatever their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
has been towards them: nor have they Friend
or Enemy; but as they are for, or against, their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
The love of which, as <hi>Cicero</hi> well says, <hi>is above
all other Loves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who would be <hi>Trimmers</hi> in this Cause,
make it evident, they are for having the ship of State
sink all at once: King <hi>William</hi>'s, and our Countries
side, can never have too much weight against <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor, howmuch soever some talk for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54995:13"/>
               <hi>English Monarchy,</hi> can they reasonably expect to see it
flourish, but under King <hi>William;</hi> or till His Wisdom,
and his Arms, have left it secured to us?</p>
            <p>I know it is difficult to make men wise, when the
Wit and Mony of <hi>France</hi> raise so much Art to impose
upon them: Yet this would be lost upon the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> if all disguises were thrown off;
and they who are for <hi>France,</hi> or King <hi>Iames,</hi> would
speak out. That well meaning Men may no longer
be cheated by their false appearances; it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to pull off their Masks, and borrowed Faces.</p>
            <p>1. They are very copious upon the theam of Taxes,
and the exporting Mony to our Armies abroad, or to
assist any of the <hi>Confederates;</hi> but chiefly upon the
payment to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> for their Charges
in the late Expedition. They would have it believ'd,
that <hi>France</hi> would bring in a shorter Reckoning; and
would rather-have the Nation, like <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
keep its Riches for a Prey to the Enemy, than to
give part to keep them out.</p>
            <p>2. They to the prejudice of Thier Majesties, their
Crown and Dignity, advance Subjects to be Head
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> When a Man has once
receiv'd that Unction, his Person is become sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and to suggest that such an one is <hi>treacherous</hi> is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54995:13"/>
matter of excommunication. But who can, with patience
hear it said; in such a Man the Government loses or
disobliges a <hi>whole Party?</hi> When, if the <hi>Party</hi> be for
the Government, they will esteem no man longer
than he can be thought true to it: If they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, kindness to any of them will but embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the rest, and give them opportunities for mischief.
Who, when his House is beset with Thieves,
finding some of them lurking within, instead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to master them, will think to tempt them to his
defence, against their accomplices? They are too
far engag'd with one another, to dare to be honest
till their whole gang is; nor can they be reclaim'd by
gentle usage.</p>
            <p>3. They have their known <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> to
distinguish their Party from all others: (the Church)
and (the King) are the words given among them,
to unite <hi>Papist,</hi> and <hi>High-Church, Iacobite,</hi> and <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they have a certain Anagram, which joins
<hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Iames;</hi> but always preferring their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>France,</hi> witness the Health (<hi>LIMP</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And well knowing, that <hi>England,</hi> as the Great
Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> has rightly observ'd, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
but by it self, and its own inbred Diseases;
they make and foment distemper'd Heats among us;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54995:14"/>
while they divide <hi>Protestants</hi> into different Clans and
Interests; and while they make many Parties
of them who should be but one, or two at the
most, they seem to wish us <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s Fate: But
when the Enemy has a party within our Gates; they
who would be of no Party, at least are not against the
destruction of their Country.</p>
            <p>4. They magnify the power of <hi>France,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of its way of Government to make War, or
command Peace; and mightily lessen, and reproach
the <hi>Confederates;</hi> and that chiefly under a popular
Mask of Zeal against Leagues with Popish Princes:
which they, Good men! are so far from, that they
are for submitting to the worst of them without terms.</p>
            <p>5. They insinuate, as if <hi>England</hi> bears the Charge of
a needless War, to maintain the Dominion of a forein
Prince, not considering that the <hi>Dutch</hi> alone have in
their pay 106540 Men, besides their allowing 25000
Gilders a Month towards carrying on the War in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont:</hi>
and are so far from being discouraged by the
late Misfortunes, from a vigorous prosecution of the
War, that they have added 15000 to their former Land
Forces; besides encreasing their Navy.</p>
            <p>And it's a known Maxim, that the preservation of
<hi>Flanders</hi> is more for the interest of <hi>England,</hi> than of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54995:14"/>
               <hi>Spain.</hi> If <hi>Flanders</hi> be an accession to <hi>France, Holland</hi>
must soon follow, and <hi>England</hi> next. They are like
Nine-Pins the throwing down one carries the rest</p>
            <p>The importance of <hi>Flanders</hi> is sufficiently confess'd
by these Gentlemen, when they would have others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is a necessity of our truckling to <hi>France</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the taking a Town or two there; and yet they are
for giving it all up: but any man who has seen the
noble Towns, and large Country yet remaining, would
think it very well worth the preserving. <hi>Antwerp</hi> it
self, if it were in the <hi>French</hi> Hands, would command
the Trade of Christendom.</p>
            <p>6. They are very invective against <hi>French</hi> Protestants
among us, as promoting Schism, eating the Bread out
of our Mouths, and being Spies for <hi>France:</hi> as if
they wish'd them their persecution again.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>Dutch</hi> they would render more dangerous
than <hi>either</hi> of the <hi>Turks;</hi> because of the strength of
their Shipping, and their Rivalship with us in Trade;
not considering, how they themselves have helpt to
raise <hi>France</hi> to be a match for us and <hi>Holland;</hi> and,
how likely it is, by the dividing either from the other
to swallow both: yet, by open ill usage, or a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
and fatal friendship, they would drive the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to take part against us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54995:15"/>
8. They represent it dangerous to arm the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> out of a pretended fear of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth;</hi> and in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for fear the
<hi>Church</hi> should be over-run with <hi>Protestants</hi> of all sorts;
holding the <hi>French</hi> Power and <hi>Popery,</hi> to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
dangers, or more tolerable evils.</p>
            <p>9. They beyond measure magnify that Service the
<hi>Dissenting Bishops</hi> did themselves, in appearing for
<hi>England</hi> in their own defence; and improve that Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and Transport which the Nation was in, to see
them once in their Lives <hi>Protestants,</hi> and <hi>Englishmen,</hi>
without marks of distinction; into an awing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with an imaginary reputation; the very
ground of which fail'd, as soon as they fell off from
the common Cause. Nor must they think it an easy
thing to dispose this Nation to turn out a <hi>Protestant
King;</hi> because they followed those Leaders, as they
would any others, against <hi>Popery.</hi> God be thanked,
we have a Prince who will not quit His possession
without bloody Shirts.</p>
            <p>They may have vanity enough to fancy, that they
made this Revolution; when they were no more than
Flyes upon the wheel, which the Sufferings of <hi>Lord
Russel,</hi> and others, first set a going. Their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the <hi>Tower,</hi> was but the last drop with which
the Vessel ran over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54995:15"/>
Yet if we reflect upon the Shares some of them had in
laying or holding on, that burden, which the Nation was
eager to throw off; we may own, that they contributed
to the <hi>Revolution,</hi> as Storms and Tempests do to clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sky for fair Weather.</p>
            <p>These, with a few hot headed <hi>Laymen,</hi> who have
always us'd the Church for a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and <hi>Asylum;</hi> set
up for a Church by themselves, divided from the Body
of the <hi>English Clergy,</hi> as well as <hi>Layty;</hi> and standing
between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since there is no hopes of the <hi>Cassandrian</hi> way, for
<hi>Rome</hi> to come to them; none is left but the <hi>Laudaean,</hi>
for them to advance towards <hi>Rome.</hi> And, indeed, it
was very visible, that they were doing drudgery for
the <hi>Papists,</hi> in former Reigns; while they were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to keep the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> upon a bottom,
which they neither design'd for National, or a means
of uniting with <hi>Protestants</hi> of other Countries.</p>
            <p>Can their Reputations weigh in <hi>England,</hi> against a
Government founded in common <hi>Protestantism?</hi> or
against the Reputations of those their Successors, whose
Piety, Learning and Moderation, as they kept them
from the highest Stations in the <hi>Church,</hi> against the
general Voice; at last promoted them with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of all, who wish well to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54995:16"/>
And though our <hi>Archbishop</hi> wants the advantage of
an education at <hi>Rome</hi> (which it seems the other has
not had to no purpose) the greatest <hi>Bigots</hi> of the <hi>new
Sect</hi> cannot imagine him short of <hi>their Head,</hi> in any
real Ornament, or Qualification.</p>
            <p>10. They, tho masters of no virtue, are so far from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
what the greatest Enemies abroad admire in
our <hi>King</hi> that they have the <hi>insolence</hi> to speak unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of his Person; when they owe it to His Clemency, that
they are not chastised for it by the Fury of the People.</p>
            <p>11. They vilely insinuate, as if <hi>His Majesty</hi> were no
Friend to the <hi>English Nation:</hi> which no man can do,
without greatly undervaluing both <hi>Prince,</hi> and People. If
indeed, the most were like themselves, or what they
represent them; he would be under an unwelcome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
of living as in a Country of Enemies, who
would not have him Reign over them. But, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
none but they who are obstinately resolv'd against
loving him, can apprehend the hatred of a <hi>Prince,</hi>
whose goodness surprizes his greatest Enemies: tho the
Coals of Fire, which it heaps upon their heads, do not
melt them into any sense of gratitude, or shame.</p>
            <p>What follows? but that all true <hi>Englishmen,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their Guard against these <hi>Wolves in Sheeps
cloathing;</hi> and against all, who may at least be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54995:16"/>
of private ends; second the Intentions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> who cannot possibly be thought
to have any aim, or interest, but for the good of this
Nation, and Mankind in general.</p>
            <p>Let us not fear the Power of <hi>France;</hi> like infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diseases, it will come with a fear, which debilitates,
and disables from resistance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> at the Gates, as it was us'd to frighten the
Children of <hi>Rome;</hi> to the Men was a Call, and Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to take care of the Publick Safety. Not to have
despair'd of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> when its Fortune
seem'd most desperate, was as happy to them, as it
was glorious.</p>
            <p>And should the issue of opposing <hi>France</hi> be as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
as the most timerous, or most designing, pretend
to foretell; it were better, that the last day of our
being a free People, should overtake us doing our
duty, and struggling against our Chains, than helping
to put them on. And in truth, hardly any thing in
this life can be a real affliction, till men begin to sink
under the sense of having brought it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Those Protestants, who hope to plead the merit of
voluntary submissions and services to <hi>France;</hi> would
do well to consider, how it has been with those of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54995:17"/>
the Religion there, who enabled their King so to
use them.</p>
            <p>And those miserable Towns and Cities, which
thought, by delivering up their Keys to secure their
Houses, Estates, and Liberties; stand as so many
<hi>fir'd Beacons,</hi> to stir up all Nations against them.</p>
            <p>As the Power of <hi>France</hi> may be thought a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon our accessions to it formerly, and present
divisions; when we repent of the past, and mend the
present cause of that Calamity; we may well think
the Rod will be broken. Nor will <hi>France</hi> longer be
a scourge, than we deserve it.</p>
            <p>It is, doubtless, in our Power to remove the moral,
and judicial Cause, of our Fears: nor can we think
that all those Ravages, Persecutions, Perfidies, and
Contempts of God and Man; shall long go without
some remarkable Punishment. However, Humane
Greatness has its Limits and Periods; and <hi>France</hi>
seems to have seen its best days.</p>
            <p>If we use the means to humble it, by uniting, and
exerting, our strength; when once we come to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with it, and give it one powerful shock; like a
great Machine screw'd up to the height<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> it will
never leave turning, till it comes to the bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54995:17"/>
Inwhich happy day we shall no longer be troubled
with the scruples of the <hi>noisie few,</hi> that hold off from
this Government; or the distinctions of <hi>the many,</hi> who
soon settled the point, of accepting Preferments; but
are yet to seek of Salvoes to the Reputation of a <hi>Party;</hi>
which must change their Principles, and cease to be a
<hi>known Party,</hi> to come to those Grounds, upon which
the Nation received their <hi>present Majesties</hi> for <hi>King and
