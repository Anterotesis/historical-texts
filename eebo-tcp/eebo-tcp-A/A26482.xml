            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>TO pass by that <hi>Aelian</hi> (if his name were such, for some Copies reade <hi>Helian,</hi> others <hi>Hadrian</hi>) whom <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Epigr.</hi> 24. mentions as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary and friend: The first eminent person of this name was the Author of the Tacticks, who appears to have been (not a <hi>Roman</hi> but) a <hi>Grecian,</hi> in regard he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in his Preface that he had no knowledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tacticks. The time wherein he lived is manifestly collected from the same Preface, which he addresseth to the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> and in it saith that he met <hi>Nerva</hi> at <hi>Formiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later in time (as being contemporary with <hi>Philostratus</hi> the <hi>Lemnian</hi> who lived under <hi>Severus</hi>) was <hi>Aelian</hi> the Sophist, of whom <hi>Philostratus</hi> gives this account;</p>
            <p>Aelian <hi>was a</hi> Roman, <hi>but spoke Greek as purely as those who lived in the midst of</hi> Attica: <hi>This man seems to me worthy of praise; First, because though he lived in a City which used another Language, yet he arrived at the purity of the Greek: Next, because being honoured by the Title</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45846:4"/>
               <hi>of Sophist by those who used to confere such attributes, he was nothing the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of himself, nor conceited of his own opinion, nor exalted with so great a title, but making scrutiny into himself, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself not proper for publick declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he gave himself to writing, in which he was admirable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His style is unaffected, with a gracefulness beyond</hi> Nicostratus. <hi>Sometime he imitates</hi> Dion <hi>and his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On a time</hi> Philostratus <hi>the</hi> Lemnian <hi>found him intent upon a Book, and reading it with anger and eagerness, he asked him what he was about; He answered, I am making a declamation against</hi> Gynnis, <hi>for so I name that Tyrant who so lately by his infamous life dishonoured</hi> Rome. Philostratus <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I should have admired you, if you had declaimed against him whilest he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for to oppose a living Tyrant is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but every one can revile him when dead. This man said that he never went out of</hi> Italy, <hi>that he never went on Shipboard, or saw the Sea; for which he was much respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the</hi> Romans, <hi>as one that loved their manners. He was a hearer of</hi> Pausanius: <hi>but he admired</hi> Herod <hi>as the most florid of all Oratours. He lived above threescore years, and died without issue; for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45846:4"/>
               <hi>not the having of Children or mariage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suidas</hi> more briefly of the same <hi>Aelian of</hi> Preneste <hi>in</hi> Italy, <hi>chief Priest and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist, surnamed</hi> Claudius <hi>called</hi> Meliglos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <hi>and</hi> Melipthongus <hi>taught Rhetorick in</hi> Rome <hi>in the times after</hi> Adrian. <hi>Suidas</hi> implieth that he lived under <hi>Antoninus</hi> who succeeded <hi>Adrian,</hi> but that he was not the same with the other <hi>Aelian,</hi> Author of the Tacticks.</p>
            <p>This last <hi>Aelian</hi> in all probability, was the Author of this Treatise, as also of that concerning living Creatures; both which are one style, and that much different from his who wrote the Tacticks. In his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise concerning living Creatures he cites <hi>Dion (Cassius)</hi> who lived under <hi>Severus:</hi> In this, he takes many passages out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenaeus,</hi> not <hi>Athenaeus</hi> out of him; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenaeus</hi> is very punctual in citing his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors omitted by the other.</p>

               <p>I will relate to you an action of <hi>Phalaris</hi> not agreeing with his disposition: for it expresseth a great humanity, and therefore seemeth not to sute with him. <hi>Chariton</hi> an <hi>Agrigentine</hi> loved <hi>Melanippus</hi> passionately, who was also an <hi>Agrigentine,</hi> of a sweet disposition and excellent form. <hi>Phalaris</hi> had injured this <hi>Melanippus</hi> in a certain bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; for he having brought an Action against a Favourite of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant commanded him to surcease the Suit: He not obeying, the Tyrant threatned him with death unless he submitted. So being compelled he gave over the cause, and the Judges under <hi>Phalaris</hi> null'd the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; which the young man taking ill, said that he was wronged, and discovered his resentment thereof to his friend, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45846:22"/>
him to joyn with him in a Plot against the Tyrant, intending also to ingage some other young men, whom he knew proper and ready for such an attempt. <hi>Chariton</hi> seeing him inraged and inflamed with fury, and knowing that none of the Citizens would joyn in the design through fear of the Tyrant, said that he also had formerly the same intention, and should ever be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy above all things to free his Country from Slavery; but it was dangerous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate such things to many persons: wherefore he intreated <hi>Melanippus</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it more deliberately, and to permit him to finde out an opportunity proper for the attempt. The young man yielded. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton</hi> thereupon undertook the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness himself, not willing to engage his friend in it; that if he were taken and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he alone might bear the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his friend not share in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He provided himself of a Falchion to assault the Tyrant when he should see a fit occasion. This could not be carried so privately, but that he was apprehended by the Guard, watchful of such things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to Prison, and tortured to make discovery of his Complices, he couragiously endured the torment. But this continuing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45846:22"/>
a long time, <hi>Melanippus</hi> went to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and confessed that he was not onely a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirator, but Author of the Treason. The King demanding the cause that moved him to it, he declared the whole business from the beginning; how he was obstructed in his Suit, and that this was it which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him. The Tyrant wondering hereat set them both at liberty; but commanded them immediately to depart, not onely out of all Cities belonging to the <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> but quite out of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Yet he allowed them to receive the full benefit of their estates. These and their friendships <hi>Pythia</hi> afterwards commended in these Verses:</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45846:26"/>
accusing a person so farre from being guilty of any wrong to the State, that he was the onely Ornament of <hi>Athens.</hi> What then do they contrive?

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45846:26"/>
eminent for learning or vertue) they begun to be taken with the <hi>CLOUDS,</hi> [so was the Play named] and cried up the Poet with more applause then ever any before, giving him with many shouts the victory, and sending word to the Judges to set the name of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> in the highest place. <hi>Socrates</hi> came seldome to the Theatre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less when <hi>Euripides</hi> the Tragick Poet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested with any new Tragedian, then he used to goe: And when <hi>Euripides</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> he went thither also, for he loved the man as well for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as the sweetness of his Verse. Sometimes <hi>Alcibiades</hi> son of <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Critias</hi> son of <hi>Callaeschrus</hi> would invite him to a Comedy, and in a manner compell him: for he was so farre from esteeming, that he did greatly contemn those persons that were abusive and scurrilous in their language, (being himself a temperate, just, good and discreet person) which hugely troubled the Comedians. And this was the ground (as well as other things sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi>) of <hi>Aristopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> his Comedy; who, it is likely too, got a great summe of money by it, they being eager in prosecution of their design, and he prepared by want and malice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> deserves justly to be laughed at, who after he had contemned the works of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and made himself new waies to travel by land and water, fell in love with a Plane, and doted upon the Tree: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it is reported) in <hi>Lydia</hi> a tall Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, there he stayed a whole day, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity requiring, and pitched his Tents in the Wilderness about the Plane-tree: he also hung upon it many rich ornaments, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the boughs with chains and bracelets, and left it a Keeper, as the Guardian and Protectour of a Mistress. But what did this profit the Tree? the apposititious ornament nothing suiting with it, hung there in vain, not adding any thing to the beauty of the Tree. For to the beauty of a Tree are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site fair branches, leaves thick, a body strong, roots deep and plaint, yielding to the winds, wideness of shadow, the successive seasons of the year, the nourishment of the water by chanels and rains. But the Robes of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the gold of the <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and his other gifts, contribute nothing to the Plane, or any other Tree.</p>

               <p>There was great friendship betwixt <hi>Pausanias</hi> a <hi>Ceramean</hi> and <hi>Agatho</hi> the Poet: This is generally known; but I will relate what is less common. On a time the two friends came before <hi>Archelaus:</hi> He observing the frequent differences betwixt <hi>Pausanias</hi> and <hi>Agatho,</hi> and thinking that one friend despited the other, asked <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> what was the reason that he had such frequent quarrels with him who loved him so well. He answered, <q>O King, I will tell you: It is not that I am froward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, neither doe I this through ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity; but if I understand any thing of behaviour, as well by Poetry as other things, I finde that the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of friends is, after some falling out to be reconciled; and I am of opinion that nothing can happen to them more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful: Therefore I make him partake often of this pleasure, by falling out with him frequently. For he is over-joyed when I end the difference and am reconciled; whereas if I should use him alwaies alike,

he would not understand the difference.</q> 
                  <hi>Archelaus</hi> (as they say) commended this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

               <p>Lovers of Drink were <hi>Dionysius</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Nisaeus</hi> a Tyrant also, <hi>Apollocrates</hi> son of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant, <hi>Hipparinus</hi> kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Dionysius, Timolaus</hi> a <hi>Theban, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridemus</hi> an <hi>Orithean, Arcadion, Erasixenus, Alcetas</hi> a <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and <hi>Diotimus</hi> an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian.</hi> This last was called a Tunnel, because putting a Tunnel into his mouth, he could drink wine poured into it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking breath. They relate of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> that he was not onely a great Drinker, but that he also used the ill custome of the <hi>Scythians</hi> to drink Wine unallai'd. They say also that <hi>Io</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> the Poet, was an immoderate drinker of Wine. Likewise <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> in honour of <hi>Calanus</hi> the <hi>Brahman,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Sophist, that burned himself, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Games of Musick, Horse-racing and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45846:37"/>
Wrastling; to gratifie the <hi>Indians,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another part proper to that Country, which was Drinking. To him that should be Victor he appointed a Talent for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the next thirty <hi>Minae,</hi> to the third ten. <hi>Promachus</hi> got the Victory. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Dionysius,</hi> at the Feast which they call <hi>Choae,</hi> proposed a golden Crown as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to him that drank most. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> was Victor, and taking the Crown when he went away after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, put it upon a Statue of <hi>Mercury</hi> which stood at the door, according to his custome: for he used to lay there Garlands of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Myrrhe, Ivy, and Laurel, and leave them. Also <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> as it is said, drank much at <hi>Periander</hi>'s house. He brought this custome from his own Country, for it is proper for the <hi>Scythians</hi> to drink pure Wine. <hi>Lacydes</hi> and <hi>Timon,</hi> Philosophers, are said to have drank much. Likewise <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerinus</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> a Prophecy being brought him from <hi>Buta,</hi> foretelling that he should live but a little while, to delude the Oracle by doubling the time, turning nights into daies, watched and drank continually. To these adde <hi>Amasis</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> of whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> attests enough. And <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coteles</hi> a <hi>Corinthian</hi> must not be severed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45846:37"/>
from these. And they say also that <hi>Scopas</hi> the son of <hi>Creon</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the King were much addicted to Wine: for which reason he put the whole Government of his Kingdome into the hands of <hi>Aristaeus</hi> and <hi>Themisto, Cyprians,</hi> whilest he, given over to Drunkenness, bare onely the Title of King. Likewise <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> delivered as pledge to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> used to drink Wine immoderately. As also his name-sake <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Warre with the <hi>Medians</hi> against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces,</hi> was a slave to Drunkenness. Amongst these may be reckoned <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great. Immoderate drinking cast <hi>Agro</hi> King of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> into a Pleurisie, and kill'd him. Likewise <hi>Gentius</hi> another King of the <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> was a great Drinker. What shall we say of <hi>Orophernes</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who was also a great Drinker? And if we must mention Women, (in whom to love drink is a great vice, to drink much a greater) <hi>Clio,</hi> as they say, contended in drinking, not with Women onely, but with Men; for she was a great Drinker, and had the better of every one, carrying in my opinion a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful victory.</p>

It affords various pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of delight of all kinds, not wrought by the hand of man, but spontaneous works of Nature, which contributed much to the beauty and glory of the place from its first beginning. For Ivy full of down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds and flourisheth there, which like generous Vines creepeth up the high trees, and groweth with them. There is also plenty of Smallage, which climbing up the Hill shadoweth the Rock, so that it lies hid under it, nothing being seen but the green Herb, which yields a pleasant entertainment to the eye. In this Plain there are divers Groves and large Cupbords, which in the Summer afford grateful shelter to Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and refreshment. It is full of little Brooks and Springs of water, cool and pleasant to the tast. These waters, they say, benefit such as wash in them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to health. Birds are dispersed about every-where, especially the Musical, which yield extraordinary pleasure to the ear, and by continual warbling invite and delight the very passenger. On each side of the River are those pleasantnesses which I mentioned before, and places fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45846:40"/>
and diversion. Through the middle of the <hi>Tempe</hi> runneth the River <hi>Peneus</hi> gently and smoothly like oil. This is much shaded by the thick branches of the adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Trees, which for the greatest part of the day keep off the Sun's beams, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to those that sail a cool passage. All the neighbouring people meet with one another there, and offer sacrifice, converse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and feast. Whence there being many that sacrifice and perform Divine rites conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, it happeneth that such as travel thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either on foot or by water perceive very sweet odours. This unintermitted worship of the Gods makes the place sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. Here the <hi>Thessalians</hi> say that <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> having slain <hi>Pytho</hi> with his arrows at that time possessed of <hi>Delphi</hi> when the Goddess Earth held the Oracles, was by <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s command purified; and that then the son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Latona</hi> crowned with this <hi>Tempian</hi> Laurel, and bearing a branch thereof in his hand, came to <hi>Delphi</hi> and took possession of the Oracle. There is also an Altar in that place where he was crowned, and took away the branch. Whereupon even to this time the <hi>Delphians</hi> every ninth year send youths of Noble birth with an <hi>Architheorus,</hi> who is one of their own.

               <p>
                  <hi>Theopompus</hi> relates a discourse between <hi>Midas</hi> the <hi>Phrygian</hi> and <hi>Silenus.</hi> This <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> was son of a Nymph, inferiour by nature to the Gods onely, superiour to Men and Death. Amongst many other things, <hi>Silenus</hi> told <hi>Midas</hi> that <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> were Islands surrounded by the Ocean: That there was but one Continent onely, which was beyond this world, and that as to magnitude it was infinite: That in it were bred, besides other very great Creatures, Men twice as big as those here, and they lived double our age: That many great Cities are there, and peculiar manners of life; and that they have Laws wholly different from those amongst us: That there are two Cities farre greater then the rest, nothing like to each other; one named <hi>Machimus,</hi> Warlike, the other <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> Pious: That the Pious people live in peace, abounding in wealth, &amp; reap the fruits of the Earth without Ploughs or Oxen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no need of tillage or sowing. They
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45846:47"/>
live, as he said, free from sickness, and die laughing, and with great pleasure: They are so exactly Just, that the Gods many times vouchsafe to converse with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Inhabitants of the City <hi>Machimus</hi> are very Warlike, continually armed and fighting: They subdue their Neighbours, and this one City predominates over many. The Inhabitants are not fewer then two hundred Myriads: they die sometimes of sickness, but this happens very rarely, for most commonly they are kill'd in the Wars by Stones or Wood, for they are invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by Steel. They have vast plenty of Gold and Silver, insomuch that Gold is of less value with them then Iron with us. He said that they once designed a Voiage to these our Islands, and sailed upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, being in number a thousand Myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads of men, till they came to the <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans;</hi> but understanding that they were the happiest men amongst us, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned us as persons that led a mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious life, and therefore thought it not worth their going farther. He added what is yet more wonderful, that there are men living amongst them called <hi>Meropes,</hi> who inhabit many great Cities; and that at the farthest end of their Countrey there is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45846:47"/>
place named <hi>Anostus,</hi> (from whence there is no return) which resembles a Gulf; it is neither very light nor very dark, the air being dusky intermingled with a kinde of Red: That there are two Rivers in this place, one of Pleasure, the other of Grief; and that along each River grow Trees of the bigness of a Plane-tree. Those which grow up by the River of Grief bear fruit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this nature; If any one eat of them, he shall spend all the rest of his life in tears and grief, and so die. The other Trees which grow by the River of Pleasure produce fruit of a contrary nature; for who tasts thereof shall be eased from all his former desires: If he loved any thing, he shall quite forget it; and in a short time shall become younger, and live over again his former years: he shall cast off old age, and return to the prime of his strength, becoming first a young man, then a child, lastly, an infant, and so die. This, if any man think the <hi>Chian</hi> worthy credit, he may believe. To me he appears an egregious Romancer as well in this as other things.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The first dissension betwixt <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> is said to be thus occasioned; <hi>Plato</hi> did not approve of his life and habit, for <hi>Aristotle</hi> wore rich garments and shoes, and cut his hair after a manner not used by <hi>Plato<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> He also wore many Rings for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament; he had a deriding kind of look, and was peremptory in discourse: all which mis-became a Philosopher. <hi>Plato</hi> seeing this rejected him, and preferred before him <hi>Xenocrates, Speusippus, Amyclas,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to whom he shewed respect, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to his conversation. On a time, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> being gone into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Aristotle</hi> came to <hi>Plato,</hi> accompanied with a great many of his Disciples, of whom was <hi>Mnason</hi> the <hi>Phocian,</hi> and the like: <hi>Speusippus</hi> was then sick and unable to be with <hi>Plato: Plato</hi> was fourscore years old, and through age his memory much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. <hi>Aristotle</hi> assaulting and circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by propounding arrogantly some questions, and arguing with him, discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself injurious and ingrateful. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45846:48"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> retiring from his outward Walk, walked privately with his friends. After three months <hi>Xenocrates</hi> returned from his Journey, and found <hi>Aristotle</hi> walking where he had left <hi>Plato,</hi> and seeing that he and his Disciples went not from the walk to <hi>Plato,</hi> but directly to the City, he asked one of the Walk where <hi>Plato</hi> was, doubting that he was sick. He answered, He is not sick, but <hi>Aristotle</hi> troubling him hath made him quit the Walk, and now he teacheth Philosophy privately in his own Garden. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> hearing this went presently to <hi>Plato,</hi> whom he found discoursing with such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who were young men of eminent quality, and some of the Noblest. When he had ended his discourse, he saluted <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> kindly, according to his usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and <hi>Xenocrates</hi> did the like to him. When the company was dismist, <hi>Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> without speaking a word to <hi>Plato,</hi> or acquainting him with it, got his friends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and sharply reproved <hi>Speusippus</hi> for having yielded the Walk to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Then to his utmost he opposed the <hi>Stagirite,</hi> and so farre proceeded the contention, that at last <hi>Aristotle</hi> was thrown out, and <hi>Plato</hi> restored to his former place.</p>

Why should we endeavour to comprehend within the narrow expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of words the unlimited courage of this person in Warre? Or if any detractor will rather impute these things to the Fortune which attended on him, so let it be. But he was doubtless excellent in that he was never worsted by Fortune, nor at any time deserted by her. Other things there are not commendable in him. That on the fifth day of the Month he drank excessively at <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> his house, on the sixth day he slept after his debauch, and recovered so well as to rise and give order to his Captains for the Expedition of the next day, saying that they should set forth very early. On the seventh he feasted with <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> and again drank freely. On the eighth he slept. On the fifteenth day of the same Month he made another debauch, and the next day slept. On the four and twentieth he supp'd with <hi>Bagoas.</hi> (The house of <hi>Bagoas</hi> was from the Palace ten <hi>Stadia</hi>) The day following he slept. One of these two therefore must needs have been; Either that <hi>Alexander</hi>

did prejudice himself exceedingly by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying so many daies of the Month in drinking, or that they who write these things have belied him.

was <hi>Plato.</hi> When they came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he entertained them courteously. <q>Come, <hi>Plato,</hi> said the strangers, shew us your name-sake, <hi>Socrates</hi> his disciple, bring us to the Academy, recommend us to him, that we may know him.</q> He smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little, as he used, said, ''I am the man: whereat they were much amazed, having conversed so familiarly with a person of that note, and not knowing him, who used no boasting or ostentation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> called <hi>Aristotle</hi> a Colt: What is meant by that name is manifest: a Colt as soon as it is satisfied with the milk of the Dam kicks at her. <hi>Plato</hi> therefore hereby signified some Ingratitude of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> for he having received the greatest seeds of Philosophy from him, and introduction thereto, as soon as he was replenished and satisfied with the best things thereof, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, and, getting his friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, set up against him <hi>Peripateticism,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing himself <hi>Plato</hi>'s adversary.</p>

                  <hi>Hiero</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Sicily</hi> is said to have been first a private person, and of all men the most averse from learning Musick, and nothing inferiour to his brother <hi>Gelo</hi> in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity. But falling sick he became extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary learned, imploying the leisure of his infirmity in hearing learned Discourses. <hi>Hiero</hi> therefore recovering heard <hi>Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the <hi>Cean, Pindarus</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> and <hi>Bacchylides</hi> the <hi>Juliet;</hi> but <hi>Gelo</hi> was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate to the last.</p>
               <p>They say also that <hi>Ptolemee</hi> the second falling sick became very learned.

What man of understanding wisheth not that sickness had befallen <hi>Alcibiades, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias, Pausanias</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> and others?

               <p>And <hi>Straton</hi> son of <hi>Corrhagus</hi> seems to have fallen sick advantageously. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an old family and rich, he used no exercise; but falling ill of the Spleen, and exercise being requisite for his cure, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself to it, and making progress therein, he in one day at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games was Victor in wrastling and the <hi>Pancratium,</hi> as also in the following <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> and <hi>Nemean</hi> and <hi>Isthmian</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Games.</p>
               <p>Likewise <hi>Democrates</hi> the Wrastler, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a pain in his feet, went to the Games, and standing in the <hi>Stadium</hi> made a Circle about himself, and challenged his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists to force him beyond the line; which they not able to doe, were worsted: And he, for continuing firmly in his station, went away crowned.</p>

                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> the second had an Empire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently fortified after this manner. He possessed Ships no less then four hundred, of five rows and six rows of Oars. His
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45846:78"/>
power of foot-souldiers was a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, Horse-men nine thousand. The City of <hi>Syracusa</hi> was adorned with exceeding great Havens, and encompassed with a very high Wall. He had store for five hundred Ships more. His provision of Corn which was laid up was a hundred Myriads of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimnae.</hi> His Magazine was furnished with Shields, Swords, and Spears, many Legg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Arms, Breast-plates, and Slings. The Sling was <hi>Dionysius</hi> his own invention.</p>
               <p>He had also many Auxiliaries; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in these <hi>Dionysius</hi> thought he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Empire bound with Adamant. But he first put his Brothers to death; then saw his Sons cruelly murthered, and Daughters first ravished, then killed. Not one of those that descended from him had the rite of Sepulture: for some were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alive, others cut in pieces and cast into the Sea. This happened to him, when <hi>Dio</hi> Son of <hi>Hipparinus</hi> invaded his Kingdome. He himself died old in extreme poverty.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Archelaus,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> (for so <hi>Plato</hi> calls him, not King) loved <hi>Crateuas</hi> exceedingly, who no less loved the supreme Command, and therefore killed his Friend <hi>Archelaus,</hi> hoping thereby to obtain the Tyranny, and make himself happy. But having possest the Tyranny three or four daies, he was also betraied by others and slain. To this <hi>Macedonick</hi> Tragedy aptly suit these Verses,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Who snares for others laies,</l>
                  <l>Himself at last betraies.</l>

               <p>That <hi>Parrhasius</hi> the Painter wore a Purple Vest and Crown of Gold, besides others, the Epigrams on many of his Images attest. On a time he contested at <hi>Samos,</hi> and met with an Adversary not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himself; he was worsted: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was <hi>Ajax</hi> contending with <hi>Ulysses</hi> for the Arms of <hi>Achilles.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45846:97"/>
and till the Needle had passed quite through the fat, and came to the flesh it self, he lay like a stone; but when it came to the firm flesh, he felt it and awaked. When he had business, when any came to speak with him for advice or orders, he set a Chest before him, (some say it was not a Chest, but a little kind of Turret) which hid all of him but his face, which was seen out of the top, and so talked with them: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Garment, farre fitter for a Beast then a Man.</p>

One of the Officers of <hi>Cyrus</hi> brought her with other Virgins to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who immediately preferred her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his Concubines, for simplicity of behaviour, and modesty; whereto also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed her beauty without artifice, and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When <hi>Aspasia</hi> came first to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> it happened that he was newly rise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:45846:115"/>
amongst whom was <hi>Aspasia</hi> the <hi>Phocian.</hi> They were finely attired; three of them had their heads neatly drest by their own Women which came along with them, and had painted their faces. They had been also instructed by their Governesses how to behave themselves towards <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to gain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Each contended to outvie the other in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness. Onely <hi>Aspasia</hi> would not endure to be clothed with a rich Robe, nor to put on a various-coloured Vest, nor to be washed; but calling upon the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Eleutherian</hi> Gods, she cried out upon her Father's name, execrating herself to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She thought the Robe which she should put on was a manifest sign of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. At last being compelled with blows she put it on, and was necessitated to behave herself with greater liberty then beseemed a Virgin. When they came to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the rest smiled, and expressed chearfulness in their looks. But <hi>Aspasia</hi> looking on the ground, her eyes full of tears, did every way express an extraordinary bashfulness. When
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45846:116"/>
he commanded them to sit down by him, the rest instantly obeyed; but the <hi>Phocian</hi> refused, until the Officer caused her to sit down by force. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> looked upon or touched their eyes, cheeks and fingers, the rest freely permitted him; but she would not suffer it: For if <hi>Cyrus</hi> did but offer to touch her, she cried out, saying, he should not goe unpunished for such actions. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was herewith extremely pleased; and when upon his offering to touch her breast, she rose up, and would have run away, <hi>Cyrus</hi> much taken with her native ingenuity, which was not like the <hi>Persians,</hi> turning to him that bought them, <q>This Maid onely, saith he, of those which you have brought me is free and pure; the rest are adulterate in face, but much more in behaviour.</q> Hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> loved her above all the Women he ever had. Afterwards there grew a mutual love between them, and their friendship proceeded to such a height that it almost arrived at parity, not differing from the concord and modesty of <hi>Grecian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Hereupon the fame of his affection to <hi>Aspasia</hi> was spread to <hi>Ionia</hi> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Greece; Peloponnesus</hi> also was filled with discourses of the love betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and her. The report went even to the great
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45846:116"/>
King [of <hi>Persia,</hi>] for it was conceived that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after his acquaintance with her, kept company with no other Woman. From these things <hi>Aspasia</hi> recollected the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her old Apparition, and of the Dove, and her words, and what the Goddess foretold her. Hence she conceived that she was from the very beginning particularly regarded by her. She therefore offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of thanks to <hi>Venus.</hi> And first cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great Image of Gold to be erected to her, which she called the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> and by it placed the picture of a Dove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with Jewels, and every day implored the favour of the Goddess with Sacrifice and Prayer. She sent to <hi>Hermotimus</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many rich Presents, and made him weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. She lived continently all her life, as both the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. On a time a Neck-lace was sent as a Present to <hi>Cyrus</hi> from <hi>Scopas</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which had been sent to <hi>Scopas</hi> out of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Neck-lace was of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry workmanship, and variety. All therefore to whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> shewed it admiring it, he was much taken with the Jewel, and went immediately to <hi>Aspasia,</hi> it being about noon. Finding her asleep, he lay down gently by her, watching quietly whilest she slept. As
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45846:117"/>
soon as she awaked, and saw <hi>Cyrus,</hi> she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him after her usual manner. He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Neck-lace out of a Boxe, said, <q>This is worthy either the Daughter or the Mother of a King.</q> To which she assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; <q>I will give it you, said he, for your own use, let me see your neck adorned with it.</q> But she received not the Gift, prudently and discreetly answering, <q>How will <hi>Parysatis</hi> your Mother take it, this being a Gift fit for her that bare you? Send it to her, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I will shew you a Neck handsome enough without it.</q> 
                  <hi>Aspasia</hi> from the greatness of her minde acted contrary to other Royal Queens, who are excessively desirous of rich Ornaments. <hi>Cyrus</hi> being pleased with this answer, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Aspasia.</hi> All these actions and speeches <hi>Cyrus</hi> writ in a Letter which he sent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Chain to his Mother; and <hi>Parysatis</hi> receiving the Present was no less delighted with the News then with the Gold, for which she requited <hi>Aspasia</hi> with great and Royal Gifts; for this pleased her above all things, that though <hi>Aspasia</hi> were chiefly affected by her Son, yet in the love of <hi>Cyrus</hi> she desired to be placed beneath his Mother. <hi>Aspasia</hi> praised the Gifts, but said she had no need of them; (for there was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45846:117"/>
much money sent with the Presents) but sent them to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> saying, <q>To you who maintain many men this may be useful: For me it is enough that you love me and are my ornament.</q> With these things, as it seemeth, she much astonished <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And indeed the Woman was without dispute admirable for her personal beauty, but much more for the nobleness of her mind. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was slain in the fight against his Brother, and his Army taken Prisoners, with the rest of the prey she was taken; not falling accidentally into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hands, but sought for with much diligence by King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> for he had heard her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that she might not put on the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King appointed, for she mourned exceedingly for <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But when she had put it on, she appeared the fairest of all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was immediately sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and inflamed with love of her. He valued her beyond all the rest of his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, respecting her infinitely. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ingratiate himself into her favour,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45846:118"/>
hoping to make her forget <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and to love him no less then she had done his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but it was long before he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass it. For the affection of <hi>Aspasia</hi> to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had taken so deep impression, that it could not easily be rooted out. Long after this, <hi>Teridates</hi> the Eunuch died, who was the most beautiful youth in <hi>Asia.</hi> He had full surpassed his childhood, and was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the youths. The King was said to have loved him exceedingly: he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely grieved and troubled at his death, and there was an universal mourning throughout <hi>Asia,</hi> every one endeavouring to gratify the King herein; and none durst venture to come to him and comfort him, for they thought his passion would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any consolation. Three daies being past, <hi>Aspasia</hi> taking a mourning Robe as the King was going to the Bath, stood weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her eyes cast on the ground. He seeing her, wondred, and demanded the reason of her coming. She said, <q>I come, O King, to comfort your grief and affliction, if you so please; otherwise I shall goe back.</q> The <hi>Persian</hi> pleased with this care, commanded that she should retire to her Chamber, and wait his coming. As soon as he returned, he put the Vest of the Eunuch upon <hi>Aspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:45846:118"/>
which did in a manner fit her: And by this means her beauty appeared with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter splendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>r to the King's eye, who much affected the youth. And being once pleased herewith, he desired her to come alwaies to him in that dress, until the height of his grief were allayed: which to please him she did. Thus more then all his other Women, or his own Son and Kindred, she comforted <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and relieved his sorrow; the King being pleased with her care, and prudently admitting her consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Milk, came by a certain divine providence, taking delight in the Child gave it suck; whereby at once the Beast eased her own pain, and nourished the Infant: and came again, being opprest with Milk; and being no longer Mother of her own, became Nurse to one that nothing belonged to her. The same Huntsmen who before had taken her Whelps watch'd her, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every part of the Thicket, when the Bear according to her custome was gone to the Pastures to get food, stole away <hi>Atalanta,</hi> not yet so called (for they gave her that name afterwards) and she was bred up amongst them with wild food: And by degrees her stature encreased with her years, and she affected Virginity, and shunned the conversation of men, and delighted in the desart, making choice of the highest of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Mountains, where was a Valley well furnished with water and tall Oaks, as also fresh gales and a thick wood. Why should it seem tedious to hear the description of <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s Cave, more then that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypso</hi> in <hi>Homer?</hi> In the hollow of the cliff there was a Cave very deep fortified at the entrance with a great precipice; along it crept Ivy, and twined about the young Trees, upon which it climbed. Saffron also
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:45846:138"/>
grew about the place in a young thick Grove, with which also sprung up the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acinths, and many other flowers of various colours, which not onely feasted the eye, but the odours which they exhaled round about into the air, did afford a banquet also to the smell. Likewise there were many Laurels, which being ever verdant were very delightful to the sight; Vines also growing thick and full of Bunches before the Cave, attested the industry of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> springs ever running clear and cool to the touch and tast flowed there abundantly. These contributed much benefit to the Trees we speak of, watering them and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening them continually. In fine, the place was full of beauty and majesty, such as argued the prudence of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>The skins of Beasts were <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s bed, their flesh her food, her drink water. She wore a careless Vest, such as <hi>Diana</hi> not disdained. For she said that she imitated her as well in this as in determining to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a Virgin. She was exceeding swift of foot, so that not any Beast could run away from her, nor any man that layed wait for her, was able (if she would run away) to overtake her. She was beloved, not onely of all those who saw her, but also of those
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45846:138"/>
who heard the report of her. If therefore it be not tedious we will describe her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But tedious it cannot be, since hereby we may arrive at some degree of skill in Rhetorick. Whilest she was yet a child, she exceeded in stature those who were Women grown; for Beauty she went beyond all other of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Virgins of that time. Her look was masculine and fierce, occasioned partly by eating the flesh of wild Beasts, (for she was very couragious) partly by her exercise on the Mountains. She had nothing of an effeminate loose disposition, neither did she come out of the <hi>Thalamus,</hi> [where Virgins are educated.] nor was one of those who are brought up by Mothers or Nurses. She was not corpulent; for by Hunting and other Exercise she preserved herself in a good Constitution. Her Hair was Yellow, not by any Womanish Art or Die, but by Nature. Her Face was of a ruddy Complexion, somewhat tanned by the Sun. What Flower is so beautiful as the countenance of a modest Virgin? She had two admirable properties, an irresistible Beauty, and an awfulness. No timid person could fall in love with her, for such durst not look upon her, so much did her splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour dazle the beholders. That which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45846:139"/>
her to be admired, besides other things, was her reservedness. For she exposed not her self to view, unless accidentally in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the chase, or defending herself from some man; in which action she broke forth like lightning, then immediately hid herself in the thickest of the wood. On a time it happened that two bold young-men of the neighbouring Country, Centaurs, <hi>Hyleus</hi> and <hi>Rhecus,</hi> in love with her, came in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to her. They had no players on the Flute in this frolick, nor such things as the young men use in Cities upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but took with them lighted Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the sight whereof might have frighted a multitude, much more a lone Maiden. Then breaking boughs from the Pine trees, they twined them about them, and made themselves Garlands of them, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual clashing of Weapons as they went along the Mountains, set fire on the Trees in their way to her, presenting her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries instead of Nuptial Gifts. She was aware of their Plot, for she beheld the fire from her Cave, and knowing who those revellers were, was nothing terrified with the sight: but drawing her Bow, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fly an Arrow, chanced to kill the first, who falling down, the other assaulted her,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45846:139"/>
not in mirth, but as an Enemy to revenge his friend and satisfie his passion. But he met with another vindictive Arrow from her hand. Thus much of <hi>Atalanta</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Jasion.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>Mitylenaean,</hi> by name <hi>Macareus,</hi> Priest of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> was of a mild and good look, but the most impious of all men. A stranger coming to him, &amp; giving him a great summe of money to lay up, in the inner part of the Temple; <hi>Macareus</hi> digging a hole, hid the Gold in the ground. Afterwards the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger returning, demanded his Money; he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ding him in as if he meant to restore it murdered him, digging up the Gold bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the man in the place, thinking that what he did was hid as well from God as from men; but it proved otherwise, for not long after; within a few daies came the triennial solemnity. Whilest he was busied in celebrating the Rites of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in much state, his two Sons that were left at home, imitating their Father's sacrificing, went to his Altar, where the brands were yet bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45846:140"/>
The younger held out his neck, the elder finding a knife left there by accident, slew his brother as a Victim. They of the family seeing this cried out. The Mother hearing the cry, rushed forth, and seeing on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of her Sons slain, the other standing by with a bloudy Sword, snatched a brand from the Altar, and kill'd her surviving Son. The news was brought to <hi>Macareus,</hi> who giving over sacrifice, with all speed and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness ran to his own house, and with the Thyrsus which he had in his hand, kill'd his Wife. This wickedness was publickly known: <hi>Macareus</hi> was taken, and being tortured, confessed what he had perpetrated in the Temple. In the midst of thefe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he gave up the Ghost. But the other who was murdered unjustly, had publick honour, and was interred by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Thus <hi>Macareus</hi> suffered due revenge, as the Poet saith, with his own head, and his Wives, and his Childrens.</p>

But withall, that they should write upon a Pillar, that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had forced the <hi>Thebans</hi> against their wills to lay <hi>Laconia</hi> wast, what had continued five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years unviolated by Enemies.
