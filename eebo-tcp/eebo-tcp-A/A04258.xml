            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AVTHOVRS
Preface to the
Reader,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T falls out often, that the effects of mens
actions comes cleane contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Authour. The ſame find I by
experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (beloued Reader) in my Poeme
of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> For although till now, it
haue not bene imprinted, yet being ſet out to the publike
view of many, by a great ſort of ſtoln copies, purchaſt (in
truth) without my knowledge or conſent, it hath for lack
of a Preface, bene in ſome things miſconstrued by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
which I of very purpoſe thinking to haue omitted,
for that the writing thereof might haue tended, in my
opinion, to ſome reproch of the skilful learnednes of the
Reader, as if his braynes could not haue conceyued ſo
vncurious a work, without ſome maner of commentary,
&amp; ſo haue made the worke more diſpleaſant vnto him:
it hath by the contrary falne out, that the lack thereof
hath made it the more diſpleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſome, through their
miſtaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I
know the ſpecial thing miſliked in it, is, that I ſhould
ſeeme far contrary to my degree &amp; Religion, like a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie
Poet, to pen a worke, <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> in praiſe of a
forraine Papiſt haſtard; I will, by ſetting downe the
<pb facs="tcp:26196:3"/>
nature and order of the Poeme, reſclue the ignorant of
their error, and make the other ſort inexcuſable of their
captiouſnes. The nature then of this Poeme, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>a minore ad maius,</hi> largely intreated by a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
compariſon, being to the writing hereof moued, by
the ſtirring vp of the league &amp; cruell perſecution of the
Proteſtants in al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, at the very firſt raging wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I compiled this Poeme, as the exhortation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
in the hinmoſt eight lines thereof doth plainely
teſtify, being both begun and ended in the ſame Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
wherin the league was publiſhed in Fraunce. The
order of the Cantique is this: Firſt, a Poetike preface,
declaring the matter I treat of, wherein, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> name not
<hi>Don-Iohn,</hi> neither literally nor any wayes by deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I behoued to haue done, if I had penned the
whole Poeme in his praiſe, as <hi>Virgil, Arma virum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
cano: &amp; Homer, Dic mihi muſa virum:</hi> of whoſe
imitation I had not bene aſhamed, if ſo my purpoſe had
bene framed. Next followes my inuocation to the true
God onely, and not to all the Hee and Shee Saints, for
whoſe vaine honors, <hi>Don-Iohn</hi> fought in al his wars.
Next after my inuocation, followes the poetike Hiſtory
of my compariſon, wherein following forth the ground
of a true hiſtory, (as <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer</hi> did) like a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhadowing with vmbers a portrait els drawne in
groſſe, for giuing it greater viuenes, ſo I eike or paire to
the circumſtances of the actions, as the rules of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etike
arte will permit: which hiſtorike compariſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
till the ſong of the Angels: in the which I
compare and apply the former compariſon to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſtate, taking occaſion thereupon to ſpeak ſomewhat
<pb facs="tcp:26196:3"/>
of our religion. Laſtly, the Epilogue of the whole, in the
laſt eight lines, declares fully my intention in the whole,
and explaines ſo fully my compariſon and argument,
from the more to the leſse, as I cannot without ſhameful
repetition ſpeak any more thereof. And in a word, what
ſoeuer praiſe I haue giuen to <hi>Don-Iohn</hi> in this Poem,
it is neither in accounting him as firſt or ſecond cauſe of
that victorie, but onely as a particular man, when hee
falles in my way, to ſpeake the truth of him. For as it
becomes not the honour of my estate, like an hireling,
to pen the praiſe of any man: So becomes it far leſse the
highneſſe of my ranke and calling, to ſpare for the feare
or fauour of whomſoeuer liuing, to ſpeake or write the
truth of any. And thus crauing pardon, beloued Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for this long ſome Apologie (being driuen thereto,
not by nature, but by neceſsitie) I bid you hartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
