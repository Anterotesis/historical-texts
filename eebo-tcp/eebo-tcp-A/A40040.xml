            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to trouble thee with a long and tedious Courtſhip and Complement (according to the common practice) nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I ſhall only tell thee two or three things relating to the following Papers.</p>
            <p>Some three years ago, <hi>viz.</hi> 1659. through the diſſention and obſtinacy of two wicked Parties, the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> the Nation was almoſt ruin'd; ſometimes this, and ſome times that, and other times God knows what, being chief Lords of miſ-Rule: Inſomuch, that in one Fortnight, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> we laid under the laſh of three ſeveral Authorities; every Party pretending nothing but Zeal, the Good of the People, and the Power of Godlineſs, yet deſigned to deſtroy all before them. And having formerly got the Revenues of the King, Church, Loyal Nobility and Gentry; began to gape after the Lands of the <hi>Univerſities:</hi> This one action being able to pleaſure them in two reſpects, The fingering of ſome Riches, [though King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ſaid, they were too ſmall to wipe out the reproach]; And the overthrow of Learning.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and others, imploy'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Pulpiteers</hi> and Pen-men, to thunder out the Vanity of Humain Learning. And at the ſame time, as well as before, <hi>Baxter</hi> and other <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> made it their buſineſs to throw what Aſperſions they could, upon the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party: all which were preſently confuted, by the Learned and Loyal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the King and Church, the famous Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr <hi>Heylin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Brethren</hi> began to aſſociate themſelves into <hi>Bands,</hi> getting what Gentry and others they could to joyn with them, vilifying and abuſing the Reverend Church, whilſt the other <hi>Phanaticks</hi> perſecuted them with their helliſh Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61643:4"/>
The Nation being thus entiſed to prejudice by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Pamphlets, which dayly multiplyed and flew about the Cities and Countrey, the <hi>Poet</hi> came into my head:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Semper ego auditor tantum, nunquamne reponam? <note place="margin">Juven. Sat. 1.</note>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Since all the World is madd why ſhould not I? So, getting ſome Ink and Paper, to it I go; and the better to put the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into their right wits again, preſently drew up above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſheets by way of Hiſtory, whereby they might ſee the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, Perjury, Tyranny, Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> as well as the other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> [as it is in the firſt two Books, only ſome ſmall things added ſince the happy Reſtoration of his Majeſty]. And this Collection (with ſome other things in Vindication of the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> Humain Learning, the Church, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> I had finiſh'd before the end of the <hi>Committee of Safeties</hi> Dominion, as I ſhew'd to ſeveral Friends in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time up cometh the Worthy General <hi>Monk,</hi> and Re-inthrones the <hi>Secluded</hi> Members; which made me throw by any farther thoughts of my Papers, perceiving the Nation reſolved for Kingſhip, and the Government being then again turn'd <hi>Presbytery;</hi> A ſmall vexing thoſe Gentlemen, might have been a prejudice to his Majeſty, and a puniſhment to my ſelf, not forgetting their Impriſonment of Dr. <hi>Griffith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for ever might they have laid unregarded and in Oblivion, had not the wickedneſs of the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> even ſince the Kings coming in, clamoured them into my Remembrance, by their perpetual railing againſt the Biſhops; Preaching, Prating, and Pamphleting up Sedition and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by endeavouring to make the People believe them to be the only Saints, and men of Honeſty: which made me think it not amiſs, to publiſh theſe following ſheets, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to undeceive the Ignorant, the better to keep them from joyning with theſe <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and to ſhew them what ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have to cry Perſecution, and Trumpet out their own Commendations.</p>
            <p>You may perceive, by the brevity of ſome Chapters, that I
<pb facs="tcp:61643:4"/>
did not intend to make a large Hiſtory of theſe mens Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but only a ſhort <hi>Eſſay</hi> for the Peoples ſatisfaction; for, had I otherwiſe reſolved, I had Materials enough to raiſe up a farr greater Fabrick. I have been exact in Timing the Actions; and in the Quotations, not being aſhamed, as ſome of late, to tell from what Store-houſes, I fetch'd the Matter: For ſome things I name two or three Authors, or more; thereby endeavouring to do the Reader a Courteſie, who through this variety, may probably have one of the Books, where he may ſee the paſſage it ſelf, which is not to be laid to mine account as long as I name mine Author. The Third Book I added (whilſt the other two were Printing), in ſome ſnaps and pieces of Time, which now and then I could borrow from my beloved Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>As for the Style, you muſt do with it as Men do with their Wives, take it as you find it, for better or for worſe: yet will the <hi>Brethren</hi> cenſure me beyond Redemption, call me a <hi>Bolſec,</hi> a <hi>Gretſer,</hi> a <hi>Feu-ardentius,</hi> and what not? Look upon me as a <hi>Shimei,</hi> a <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> a <hi>Therſites,</hi> and ſuch like; and all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſpeak truth, giving things their proper Titles, not dwindling the wickedneſs of Rebellion, Perjury, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the notion of Gods Cauſe, the Covenant, and Juſtice: and in this an honeſt Poet, with a favourable Tranſlation, will defend me;<note place="margin">Inven ſat. 1.</note>

            </lg>
            <p>If my fault be only ſpeaking tartly, the then Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> will aſſure this to be no ſuch crime, by telling them, that there is ſometimes a <note n="b" place="margin">His Epiſt. Pref. to Mr. <hi>Barlee's</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rept. Correct.</note>

               <hi>I ſhall deſire that it may be conſidered, not only what is fit for me to ſpeak, but what is meet for</hi> them <hi>to hear. If I were to mention
<pb facs="tcp:61643:5"/>
their fact, who took the Reliques of</hi> Peter Martyr'<hi>s Wife's carkaſe out of the Grave, and after buried them in a Dunghill, would you not allow me to call it Unchriſtian, and Inhumane?</hi> &amp;c. And in another place, either himſelf, or his Friends, have beſtirr'd themſelves notably to plead the neceſſity and juſtneſs of my keenneſs, by declaring to all people, that—<note n="c" place="margin">

               <hi>Baxter,</hi> (three noted B's), you would bleſs your ſelf, to ſee theſe people, who pretend to all Sanctity and Holineſs, to have ſo much of the Devil in their mouths.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſtopt their rage againſt me, by making them more angry: And, if this do not ſatisfie them, I ſhall treble it the next time; yet might all this have been ſpared, if they would as patiently permit others to tell them the Truth, as they will impatiently throw Lyes and Scandals upon their betters. But theſe People do not love to be touch'd on their ſores, though it be to cure them. They ſay, 'tis one way to find a Thief, to note who bluſheth at the diſcourſe of ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but theſe men are farr from that ſign of Grace.</p>
            <p>Tell them but of the ſins belonging to their Religion, as <hi>Treaſon, Schiſm, Perjury,</hi> &amp;c. they will preſently fly in your face, though take no great notice of other <hi>Peccadiglio's;</hi> like <note place="margin">Facet.

And thus much in part, to pay them home with their own Coyn.</p>
            <p>As for the Author, whilſt a School-Boy, he was too much ſway'd to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and delighting in the Stories of our Times, had none to peruſe, but <hi>May, Vicars, Ricraft,</hi> and ſuch like partial Relators: By which means, believing with the Ignorant, all things in Print to be true, was perſwaded to incline to the wrong ſide.</p>
            <p>But, a little before his going to the Univerſity, lighting by chance upon Dr. <hi>Bate</hi>'s Judicious Book <hi>Elenchus Motuum,</hi> he found the Laws and true Government to be oppoſite to his former Readings, and therein the knavery and jugling of their Oppoſers, ſtrange things which he had never heard of before. Which, with ſome other aſſiſtance, ſo farr prevail'd with him, that in a ſhort time he threw off Father <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and ever ſince, like little Loyal <hi>John</hi> in the Epitaph,
<q>
                  <l>For the King, Church, and Bloud-Royal,</l>

As for the Learned in Hiſtory, neither Preface nor Book was intended for them; And as for thoſe who are not ſomewhat ſtudied this way, though they are not able of themſelves to ſearch out the Truth, yet are they not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe all in Print.

            <p>To ſay no more: If we believe every thing in Mr. <hi>Sam.

This Selviſh Policy, though acted by every one according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in ſome ſenſe or other; yet its chiefeſt Theater is amongſt thoſe, who (ſcorning to dwindle away their days in <hi>Petit</hi> hazards) lay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at ſtake, but whole Kingdoms, or their own ruins: The greater their venture, the more their glory, if they come off with gain or ſafety.

                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> by many, hath been thought, not only a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but ſomewhat an Actor, in the Stage of our late Sufferings; it will not be amifs, if in the firſt place, the Original of this Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order be briefly related. Though 'tis far from my intention to throw any dirt, either upon all of this Society (ſome of them, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, being of honeſt inclinations) or thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion; ſince experience hath proved many of them to be men, really pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing honeſty and loyalty: And that Religion is moſt wicked, which oppoſeth Civil Obedience.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Founder of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> was one <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> [by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call'd <hi>Iñigio,</hi> or <hi>Yñigo de Loyola]</hi> born of a good and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">De Maperne Hiſt: d'Eſpaign. l. 27.

                     <p>He lived according to the delights and pleaſures of the world, till he was about 29. years old. About which time, the <hi>French</hi> beſieging <hi>Pamplona,</hi> and he there a defendant, he had the fortune to have both his leggs grievouſly hurt; the left by a ſtone, and the right broke by a bullet. After this, the <hi>French</hi> having maſtered the City, <hi>Ignatius</hi> was conveyed to the aforeſaid <hi>Caſa de Loyola,</hi> where he was cured, yet not ſo well, but that he halted on both feet; And this deformity <note place="margin">Haſenmuller. Hiſt.

But the Jeſuites will inform us of other pretty ſtories (fit to be ſtitcht up with <hi>Villegas,</hi>

After his Converſion (howſoever it was) for the more ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him in his goodly opinion, he goeth to <hi>Monſerrat</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> (a Narrative of which wonderful Mountain, you may read in <note n="a" place="margin">De Eſpana cap. 142.</note>

From this Hill, with an intention to viſit the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and convert the <hi>Turks,</hi> he goeth to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> thence ſails into <hi>Italy;</hi> where they ſay, our Saviour appeared to him, and helpt him very ſtrangely into <hi>Padoa</hi> and <hi>Venice;</hi> and when he <note place="margin">1523.</note> wanted a lodging, ſomething from Heaven, beſpoke one for him.

                     <p>From the <hi>Holy-Land</hi> he returns to <hi>Venice,</hi> thence goeth to <hi>Genua,</hi>

Eraſmus</hi> his Books ſhould be peruſed. Having read his <note place="margin">Maffcius l. 1. c. 16.</note> Grammer here two years, he goeth to <hi>Alcala de Henares,</hi> where he and his companions, from the length of their Coats, obtain'd an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able denomination from the Univerſity-wits: ſuch pride did they take in ſingularity, and for ſuch like prancks was he caſt into Priſon, though at laſt releaſed with a ſevere check. Having ſtay'd ſeven moneths here, (in which time he got ſome skill in <hi>Logick, Phyſicks,</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> a quick Scholar as they would have him); he paſſeth to <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo diſcreetly, that he was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned again, with the honourable addition of a Chain, though after got his releaſe.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Spain,</hi> perceiving himſelf to be only derided, he thought it not conducible to his deſigns to abide there: wherefore he intends to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit <hi>France;</hi> for which purpoſe having procured an Aſs to carry his Books and other things, he himſelf foots it to <hi>Barcinona,</hi> and thence <note place="margin">1528.</note> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he re-enters himſelf into a Grammer-School, either forgetting what formerly he learn'd, or through dulneſs wanting a conſiſtent apprehenſion, and this was when he was near 40. years old. Here for his ſimple non-conformity, he had like to have been whipt in a publick manner, but eſcaped that ſcouring by his own confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the <hi>Primars</hi> or Maſters folly. But after that, he (or ſome other higher Authority for him), acted his part ſo well, that of a Scholar, he became not only a Maſter, but alſo gain'd the eſteem of ſome Sanctity.

                     <p>Having thus got his deſires in <hi>France,</hi> he reſolves to viſit his own Countrey. In the mean time, appointing <hi>Peter Faber</hi> to be <note place="margin">1535.</note> chief over thoſe of his Society at <hi>Paris</hi> in his abſence, and to meet him ſuch a day, two years after at <hi>Venice:</hi> he marcheth over the <hi>Pyraenean</hi> Mountains into <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> where he viſits his friends at <hi>Loyola,</hi> and the adjacent places, who were not able to perſwade him from his beggerly humour.

                     <p>HAving thus ſeen the Original of the Jeſuite, it will not be amiſs briefly to hint at their Temper and Activeneſs, eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Politick deſigns: Though, by the By, we may obſerve, that he is not the ſame with the more ancient Order of the <hi>Jeſuati,</hi> begun ſome 300. years ago, by St. <hi>John Columbine</hi> of <hi>Sene:</hi> concerning which I referr you to <hi>Paolo Morigia,</hi> one of the ſame Order. Nor were <note place="margin">Hiſt. del.

                     <p>In <hi>Portugal</hi> they are called <hi>los Apoſtoles;</hi> in <hi>Arragon, los Iniguiſtos;</hi> but in other places <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> or, thoſe of the <hi>Society of Jeſus.</hi> A Title (as many Catholicks themſelves confeſs) too high and general, <note place="margin">Inſolitam nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Jeſu appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem, &amp;c. <hi>Decret. de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. An.</hi> 1554.</note> to be only applyed to this Order. But ſeeing they have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make this name peculiar to themſelves; and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> VI. in his Letters in their behalf to <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ments,</hi> to <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and others, do appropriate this Name to them, and ſo doth the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and it is the Title by which they are beſt known; I ſhall not ſtick to <note place="margin">Seſſ. 25. cap. 16.</note> pleaſure them ſo farr as to nominate them according to their own deſires.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuites, though at firſt they had but a ſmall Foundation, have ſince ſo induſtriouſly increaſed their number, that they have above 60. Colledges in <hi>Italy,</hi> and more in <hi>Spain;</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> near the ſame number; in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> about 20. and in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> above 12. and in the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſome 20. and many in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are eſpecially ſworn to three things; The firſt is <hi>Poverty,</hi> the which they obſerve ſo gallantly, that I muſt ſubſcribe to that Noble <hi>German,</hi> who profeſt, <hi>That if he were to beg, he would beg with the</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Their ſecond vow is, <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> which they keep with as much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs as the former, as is obvious to any who is converſt amongſt them; and for the farther teſtimony of this point, I ſhall referr you to the writings of <hi>Peter Jarrigius,</hi> one that was formerly a Jeſuite himſelf, and in high eſteem amongſt them in <hi>France,</hi> but at <hi>Rochel</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> imbraced the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> perſwaſion, <hi>[anno</hi> 1647.] and thence went to <hi>Leyden;</hi> though afterwards <hi>[viz.</hi> 1650.] upon what account he knew beſt, renounced the Reformed Religion, and return'd to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, at <hi>Antwerp.</hi>

Their third vow is <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Pope and their General of which none in the World can be more obſervant; ſo that by their punctual keeping of this, they may ſomewhat mitigate the offence of their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the two former. And this is (as one of themſelves confeſſeth) <note place="margin">Quae virtus, praecipuum So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietat is Jeſu decus. <hi>Turcel. vit. Fr.

How beneficial this Vow hath been to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Cauſe, may be eaſily imagined, if a man may ſuppoſe (as I know nothing to the contrary), that many bloudy actions perpetrated in <hi>France, England,</hi> and other places, hath been the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this Obediential State-Vow. Which binds this Order ſtrictly to the Obedience of their General, and to ackowledge him as in the place of Chriſt; and that with all reverence and love, doing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <note place="margin">Summar.

                     </p>
                     <p>This laſt clauſe might ſeem to palliate very well this Article of Obedience, to thoſe who are not acquainted with their Writings and Actions; but they who have any knowledge with their Caſuiſts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, how they annihilate and jeaſt with ſin, by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Doctrine of <hi>Probable Opinion,</hi> of <hi>Directing the Intention,</hi> and ſuch like; as you may ſee more at large in the <hi>Myſtery of Jeſuitiſm,</hi> of <note place="margin">Les Provincia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</note> which, the laſt Edition with its Additionals will yield you more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>With theſe things I ſhould be very unwilling to charge them, did I not know; that the Agitators of theſe Political evaſions from Sin, were the chief Caſuiſts amongſt them, and their Books printed and reprinted by the conſent of their Superiours. For thoſe men are very much to blame, who ſcandalize a General Religion with the fancies and extravagancies of ſome private Writers; for by this means might Rebelling-Presbyterianiſm, King-killing Independentiſm, deluded Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriſm, and other Hereſies be thrown upon the famous Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſeveral abſurdities upon the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which cannot be found in the <hi>Tridentine Council.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <p>After this manner, were the Orthodox Divines in <hi>England</hi> weakened. The Presbyterians at their Initiation into this Kingdom, not going openly like honeſt men, but skulking up and down to private Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, (which they call'd Synods, or Aſſemblies), according to the directions of their great <hi>Muſtaphi</hi>'s, ſuch as <hi>Cartwright, Snape, Gibby, Travers, Gillebrand, Whittington, Goodman,</hi> &amp;c. But having once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt the number of their Diſciples into a formidable body, took the impudence to affront, King, Queen, Laws, and all their Superiours. Nor of all theſe many Opinions (we have had two pregnant and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amongſt us), few were obſerved how they took root, till (like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Souldiers) they ſhew'd themſelves ſo potent, that they might ſcorn a reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Nor could we dream of any intentions lurking in the breaſts of our pretended Potentates, tending any way to the introducing of a motley-Babylonick Herd of Religions (ſince Prelacy was murdered out, by a drove of Villains), ſeeing they ſo ſolemnly proteſted againſt any ſuch endeavour, as you may ſee by theſe following words:</p>

                        <p>Of this manner of cheating up Petitions, the famous Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">View of the Directory, <hi>p 90. Sect.</hi> 28.</note> takes ſpecial notice; And that great Prop of Learning, the late Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> gave a large hint in his Speech upon the Scaffold, in theſe words:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Here hath been of late a faſhion taken up to gather hands, and then to go to the great Court of this Kingdom, (the Parliament), and clamour for Juſtice: as if that great and wiſe Court, before whom the cauſes come, (which are unknown to the many), could not, or would not do juſtice, but at their appointment. A way which may endanger many an Innocent man, and pluck his bloud upon their own

                        <p>Of this clandeſtine way of Jugling up Petitions, ſeveral Counties did publickly complain (about the beginning of theſe Wars), to the Parliament, in their Petitions for Epiſcopacy; but to ſmall purpoſe: the Members reſolving to break the Laws, did not like that, which would confirm them. This way of begging was uſed above a dozen years ago by ſome <hi>Privado's</hi> in the County of <hi>Buckingham, Eſſex, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hiſt. Independ. Part. 1.

And thus (as it was thought), did the well-known Committee of <hi>Derby-houſe</hi> imploy <hi>Col.

And, to make them more complying, gave 12 <hi>d.</hi> a piece to thoſe who would ſubſcribe it. And this way of hudling up requeſts, was uſed by thoſe Bloud-thirſty Canabals, for the bringing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and others to the Block.</p>
                        <p>In this Art of State-craft, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was excellently well ſeen, and made it one of his main blinds to deceive an eaſie believing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which he thought both lawful and commendable in himſelf; but, when once raiſed to a <hi>Protector,</hi> thought it little leſs then Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">In his Speech, 22. <hi>Jan. 1654. pag.</hi> 15.</note> in others, greatly complaining of ſuch actions, to his mock-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

It was convenient, they thought, to give help to the <hi>French</hi> againſt their lawful King; yet held it abominable for Forraigners to give a good wiſh to the King of <hi>England,</hi> againſt his rebellious people. The <hi>Covenanters</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> might with honeſty, crave aid from the <hi>French</hi> King, though a Roman-Catholick againſt their Anointed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: But ſo muſt not the King of <hi>England</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> though his life endangered by his bloud-thirſty Subjects. The Parliament, forſooth, may make a Pacification with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; but the King muſt not harbour ſuch a thought, without grand aſperſions. If the King but march towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> the malignity of envious tongues endeavours to blaſt his Reputation, as not fit to wear the Crown: But many thouſands of the <hi>Scotch-</hi>Covenanters may come into <hi>England,</hi> fight againſt their King, kill his faithful Subjects, and inrich themſelves by their plundering and ſtealing from the honeſt People; and for their villainies, receive large rewards, with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and ſo they were, but <hi>in Iniquity:</hi> being guilty of High-Treaſon, becauſe marched and acted againſt the Kings conſent, who is the Supreme Authority of the three Nations.</p>

The form of Preaching of late, was come to that paſs, that unleſs he decryed Learning as uſeleſs, or either ſav'd or damn'd all, (though the latter was held the more plauſible, ſuch was the peoples love to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams), he was held to want both gifts and a diſcerning ſpirit. To ſhake hands with the Text, and take no more notice of it, then when it was named, was a great ſign of ſome extraordinary Inſpiration: but a good and ſolid Sermon was reproach'd with Humane Learning; as if <hi>Literature</hi> were no more advantage to a <hi>Divine,</hi> then the ancient Ship <hi>Argo</hi> to defend the great Stones upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain</hi> from being ſtoln away by the Parrots in <hi>Magellinica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this way, they uſed to make Learning ſeem unneceſſary and odious to the Vulgar, that ſo with more plauſibleneſs, they might alienate their Lands. For nothing elſe could be their intentions to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh up Ignorance, by ſuffering and encouraging Pratlers, who had never ſeen a Colledge, ſacrilegiouſly to abuſe Pulpits; by which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating to the People, that a Cobler or Taylors-ſtall, was as good a Nurcery for a Divine as either Univerſity. And to make this more feſible, a Band of <hi>Itinerants</hi> were foiſted up in <hi>Wales,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Vavaſor Powell,</hi> one (if reports be true), more fit to rub Horſes heels, than enter a Pulpit: where they turn'd out the ſetled Miniſtry, and ſo lock'd up the Church-doors, that a Sermon was as rare there, as they were too common in <hi>England.</hi> It was another mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance, and their own Impudence, that were their chief Interpreters of Scriptures.

                        <p>Thus have a wretched ſort of people, (who like the Shark, oft ſwallow that, which was never intended them), endeavoured what in them lay, to root up the Foundation of Learning. And this more pardonable, than a late wicked crew of Matricides, who have had not only their breeding, but the beſt part of (if not all) their lively-hood from the Charity of Colledge-Founders; yet have made it their buſineſs to ſcrible whole Books, to incite the Rabble to lay theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fabricks equal with the ground, ſo that the Univerſity might well complain;</p>

                     <p>Theſe, though they had the worſt Plea, yet came off with the beſt Succeſs; by which they clamourouſly declared the Juſtneſs of their Cauſe, hinting to the Royaliſts, that it was owned by a Supernatural Power. But</p>

                     <p>And how Orthodox ſuch Arguments are, is obvious, if we do but conſider the often proſperity of the wicked, who are ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to conquer, more for a ſcourge to others, than any juſtneſs in themſelves: And, I dare be confident, in our caſe it holds; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of theſe late domeſtick Commotions, being rightly more appropriated to the Parliament than his Majeſty, as in it's due place ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, to make the way more plain and eaſie to thoſe who call themſelves the <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> (the firſt fomenters of this Rebellion);
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61643:24"/>
we ſhall in brief conſider, the <hi>Antiquity, Subordination,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as they now ſtand; whereby it is plain, they had no power given them thus to raiſe Wars againſt, and impriſon [much leſs behead] their Soveraign: For, what I here ſpeak, is intended chiefly againſt the Long-Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ancient Government in this Iſland, that Records can inſtruct us of, is <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that in its Antiquity, the moſt abſolute; the higher we go, finding our Kings more free and powerful.

                     <p>That the ancient Kings of this Iſland had <hi>Meetings</hi> for Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reaſon prompts me to believe; though I do not remember after what certain faſhion: yet, ſince Chriſtianity was ſetled here, the Kings uſed to imploy the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Nobility, by way of Advice and Counſel: <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the famous King of our <hi>Kentiſh Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> being converted unto the Chriſtian Faith, about the year 596. ſome nine years after <hi>[viz.</hi> 605.] ſummons a Council, in which were, not only the Laity, but the Clergy alſo. After which time, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, have ſat, as a part of thoſe grand Meetings, [till the late Excluſion by the Long-Parliament], as the well-read Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> (who though under a great decay of ſight, ſees <note place="margin">Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block, <hi>Chap. 5.

                     <p>Theſe Lords Spiritual and Temporal, were the only Parliament known to former Kings, and ſo but one Houſe: However, ſometimes <note place="margin">Sir <hi>G. Buck</hi>'s Third Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, in <hi>John Stow</hi>'s Chron. <hi>p. 1068. col.</hi> 2.</note> upon great concerns, the King would, when himſelf beſt pleas'd, have ſome of the Commoners joyned with them; but then, they were not as now elected, but particularly choſen, according to the Kings deſire; and theſe were of more than ordinary ſavour and diſcretion, and therefore call'd <hi>Wiſe-men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt time, that, in Hiſtory, we can meet with a Parliament, conſiſting of the Clergy, Nobility, and <hi>Commons,</hi> is in King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſts dayes, at <hi>Salisbury, Anno</hi> 1116. and ſo the Clergy were 500. years before the Commons in Parliaments. But, why this King ſhould be the firſt, that threw this favour ſo generally upon the Commons, was (as ſome are pleas'd to affirm), grounded upon his own Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. For, he being but the younger Son of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi> following the Preſident of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> ſeized upon the Crown, in the abſence of his eldeſt Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> and afterwards moſt cruelly put out his eyes. This, they ſay, moved many Diſcontents amongſt the Nobility, againſt whom to ſtrengthen himſelf, he thought it beſt to pleaſure the Commons; which was done, by calling them to this Parliament at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whereby his Uſurpation became more formidable againſt his Enemies.</p>

                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61643:25"/>
But though the <hi>Commons</hi> were call'd to Counſel at this time, [if <note place="margin">Hiſtorical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. of Ancient Parl. <hi>Part. 1. p.</hi> 17, 18.</note> at this time, ſince <hi>Prynne</hi> denyeth it], yet were they not thereby made or eſteem'd neceſſary: ſince in ſeveral Kings raigns ſucceſſively after, Parliaments were held (as <hi>Prynne,</hi> their chief Patron, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge), conſiſting only of the Spiritual and Temporal Barons. And, when afterwards they did really ſit, is as uncertain, as after what manner, or when they had their firſt Speaker: The firſt, by that Title upon Record, being Sir <hi>Thomas Hungerford, [Anno</hi> 1376.] <note place="margin">Hackwell'<hi>s</hi> Modus tenend. Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 200.</note> though the year before, <hi>John Stow</hi> calls Sir <hi>Peter de la More</hi> their <hi>Prolocutor.</hi> And before theſe two, but three <hi>[viz.

Thus, we ſee the ſmall Antiquity of Parliaments, as they now ſtand with us repreſenting the three Eſtates, the Clergy, Nobility, and Commons.</p>
                     <p>This I write, to ſhew, how ſtrangely confident, the Commons were of late dayes; who, (if you will believe <hi>Prynne,</hi> one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves), <note place="margin">Plea for the Lords.</note> had really no ſuch Power and Judicatureſhip, as they did in the leaſt pretend to.

                        <hi>King may hold his Parliament for the Communalty of the Realm, without Biſhops, Earls, and Barons; ſo, that they have lawful Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſummons, albeit they come not.</hi> Yet the ſame Book af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that, <hi>the King, with his Biſhops, Earls, and Barons,</hi> cannot hold a Parliament without the aſſiſtance of the Commons.

well known. And it ſeems ſtrange to me, that they durſt be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent againſt their King, who, conſidering his power in chooſing Parliaments, was one of the moſt abſolute Monarchs in the World, till the modern Rebellious Retrenchments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are convincing to me, that the King never was one, or part of, but above, the <hi>Three Eſtates;</hi> it being ridiculous, that his Majeſty ſhould Petition himſelf, and call himſelf ſubject to himſelf. Nor ſee I any reaſon, to doubt, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> was one, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Acts of Parliament for it, who knew their own Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſt.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, of late, the <hi>Clergy</hi> have had no Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; the Reverend Lords Spiritual, being, I do not know how, thrown out of the Upper-Houſe; and the action, at laſt, by threats and other villainies, procured to be ſigned by the Royal Aſſent: for which (and ſeeing they are ſince happily reſtored again), I ſhall not at this time preſume to queſtion; though many who are learned in our Fundamental Laws, ſuppoſe that reaſons might be ſhewn, and that grounded upon law, of it's nullity; to which purpoſe, the learned Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath given a ſhort Eſſay; both, from the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Stumbling Block, <hi>Chap. 5. Sect. 12. p.</hi> 212.</note> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> [the darling too of our Presbyterian Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments], which, eſpecially provides for the Priviledges of the Clergy, as alſo by the voiding of all actions done by the King by compulſion, and not of his free-will. And that Kings may be ſo wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appears by King <hi>James,</hi> who, when King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was by his unruly Subjects, conſtrained to declare, ſeveral times, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his judgement; and, ſo was King <hi>Edward</hi> III. as appears by the <hi>Revocation of a Statute made the</hi> 15. year of his raign. And how unwilling, King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, was to ſign this Bill, is not unknown: the Parliament having got a new Art of getting their ends about, <hi>viz.</hi> by Tumults, and Threats, ſo that the King was rather fought, than reaſoned out of it. And, what impudence the Commons were bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with, to preſume, thus, to extirpate the Spiritual Lords, whoſe Antiquity in Parliament was double to theirs, is experimentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion. But they, and ſo did the Puritanical Faction of the Nobility (for ſuch Animals were amongſt them too) know well enough, that the King would not only be weakened, but themſelves ſtrengthened, by annihilation of 26. ſuch ſound, Royal and Orthodox Votes, for which qualifications the Schiſmatical Lords and Commons hated them.</p>
                     <p>But enough of this: only I ſhall leave ſome Quaeries to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Presbyterian mad-caps (Lord or Common), of the wicked Long-Parliament.</p>

                        <p>But theſe People did not only overthrow Epiſcopacy, but ſtruck alſo at the root of Monarchy it ſelf, by their pleadings againſt the King's Supremacy; making themſelves not only equal to, but above <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to the King, 2. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 1642.</note> him. And this, not only when aſſembled in Parliament, but when they are ſo far from having any Authority there, [there being no ſuch thing then ſitting], that they are ſeparately, ſo many private Subjects, obliged only to follow their own occaſions; for in this capacity, I ſuppoſe, they make themſelves, when they alledge for a Rule, <hi>Rex eſt major ſingules, minor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis,</hi> conſidering they place this in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance as diſtinct from Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>But how weak this Poſition is, let Parliaments themſelves be our Judges. And I do not love to reaſon againſt Authentick Records. When God tells us expreſly, that Whoredom is a grievous ſin; 'twas blaſphemy in <hi>John de Caſa,</hi> to write in the vindication of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy. When <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus,</hi> and other ancient and authentick Authors, aſſure us, that Presbytery was ſubordinate to Epiſcopacy in the firſt Century, 'tis folly in our late Schiſmaticks to dream of, or introduce, a Parity. When Parliaments acknowledge themſelves Subjects to his Majeſty, for any to conclude thence, their Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, are, in my judgement, no leſs guilty of ignorance than that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton of <hi>Athens,</hi> who fancied all the ſhips and other things to be his, when he had no more intereſt in them, then I have relation to the Crown of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Lords and Commons tell us plainly, what little ſigns they have of Superiority in theſe words;—<hi>Where by divers</hi>

And in many other Statutes, do they acknowledge themſelves the King's moſt humble, faithful, and obedient Subjects.

of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical affairs, and ſo ſwear Allegiance to him, each Parliament-man before he ſit, taking both the Oaths, as all other Subjects do.

                        <p>Theſe are Preſidents enough, to ſatisfie any man in the Parliaments ſubjection to the King; it being in his power to conſtitute them, not they him; in him being the only Authority to call, and diſſolve them, not any ſuch being in themſelves: He can pardon Malefactors, not they without his conſent. The death of the King diſſolves the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though their breaking up reflects nothing upon him: He can call them where he pleaſeth; but they, not remove his Court. They Petition him, by way of Subjects, not he them. The King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> can do no wrong, and never dyeth, being alwayes of <note n="*" place="margin">7 Edw. 6. c. 3.</note> full age; the breath of the former being no ſooner expired, but the next Heir is <hi>de facto</hi> King, without the Ceremony of Proclamation

or Coronation: And, whether a Parliament can do no wrong or no, I leave to many men now in <hi>England</hi> to judge?

But they humbly declined it, ſubmiſſively deſiring, that they might not be put to conſult of thoſe things whereof they had no cogniſance. And in the ſame King's reign, when their advice was asked, touching a Proſecution of a Warr with <hi>France;</hi> after four dayes conſultation, they returned their Anſwer by Juſtice <hi>Thorpe: That their humble deſire to the King, was, that he would be adviſed therein by the Lords, being of more experience then themſelves in ſuch affairs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the ſixt year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, a Parliament was call'd to conſult, Whether the King ſhould go himſelf to reſcue <hi>Gaunt,</hi> or ſend an Army? The Commons humbly anſwered by their Speaker Sir <hi>Thomas Puckering,</hi> That the Council of Warr did more belong to the King and his Lords. And the next year, their advice being asked, concerning the Articles of Peace with <hi>France,</hi> they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly excuſed themſelves, as <hi>too weak to counſel in ſo weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and being more earneſtly preſt to ſhew their own opinions, they <hi>humbly adviſed rather for Peace than Warr.</hi> For in thoſe dayes the Knights and Burgeſſes made it their only care, to ſtudy the well-fare of, and complain of the grievances which afflicted, thoſe places for which they ſerved. Thoſe of <hi>Lin,</hi> would conſult the advancement of the Trade of Fiſhing; thoſe of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the making of Stuffs; he of <hi>Teverſton,</hi> of Kerſies; thoſe of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> what conduced to the benefit of Clothing; thoſe of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> for their Stanneries; and never pry into thoſe things which were farr above many of their Intellectuals.

                        <p>The Priviledges of Parliament; and that in ſome Caſes they are Null and Void.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough theſe things afore ſpecified, might ſatisfie a Rational Subject: yet, as a cloud to obſcure this Regal Supremacy, the Commons have found out a way, to cry, <hi>Priviledge of Parliament.</hi> And with this clamorous plea, they have lately thought to ſave their Bacon, in the multitude of their bewitched Proſelytes, be their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never ſo notorious; And theſe Priviledges, they are gloriouſly pleas'd to call, <hi>Their ancient and undoubted Rights and Inheritance.</hi> But King <hi>James,</hi> (a Prince, too wiſe and learned, to ſubmit to, or <note place="margin">

And therefore, could not endure, Subjects to uſe ſuch <hi>Anti-Monarchical</hi> words, unleſs ſubjoyned with acknowledgement of grace and favour.</p>
                     <p>What their Priviledges are, they have been very unwilling to ſhew in a particular way: But be they what they will, theſe two following, they have moſt made uſe of, and imbraced, <hi>viz.</hi>

As for the firſt, 'tis true, that Sir <hi>Arnold Savage,</hi> [1404]. Speaker <note place="margin">Hackwell'<hi>s</hi> Mod. tenend. Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 203.</note> to the Commons, humbly deſired King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that they might freely make complaint of any thing amiſs in the Government: And, that the King, by the ſiniſter Information of any perſon, would not take it offenſive. The which the King was royally pleaſed to grant. And, after this, Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> their Speaker, [1523]. prayed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, That, <hi>If in Communication and Reaſoning, any man</hi>

                        <hi>in the Common-Houſe ſhould ſpeak more largely, then of duty they ought to do, that all ſuch offences might be pardoned;</hi> the which, the King was pleaſed to grant. And, the ſame favour was alſo yielded to <note n="*" place="margin">The Speakers Petition for freedom of Speech, is not recorded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, as <hi>Hen.

                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> their Speaker, ſome twenty years after. And Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at the entrance of her reign, was graciouſly pleas'd to allow the ſame to the Speaker, Sir <hi>Thomas Gargrave,</hi> before which mans time, 'twas very ſeldom asked, and therefore not granted. The Speakers commonly, only deſiring liberty for themſelves, not including the reſt of the Members; though ſince <hi>Gargrave</hi>'s time, it hath alwayes been humbly deſired, and alſo favourably granted.</p>
                     <p>But, what of all this, the King permits them Liberty of ſpeech, or rather winks at ſome ſlips, which in heat of diſcourſe, or debates, they may, through unadviſedneſs let fall: Therefore they may ſpeak Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, revile Authority, intrench upon Prerogative, and what not: But, if this be a Logical Conſequence, then is a Kings condition, as miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as uncertain. And, this is ſomething like the Long-Parliaments plea for a perpetual Seſſion. The King agrees, that they ſhall not be diſſolved without their own conſent; therefore they would ſit, till call'd to Judgement by the laſt Trumpet: though their Treaſonable Actions againſt the King, did not only by the Law diſſolve them, but left them capable of ſevere puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>But, how weak this pretended Conſequence is, may appear by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued practiſe. The Biſhop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> for his bold Speech in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was impriſoned by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. And Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>

                     <p>How ſeverely did ſhe check the Parliament, in the 23. year of her <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Exam.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61643:29"/>
they deſired Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> to preſent their Submiſſion to the Queen, and to crave her pardon. Nor would ſhe ſuffer her Parliaments to <note place="margin">

And plainly uſed to tell them, that their Priviledges were but the free pronouncing theſe two words, <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>No.</hi> And King <hi>James,</hi> perceiving his laſt Parliament but one, to ſoar ſomewhat high, told their Speaker, Sir <hi>Thomas Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in a Letter from <hi>New-market,</hi> That <hi>ſome fiery and popular ſpirits</hi>

                        <hi>of the Lower-Houſe, did debate matters above their capacity, to our diſhonour and Prerogative Royal. Theſe are therefore to make known to them, That none ſhall hereafter preſume to meddle with any thing concerning our Government, or matters of State; with our Sons match with the Daughter of</hi> Spain; <hi>nor to touch the Honour of that King, or any other our Friends or Confederates. Nor with any mans particulars, which have their due Motion in our Ordinary Courts of Juſtice.—But to put them out of doubt of any queſtion hereafter of that nature, We think our ſelf very free and able to puniſh any mans miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in Parliament, as well ſitting there, as after, which we mean not to ſpare, hereafter, upon any occaſions of any mans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that King <hi>James,</hi> had good grounds for what he wrote, I am apt to believe, not only conſidering his own Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in State-affairs: But, that, if a Parliament man, by their own Orders, is not abuſively to reflect upon any of their own Members, to me, it ſeems very irrational, to think, that they may openly vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Crown, and throw dirt upon Regal Authority. Therefore, I ſhall perſwade my ſelf, that Sir <hi>Henry Ludlow,</hi> who ſaid there, that <note place="margin">Ex. Coll. <hi>p.</hi> 550.</note> 
                        <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>was not worthy to be King of</hi> England; was farr more unfit to live.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Priviledge, which the Parliament doth vigorouſly demand as their due and right; we ſhall find their clamour to be not unlike ſome Bills in Chancery, where many thouſand pounds are demanded, when ſcarce twenty is due: Or the towring expectations of <hi>Lambert Simnell,</hi> a Bakers ſon, who under a Princely Vizard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <note place="margin">Bacon'<hi>s Hiſt.</hi> Hen. 7. p. 20, 36.</note> the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as his Birth-right; yet, after all the bloud-ſhed in his behalf, was happy to be a Turn-ſpit to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, for Debt, and ſuch private and peculiar Engagements, a Member cannot be Impriſoned; for, if ſo, a plot might be framed to ſhrink the Houſes again, though in a more plauſible method, to a New Rump. And this was the caſe of Mr. <hi>George Ferrers,</hi> Burgeſs for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> [1542.] who being arreſted for debt, was, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">

But yet, the beſt of them may be impriſoned, though then actually in Parliament, either for Treaſon, Felony, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give ſecurity for the Peace.

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus hinted upon the Kings Prerogative, the Origin of the Commons, and their Priviledges, by which 'tis plain, that the King is Supream, and, by Conſequence and good Law, Treaſon <note place="margin">25 Edw. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 1 Phil. &amp; Mar. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> to warr againſt him: I ſhall now ſhew, that the Parliament, and not himſelf, was the firſt beginners of theſe late Confuſions; the true riſe of which, I muſt fetch higher, than the Presbyterian Party will give me thanks for.</p>
                     <p>And as a leading Card to this Diſcovery, we muſt obſerve, that a rebellious itching humour of incroaching upon, and railing againſt lawful Authority, was the main foundation of our miſeries; the ſource of which frantick temper, I muſt draw from <hi>Geneva,</hi> whoſe Diſciples are commonly carryed on with more violence than the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> upon which the City boaſts her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>In this City, <hi>John Calvin</hi> confirmed his Presbyterian-Diſcipline, in the ſame year, that <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the firſt Founder of the Jeſuites, was choſen their firſt General in a ſolemn manner, <hi>viz.</hi> 1541. And <note place="margin">1541.

And, as theſe two Orders of Presbytery, and Jeſuitiſm, took their riſe together; ſo have they gone hand in hand through a blind zeal, not only to derogate from, but extirpate all Civil Authority not conducible to their Intereſts. And, as <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Presbytery,</hi> at firſt, was begot by Rebellion and Treaſon, [they expelling from <hi>Geneva,</hi> their lawful Prince and Magiſtrate]: So have their Children (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the foot-ſteps of their Parents, (as, what is in the bone, will never out of the fleſh), made it their buſineſs, to terrifie the World with this truth, that, as Schiſm, ſo Sedition and they, are inſeparable. And in this, they have been no way hindred, by their Lord and Maſter <hi>John Calvin,</hi> whoſe inconſiderate zeal, in ſome things, was ſuch, that it was ſo farr from ſparing any, that it would throw its fury at Kings and Queens: Witneſs his irreverent expreſſion, thrown againſt Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> calling of her <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> telling <note place="margin">—<hi>Proſerpinae,</hi> quae bodie illic ſuperat omnes Diabolos. <hi>Calv.</hi> in <hi>Amos</hi> cap. 7. verſs. 13. pag. 282.</note> us, that <hi>ſhe outſtrips all the Devils in Hell.</hi> And in this way of Rhetorick, do other of his dear ſons follow him; as, <hi>John Knox</hi> calls the ſame Queen <hi>wicked Jezabel,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>

But, their only railing againſt Princes, doth not ſhew half their malice; for, they have found out fine wayes, not only to dethrone, but murther their Kings, by their not only approving of ſuch wickedneſs, but perſwading thereto.

The Kings and Queens thinking it hard meaſure, to have their undoubted Rule and Soveraignty pluck'd from them, by ſuch inferiour Inſtruments and Vaſſals: And, on the other ſide, the <hi>Congregators,</hi> [for ſo they then call'd themſelves], back'd on by ſeveral Hot-ſpurs, ſcorned to yield ſubjection to any but themſelves; ſo, that the diſturbed Kingdom appeared to be governed by two diſtinct Authorities; like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> one party diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Equal, whilſt the other denyed a Supream.

                     <p>At the beginning of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Queen-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent favourably, becauſe contrary to her Religion, allowed them the Bible in their own Language: But they not content with this, uſe their wonted Maſter-peice of Reviling; upon which, ſhe was conſtrained to ſend for ſome of their Preachers, to appear before her, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly came; but with ſuch a multitude of favourites and attendants, that through fear of her own Perſon, ſhe was obliged to order, by Proclamation, all to depart, who came unſent for; a thing alwayes uſual in the beſt of Governments: yet was this ſo offenſive to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they throng in Tumults into her Privy-chamber, and there threaten her with their weapons, (an act quite contrary to the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians); ſo that ſhe was conſtrained to pleaſure them.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards ſhe allows them liberty to uſe their Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note place="margin">1558.</note> in the Vulgar Tongue, provided, they kept no Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> or <hi>Leith,</hi> for avoiding Tumults. And in their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61643:32"/>
Petition to her for the obtaining theſe favours, they acknowledge, that <hi>the Redreſs of all Enormities, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, did orderly belong to her.</hi> But, this acknowledging of her Authority, laſted not long: for, when preſently afterwards, they demanded more liberty, with a bob at Biſhops, and not receiving a Poſitive Anſwer according to their Intentions; They publickly proteſt <hi>to ſtand to their Tenents, and that they will defend all thoſe who ſhall violate ſuch Acts and Rites which are commanded by their Adverſaries, (i. e.</hi> the Queens Party). <hi>And, that if any Tumult and Uproar ſhall riſe, or abuſes be violently reformed, or whatſoever inconvenience ſhall happen to enſue, that theſe crimes be not imputed to them, but to thoſe who will not hearken to our Petitions.</hi> At theſe actions, the Queen-Regent was ſo moved, as to profeſs, ſhe could not keep promiſe with them; upon which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,—<hi>We cannot any longer acknowledge your Authority, and will henceforth renounce all Obedience to you.</hi> Thus do they acknowledge and deny Supremacy, as each action will ſerve for their turn. And to this purpoſe, King <hi>James,</hi> (who had moſt reaſon to know theſe people), thus tells us; That <hi>John Knox, wrote to the Queen-Regent,</hi>

But, this is nothing to the Inſolency they uſed to their Soveraign Queen; for, when it was noys'd about, that ſhe intended to marry <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> Son to <hi>Lenox: Knox</hi> rails to the purpoſe, againſt this match, affirming, that <hi>it would bring Plagues upon the Nation, and the Kirks Curſe to boot:</hi> for this, the Queen ſends for him in private, where, with trickling tears, ſhe tells them. <hi>How low her Princely nature had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, in often Conferences with them, adviſing them to moderation, and ſhe would conſult for their quiet eſtabliſhment;</hi> and truly told him, That <hi>the more ſhe reſtrain'd the puniſhment of their diſorders againſt her Perſon and Authority, the more liberty they took to offend.</hi> To this, <hi>Knox</hi> impudently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, That <hi>his patience in ſuffering abominations, made him not guilty of any fault; and, if his tongue took liberty in Pulpit, ſhe might take it as ſhe pleas'd, ſince in the Pulpit he had no Superiour but God; and, that his gifts made him equal to any of her Peers:</hi> And, as for her weeping, he ſaid, <hi>He could better ſuſtain her tears, than the trouble of his Cauſe, or to betray the Common-wealth.</hi> Nor durſt the Queen queſtion him for his ſawcy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, knowing the ſtrength of his Faction; which being uot unhid to <hi>Knox,</hi> made him more Inſolent, as afterwards publickly to affirm; That, <hi>For her ſins the Land muſt lament;</hi> and, that <hi>it was abſolute Rebellion</hi>

                     <p>Not long after this, the Queen was brought to Bed in <hi>Edenburgh Caſtle</hi> [betwixt 9. &amp; 10. at night, <hi>July</hi> 19.] of a Son, which was afterwards <note place="margin">1566.</note> Chriſtned at <hi>Sterling,</hi> and call'd <hi>James,</hi> who became at laſt the happy Uniter of the two Crowns.

Then was the Queen (whether willing or conſtrained, is nothing to me), marryed to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> againſt whom the Lords raiſe an Army, and forced him to fly into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where he was impriſoned: and they alſo ſeize on the forſaken Queen, whom they ſecure in the Iſland of <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> where by threats and fear, they forced her to reſign (tears trickling down her face abundantly) her Intereſt in the Crown, to her young Son, few days above a year old, who was Crowned few days after, at <hi>Sterling, [July,</hi> 29.] And, if you will believe a late Hiſtorian, <note place="margin">

                     <p>Now could the <hi>Knoxians</hi> deſire nothing more, having their King young in his Cradle, and ſo, capable of what impreſſion they pleas'd, and their Queen in cloſe Priſon, ſo that they appeared Lords and Maſters: Yet ſhe preſently eſcapes out of Priſon, gets ſome Forces, fights <hi>Murray</hi> the <hi>Regent:</hi> but being beat, fled into <hi>England,</hi> where <note place="margin">1568.</note>

                     <p>The next year the <hi>Regent Murray</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Lithgow,</hi> by one <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton.</hi> And then <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Kings Grand-father, obtained that dignity, againſt whom the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> in behalf of the Queen, raiſeth a Warr, in which <hi>Lenox</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Sterling.</hi> Then was the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Marre</hi> choſen, who not long after dyed of a Feavour.

In this year did <hi>John Knox</hi> dye at <hi>Edenburgh, [Novemb.</hi> 27.] one that (as I am apt to believe, all things conſidered), gained more eſteem amongſt the people by the reverence of his long-beard, reaching down to his middle, than any real wiſdom or diſcretion that could be appropriated to him.</p>

And now comes <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> burning from <hi>Geneva,</hi> againſt <note place="margin">1575.</note> Biſhops, denying the lawfulneſs of their Function, labouring for the abſolute Presbyterial Diſcipline, according to the <hi>Geneva</hi> mode, which rais'd ſome Tempeſts in the Church, inſomuch, that ſome of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery forbad Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamſon,</hi> (lately by the Regent preſented (and by the Chapter choſen) to the See of St. <hi>Andrews)</hi> to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any part of his Juriſdiction, till he had acknowledged and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Athol</hi> not affecting the Regent, go to the young <note place="margin">1577.</note> King at <hi>Sterling,</hi> complaining againſt <hi>Morton,</hi> and deſiring him to take the Rule upon himſelf.

                     <p>The young King being brought up in the Reformed way, confirms <note place="margin">1579.</note> the Religion in Parliament; but not their Diſcipline: he affecting the Epiſcopal Government, and, ever ſince he was ten years old, as <note place="margin">Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> pag. 20.

                     <p>Having thus tyed his Conſcience, as they thought, his Body muſt <note place="margin">1582.</note> be ſecured too, and ſo at <hi>Ruthen</hi> they ſeize upon him, and that with ſo much inhumanity and irreverence, that he burſt forth into tears, for which he got nothing but this Anſwer from the Maſter of <hi>Glam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis; It is no matter for his tears, better that Barns ſhould weep, then Bearded-men.</hi> Upon this, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> going to know the Kings condition, was ſecured, and his Brother ſore wounded: And none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered to ſpeak with the King, but whom they pleas'd; he cryed out to ſome Noble-men, whom the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> had ſent to ſee him; that he was a Captive, and deſired his good Subjects to releaſe him. But this his Jaylors forced him preſently to recant, by ſetting forth a Proclamation in his Name, that all things were done according to his own deſire. Then is the King carryed to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where the Eſtates, and Aſſemblies of Miniſters, juſtifie this bold action, ſinging in triumph, as they went up the <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> the 124.

nothing to be done, moved the Embaſſadours to depart: But, the King being willing to diſmiſs them with ſome content, deſired the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to Feaſt them before their parting; for he, for his part, was not ſuffered to do any thing; the which they did the next next Munday. But the Miniſtry, to ſhew their rebellious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Devilliſh croſsneſs; proclaim a Faſt to be kept upon the next Munday, the day appointed for the Embaſſadours Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at this Faſt, the Miniſters thundred out againſt the Magiſtrates and other Noble-men, that waited upon the Embaſſadours by the Kings directions: Nor was this all; but they purſued the Magiſtrates with the Cenſures of the Church, and could ſcarce be ſtay'd from Excommunicating them, for not obſerving the Faſt they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</p>
                     <p>The King not liking his Reſtraint, and perceiving how Imperious <note place="margin">1583.</note> his Subjects grew, whilſt he was under hatches, conſults an Eſcape, which was performed by the means of <hi>Col. Stewart,</hi> Captain of the Guard; upon which, thoſe who would not now ſubmit to his Majeſty, were proclaimed Traytors, he alſo declaring, that however his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation came forth, yet it was extorted from him by violence, and therefore of no validity. But, for all this, the Miniſters in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits vindicate the late Impriſoning of the King, for which <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> was charged to enter his perſon at <hi>Blackneſs;</hi> but he, inſtead of obedience, fled to <hi>Barwick:</hi> which proceedings againſt <hi>Melvil,</hi> cauſed great grumblings amongſt the Brethren, who affirmed, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King, nor Council, can cenſure men for words in Pulpit, but their own Aſſociates, the Presbytery only.</p>
                     <p>The next year the Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> with whom joyned ſome of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, run into open Rebellion; but, the Earl being taken, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, <note place="margin">1583.</note> and the Miniſters fled for it.</p>
                     <p>The Nation being thus rent into diſtractions, by a company of bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling malepert <hi>Boute-feus;</hi> the Parliament hoped by giving <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, and gagging his Enemies mouths, all things would then tend to Peace and Settlement. For which purpoſe, they confirm his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Authority, over all Perſons, and in all Cauſes. And, that to decline the Kings Judgement, and the Councils, in any thing, ſhould be High-Treaſon; and, that any thing whatſoever, not approved of by the King, and the Three Eſtates, ſhould be null. And, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, ſhould either privately, or publickly, either in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Declamation, or Diſcourſe, utter any falſe, untrue, or ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, to the reproach, diſhonour, hurt, or prejudice of the King, or any of his Parents, or Progenitors, or his Council: nor meddle with the affairs of the King or State.</p>
                     <p>Theſe good and honeſts Acts, made the Presbyters Horn-madd, who, <note place="margin">1584.</note> like our bordering Moſs-Troopers, are never content, but when doing miſchief to others. They proteſt againſt theſe wholſom Statutes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them fly away into <hi>England,</hi> ſcorning to live in ſuch ſubjection; and Libels and Pamphlets fly plentifully againſt the King and Court:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61643:35"/>
And by Letter, proteſt thoſe Acts to be againſt the Word of God, and therefore, if they ſubmit to them, they ſhould then be Traytors to God; reviling Biſhops, whom they call <hi>Groſs Libertines, Belly-gods,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous;</hi> and ſuch like charitable ſtuff as this. This turbulent ſpirit flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them, made many of them be impriſoned, and others ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from their Livings.</p>
                     <p>But, this laſted not long: for the next year the Scales turned, the baniſhed Lords being come again into <hi>Scotland,</hi> they joyn Forces, and <note place="margin">1585.</note> march to <hi>Sterling,</hi> where they ſeize upon the Kings Perſon again, whom they conſtrain, by Proclamation, to pardon them all. Now did the Court put on a new face, the old Officers are turn'd out, and others put in. This imboldens the Miniſters, who fled, to return again; but much of their intended malice was ſtopt by a Parliament, who order, that none ſhall reproach his Majeſties Perſon, State, or Government. This incenſed the Miniſtry ſo much, as to ſtir up one <hi>Watſon,</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to rail to the Kings face of his evil Government, for which he was impriſoned at <hi>Blackneſs.</hi> This mans mouth being thus ſtopt, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that gang, call'd <hi>James Gibſon,</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> affirmed, the King to be the Perſecutour of the Church, and calls him to his face, <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> pronouncing this Curſe againſt him, That <hi>He ſhould dye childleſs, and be the laſt of his Race.</hi> For this, becauſe before the Council he maintained the ſame again, he was committed; yet afterwards, [1587.] upon better advice, he acknowledged his fault, and was ordered publickly to do the ſame in his next Sermon, the which he promiſed to do, yet did not; whereupon being charged for breaking his promiſe, he ſtubbornly anſwered; <hi>That out of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and weakneſs he had confeſs'd a fault, but now his Conſcience told him, that his words were innocent.</hi> The <hi>Chancellour</hi> perceiving the mans inconſtancy, put it to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> whether <hi>Gibſon</hi> had done well or no; where, though many were ready to vindicate him, yet at laſt, a majority found him ſlanderous and offenſive; but he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the afternoon to receive his cenſute, after much bandying to and fro, he was only ſuſpended during the pleaſure of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and this laſted but to the next <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when without ever acquainting the King, he was by his Brethren quitted; the which Countenancing of ſuch Seditious Actions, did ſo incenſe his Majeſty, that <hi>Gibſon</hi> was forced to fly into <hi>England,</hi> where he was entertained by the hot-brain'd Non-conformiſts.</p>
                     <p>The Presbytery to ſhew themſelves more formidable, call a Synod <note place="margin">1586.</note> at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where they accuſe the Biſhop of the ſame place, for having had a hand in the late Acts againſt the unrulineſs of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (as <hi>Melvil</hi> accuſed him). The Biſhop appeals to the King and three Eſtates, and denyes their Judicatory, not being call'd by the Kings conſent; but for all this, they judge him fit to be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, yet none would pronounce the Sentence againſt him, till at laſt, many of them being departed, a young fellow, named <hi>Andrew Hunter,</hi> ſaid, that he was warned by the Spirit, to pronounce the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61643:36"/>
ſentence, and ſo aſcending the chair, read the ſame out of a Book. This boyling humour of the Miniſters, troubled King <hi>James</hi> not a little: which greatly augmented, when they inſolently refuſed to pray for the Queen his Mother, then near herend, though he had earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. But the greateſt of all, was the execution in <hi>England,</hi> how handſomly I know not, though he greatly endeavoured to ſtop it.</p>
                     <p>But the King thinking to put an end to all tumults, thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <note place="margin">1587.</note> the Nobility, which at laſt he did, Feaſting them all at <hi>Haly-rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> thence cauſing them to walk hand in hand, two and two, to the Market Croſs at <hi>Edinburg,</hi> where they ſealed their Concord by drinking one to another. The ſame peace he thought to have made with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; but this not fadging, all fell to nothing.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Huntley, Bothwell, Crawford, Montroſs,</hi> and <hi>Athol,</hi> agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Jeſuits, rebell; but upon thier ſubmiſſion were pardoned. <note place="margin">1589.</note> Yet though the King was ſo eaſie to ſhew favour, ſo was not the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, who deprive the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> of all ſpiritual functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for marrying the King's Cozen, the <hi>Duke of Lenox</hi> his Siſter, to the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> though he did it by the King's expreſs Command; yet was the King forced to diſſemble his diſlike of their inſolency, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their power and ſtubborneſs; and having another thing in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> his marriage with <hi>Ann</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Daughter; whom to to fetch, he preſently took ſhip, and married her in <hi>Upſlo</hi> in <hi>Norway;</hi> thence, through part of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> he returned with her <note place="margin">1590.</note> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where ſhe was crowned, though the accuſtomary <hi>unction</hi> was much oppoſed by the Miniſtry, calling it <hi>a Jewiſh Rite aboliſhed at Chriſts coming, and introduced by the Pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Bothwell</hi> and ſome others conſpire againſt the King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring <note place="margin">1591. 1592.</note> to ſeize upon his perſon at <hi>Haly-rood-houſe</hi> and <hi>Faulkland;</hi> but without ſucceſs, and ſo was glad to fly into <hi>England.</hi> The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie taking advantage againſt the King in theſe troubles, Petition that the Acts made 1584. to reſtrain the inſolencies of theſe hot heads, ſhould be abrogated, which the King was conſtrained (fearing leſt they ſhould alſo rebell againſt him upon a denyal), in ſome ſort, to conſent to. Though the next year he aſſures them, that he would not ſuffer the <note place="margin">1593.</note> Priviledges of his Crown to be leſſen'd, nor Aſſemblies to meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Order; but this they ſlightly anſwer, by telling him, that they will keep to the benefit allowed them the year before: Nor ſhall they hold their tongue in the Pulpit, upon juſt and neceſſary cauſes. Such ſmall eſteem had they for their Soveraign, though they would humble themſelves to inferiour people in greater matters. For when they had, with the conſent of the Council of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> made an Act, that the <hi>Munday Market</hi> in that City ſhould be alter'd to <hi>Tueſday:</hi> The Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers whom it moſt concerned, gathered together before the Miniſters doors, threatning to chaſe them out of Town, if they harp'd upon that ſtring any more; which was the reaſon of this Saying, there: <hi>Raſcals and Sowters can obtain from the Ministers, what the King could not in matters more reaſonable.</hi>

                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> as aforeſaid, having fled to <hi>England,</hi> for Treaſon, returns again, and being aſſiſted with other Nobles, and by the cunning of the Lady <hi>Atholl,</hi> ſeizeth upon the King at <hi>Haly-rood-houſe,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the King to pardon all, and that ſeveral perſons of quality, ſhould be turned from the King's ſervice.

                     <p>If the King's Authority could do this, the Kirk thought they had as much power to excommunicate the Catholick Lords; which the King (the Lord offering themſelves to Tryal) endeavoured to ſtop, telling them, that they had nothing to do in ſuch affairs; but this denial ſo troubled and vext the Aſſembly, that they order all of their fraternity to be in Arms: For this inſolency the King checking them, they reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That it was the Cauſe of God, and in the defence thereof, they could not be deficient.</hi> Hereupon, the King puts forth a Proclamation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all meetings; yet, for all this, they kept on their Courſe, ſo that the King was forced to yield. Yet this procured him no peace, [though the birth of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> rejoyced him.] For <hi>Bothwell</hi> falls <note place="margin">1594.</note> again into Rebellion, aſſiſted by <hi>Argile, Arrol,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie were ſo active in this Treaſon, as to carry on his deſigns; they give him the monies collected for the relief of their then diſtreſſed Brethren at <hi>Geneva:</hi> By this means, having got ſome forces together, he fights the King's Party, in which, though he was not beaten, yet ſhifts for himſelf, diſſolving his Souldiers. Yet after this, having joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with ſome Catholick Lords to ſurprize the King again; but being diſcovered, flyes to open Rebellion, and having, with nine hundred men, under the Command of <hi>Huntly,</hi> beat <hi>Argile,</hi> who had above 10000. upon Compoſition, are pardoned, but baniſhed.

                     <p>The King for peace-ſake and good policy, had a mind to pardon and <note place="margin">1596.</note> call home the baniſhed Lords; to which, at laſt Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> the Miniſter conſents, provided, that <hi>Huntly</hi> ſhould not return; but the King reaſoning with him for <hi>Huntly</hi> too, he imperiouſly anſwered, <hi>I ſee Sir, that your reſolution is to take</hi> Huntly <hi>into favour; which if you do, I will oppoſe; and you ſhall chooſe whether you will loſe</hi> Huntly, <hi>or Me; for us both, you cannot keep.</hi> This is that <hi>Bruce,</hi> whoſe popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity outvyed the King's; who ſeeing one time, what a multitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſaid, <hi>By my ſale,</hi> Bruce <hi>puts me down in his Attendants.</hi> And this is he, who had preached many years without <hi>Ordination,</hi> nor would he be ordained, which was the occaſion of ſome diſputes, 1598.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all this ſelf-conceited pratler, the Lords return; which mads the Miniſtry, who meet about it, proclaim a Faſt, order inquiry to be made into their Favourites, againſt whom, they proceed with Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and clamour, as if the Kirk had been ſinging her <hi>Requiem.</hi> The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61643:37"/>
King troubled at theſe turbulent actions under his very noſe, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation diſſolves them: Whereupon they Petition him, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Limits of Chriſts Kingdom. And theſe hubbubs were the more heightned by the Sermon of Mr. <hi>David Blake,</hi> in which he rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the King, Queen, and Lords, and call'd Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and <hi>a Woman of no Religion:</hi> of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor complain'd, and demanded ſatisfaction: Upon this, <hi>Blake</hi> is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before the Council, which ſo incenſed <hi>Andrew Melvill,</hi> that he labour'd to make it a Publick Cauſe; and did ſo much, That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, it would be ill to queſtion Miniſters; and boldly told King <hi>James,</hi> (who asked them, if they had ſeen the Conditions of <hi>Huntly</hi>'s Pardon), <hi>That both he, and the reſt, ſhould either ſatisfie the Church in every point, or be purſued with all extremity, ſo as they ſhould have no reaſon to complain of the over-ſight of Papiſts;</hi> And as for <hi>Blake,</hi> they gave him a <hi>Declinator,</hi> affirming, <hi>it was the Cauſe of God, whereunto it concerned them to ſtand at all hazzard;</hi> and this <hi>Declinator</hi> was ſent to all the Presbyteries in the Kingdom, who were deſired not only to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, but to commend the Cauſe in their private and publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God; by which means they fancyed themſelves ſo ſtrong, that they deny the King to have power to judge a man for ſpeaking in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; and, that the King, in what he had already done, had ſo wronged Chriſts Kingdom that the death of many men could not be ſo grievous to them. And therefore they ordain a Faſt for averting the Judgements then threatning the <hi>Kirk.</hi> This action ſo vext his Majeſty, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all Convocatings and Meetings; but they little cared for him, or his Orders: for Mr. <hi>Walter Balcanquall,</hi> did not only forthwith rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court, naming ſeveral of the chief Courtiers; but deſired all the well-affected to meet in the <hi>Little Church</hi> to aſſiſt the Miniſtry, who did accordingly, and Petition the King in behalf of the Kirk. But the King asking them, who they were that durſt convene againſt his Proclamation, was worſhipfully replyed by the Lord <hi>Lindeſey, That they durſt do no more then ſo, and, that they would not ſuffer Religion to be over-thrown.</hi> Multitudes unmannerly thronging into the room, the King departed, and they went to the little Church again, where <hi>Linde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> told them, <hi>No courſe but one, let us ſtay together that are here, and promiſe to take one part, and advertiſe our friends, and the favourers of Religion to come unto us; for it ſhall be either theirs, or ours.</hi> Upon which, great clamours, ſhoutings, and lifting up of hands followed, ſome crying <hi>to Arms,</hi> others to <hi>bring out Haman,</hi> [for whilſt the Lords were with the King, being ſent as above-ſaid, from the <hi>Little-Church</hi> Mr. <hi>Cranſtone</hi> read to the People that ſtory] others cryed out, <hi>The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon:</hi> and ſo great were the Peoples fury rais'd on a ſodain, That, if the Provoſt, by fair words, and others by threats, had not tamed them, they had done ſome violence.

the King, ſaying, <hi>He was poſſeſt with a Devil, and compared him to a Madd-man;</hi> and affirmed, <hi>That Subjects might lawfully riſe, and take the Sword out of his hand.</hi> In this fiery zeal, they write a Letter to the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> deſiring him to be their General, telling him in it, That <hi>the People, animated by the Word and Motion of Gods Spirit, had gone to Arms.</hi> But all came to nothing, <hi>Hamilton</hi> refuſing ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious honour carryeth the Letter to the King, who orders the guilty Miniſters to be apprehended, who eſcape by flying into <hi>England,</hi> and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> are pardoned. The overthrow of this one buſineſs ſtrengthened the Kings Authority mightily, which was alſo confirmed by the Aſſembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> [now better known by the name of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-<hi>Town].</hi>

In this year was King <hi>James</hi> his third ſon [his ſecond, <hi>viz. Robert,</hi> dying young] <hi>Charles</hi> born, afterwards King of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>And now, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dying, King <hi>James</hi> the undoubted next <note place="margin">1603.</note> Heir to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, is at <hi>London</hi> Proclaimed accordingly, whither he went to receive his Crown; having thus happily united the two Kingdoms.

                     <p>Theſe round dealings did a little terrifie the reſt of them, and gave a check to the furiouſneſſe of the wiſer ſort. But yet having ſome of the Nobility their Patrons, (whether for Conſcience or Policy, let others judge:) as <hi>Leiceſter, Lord North, Burleigh, Shrewſbury, Warwick, Walſingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knollys,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beal,</hi> Clerk of the Council, and others, they took heart again, and proceeded in their Conſultations and Actions, as formerly: Nor was <hi>Arch-biſhop Grindal</hi> thought to be ſo vigilant, as his place required: for which, he got the Queens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Yet formerly, had they kept meetings of ſome of their Miniſters, to carry on their intended innovations, but privately for fear of diſcovery. The firſt known to be kept in <hi>England,</hi> was at <hi>Wandſworth</hi> in <hi>Surry, 1572. Novemb.</hi> 20.

of the Church, though they had no call, but their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe they reſolved to be vigilant, they had another Synod, [paſſing by one, alſo the ſame year at <hi>Cambridge,]</hi> where was drawn up a form of Diſcipline, (ſcorning to ſubmit to Ours, or Anthority) by which they were to be guided; of which, thus a painful and learned Antiquary will inform us: <hi>Inventing out of their own corky brains, a</hi>

                     <p>After this, another Synod was held at <hi>Coventry, 1588. June</hi> 10. where they imperiouſly condemned <hi>the reading of Homilies, Croſſe in Baptiſm, that Biſhops ordination by them and their autherity are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: and that a Biſhop is neither Doctor, Elder, nor Deacon.</hi> And beſides all this, they decree, that occaſions are to be ſought to bring the people in liking to their Diſcipline, and that thoſe of deeper appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions ſhall be drawn to it by all private allurements poſſibly. And theſe poſitions with others, were carried cunningly abroad to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all, to make their faction more unanimous.</p>
                     <p>And many other Meetings and Aſſemblies they had at <hi>London, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Cambridge,</hi> and other places, to carry on their deſigns: as appears by the confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Thomas Stone,</hi> and the Collections of the <note place="margin">

                     <p>And ſo powerful were they grown amongſt ſome of the Nobility and Gentry, that at the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> [1585.] they were ſo vigilant by their whiſpering with the Members day and night, that if the Queen had not interpoſed her authority, they might have given the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops a ſcurvy lift, by the aſſiſtance of their Schiſmatical Brethren, by them voted into the Houſe.

who confeſs't that Reformation was neceſſary, but was vext, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſhould undertake it. And at the Diſſolution of this Parliament, <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> takes ſpecial notice of our Innovators, for finding <note place="margin">Stow, <hi>p.</hi> 702, 703.</note> fault with our orderly Church-government; the which humour ſhe not unfitly terms, <hi>New fangledneſſe.</hi>

                     <p>I might here tell you of many more bold actions in this Queen's time, uſed by theſe <hi>Renegadoes,</hi> as a very ſerious and learned Gentleman <note place="margin">Weaver's Fun.

She therefore, good ſoul! was eſteemed to run counter to the Primitive Fall; there the woman, but here the man, or rather poverty, is judged the tempter: But becauſe the Country had both eyes and ears, therefore a marriage was thought moſt plauſible to vindicate the Brethren; the which was accordingly performed by a lame Souldier of <hi>Barwick,</hi> by the appointment of <hi>Snape;</hi> by whoſe order, the ſame Souldier had married many others at the ſame place. And it may be, <hi>Barebone's</hi> Parliament drew their new model of coupling, from this Swaſhbuckler.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and many other innovating and croſs grain'd actions, you may find ſtoried down by their almoſt-own <hi>Fuller:</hi> for ſo may I well take the boldneſſe to call him, ſince they could never deſire a more complyable Hiſtorian: And therefore theſe may carry the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with the Reader, let his education be either ſound or rotten.</p>
                     <p>KING <hi>JAMES</hi> ſucceeding upon the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Non-conformiſts thought to gain ground apace, having to deal with a Prince, as they thought, bred up in their own way, and a ſtranger not only to <hi>England,</hi> but, as they hoped, to her government alſo. 'Tis true, He had been nurſt up in the Presbyterian way in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but their inſolencies and incroachments to get all the power into their own hands, (as a ſtiff Presbyterian, under the fained name of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hiſt. Great.

Yet to ſatisfie their clamours, He gave them a conference at <hi>Hampior-Court;</hi> where their Objections ſeemed ſo trivial, that Self will and an erronious Conſcience was thought to be more predominant then Reaſon: Upon which, the King put forth a Proclamation for Uniformity; to which, all the Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> (and they are above nine thouſand) ſubmitted, except forty nine; ſuch a noiſe will a few diſturbers cauſe in any ſociety, when tolerated. Nor need this ſeem ſtrange to thoſe, who <note place="margin">Spotſwood. <hi>pag.</hi> 479.</note> know, that in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the number of our Clergy-men, who refuſed the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> did not amount to <note place="margin">

                     <p>Yet for all this, though King, Law, and all things elſe, were againſt the Diſciplinarian Intereſt, they grow reſolute, and as one ſaith, <hi>stark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maa,</hi>

And <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> for writing Libels againſt our Engliſh Church, [he then being at <hi>London,]</hi> was called before the Council, where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himſelf inſolently, and like a mad man, he was committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe actions our Non-conformiſts eaſily perceived, that they could gain nothing but their own ſhame and deſtruction, whilſt they acted only as private men; whereupon they reſolve under-hand to blow up the Parliaments againſt Prerogative; to which purpoſe by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, they never wanted a good party in the Houſe, who carried themſelves ſo reſolutely and cunningly, that for the future, <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> only rung with the clamours of Grievancies, liberty of Subject, and Priviledge of Parliament: A Parliament never ſitting, but ſome Member or other throwing dirt in his Majeſties face, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably done by freedom of ſpeech; never, or very ſeldom, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, in what he conveniently required; for when his pleaſure for any reaſonable thing, was any time made known to them, then they grumble and reply, that God muſt be ſerved before man; and then for a moneth or two, nothing is done in the Houſe, but the uttering of long-winded ſpeeches againſt Arminianiſm and Popery. And this to as little purpoſe, as Cardinal <hi>Rapacciolus</hi> his prayer, that the Devils fins and <note place="margin">Conclave Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. 7. <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> tranſgreſſions might be forgiven him, that ſo he might receive ſome comfort, and be of good cheer.

at <hi>Venice,</hi> or a <hi>Gondola</hi> in <hi>Themes,</hi> as is obvious to any who have ſeen the Speeches in the two laſt Kings raigns. 'Tis true, all were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on with the ſame Spirit, for the Houſe was ſtill compoſed of two different tempers.

                     <p>I ſhall not now trace the Extravagancies of private men, but ſhew you ſome of their hot-headed prancks in Parliament; becauſe they have now made that the Stage on which they intended to act for the future; and in this I ſhall ſtudy brevity, and paſs by many notorious inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt Parliament of King <hi>James,</hi> which was drawn out into ſeveral Seſſions; one of the Members bid <hi>the reſt take heed, leſt they gave too much to the</hi> King, <hi>leſt they endanger their own throats cutting when they went home;</hi> Others bob'd his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in his teeth for rewarding ſome of his own Countreymen, affirming, that <hi>their ſilver and gold abounded at</hi> Edenburgh. And one <hi>Piggot,</hi> after he had ſpoken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully <note place="margin">Heylin's <hi>Ex.

But having now to deal with a King, whom they thought might have been trampled upon here as well as beyond the <hi>Tweed,</hi> they left nothing unturn'd whereby they might ſtrengthen their own Faction. And this ſpirit of Contradiction and Contention ruling amongſt them, is pointed at by one of their own Brethren, though clad in more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <note place="margin">Wilſon's <hi>Hiſt.</hi> pag. 51, 52.</note> words; theſe bickerings, and the Members unreſtleſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour forced the King to diſſolve the Parliament, having ſat long enough in all Conſcience to do any good if they intended any.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards another Parliament being call'd, and conſiſting of the ſame Temperature, was preſently diſſolved. In the next Parliament, the King deſires ſome Moneys, [having not had any aſſiſtance from his People, for ſeveral years; ſo, that he was conſtrained to leſſen his Houſhold]. This neceſſary requeſt the Parliament hears, but never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to grant: And the better to lay it aſide, they firſt begin with the ſpacious and ſpecious ſubject of Complaints, and with a high hand fall upon the Grievances of the Subject, in which having ſpent ſome time, they drew up a <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> though they not only knew, that the things therein contain'd would be highly diſpleaſing to his Majeſty, but alſo, that the King had expreſly forbad them to meddle with any ſuch Concerns: And in this Paper, they greatly brag'd what their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were, and how they were their undoubted Right and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61643:42"/>
Theſe actions the King, who above all things loved Peace, did a little reſent, and gave them a ſmall check in a Letter; upon which, the diſcontented part of the Members grumble; and, having plotted a thin Houſe, and a late hour, [ſix a clock at night, in <hi>December]</hi> not a third part of the number being there, drew up a Proteſtation in behalf of their Liberty, Priviledges, and Juriſdiction as they pretended, and recorded it in their Journal Book [19. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1621.] thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their ſuppoſed valour to Poſterity: Nor can we imagine, but that ſuch Preſidents as theſe inflamed our late rebellious Spirits with preſumption: The King thus perceiving, that the longer they ſatt, the prouder they grew, diſſolved them by Proclamation; ſo unwilling were theſe men to ſatisfie the King, with any reaſonable ſupply; and this is ſomewhat hinted at by a Non-conformiſt himſelf, by obſerving out of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Hiſtory, that <hi>Henry</hi> the third, was ſo peſter'd <note place="margin">Wilſon'<hi>s Hiſt.</hi> pag. 155.</note> with Parliaments, that he would rather pawn his Crown-Jewels, give over his Houſe, and feed himſelf with the benevolence of Monks, than be beholden to his People; and this he tells us, was thought to be a Parallel for King <hi>James</hi> his time.

true, at the beginning they freely Vote the King five <hi>Subſidies:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">1627/8</note> he being informed by Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> and that the Houſe was ſo unanimous therein, that they made but one voyce; the King is ſaid, by ſome, to have wept for joy, hoping now he had a Parliament free from any turbulent humours; but this was but a bitter Pill covered over with Gold. For never was there any man more deceived ſince the firſt temptation then He: They no ſooner had given this Supply, but frame the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and deſire the Kings conſent to it, [for know, they never gave the King any thing, but they receive as good from him; a new way of Merchandize], the which, becauſe they had publickly queſtioned, whether they might truſt his Royal word, he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly confirms, the Houſes thereat teſtifying their joy with a mighty ſhout, and other people by ringing of Bels and Bon-fires.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſcarce had the King graciouſly granted this, but they, not yet content, drew up a Remonſtrance, ranting againſt the Innovation and Alteration in Religion, againſt the <hi>Arminians</hi> and ſome of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and other things; which was highly diſliked by the King, which ſo much incenſed the Commons, that they <hi>(over Boots, over Shooes)</hi> fell to draw up another againſt <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage;</hi> but the King not liking them to meddle after this manner, prorogued the Parliament. But being returned again, they fall very heavy upon the Cuſtomers, from which ſeverity the King endeavouring to perſwade them, work'd ſuch a contrary effect upon them, that in a high paſſion and diſtaſte they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed themſelves for ſome days as if their ſitting there would be to no purpoſe, ſeeing they could not command the King. His Majeſty being informed, that they had adjourned themſelves, thought fitting to allow them ſome more play-dayes, and ſo Adjourns them to the 2. of <hi>March,</hi> and then again for 8 dayes longer. But they met the ſecond day, and fell a ranting againſt the miſ-government; whereupon their Speaker Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> informed them of the Kings Order to adjourn them till the tenth; at this the Houſe ſtorms, affirming, the Speaker had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do to deliver ſuch meſſages, and, that Adjournment properly belonged to them; and ſo they took fire, and fell preſently into an hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, whether without fighting, I know not, though a Member was <note place="margin">

The Speaker, according to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties command, endeavours to leave the Houſe, but is violently held in his Chair by Mr. <hi>Denzil Hollis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Benjamin Valentine,</hi> and after watching his opportunity, having got a little out of his Chair, was by them two thruſt back again, and there held, the firſt of the couple, as an Authour tells us, ſwearing a deep Oath, that he ſhould ſit ſtill as long as they pleas'd: And to make all cock-ſure, Sir <hi>Miles Hobart,</hi> locks the door, and puts the Key in his pocket, (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was call'd an Impriſonment of the Parliament.) Theſe Figga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">H. L'Strange. <hi>pag.</hi> 101.</note> continued ſo long, that the King heard of them, and ſends for the Serjeant of the Mace <hi>[Grimſton],</hi> but he was not ſuffered to go; upon which contempt he ſends <hi>Maxwell,</hi> Uſher of the Black-Rod; but they ſo little regarded ſuch Summons, that they neither admitted him nor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61643:43"/>
his meſſage; which refuſals ſo much incenſed his Majeſty, that he ſent for the Captain of the Penſioners, and the Guard, reſolving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to force an entrance, than be thus out-braved by his Subjects. But the Members, perceiving what danger their paſſion had brought upon them, nimbly quitted the Houſe; though before their departure, they had noys'd out a Proteſtation againſt <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage, Arminianiſm, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Church-Innovations:</hi> And this was done by the Inſtigation of Sir <hi>John Eliot,</hi> (a great ſtickler in ſuch things) who alſo read it, the Speaker and Clerk denying to do it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Actions may well be brought to ſavour of a Non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit of Contradiction, and as a Glaſs, more really to obſerve their humours by. It is not unworth the notice, by what artifices they did really endeavour to make the King odious to his Subjects, of which I ſhall only hint upon one grand Impoſture, fobb'd about by many of theſe chief Ring-leading Members. And this was, of a Papet by them carefully and plantifully ſpread abroad, to diſcover the impertinence of Parliaments, and how by the Subjects Purſes to keep the Nation in a good defence againſt the Kings Enemies. And this was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that the King had not only ſuch a Deſign a foot, but, that by him, or his means, this Plot firſt took birth; whereas it was diſcovered by Sir <hi>David Foulis,</hi> (one not ignorant of State-affairs, being thereunto <note place="margin">L'Strange. <hi>pag.</hi> 111.</note> ſeveral times imploy'd by <hi>King James</hi> of bleſſed memory), that this Paper was contrived ſeveral years before, <hi>viz.</hi> about 1613. by Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Dudley,</hi> [then living at <hi>Florence,</hi> under the title of <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland].</hi> By which means, it ſeems, ſome men would not leave any ſtone unturned, rather than fail of their intended ends. Nor can I quit him from the ſame ignorance and malice, who long afterwards publiſhed it under the name of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s <hi>Plot diſcovered,</hi> &amp;c. endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring thereby to make him odious to the ſimple people, as if he had been the Compoſer of it; and this only, becauſe a Copy of it <note place="margin">Heylin'<hi>s Ex. Hiſt.</hi> part. 2. pag. 94, 95.</note> was found in his Study, an argument by which I might be proved the Compiler of it, and other <hi>Memoires</hi> of State, if Tranſcripts could make <hi>Syllogiſms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Actions of this Parliament countenanced many Puritans to ſhew their teeth: and amongſt the reſt, one <hi>Leighton,</hi> a Doctor in Phyſick, and a hot-headed <hi>Scotch-</hi>man, put forth a Book, call'd <hi>Sions Plea,</hi> and dedicated it to this Parliament; wherein he did not only rail againſt, but endeavoured, as much as in him lay, to ſtirr up the People to kill all the Biſhops; and ſtorm'd highly againſt the Queen, calling her the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Heth,</hi> a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and <hi>Idolatreſs,</hi> and with ſuch like language was his Book ſtuft; for theſe, and other things he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced in the <hi>Starr-chamber</hi> to be puniſh'd, to quit which, he made an eſcape, but being taken again, felt the ſmart accordingly. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, ſuch Incendiaries did not deſerve ſevere puniſhments, let any moderate man judge. Yet the Long-Parliament afterwards, did ſo much pitty his caſe, forſooth, becauſe he ſeem'd by it to be an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter of their Cauſe, that they ordered him for requital 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and

this a great while before the wars; whence a conſequence may be drawn, <note place="margin">April 21. 1641.</note> that that Presbyterian body did not only permit, but encourage Villains to ſcribble both againſt Church and State; which denotes them the Authors of our following miſchiefs, and therefore will be a brand upon thoſe Members to eternity.</p>
                     <p>After this, the <hi>Scots</hi> who had a long time been ſtuffing themſelves with diſcontents, took an occaſion to vent it upon the <hi>Divine ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1637.</note> ſent to them by the King, in ſome things differing from our <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, eſpecially in thoſe moſt agreeable to that Nation, viewed over firſt by ſome learned Biſhops; but not, as that impudent and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly lying wretch, that Protean <hi>Gage,</hi> would make ſome believe, a <note place="margin">New Survey of the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> cap. 22. pag. 208.</note> man unworthy the Relation of ſuch a noble Brother as he had. This book no ſooner began to be read in <hi>Saint Giles</hi> Church in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the <hi>Dean</hi> of that City, but the people in a fury threw their ſtools, Bibles, and any thing that came in their way, at the <hi>Dean,</hi> who was reſcued from their hands, by the <hi>Provoſt</hi> and <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> but not from their malice; who all the while, pelted the Church-windows with ſtones, and ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently aſſaulted the Biſhop going home, that if he had not been reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had probably been murthered: And in the afternoon ſell upon the Biſhop again.</p>
                     <p>Theſe tumults with much ado, were a little pacified, but broke out again: For the Council obſerving multitudes of people from moſt parts of the kingdom, to haſte to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and when there, to keep Conventicles and rant againſt Biſhops, &amp; the book; by Proclamation, command upon pain of Rebellion, all people to depart to their own homes, but thoſe who could ſhew reaſon of Lawful buſineſſe; which incenſed the Kirk-party ſo much, that the next day, they purſue the Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-houſe, which they beſet, and with threatnings demanded his Perſon; upon which, the Lord-Treaſurer, and the Earl of <hi>Wighton,</hi> going to pacifie the people, were moſt barbarouſly ſet upon by them, and with that fury that they pulled down the <hi>Lord-Treaſurer,</hi> took away his hat, cloak, and white wand, and ſo haled him to the Council-houſe; and this Tumult laſted, till they were pacified by ſome of the Non-conforming Lords and Gentlemen, who were deſired by the aſſaulted Nobility, to quiet their brethren.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the Lords of the Council, by Proclamation forbid any tumults for the time following; and another from the King to the ſame purpoſe; and for adjourning the Term to <hi>Sterling:</hi> but the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was no ſooner read at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> Lord <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and others, cauſed their Proteſtation againſt it to be read, and in deſpight of the King's Proclamation, gathered <hi>four Tables:</hi> The firſt for the Nobility: Second, for the Gentry. Third, for the Burroughs. Fourth, for the Miniſters. Theſe four prepared what they thought fit to propound to the <hi>General Table,</hi> conſiſting of ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners choſen from the reſt.

                     <p>The chief Promoters of the Covenant, were theſe three Miniſters, <hi>Henderſon, Dickſon,</hi> and <hi>Cant;</hi> who with their Covenant, were learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly repulſt by the Orthodox Divines of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King not liking theſe Combinations, ſent the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> as High-Commiſſioner, to pacifie them; but took no effect, they declaring to renounce their Baptiſm, rather then Covenant: though, to give them content, the King null'd the <hi>Service-book,</hi> and gave them an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was held at <hi>Glaſcow, Novemb.</hi> 21. 1638. In which, the Presbyterie were ſo far from ſuffering Biſhops to ſit, (as if they had not been Clergy-men) that they would have had them to appear before their Kirkſhips as guilty perſons, and ſo to be proceeded againſt: But this the Biſhops denyed, and put in a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinator and Proteſtation againſt their proceedings. By theſe and other croſs-grain'd humours of the Presbyterie, the Duke, perceiving the longer they ſat, the wider the breaches would grow, diſſolved the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; they oppoſing the King in all things, though he had granted them all convenient requeſts. To the diſſolving of this Aſſembly, all the Council conſented and ſubſcribed, but the Earl of <hi>Argtle;</hi> who ever after proved an inſtrument of miſchief to both Kingdoms. Againſt this diſſolution, the Covenanters proteſt and act accordingly, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt Biſhops, whom they afterwards by their goodly Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depoſed, and alienate their Lands: no great matter, God wot, the Rents of all the Biſhops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> not amounting to ſeven thouſand pounds ſterling, <hi>per Annum,</hi> as a Native informs us. And yet this ſmall <note place="margin">Maintenance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, or a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> p. 58.</note> pittance amongſt ſo many grave and hoſpitable Biſhops, was a great eye-ſore to the Covenanters, though ſeveral private Presbyterians might be nominated, whoſe eſtate ſurmount this. And not content with theſe actions, they began to gird themſelves to their Arms. Againſt whom the King marcheth, and both Armies draw up near <hi>Barwick,</hi> where a peace was concluded; by which means, <hi>Aberdeen</hi> eſcaped a ſcouring, the Earl of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> (then miſled) a General of the Covenanters, marching then againſt it with a Commiſſion to burn it.</p>
                     <p>This peace laſted not long, the Covenanters not ſticking cloſe to the Articles of agreement; and which was more, a great part of the walls of <hi>Edinburgh-Caſtle,</hi> falling one night down, and the King ordering the Governour and others, to ſee it rebuilt; the Covenanters would not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61643:44"/>
ſuffer it, by forbidding any materials to be carryed to its reparation. And, which was moſt of all, they perceiving the King incens'd at their actions; and therefore fearing ſome checks, addreſs themſelves to their old Ally, the King of <hi>France,</hi> from whom they deſired aid and aſſiſtance; an action ſo ſtrange, for ſubjects to appeal from their own King to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers, and that againſt their King too, that it will eaſily ſilence the old ſtory of the King's German horſe. Yet whether their Letter and Meſſenger was ſent, or no, it matters not; that it was drawn up, and ſubſcribed to be ſent, is certain, which is as much. By theſe affronts, the King being ſufficiently provoked, raiſeth an Army, and marcheth againſt the Scotch Covenanters, who with a great force had entred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that with cheerfulneſs, having more friends than the King: they having ſome twenty eight Lords and Earls: Whereas the King had not above twenty: beſides, they had the good wiſhes of the Engliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, who by their Sermons, Diſcourſes, and Pamphlets, had made the King's actions and friends ſo odious to the people, that many of the Royal Army marched unwillingly againſt the Scots, wiſhing them victorious, hoping by that means, to work their malice upon our Biſhops, and other perſons of quality. And accordingly it fell out, a part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being routed, the Scots poſſeſs all <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> with <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> This Proſperity of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cheers up our Nonconformiſts, who in this, joyning themſelves with the Scots, preſently get the King aſſaulted for a Parliament, which was granted, and to ſit <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. at <hi>London:</hi> and a ceſſation between the two Armies was made, and orders taken for a further Treaty. In the mean time, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army miſerably tormenting the Northern Counties of <hi>Cumberland, Weſtmorland, Northamberland,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> from which they raiſed a Contribution of 850. li. <hi>per diem,</hi> for their aſſiſtance: a thing by many thought very ſtrange, that an enemies Army ſhould thus, by compact, be maintained by thoſe who wiſht them farther off. This Covenanting Army kept correſpondency with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, having a ſafe convoy granted by the King for their Letters, by which means, many an odd deſign was, probably, nurſt up; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giving them thanks, and monies to boot, for their good ſervice.</p>
                     <p>But muſt the <hi>Scotch Covenanters</hi> be only guilty in affronting their King? No, that would derogate much from the zeal and forwardneſs of our <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians:</hi> who had ſo far countenanced their <hi>Caledonian</hi> brethren, as to have beſeeched them into a native conſpiracy, and then beckoned them to a Southern march. And therefore to ſhew their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable forwardneſs, they beſtirr'd themſelves to the purpoſe, to get non-conforming Members choſen, which accordingly anſwered their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation <note place="margin">1640,</note> in the <hi>ſhort Covenant ſympathizing Parliament:</hi> whoſe refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humours occaſioned their ſudden diſſolution. Our <hi>Engliſh Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> perceiving now, what a great ſtroak they had in chooſing members, thought it fitting to ſee what mettal their Proſelytes were made of: to which purpoſe, ſeveral were inſtigated to murther that great Prop of Learning, the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then the main eye-ſore to our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61643:45"/>
factious ſplrits, and to carry on this deſign more unanimouſly, a Paper was poſted upon the <hi>Old Exchange, May</hi> 9. exhorting all Prentices to riſe and ſack his houſe at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the Munday following; ſuppoſing they had as much authority to tumultuate againſt the Reverend Biſhops, as the Covenanters had. Of this plot, the Archbiſhop having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, prepared for his defence, and well was it, that he did ſo; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, on the following Munday, in the dead time of the night, above 500. men well armed for the purpoſe, aſſaulted his Palace, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all the ſtrength and force they had, to break open his Gates, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to come to his perſon; but he had ſo well provided for his ſecurity, that all their attempts only ſhewed their deviliſh malice, and murtherous intentions, which was alſo demonſtrated by their railing and curſing tongues. The next day, ſeveral of them were apprehended, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the <hi>White-Lion priſon,</hi> who were violently releaſed within three days by ſome of their wicked complices, by breaking open the priſon: ſo unanimous were ſome of the Anti-epiſcopal men to intolerable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy. Nevertheleſs one of their Chief-tains was re-taken, and for this rebellious riot was condemned, and, for example-ſake, hang'd and quartered; which ſo terrified the reſt of the Non-conforming brethren, that a kind of a peace was outwardly kept for a while. And as no ſmall incendiaries to theſe intolerable practices, were the wicked Pamphlets ſpred abroad to delude the vulgar by divers ſeditious perſons; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by <hi>Prynn, Burton, Baſtwick,</hi> and <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> people of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable ſpirits, that no government could ſatisfie them. And were ſo hot-headedly led by their erronious and ſpightful Principles, that as they took a pride in their own deſerved ſufferings, ſo nothing could ſatisfie them but the Confuſion of others. Yet theſe men afterwards took ſuch oppoſite intereſts, that they became utter enemies, endeavouring what in them lay, not only to vilifie, but ruine one another; though <hi>Prynn</hi> ſtill held up his head above the reſt. Thus were theſe Presbyterians the authors of our after-miſeries, that I may well ſob with a time ſerving Poet, <note place="margin">Pag. Fiſher. Irenodia Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulat.</note>

many of them, ſpur'd on by their Loyalty following his Majeſty, and ſitting in Parliament in the Schools at <hi>Oxford:</hi> after whoſe departure, the Houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſeemed like <hi>Pandora</hi>'s box, from whence all our future miſchiefs and diſeaſes flew over the Nation.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament, a little after its beginning, having triumph'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divers perſons of quality, whom they knew to be oppoſers of their intended Presbytery, thought it fitting to ſeek ſome abſolute way of ſecurity to themſelves for the future; And to this nothing could be thought more conducible (conſidering how they had gul'd an <hi>odium</hi> of Reverend Epiſcopacy into the ſimple people) than by the certainty of Parliaments, for which purpoſe they procured of the King (who dreamt nothing of their after-games and fetches) an <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Triennial Parliaments:</hi> And that their own actions might appear of more gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure by the ſtability of their own foundation, they alſo obtain'd from his Majeſty (who was never wanting to grant any thing to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pretended to be for the good of his ſubjects) an <hi>Act</hi> whereby themſelves ſhould not be diſſolved, prorogued, or adjourn'd but by their own conſent. By which means, they were fancied by many of the Kingdome to be of ſuch high Authority, that neither King, law, or any power elſe could have any influence over them, let their actions be never ſo treaſonable or wicked: And ſo might <hi>Phaeton</hi> ſuppoſe, when his Father had given him the command of his refulgent Chariot, though his indiſcreet authority brought ruine to himſelf and deſtruction to ſome parts of the world. And well may any one in this, turn their own weapons againſt themſelves, and yet not be deem'd too medling. Such a continuing-Commiſſion is freely given, yet cunningly procured, to the Captain of a ſhip: But when this Governour falls ſo farr di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, as to indeavour nothing more then the ruine of his Veſſel; by their own popular conſequence, his Commiſſion is void, as being no more able to govern his charge to the beſt. This inſtance I quote, more becauſe oft alledged againſt Regall authority, than for any ſimilitude it carrieth, unleſſe upon our perpetual Parliamentary account. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reviving of this long-Parliament by a modern Writer ſeems to be to as ſmall purpoſe, as <hi>Don Quixot's</hi> martial endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the I know not what Knight-errantry, by his paper helmet, his wind-mill, and claret-butts encounters; or <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the ſelf-conceited School-maſter in <hi>du Parques Franchion,</hi> to obtain the Crown and Kingdome of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King having as he thought pacifyed his Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving granted them what they deſired; thought it likewiſe expedient to ſettle all things in <hi>Scotland</hi> in a peaceable temper, for which purpoſe he <note place="margin">Auguſt. 1641.</note> put himſelf to the trouble of a journy thither; yet not without ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table obſervators; No ſooner he being departed, but our Parliament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſome members to go alſo into <hi>Scotland</hi> in notion of a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, to inform them of all paſſages in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet when the King went into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Parliament adjourn'd, though appointed a Committee of the Commons conſiſting of 50; of

and over which Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> was the chief Lord and Maiſter of miſ-rule; and him I find nominated at the very beginning of this Parliament with the Emphaſis of <hi>the great parliament man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the truth of it is, that he was ſo farre the <hi>dominus fac totum</hi> in <note place="margin">Diurn. Occur. pag. 7.</note> this <hi>juncto</hi> that his words were laws, all things being acted according to his deſire: Here many things of Church matters were by theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen purely innovated, and then proſecuted with ſuch violence that the Epiſcopal clergy durſt not gainſay him, as Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hutton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and others of St. <hi>Giles Cripplegate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> the Miniſter of St. <hi>Botolphs Alderſgate,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heywood</hi> of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> the Miniſters of St. <hi>George</hi> Southwark, of <hi>Margarets</hi> new Fiſh-ſtreet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could very well teſtifie by experience. Although the houſe of Lords would not conſent in theſe things to join with the Commons, yet did they ſo farre ſupinely wink at the others actions; that their Authority was now ſo much intrench'd upon, by the Commons, that their priviledges ſlipt from them unperceived: though without all queſtion the preſbyterian party both underſtood and ſmiled at ſuch proceedings. About this time there was a great deal of noiſe and clamour about a Letter forſooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> with I know not what plaiſter in it, and written, God <note place="margin">25 October 1641.</note> wot when, and delivered by no body knows whom, but a Gentleman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth in a gray-coat on horſeback; and great ſearching and inquiring for this <hi>man in the moon</hi> was made, but all to as little purpoſe as the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt paſſage</hi> or the <hi>philoſophers ſtone:</hi> And many times hath it been printed and ſpread abroad, to let the good people ſee the wickedneſs forſooth of Malignants, and with ſuch chaffe as this, have many of our old fools been taken.

                     <p>But let us now think of his Majeſties return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> in whoſe abſence ſome of the Parliament had raiſ'd large reports of ſtrange and terrible plots and deſigns againſt <hi>John an Oaks,</hi> and <hi>John a Stiles,</hi> by

which means many people were endeavour'd to be whiſper'd into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction of the King; and ſuch a jealouſie was grown by the noiſe of this <hi>Chimaera,</hi> that many did, according as they were bid, think that things were not then well carryed: and this was cunningly aimed at the King and his Favourites, by thoſe who had their <hi>Coy-ducks</hi> in ſuch obedience, that their Commands was not unlike that of Madam <hi>Fame</hi> to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> in our ingenious <hi>Chaucer.</hi>

                     <p>But theſe Alarums ſerved the Parliaments turn, being a Cloak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they might deceive the People in their pretences for raiſing a Guard; the which they did, and it may be to defend them from a <hi>Pedicularie diſeaſe,</hi> of which poſſibly they ſaw ſome ſymptoms then in the Houſe. Of theſe Romantick Jealouſies, Frights, Alarums and <note place="margin">2. Decemb. 1641.</note> unheard of Plots and Deſigns, his Majeſty tells the Parliament, and of the evil conſequences of ſuch ſlanders, in his firſt Speech to them after his return from <hi>Scotland.</hi> And in his next, earneſtly deſires them to <note place="margin">14. Decemb.</note> proſecute the <hi>Iriſh</hi> affairs; and perceiving them conſidering about preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Souldiers, with a check at his Prerogative, He deſires that the bounds of his ancient and undoubted Authority, might not then fall into debate; however, that it may paſs with a <hi>Salvo jure,</hi> he is willing, rather then ſuch diſputes ſhould take up time in ſuch an hour of extreamity; for whileſt the Graſs groweth, the Horſe may ſterve. Upon this they clamour againſt his Majeſties dealings, profeſſing the Priviledges of Parliament were broken, by theſe his Exceptions; for which they demand ſatisfaction, and earneſtly deſire his Majeſty, not only to declare the names of, but alſo to deliver up to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe perſons, who had given ſuch counſel. Nor was this mode of dealing one of their leaſt Plots, upon all occaſions deſiring the King to betray his faithful Counſellors; by that means, not only to leave him naked, but to the diſcretion of the Houſes.</p>
                     <p>But theſe things carryed no great ſhew of unhandſomneſs, (though like the Apples of <hi>Sodem,</hi> beautiful without, yet ſtuft with filthineſs), in reſpect of their after Thunder-claps, which, like <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſhew'd their malice in their fronts. For the next day after their Petition, <note place="margin">15.

They out-braid him for putting forth <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, ſcandalous, falſe,</hi> and <hi>impudent</hi> Declarations; in it they highly commend the Schiſmatical Non-conformiſts, blaming the King for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61643:48"/>
puniſhing them; Nor is this all, but the <hi>Scotch</hi> Invaſion of <hi>England</hi> too is extoll'd and defended, and the King ſcandalized, as if he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to root out the true Religion, and bring in Popery; nor are they ſilent againſt the Biſhops and their Orthodox Divines, (by which it is plain, the Presbyterian ruled the Parliament); nor muſt the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies, and, forſooth, Superſtition eſcape a ſcouring; And yet, in this very ſame <hi>Hoch ende mogende-</hi>Paper, they confeſs they <hi>muſt acknowledge that his Majeſty hath paſſed more good Bills to the advantage of the Subjects, then have been in many ages.</hi> Yet for all theſe good <note place="margin">Ex.

The Heathen <hi>Heraclians</hi> were more noble to <note place="margin">Juſtin. <hi>lib.</hi> 16. Plin. <hi>Hiſt. Nat.</hi> lib. 8. cap. 16. A.

                     <p>Yet never was there any who deſired Peace and the Subjects good more than He, for the obtaining of which, he conſented to them in ſuch things, that he parted with many <hi>Jewels</hi> from his Crown [as Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> uſed to call ſuch Priviledges] granting them Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, aboliſhing the Star-Chamber, High-Commiſſion-Court, Writs for Ship-Money, Biſhops-Votes in Parliament, Temporal power of the Clergy, ſlip'd away Tunnage &amp; Poundage, and gave the Parliament leave to ſit as long as they pleas'd; and, that they might ſee, he privately acted nothing againſt them, he admitted into his Privy-Council, ſeveral Lords, which were great Favourites and Correſpondents with the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Party; and in many other things, beſides theſe, hath this King valed <note place="margin">Obſervar. on Hiſt. K. <hi>Ch.</hi> pag. 29, 30, 31.</note> his Crown, as a Learned Doctor phraſeth it. Yet could not all this pleaſe ſome men, being like the Sea, inſatiable. Though a moderate Member of the Parliament asked what they could deſire more of the King, ſeeing he had granted them ſo much, he was anſwered by Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> (as a <note place="margin">

                     <p>One of their firſt ſteps was to make the Court and Church odious <note place="margin">I.</note> amongſt the Vulgar, under the Title of <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Arminians;</hi> a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs quite contrary to the Laws of our Land, which make ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion <note place="margin">3 Edw. 1. 33. 2 Rich. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 33. 12 Rich. 2. <hi>c. a</hi> 1.</note> againſt the publiſhers of ſuch rumours, whereby diſcord, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſcord or ſlander, may ariſe between the King and his People, or the Nobility or Biſhops; yet neither Law nor Goſpel can have any any ſway with theſe men, who had uſed this knack of reviling in ſeveral former Parliaments, and may be ſeen in the multitude of their long-winded Speeches, and printed too forſooth, the better to ſpread the Infection about the Nation; yet you may take all the Reaſon amongſt them, and never grow madd with too much Learning; though the multitude of words are enough to choak the largeſt Leviathan: nor could much be expected, many of the Members being ſo ignorant, that I dare boldly ſay, that they did not know what the five Controverted Points ſignified, and I believe would have taken, and voted too <hi>Jacob van Harmine,</hi> and the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> for <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> though have damn'd <hi>Arminius</hi> for a wicked Heathen. Thus the Prieſts in <hi>Spain</hi> told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (to make them hate the Reformed Religion) that Proteſtants were not like other men, had heads like Dogs and ſuch like Beaſts.</p>

                     <p>And to make their Cauſe more favourable to the People, and to <note place="margin">III.</note> blaſt the Reputation of their Enemies, they promoted abundance of bawling Lecturers, moſt of them of no great Learning or Conſcience, but as furious as <hi>Orlando,</hi> and with throats, O heavenly wide! who could ſcold excellently againſt Biſhops and Government, and vomit out a Leſſon with as much eaſe, as a Matron of <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> both being

compos'd of the ſame materials, and to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrife, and for their dexterity and quickneſs they out-did a Mountebank; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes as ready for the Pulpit, as a Knight-Errant for combate, never out of his way, let the Text be what it will; like the <hi>Sompners Fryer</hi> in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> (but nothing related to the honeſt Parſon in the ſame Poet) that it is beyond admiration, how they can conjure ſuch an <hi>Olla Podrida</hi> of Sermon-Notes from ſuch good Texts, and that of ſo little coherence, that their extraction ſeems as miraculous, as the generation of the <hi>Cadmian</hi> armed Souldiers from Serpents teeth.</p>

                     <p>As for the Antiquity of Lecturers, if looked into, it will be found to be but upſtart, to witt, in the latter end of Queen. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and this faſhion too ſtoln from <hi>Geneva,</hi> and here introduced by thoſe who had no Authority, unleſs you allow <hi>Trevers</hi> and his companions to have the ſway of the <hi>Engliſh Church.</hi> And what law they have for their vindicarion I know not, unleſſe they plead an Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <note place="margin">22 Feb. 1640.</note> whereby any Miniſter was permitted to uſe weekly Lectures in his own Church; But whether any ſuch Authority was intruſted with the Commons, or, if it were, whether this permitted them to thump in other peoples Pulpits, lyeth out of my ſtudy; though a novice in Law is able to ſatisfie any man in this: Yet were many of theſe <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ex Coll. p. 526, 527.</note> though never in <hi>orders</hi> recommended, cheriſh'd, and held up in their bold and ſeditious railing againſt the Church, Book of common Prayer, and the King and his Government, and licence publickly given to their Pamphlets; whereby many of the people were drawn to take part againſt their King; <hi>For they having the ſway or'e the Conſcience which is the rudder that ſteers the astions, words, and thoughts of the rational Creature, they tranſport and ſnatch it away whither they will; making the beaſt with many heads, conceive according to the colour of thoſe rods they uſe to caſt before them,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Howell</hi> very ingeniouſly <note place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. pag. 128.</note> ſaith.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61643:50"/>
by theſe thunderers, experience hath ſadly told us. Nor in plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, is there any ſuch need of theſe <hi>Lecturers,</hi> as is pretended to by our Non-conformiſts; for, conſider our Sunday-ſermons with thoſe upon our Feſtivals, with the appointed and accidental Faſts, and Thanks-giving ones, and I am confident, there will be as many in a year as are either well made uſe of, or well preached.</p>
                     <p>Another mode they had, to drive on their deſignes of altering the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> confirm'd by ſo many wholſome Laws, was to get the Lords and Commons jumbled together into one houſe; for which purpoſe they put ſeveral agitators to draw up a Petition againſt <note place="margin">Ex Coll. <hi>p.</hi> 547. 548.</note> a malignant faction, and that the Peers who were agreeable to them would remove, and ſit, and vote with the Commons, profeſſing unleſs ſome ſpeedy remedy were taken for their ſatisfaction, they would lay hold on the next remedy that was at hand, and not to leave any means for their relief; and that thoſe who agreed not to them, might be publickly declared and removed. And this worſhipful petition was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly framed, and by the Commons preſented to the Lords. This extravagant paper, was preſented with the like words of a Commoner the ſame day, that thoſe Lords who would concurr with the Commons about the <hi>Militia</hi> would make themſelves known, that the diſſenting Peers might be made known to the Commons; Theſe threats I ſay, as a Royall pen informes us, did ſo aſtoniſh many of the Lords, that ſo many of them with indignation departed that the vote againſt the Kings <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> paſſed, though it had ſeverall times been denied before. And by ſuch like unhandſome jugling tricks as this, were the reſt of their deſigns pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. And that they really had an intent to have but one Houſe, by making the Lords ſit with them, a Dr. well-ſkilld in theſe times, aſſures <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſervat.</hi> on the Hiſt. K. <hi>Ch.</hi> p. 61.</note> us out of Sr. <hi>Edward Deering's</hi> Speeches; and beſides this, that the King himſelf ſhould be but as one of the Lords, and then their work was done.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the Presbyrerian faction had other waies to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Lords and Maiſters; eſpecially one, without which the reſt though obtain'd would not reliſh well with them. And this it was, they having oft heard from King <hi>James,</hi> and he learnt it by good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>No Biſhop, no King,</hi> caſt about how to ruine the firſt, and then the latter they thought (as it fell out accordingly afterwards) would fall to their obedience with the more eaſe.</p>
                     <p>To bring this great thing about, all their art was imployed. But the chief of all, was their old true friend and ſouldier <hi>Calumny;</hi> by this to make the orthodox epiſcopal party odious to the people, a way which <hi>Contzenus</hi> the Jeſuite looks upon as ſo excellent, that it is very fitting it ſhould be endeavour'd. And in this trade of vilifying, our Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts <note place="margin">Polit. lib. 2. cap. 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</note> were ſo expert and ſedulous, that in a ſhort while they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable lying pamphlets and reports ſpread about the Nation, that in the firſt year or two of this Long Parliament, the hearers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, with the relatours of theſe ſlaunders, were ſo many, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with that care and celerity, that Dame <hi>Report</hi> in <hi>England</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vapour'd Queen <hi>Fame</hi> in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> who</p>

                        <hi>For as much as divers queſtions by overmuch boldneſſe of ſpeech and talk amongſt many of the common ſort of people, being unlearned, have lately grown upon the making and conſecrating of</hi> Archbiſhops <hi>and</hi> Biſhops <hi>within this Realm, whether the ſame were and be orderly done according to the Law or not, which is much tending to the ſlaunder of all the ſtate of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>being one of the greateſt ſtates of this Realm, &amp;c.</hi> Yet let the Laws ſay what they will, theſe men will oppoſe, and that in Ritaing waies, rather then not get their end, above 2000. of this facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">October 22. 1640.</note> making a tumult in <hi>London,</hi> crying out, <hi>they would have no</hi> Biſhop <hi>nor no high Commiſsion,</hi> a bad omen to the peace of the Kingdom, but a great incouragement to the Long Parliament, who firſt ſat within a fortnight after this hurry: And had preſently a ſympathizing Petition brought them by Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> loaden with the ſcrawling <note place="margin">December 11. 1640.</note> hands of 15000 <hi>Londoners,</hi> and this forſooth againſt <hi>Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and our Church-ceremonies, though I believe, if none had been ſubſcribers but thoſe who underſtood what they ſet their hands to, that neither the Alderman, nor 15000 of the reſt, had liſted their faith and themſelves in that paper, which the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> call'd very well <hi>contemptible, irrational,</hi> and <hi>preſumptious.</hi> Yet did the Presbyterian fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Parliament joy themſelves thus to have brought that great City to the ſubjection and reverence of their new found Diſciplinarian ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and perceiving themſelves thus back'd by ſuch riches and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, went boldly on to pull down our Reverend Church, and ſet up their golden calves in its ſtead. And all this pains, hurly-burly, <note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in</hi> Cal. cap. 46.</note> alarums, and warre, muſt only be, like <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Army, to fight for empty cochle-ſhels, in reſpect of the truth, glory, and ſincerity, ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Engliſh Church.</p>
                     <p>The firſt imployment of note againſt the Church, that the Commons put themſelves upon, was againſt the <hi>Convocation,</hi> contemporary with the ſhort Parliament, which they condemned as ſeditious, dangerous againſt King, Law, &amp; Subject, though the King acknowledged no ſuch thing, and <note place="margin">December. 16, 1640.</note> one of their main reaſons againſt this Convocation, was becauſe the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy therein aſſembled] perceiving how the <hi>Scots</hi> did covenant and ſwear againſt our Church-government, and that our Engliſh Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts were grown ſtrong, and not only correſponded with the <hi>Scots,</hi> but tended the ſame way, which would ruine our Church at laſt, as experience proved] did frame an Oath for the maintaining of our Church-Government, againſt all Popery, and its Superſtition.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61643:51"/>
And this was called the Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the words following this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, <hi>as it ſtands now eſtabliſhed,</hi> makes not the Oath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as our Presbytery clamoured. Againſt this Oath the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ranted, affirming the Clergy, though aſſembled by the King's command, had no power to make an Oath: the which whether they had or no, I ſhall not now diſpute. Only I ſhall have leave to think, that every one thinks the beſt of themſelves: And ſo, I ſuppoſe, did the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when they framed the <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and ordered all in their own <note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 3. &amp; 4. 1641.</note> Houſe, to take it; and did alſo recommend it to be taken all <hi>England</hi> over, though the King did never conſent to it, nor as then had the Lords; and whether the Commons by themſelves, have power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Oath, I ſhall not determine, though report ſpeaks the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And as for the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> it ſelf, 'tis compoſed of ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain jugling materials, (conſidering the Presbyterian Notion which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it) that a true underſtanding Conſcience would never embrace it; for theſe following rational Doubts, waving the diſpute of the Impoſers authority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to maintain—with my life—the true, reformed, Proteſtant Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt all Popery, and Popiſh Innovations within this Realm.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dub.</hi> 1. What the Presbyterian Impoſers and Framers here mean, by the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England? If the Thirty nine Articles, why do they not ſubſcribe them? if any thing elſe, why do they not mention it, that men might know what they ſwear?</p>

                        <hi>Dub.</hi> 2. What they mean by <hi>Popery?</hi> If their Articles; in what ſenſe they meant the Points held againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> by ſome learned men of our Church and <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dub.</hi> 3. What they meant by <hi>Popiſh Innovations within this Realm?</hi> for their Writings affirm our Church-government by Biſhops, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Ceremonies, to be ſo: The which if they meant, then none but Schiſmaticks would take it; if otherwiſe, why did they not explain themſelves, that people might not ſwear ignorantly.—<hi>As alſo the power and priviledges of Parliament, The lawful Rights and Liberty of Subject,—and ſhall never relinquiſh this Promiſe, Vow, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dub.</hi> 4. What are the power, priviledges of Parliament, and Rights and Liberty of Subject? As for the Parliamentary priviledges, they themſelves never yet undertook to declare what they are: And for men to ſwear to defend they know not what, is not unlike that Meſſenger, who ſwore to obſerve his Maſters Inſtructions in his ſealed Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which when he had opened, he found no command but to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dub.</hi> 5. Whether it is lawful to ſwear <hi>never to relinquiſh this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi> though the King and State ſhould afterwards have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to revoke, or alter all, or any clauſe, in the ſaid Proteſtation? as none can queſtion their Authority in ſuch things.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61643:51"/>
And then eight dayes after, was a piece of paper, as if dropping <note place="margin">May 12.</note> from its Poſteriors, joyned to the rump of this Proteſtation; wherein was declared, that nothing in this Oath was <hi>to be extended to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of any form of worſhip, diſcipline or government, nor of any rites or ceremonies of the ſaid Church of</hi> England. By which, the <hi>Haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt</hi> of Presbyterie, is eaſily perceived to be there domineering; and 'tis the humour of theſe men, to love that in themſelves, what they hated in others:<note place="margin">Decemb. 30. 1641.</note> Witneſs their accuſing the Biſhops of Treaſon,<note place="margin">Decemb. 27.</note> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their proteſtation againſt the others proceedings, ſeeing they were kept out by violence and tumults: And yet when it was, after, the Commons caſe, the Army expelling them, they alſo put in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation <note place="margin">Decemb. 6. 1648.</note> to the ſame purpoſe: Thus are men oft paid in their own coin.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Convocation, which, I ſuppoſe, had as much lawful Power, as a Presbyterian Aſſembly; and, I am confident, have uſed it with more diſcretion. In what little eſteem, the <hi>Kirkers of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had the civil Authority, their own Hiſtories will tell you: and in the Scotch troubles, [before our late Wars], it appears by their own <note place="margin">True Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pag. 10. 13, 14.</note> Commiſſioners, as if it were the <hi>Kirk's</hi> right, to determine all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical affairs by their Aſſemblies. And it is the opinion of our Engliſh Non-conformiſts, declared in their <hi>Book of Diſcipline,</hi> [in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                     <p>The Houſe of Commons having thus voted againſt the <hi>Convocation,</hi> made it a Coy-duck to draw in the reſt of their deſigns. And in the firſt place, they fall heavy upon the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as a promoter of the former <hi>Canons,</hi> and ſo accuſe him of <hi>high-Treaſon;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Decemb. 18. 1640.</note> though as then they had laid no Articles againſt him, but promiſed to do it, to the Lords, upon which he was ſecured; and the third day after, was fined five hundred pounds, which he was forced to borrow, <note place="margin">Decemb. 21.</note> and to ſell plate to repay it: ſuch a liberal Benefactor was he to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning, that he left himſelf nothing; and if the ſevere ſtroke of injuſtice, had not untimely ſequeſtrated and cut him off, Saint <hi>Paul's Cathedral</hi> had ſilenced the fame of the ancient wonders: our <hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> had been the glory of the World; the <hi>Bodleian</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had daily more and more out-ſtript the <hi>Vatican;</hi> and his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Structures had ore'topt the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> and all this by his own muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence; in which, he ſo far excelled his neighbours, that he was not unlike the good Emperor, <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> whoſe liberal ſoul made <note place="margin">Sueton. 8.</note> him think that he had loſt that day, in which, he had not given ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>The next day that they accuſed the Arch-biſhop, they alſo accuſed Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> of the ſame crime. And a little after, voted highly againſt <note place="margin">Decemb. 19.</note> the Learned and Reverend [as the French Churches beyond ſea, can teſtifie]<note place="margin"> Jan. 23. 16¼</note> Dr. <hi>Couſins;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">March 4.</note> and the next day, receive Petitions againſt Dr. <note place="margin"> Jan. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Duck,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lamb.</hi> And a week after, received a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61643:52"/>
pretended to be loaden with ſeven hundred Miniſters hands againſt Biſhops; the which if true, yet that number bears no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Jan. 31.</note> with above nine thouſand, which were the number of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy: and however it was, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf did declare, that very day, that the Houſe of Comons had nothing to do with Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in that nature: And reaſon tels us, that it is not only hard but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that men ſhould be accuſed for acting according to the known Laws of the Land, they not being as then repealed.</p>
                     <p>But what care the Commons for this? ſeeing they are reſolved, come what will of it, to have Sir <hi>Jack</hi> Presbyter to bear the ſway; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall heavy upon Epiſcopal government, and after a whole <note place="margin">Feb. 7. March 7, 9, 10. April. 2. May 19, 24, 27. June, 3. 4, 7, 12.</note> day's debate, the Majority againſt both Law and Reaſon, did agree to take away Lordly Prelacy, their medling with temporal affairs, their juriſdictions and Courts, and a great part of their Means and Eſtates; and afterwards inlarged upon theſe things. And that the Country might not be ignorant alſo of their enmity to Church government, they therefore appoint Commiſſioners to go into all places of the Kingdom, <note place="margin">Febr. 11.</note> and there remove all Altars, Images, and Rayls about the Communion-table, and ſell them, and puniſh thoſe who ſhall endeavour to ſet them up again. Nor was this all, but they alſo queſtion Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Febr. 21. March 4.</note> and Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> for getting Organs repair'd, and ſetting up ſome new Organs in Churches. Though I do not know againſt what Law theſe two Gentlemen had offended; though I know againſt what, the latter did afterwards.</p>
                     <p>And having gon thus far, away they in a fury hurry Arch biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">March 1.</note> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> whither he was followed and rail'd at by the (then) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant rabble of the Anti-church-government Puppies. And ſome few dayes after, they appointed a (forſooth) Committee for Religion, of ten Earls, ten Biſhops, and ten Barons; by which means, the Lay-votes <note place="margin">March. 21.</note> were not only double to the Clergy, but, in fine, none of the latter left; they knowing now their own intentions and power ſo far, that they were more then confident, to have the Clergy-men in ſhort time to be but as Ciphers.</p>
                     <p>To obtain which, they endeavoured all ways that malice or induſtry could propoſe to them: And as a means to encourage others to oppoſe Biſhops and Church-government, they not only releaſed the ſcribling <note place="margin">April 20, 21.</note> fire-brands of the Nation, as <hi>Burton, Prynn, Leighton, Lilburn,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo as a reward for their good ſervice, voted them many thouſand pounds a piece; And the next week fined the Members of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">April. 27.</note> houſe, two hundred thouſand pounds. And afterwards voted that not only the Biſhops, but all other Clergy-men, that did either ſend their Proxies, or execute the ſaid Canons, were guilty. <note place="margin">Auguſt 4.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Lords have a Religious Committee, the Commons muſt have one too, or elſe they think themſelves out-vapoured. And ſo they jumble up a Company of Miniſters together, giving them autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to conſult the Canons and Liturgy, and alſo to draw up a plat-form <note place="margin">May 5.</note> or model for Reformation, to be ſetled in the Kingdom: and by what
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61643:52"/>
rule theſe men were to work, is no difficult buſineſs to collect, from the Commons Votes ſome few dayes after, that it was neceſſary to have <note place="margin">17. May.</note> an Uniformity of Religion with <hi>Scotland:</hi> as alſo from their kindneſs to the Armed Covenanters, not long before, by Voting for them 300000 pounds, with the goodly title of <hi>Brethren.</hi> And all this, becauſe they <note place="margin">2. February.</note> march'd into <hi>England,</hi> with a numerous Army, proteſting, ſwearing, and fighting againſt Epiſcopal Government; for, that was the thing now alſo aimed at in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> ſpeaks the hearts of others as well as his own, when he reproved one of the Lords, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That it was not enough to be againſt the Perſons of the Biſhops, if he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ex. Coll. <hi>p.</hi> 521.</note> 
                        <hi>were not againſt the Function.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And according to this Maxim, the Commons by their former Votes, having made the way more facile, boldly Vote the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">11. June.</note> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Chancellors, Deans, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp;c. to be prejudicial to both Church and State; and the next day Voted alſo, that from that time there ſhould be no <note place="margin">12. June.</note> ſuch things as <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>England.</hi> Nor was this all, but preſently after, they alſo expunged all <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">15. June.</note> &amp;c. So that, in four dayes time, the haſty Commons over-throw, as much as in them lay, the Reverend Church of <hi>England;</hi> which had continued many hundreds of years a flouriſhing glory to the Nation.</p>
                     <p>The Commons, for their parts, having thus pull'd down the pale of our Church, faſtned and ſtrengthened by ſo many Authentick and Fundamental Laws, as old again as the Houſe of Commons, will not leave Religion without ſome Government. No, good ſouls! they were more kind-hearted. And therefore in the firſt place, they Vote, that all the Lands and Means belonging to <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters, Chancellors,</hi> or <note place="margin">15. June.</note> 
                        <hi>Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, Deans, Prebendaries, Chapter, Canon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be taken away and diſpoſed of to the advancement of Learning and Piety.</hi> That is, (if their after-actions may be taken for Expoſitors) to maintain Rebellion, Hereſie, Sacriledge, and ruine Univerſities; for theſe mens promiſes, like <hi>Hebrew,</hi> muſt ſtill be read backwards: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rule, did they ſend a requeſt to the King by Secretary <hi>Vain, That</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">16. Decemb. 1640.</note> 
                        <hi>he would give them leave to look into his Revenues and Expences, and they would make him the richeſt King in Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Parliament will not ſpend their time only in ſelling Lands, but ſomething muſt be conſidered of a Church-Government too; and, therefore they Vote, that all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> fit to be <note place="margin">12. June. 1641.</note> exerciſed in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall be committed to ſuch a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in ſuch a manner, as their Worſhips ſhall think fit. Nor were they long without making the Nation happy with the diſcovery of their Intellectuals, which was, <hi>That ſix of the Clergy, and ſix of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">21. June.</note> 
                        <hi>the Laity, ſhould be appointed in every County for the ſetling of Church-Government.</hi> But, this was a little ſhaken by an after concluſion, <hi>viz. That nine of the Laity, and three of the Clergy, in every Dioceſs, ſhould</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">9. July.</note> 
                        <hi>have power to exerciſe all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, as ſhall be ordered
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61643:53"/>
by Parliament; and to have their Monethly meetings for that purpoſe.</hi> And the next day, to make this hotch-potch Model more compleat, they Vote, <hi>That there ſhall be ſeveral ſelect Committees of the Clergy,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">10. July.</note> 
                        <hi>appointed for the Ordination of Clergy-men into the Miniſtry.</hi> But, yet this Presbyterian Brat would not come to perfection: And, therefore to give more encouragement to the Covenanting-admirers, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That all Archiepiſcopal and Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">15. July.</note> 
                        <hi>in this Kingdom by the Commiſsioners, as there was by Biſhops.</hi> And the ſame day read the Bill for the uſing of <hi>Lectures,</hi> taking away <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm, Surplis, bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>Jeſus, ſtanding</hi> up at the <hi>Goſpel, Gloria Patri, Pictures</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> &amp;c. and conclude the day with the appointing of a <hi>Committee for the Propagation of the Goſpel.</hi> And the next day they give further power to their nine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to wit, <hi>That after the firſt</hi> of Auguſt, <hi>any five of them ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">16. July.</note> 
                        <hi>be a Quorum, and have full power to try all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, and to appoint Deputies under them in ſeveral places.</hi> And after this, they further agreed, That, if any of the nine Commiſſioners ſhould dye, <note place="margin">17. July.</note> that five, or more of them, are to chooſe another preſently, and ſo if any of them reſign; and, that if any came to take Orders, that theſe Commiſſioners ſhall appoint five Clergy men to grant Ordinations. And, for the more ſpeedy putting of this medly in practiſe, the Knights <note place="margin">31. July.</note> and Burgeſſes of every Shire are commanded, to bring in the Names of the nine Commiſſioners for their ſeveral Counties to be appointed, and that no Clergy-man be of the Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus farr had the Commons thrown (I cannot ſay built) up this their confuſed <hi>Babylon:</hi> when on a ſodain, an unexpected <hi>Remora</hi> was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their further proceedings, by ſome fallings out betwixt the Lords and them about the <hi>Proteſtation.</hi> For the Commons, having ordered, <note place="margin">30. July.</note> that it ſhould be taken all over the Kingdom, were in this oppoſed by the Peers, who threw it out of their Houſe; which ſo incenſed the Commons, that they preſently Vote, That <hi>what perſon ſoever ſhall not take the Proteſtation, is unfit to bear Office in Church or Common-wealth.</hi> And thinking that the Biſhops were the reaſon of the Lords diſſent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Committee for impeaching them about the late Canons, who accordingly Voted thirteen Biſhops to be Delinquents, whom the <note place="margin">3, 4. Auguſt. 17. Aug.</note> Lords alſo ſuſpended their houſe, till a further hearing. And ſo violently were theſe good men perſecuted by the Presbyters, that they never left plotting, till they had got them Voted Traytors, and ſent to the <note place="margin">30. Decemb.</note> Tower. Nor could they have any outward content any where, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the reproaches, threats, and curſes daily thrown againſt them by the wicked, the danger of their lives by Tumults, and their Lands Voted from them long before by their, and Religions Enemies, the <note place="margin">9. July. 10. July.</note> Non-conforming Commons: though they agreed to allow them <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral allowance during life;</hi> and how unhandſomly the Parliament in this neglected this promiſe, the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> will ſatisfie <note place="margin">Remains.</note> you.</p>
                     <p>The Commons now having, as they thought, bridled the Biſhops and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61643:53"/>
their Party, are reſolved to root out the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> too: to <note place="margin">1. Septemb.</note> which purpoſe, ſome of them deſire, that it might be altered, and ſome thing added to it; the which, after ſome ſpeeches, being put to the Vote, it appear'd, that there were then but 55. Diſciplinarians in the Houſe, no more voting for Alterations, ſo, that the Book came off with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; the Orthodox Party knowing well enough, that, if that Houſe once fell to alter it, (it rather belonging to able and lawful Divines), they would equal the Tinker, who made two holes for mending one. The Anti-Epiſcopalians being thus baffled, fall to it again, getting it to be moved again in the Houſe the next week, where they came off <note place="margin">6. Septemb.</note> with the like ſucceſs. And the next day, (being a Thanks-giving day for the Peace between the two Nations), to ſhew their malice to Church-Government, and countenance the Schiſmaticks; the Commons would not go to St. <hi>Margarets Weſtminſter,</hi> as was by them appointed, <note place="margin">7. Septemb.</note> becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> had caus'd a ſet Form of Prayer for that occaſion to be printed and uſed in the Church; the news of which, ſo ſtarted their Worſhips, that they turn'd tail, and went to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Lincolns Inne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, if the Commons were troubled at this, they were after out of their wits, and all ſtark-madd againſt the Lords: Becauſe they had <note place="margin">9. Septemb.</note> put forth an Order, and ſent it all over the Nation, ſtrictly injoyning the reading of the <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> againſt which, and many other Church-affairs, the Commons the ſame day put forth a Declaration, ordering it to be printed and ſent over the Kingdom; and with them they alſo got the nine diſſenting Lords, to proteſt againſt the Order made by the Houſe of Peers. This croſs-graind action of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſo incenſed the Lords, that they left off ſitting for a while, cauſing the Hangings of their Houſe to be taken down: Nor did this any way vex the Commons, who neither cared for them nor their ſitting, nor any elſe, that would not dance after them and <hi>Geneva:</hi> For they are reſolved for Jack Presbyter, and therefore being informed, that the <note place="margin">28. Sepeemb.</note> Lords Order for the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> had been read in Churches, and not their Declaration; they drew up an Order and ſent it to be printed, enjoyning, that their aforeſaid Declaration ſhould be read in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>And ſo ſevere were they in this point, that they put Dr. <hi>Haywood</hi> of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> to ſome trouble, for not permitting their Order to be read, though he had not only his own Conſcience, and the Lords Order, but the Law of the Land to teſtifie his juſtneſs: And, what more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, then to aſtoniſh the people into diſcontents and ſidings, by reading to them, at the ſame time, two contrary Orders; and that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being quite againſt the Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>Thus did the Commons batter down Religion, as <hi>Captain Jones</hi> in the Poet, did the Jeſuites; more, by ſtrong hand then reaſon: yet had they left one thing undone, which was the extirpation of Epiſcopacy root and branch; to bring which villany about, they Voted them to have no place in the Houſe of Lords, nor to meddle with any ſecular affairs. <note place="margin">23. Octob.</note>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61643:54"/>
But here, before they went any further, they were ſomewhat troubled at the King, becauſe he (being then in <hi>Scotland),</hi> had ſent Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Orders to draw up five <hi>Congé d'Eſlire's,</hi> for five new Biſhops, there being then ſo many Sees vacant; but in this ſtrait, Mr. <hi>Stroud</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">26. Octob.</note> thinks it fitting to Petition the King, to ſtop theſe five, till they had diſpacht the charge againſt the other Biſhops. Yet, what need they care, whether the King make Biſhops or no? ſince they are reſolved never to acknowledge them to be ſo; for, they can with the ſame eaſe cut off all, as one: Therefore, ſeeing the King for Biſhops, they bend themſelves more reſolutely againſt them, and ſo prepare their charge againſt thoſe formerly accuſed; and, for the Champions to mannage this Combate, <hi>Pymme</hi> and <hi>St,-Johns</hi> by the commendations of <note place="margin">27. Octob.</note> one another, are choſen. The death of the firſt is noys'd by report, and the honeſty of the latter is not unknown to any.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament was ſomething ſtopt in their proceedings againſt Biſhops, by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; yet, having taken ſome breath, they ſent a meſſage to the Lords, deſiring, that the 13. Biſhops, might <note place="margin">6. Decemb.</note> ſpeedily come to anſwer. And not long after, as an incouragement to the factious, they releaſed <hi>Simmonds</hi> a Printer, who had been in <note place="margin">20. Decemb.</note> cuſtody for printing a Book againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> yet the very ſame day was <hi>Walker</hi> the <hi>Iremonger</hi> impriſoned, only for Printing a Book concerning Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> though the firſt deſerved as much hanging as the latter Impriſonment; and from theſe men, the Biſhops might well expect good juſtice. But ſtill they ſit and Vote in the Houſe of Lords; which vext the Sectaries to the guts, becauſe they could not tell how to get them out handſomly, for they had no great confidence in their Articles of <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> and whileſt they Voted there, the Orthodox Party would ſtill exceed. At laſt, ſome ill ſpirit or other, put it into the noddles, of <hi>Iſaac Pennington, Captain Ven,</hi> and ſuch combuſtible humours, to raiſe ſuch tumults againſt the Reverend Fathers, the fear whereof ſhould either keep them from the Houſe, or bring ſome ruine ſacrilegiouſly to be acted upon them. And accordingly up cometh the Rabble of <hi>London</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note place="margin">27. Decemb.</note> Houſe, crying out <hi>No Biſhops, no Biſhops!</hi> And at laſt got the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (then going to the Houſe with the Earl of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver),</hi> into the midſt of them, where they had like to have ſqueez'd him to death. And having thus begun, many hundreds of them come again the ſame day, with Swords and Staves, cauſing great uproars both in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> not only to the affrightment of the Biſhops, but the King and Queen; and the next day alſo aſſaulted <hi>Weſtminſter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Theſe Tumults obtain'd the end of their Contrivers, keeping the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops from the Houſe, pelting of them with ſtones as they endeavoured to go. By which, they drew up a Petition to the King, how that the Tumults kept them out, and therefore proteſted againſt all things, that ſhould be done in the Houſe of Peers in time of their thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſecluſion. Which did trouble the Parliament ſo much, that one Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> of the Commons Houſe, thought he had ſpoke bravely, <note place="margin">30. Decemb.</note>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61643:54"/>
when he moved that the Biſhops might be ſent to <hi>Bedlam:</hi> But <hi>Glyn</hi> and others were cleerly for High Treaſon, which accordingly was done, and ten of them ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> and two to the Black Rod. And thus their buſineſſe being don, the great tumults ceaſ'd, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians ſang <hi>Victoria,</hi> whilſt the reverend Church of England lay in the duſt, miſerably trod upon by a Schiſmatical zeal; yet had they they nothing to accuſe the Biſhops of, and ſo were forced to releaſe them all but two: againſt one of which they could ſay nothing (for if they could they would) and whether the cry of the others bloud be yet ſtopt I know not.</p>
                     <p>How were the Country cheated with ſwarms of Petitions againſt this Eccleſiaſtical Order, yet in this, none more ridiculous then the <note place="margin">31 Jan. 1641/2</note> Londoners. One troup of Tradeſmen petition againſt Biſhops, and their reaſon was becauſe their being, was the decay of trading; and in the clauſe of all gave a notable laſh at the Houſe of Lords. Nor is this all, but the very Porters [15000 ſaid to be in number] Petition too; and affirm that they cannot indure the weight of Epiſcopacy any <note place="margin">2 Feb.</note> longer, and therefore muſt have redreſs. Nay the very women, by the puſhing on of their hot-headed aſſociates, thought themſelves ſo much concerned in theſe Church-affairs, that they muſt petition too.

                     <p>For though the Commons, as aboveſaid, had a great while agoe, voted the Biſhops to have no Votes in the Lords Houſe, yet the Peers would never conſent to it till they were not only threatned by Petitions, but unheard-of Tumults.

                     <p>Yet if it had been only the ſottiſh multitude who had thrown durt in the face of Epiſcopacy, their ignorance had been ſome pardon for their malice; But when men that pretend to great learning do join with the rabble in their revilings, I may have ſome cauſe to think that their unbounded malice led them to act either contrary to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or learning.</p>

                     <p>Theſe actions by the Sectaries, were look'd upon, as a bleſſing to the Nation; and to keep the hands of theſe Myrmidons in uſe, the City and Kingdom muſt now and anon too, be alarum'd with falſe rumours, and un-heard of plots and deſigns againſt ſomething or other.

                     <p>Theſe jugling Tranſactions were enough to perſwade the King and his friends to look about them; but being innocent, ſeemed alſo fearleſs. Yet for prevention of diſorders and tumults, ſome people were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to keep watch near the Parliament, thereby to keep off the Rabble, which uſed daily to tumble out by thouſands in great diſorder, ranting and railing againſt ſomething or other in government, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Items</hi> of their Patrons, very beneficial to, and deſirable by the Commons. Who took it ſo ill, that their good friends, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſhould thus be kept back, that they did not only queſtion the Juſtices of peace of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> who by Order, had commanded thoſe men to keep watch, but ſent one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtice <hi>Long,</hi> to the <note place="margin">12.

                     <p>This favour of the Commons, ſo animated the people, that they thought ſedition was then lawful, and thoſe tumults a glory to the City, becauſe they ſhewed its ſtrength. And therefore many thouſands of them, run crowding to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> crying out, <hi>No Biſhops, no Biſhops:</hi> and having thus ranted it in the morning, they come again in <note place="margin">27.

                     <p>Such is the malice of Presbytery againſt Biſhops, as if they were all inſpired with the ſame ſpirit of venome and hatred, that he had, who long ago cryed out,

                           <l>Short red, God red, ſhea we the Byſhop, <note place="margin">Mat. Paris. <hi>Anno</hi> 1075. p. 10.</note>

                        </q>
And accordingly was the Biſhop with a hundred men murthered. And not inferiour to the former was he in <hi>London,</hi> when the Tumult was; railing againſt the Reverend and Learned Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> ſome crying, <hi>Pull him out of his Coach,</hi> others acting ſo violently, that the Biſhop <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi>'s life of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. <hi>p.</hi> 103.</note> believed he ſhould never have eſcaped alive, if a leading man amongſt the rabble had not cryed out, <hi>Let him go, and hang himſelf;</hi> words wicked enough, and vomitted with as much malice; though by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they ſaved the good Biſhop's life.</p>
                     <p>The chief men tamper'd withal by ſome of the factious Members, to ſtirr up theſe Tumults were, Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> and <hi>Venne,</hi> two King-Tryers, and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> nominated one of the Kings Judges, and other ſuch like Inſtruments they could not want; <hi>Venne</hi> pleading, to the people, That <hi>the worſer Party was like to have the better of the good Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and uſed to imploy his Wife as a Mercury, to run about and ſtir up the people. And it is an old Note, that Sectaries uſed in the firſt place to tamper with ſuch ſoft-hearted Creatures.</p>
                     <p>The truth on't is, the audaciouſneſs of theſe men was intolerable, being like one of their Predeceſſors <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> who is branded for a <note place="margin">Mat.

Yet had his Majeſty but ſtript himſelf of ſo much mercy, as to have eas'd the Nation of the Ring-leaders of theſe diſorders by ſome meritorious exemplary puniſhment, it may be, the reſt of the rabble would have learn'd better manners by the Precedent of ſuch an execution.

                     <p>The Tumults (of which his Sacred Majeſty gives the beſt chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <note place="margin">Cap. 4. &amp; 6.</note> in his incomparable Book), favour'd the Parliament with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold courteſie: one was, they forced him from <hi>London,</hi> there being no ſafety for his Royal Perſon, whilſt ſuch unbelieving miſcreants did domineer: The other was, they having learn'd the knack to cry Thief firſt, horribly exclaim'd, that themſelves were thereby only in danger, and therefore deſired not only a Guard to defend their Worſhips, (though they puniſh'd thoſe appointed to protect them), but very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to have the diſpoſal of the whole <hi>Militia</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And this claim, rather then deſire, of theirs, they call <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and for <note place="margin">Ex.

Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> would but command the whole World. Thus would <hi>Calvin,</hi> only have his Countrey-men, and Creatures, mingled with the <hi>Geneva</hi> Senate.

But an old Scotch Poet would have taught them better manners and diſcretion, if their wicked policy would have given them leiſure to have conſulted either Morality, or Divinity, but what is in the Covenant.</p>

                     <p>Yet for all theſe, and many more miſeries of Warr, the Parliament could not doubt of many partakers, ſince the Commons had made themſelves ſuch a Bug-bear and Terror to the Nation, that the power of the King was even ſhrunk into a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>

If the Lords, at firſt, refuſe

Goodly! goodly! hath not the Peers brought themſelves unto a fine paſs? But I believe they know beſt, whom they may thank for't. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the dapper Commons thought they might as well ſpurn at King and Lords, as the old Gyants fight againſt <hi>Jupiter:</hi> for I believe from <hi>Ovid</hi> they took a Scheme of many of their mutations. But theſe men wrought by action, as well as words and thoughts, which was a high token of the Commons ſtrength, who had ſo much influence amongſt the Sectaries (a word good enough for him, Lord or Clown, that takes exception at it) and power over the Lords, that they gott 9 of the <hi>Peers</hi> voted never to ſit again in Parliament, becauſe they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to his Majeſty, ſo that Mr. <hi>Pym's Item</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi>

                     <p>Thus have we come ſhort to our Anceſtors in fidelity, and Loyalty, by ſtudying all occaſions to rebell againſt our King: They rather then undergo the ignominions title of Nithing <hi>(i. e.</hi> a knave, or a night-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher) ſwarme to the Service of their King; we on the contrary, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Mat.

                     <p>And ſo to conclude this aſſertion, I ſhall tell you, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wanted all the qualifications to make a warre really eſpouſable. No warre being lawful unleſſe it be commanded by the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the which the Parliament was not, but the King, if the Laws of our Land be an authentick Standerd.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly the occaſion of the Warre muſt be juſt, which was wanting on the Parliaments ſide, all their ſpecious pretences being falſe and ridiculons, their reaſons ſuggeſted to the people to beget a Warre, being to as ſmall purpoſe as the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell for a cart-load of Sheep-skins; or the two Brethren neer <hi>Padua,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diſpoſal of the Starrs and Firmament. And ſuppoſe their jealouſies had been true, yet it was Treaſon in them to warre againſt the Supream Authority the King, according to the Laws of our Land, and damnable according to the word of God. [Let <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <note place="margin">De jure belli ap. Scotos.</note> ſuch as he, by ſuppoſing the Apoſtles and the Spirit, to deal with us, like Hypocrites, evince to the contrary]. For if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth the Chriſtians to be obedient to their Heathen and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Kings (who made it their ſport to perſecute Chriſtians) and <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2.</note> that for Conſcience-ſake, telling them that their power was of God; certainly, we are bound to obey a Chriſtian Prince, whoſe authority can be no leſſe.</p>

                     <p>The primitive Chriſtians when collected into great Armies were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for their obedience; never rebelling againſt, but fighting, or quietly living under, their Heathen Kings, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> will ſatisfie <note place="margin">Apologet.</note> more at large.

Thus the Army, when in obedience to the Parliament, it had conquer'd and ruin'd the King and Kingdome, and by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſword and Satan had made themſelves Lords and Maſters over their Betters, then I ſay when they were at the top of their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, they do ſeriouſly profeſſe that the Parliament, <hi>did juſtifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

                        <hi>extraordinary ſtrange (and doubtleſſe in reſpect of the letter of the Law) very illegal actions,</hi> viz. <hi>Their taking up Armes, raiſing and forming Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt the King, fighting againſt his perſon, impriſoning, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, arraigning, trying, and executing him, cutting off his Head, baniſhing his Children, aboliſhing Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters; took away Kingly Government and the Houſe of Lords, broke the Crowns, ſold the Jewels, Plate, Goods, Houſes, and Lands, belonging unto the Kings of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; erected extraordinary High Courts of Juſtice, and therein impeached, arraigned, condemned, and executed many notorious enemies to the publick peace, when the Laws in being, and the ordinary Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, could not reach them. Theſe were ſtrange and unknown practiſes in this Nation, and not at all juſtifiable (as is conceived) by any known Laws and Statutes.</hi> Thus have you the judgment of a ruling Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Maſters and themſelves, though this their repentance was but to vindicate another infidelity.</p>
                     <p>But here after all this, it may be objected; that though ſome facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits of the Parliament have been too incroaching upon the King and the chief Incendiaries of theſe Warres, yet why ſhould I lay all this upon the Presbyterian account? To which there needs no tedious reply, if we do but conſider that theſe factious people were all Non-conformiſts, from whom (if examples may be held for proofs) as Schiſmaticks, a ſelf-conceited, giddy, hot-headed zeal, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Rebellion, is as inſeparable, as pride from <hi>Menecrates,</hi> or Children when gallanted up in new cloathes. For my part, I am apt to believe that the Bloud of many thouſand Chriſtians ſhed in theſe warrs and before, cryeth loud againſt Presbytery, as the people only guilty of the firſt occaſion of quarrel. And that they have been the chief occaſion of other ſlaughters, may be credited not only from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign ſtories, but the authentick judgment of the ever great <hi>Grotius,</hi>

                     <p>AMongſt the Ancients, <hi>Proteus</hi> was look'd upon as a pretty fellow, that could vary his ſhape according to his own pleaſure. And with what equal reſpect we have lately favour'd thoſe, who have hugg'd themſelves, for their ſame knack of jugling; is not (nor never will be) worn out of memory: The ſmooth-tongued St. <hi>Martins</hi> Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers at <hi>Venice,</hi> have delt honeſtly and open-handed, in reſpect of our Modern State-Mountebancks; who were ſo farr Phariſees, that they blab'd their zeal at the corner of every ſtreet, yet kept their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more ſecret than the Boy did, who dyed by the devouring Fox hid <note place="margin">Horat.

Our Politicians, like <hi>Eutrapelus</hi> in the Poet, were grown to the true pitch of callidity, to charm their Neighbours to the changing of their Opinions with their Habits; and all this induſtry (as <hi>Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> did the Roman <hi>Cannius)</hi> meerly to cheat thoſe who deal with <note place="margin">Tull. de Offic. lib. 3. ſect. 63.</note> them.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, I am apt to ſmile, (though I do not approve) when I read or hear a neat piece of ſmall couſenage: But for thoſe, who through private Intereſts, by their plots and devices endeavour to over-throw whole Kingdoms, no man of honeſty but muſt abominate. That man, which through judgement, though erronious, ſticks to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſhall be more in my favour, than thoſe who outwardly offend leſs, yet are ſo peccant through deſign: which makes me have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of many miſled <hi>German-</hi>Boors at <hi>Munſter,</hi> then ſome of our late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grandees; who for their own profit, have not only ſided with all Parties, but run counter to their former Oaths, Declarations, Principles, (if they have had any, firm) to make a private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>How many have we had who have confidently given out themſelves the only men of honeſty and ſanctity (yet ſuch as againſt all Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality) who have fill'd the World with ſtrange Declarations and Vows, by calling Heaven and Earth to witneſs, that their intentions were ſo and ſo; whereas, if that be true of the Poet,</p>

                     <p>Then may we juſtly conclude, that they intended nothing leſs, then that which they moſt engaged to perform.

                     <p>I have ſhewed before, how, that the King did not only not begin the Warr, but, that the Presbyterian Parliament by their plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices forced him to the endeavour of oppoſing ſtrength by ſtrength. And I ſhall ſhortly demonſtrate from their own deceitful lips, how, that they and their Party, did not only proteſt, to have no bad Intentions againſt the King, but alſo to defend and maintain him and his Royal Progeny, and make them more glorious and famous then ever. But this, I may ſay, was done, when they were either too weak, or to gain more friends; for, when they were Conquerers, and had him in their diſpoſal; nothing could ſatisfie their well tutor'd Army, and many of themſelves, but the taking away his innocent life, that with Thieves and Robbers after the murther, they might poſſeſs all; ſo that I may ſing of them with the well known <hi>Colletet.</hi>

This action with their Vote againſt the Queen and that concerning Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Commiſſion, doth not a little or'e-cloud the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, who think they come off with honour, when they deny, it was them, but the Independants, who beheaded his Majeſty.

For which trick, they accuſe ſeveral of the Members, and march up to <hi>London,</hi> with an intention to ſhackle the two Houſes; which the Parliament perceiving, and thereby their own ruin, if not ſpeedily prevented, Vote the Kings Conceſſions to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals lawful to make a firm peace upon. Hoping by this means, that not <note place="margin">5. Decemb.</note> onely the Royaliſts, but that the Presbyterians alſo, would aſſiſt them againſt this Independent Army. Though 'tis no thanks to them, upon ſuch a pinch, and their owne intereſt, to make peace with his Majeſty; for if they had not been utter enemies to him, they might have done it ſooner; and then their courteſie, or rather Royalty, had been double: But now, cry you mercy horſe! they would treat with the King, not to ſave him, but themſelves. So that, for all the boaſts of theſe Bragga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docio's,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61643:65"/>
of their endeavours to preſerve the King's perſon; I ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perſwaded to believe, that their intentions were as real, and to as ſmal purpoſe, as the Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> the great, to defend the <hi>Pariſians</hi> from robbing upon <hi>Pont Neuf.</hi> Nor could any more be expected from them; a true Royaliſt being as rare amongſt them, as a Virgin at ſixteen in <hi>Marolle,</hi> a village in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>But now 'tis too late for the Parliament to comply with the King, the Army being reſolved not to be govern'd by either of them; conſidering what they might ſuffer (as <hi>May</hi> himſelf confeſſeth) if he ſhould come <note place="margin">Breviary <hi>pag.</hi> 212.</note> to Raign again; and for this jealouſie, the Nation may thank <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and <hi>Ireton.</hi> And the Army, thus reſolved, the next day ſeiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">6.

                     <p>Beſides theſe Pamphlets, ſeveral people were inſtigated to Petition the Commons and General, that ſpeedy juſtice might be executed upon his Majeſty and this as ſoon as the Army had conquered <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the reſt of the Royaliſts; <hi>Ponifract</hi> excepted.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Inconſtancy, villany, and monſtrous Tyranny of the wicked Army! till the Reſtauration of his Majeſty.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus did the <hi>Rump</hi> tryumph, when ſeparated from the ſecluded Members. The which outing, was as great a Providence, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hath hapned to the diſtracted Kingdoms theſe many years (the miraculous reſtauration of his Majeſty excepted). For if they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the King to his Title again, yet had it been ſo qualified, that his Authority and honour had lain in the duſt, his friends and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church utterly diſtroyed and diſcredited, and an abuſed Nation trampled upon by a tyrannizing and ſchiſmatical Presbytery.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> being thus a Cock-horſe acted on with more wickedneſs then the 30 <hi>Athenian</hi> Tyrants, there being no good <hi>Theramenes</hi> at <note place="margin">Diod. Sicul <hi>Bib.</hi> l. 14. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as there was at <hi>Athens,</hi> honeſtly to oppoſe our unheard of Villanies, who preſently Vote the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> uſeleſſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the <hi>Kingly-Office</hi> unneceſſary and burthenſome. And for <note place="margin">6 Feb. 7 Feb.</note> the better carrying on of their deſignes, order a <hi>Committee of Eſtates</hi> conſiſting of ſeveral Lords and Commons, who were to ſit in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and rule the Militia and Navy, and look after the Trade and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace of the Nation, and this to continue a year and no longer; <note place="margin">14 Feb.</note> And makes it treaſon for any to proclaim the King, vote themſelves a <hi>Free State</hi> and a Common-wealth, and order an Engagement to be taken all <hi>England</hi> over, to be true and faithful to them. And having thus ſecured themſelves, they ruled the roaſt till 1653. In which year <note place="margin">20 April.</note> they were pul'd out by the eares, by their Generall and darling <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and his hireling Red-coats, who affirm'd, <hi>Wiſedome and direction</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Declarat. why they diſſolved the Rump.</note> 
                        <hi>being ſought from the Lord, it ſeem'd to be a duty incumbent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God going along with us.</hi> And <hi>that we were bound by neceſsity and providence to act as we have done, even beyond and above our own thoughts and deſires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> being thus ſqueezed out, <hi>Oliver</hi> began to be all in all, and ſo for ſome daies the Nation remain'd without any Government, but what reflected from the beams of his Orient Noſe; in which time the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and the Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with others, congratulate his valour againſt the Beaſts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and reſolve to ſtick to him, as was formerly concluded upon amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Yet at laſt after ſome conſultation, a <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>State</hi> was order'd to <note place="margin">30 April.</note> ſit, till another Repreſentative be call'd, he and his Officers acting at pleaſure. At laſt, as the King doth with the Peers, ſo did he with his confiding Commons, ſending out his Letters to every man who ſhould ſit, whereby none were permitted but ſuch as he pleaſ'd.</p>

The men that were ſummon'd by his particular writs (above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in number) accordingly met at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where their Patron <hi>Cromwell</hi> made a canting Speech to them, and then gave them an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> under his own fiſt and ſeal, whereby he conſtituted them the <note place="margin">4 July.</note>

This conventicle puts me in mind of that Parliament, kept at <hi>Coventry</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixths time; which was afterwards declared <hi>a deviliſh Councill and only celebrated for the diſtruction of the Nobility, and no lawful Parliament: Becauſe they which were return'd, were never elected according to the due</hi>

But the cunning <hi>Rumpers</hi> ſmelling the deſign, Voted this grand Office, as in a ſingle Perſon, to be needleſs, chargeable and <note place="margin">23.

and uprightneſs of heart.</hi> Yet all this not half ſo true as the ſea burns, let the Country people confide never ſo much in the Proverb.</p>
                     <p>'Twas a mad world, my Maſters, when <hi>John of Leyden</hi> a Taylor, muſt be made King of the Univerſe: And <hi>Robert Kett</hi> a Tanner, ruin our <hi>Engliſh</hi> incloſers according to his diſcretion; Or <hi>Michael Joſeph</hi> a Black-ſmith; endeavour to correct the King, and his Council. <hi>Naples,</hi> we may ſuppoſe, was well reformed, when <hi>Thomas Anello</hi> a poor Fiſher-man, would there rule the roaſt, to the deſtruction of many ſtately buildings.

For which purpoſe, they murdered all perſons of quality, which fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their clutches if not of their ſociety; burnt, and diſtroy'd the beſt houſes in <hi>London;</hi> And had ſo little reſpect of perſons, that every ſlave amongſt them, would ſport themſelves upon the King's bed, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently invite the King's Mother to kiſs with them, whoſe head they alſo broak in a Tyrannizing frolick: And that their villany might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat by a bloudy Sacriledge, they took <hi>Simon Tibald,</hi> aliàs <hi>Sudbury,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and in their deviliſh fury, by eight mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtroaks, cut off his head; and for more infamy, ſet it upon <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>

                     <p>How parallel (or rather excell'd) our late Rebellion hath run to this, is not unknown. How hath our Nobility, and Gentry been trod upon, and that by the ſcum of Manhood; whoſe wicked deſignes were mainly carried on for their utter annihilation: And they began betimes, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that confident Petition of the Raſcally <hi>Londoners,</hi> at the beginning <note place="margin">Ex.

And with what applauſe the Commons received this durty Paper, is clear from their ſwagring with it before the Lords; whereas their Loyalty had been more ſhewn, had they burnt the Petition, and cut off the Preſenters ears; but then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome of the Compoſers, would have pleaded Protection by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Parliament, for 'tis more then ſuſpected who ſet ſuch people on work.</p>

                     <p>Yet nothing hath been more familiar with our late Grandees then this; which makes me ſometimes apt to fancy, that our Phanaticks hold all manner of Oaths unlawful, (though before a Magiſtrate) meerly as a pretty <hi>ſalvo</hi> for their Perjury, thinking thoſe not fit to be kept, which in the Original is unwarrantable to be taken.

                     <p>Thus the <hi>Graecian Lyſander</hi> made ſo little Conſcience of Oaths, that he affirm'd, they were but to deceive men, as falſe-play children.

                     <p>But to return to our late times, in which, we are firſt to conſider the two Oaths, one of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> (made in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time), and the other of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (made in King <hi>James</hi> his reign) wherein, all are ſworn to defend the Kings Perſon, Progeny, Power, Authority, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and acknowledge him to be Supream over all; and this alſo the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> bound them to keep. But, how theſe were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that by the Parliament itſelf (every Member therein having taken the two Oaths), is not unknown. And, if theſe allow'd them to fight againſt the King, or at leaſt to kill him, I ſhall lament my Baptiſm, and put no more truſt in my Creed.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Rump</hi> had perjured themſelves by beheading their King, they frame an <hi>Engagement,</hi> obliging all to take it; or elſe to have no benefit of an <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man, the words of which were theſe;</p>

                     <p>This was taken by all the Officers and Souldiers of the Armies who return'd their Subſcriptions in Parchment-Rolles, to make the work more ſure and laſting; and beſides them many others took it.</p>

                     <p>This Oath in behalf of Protectorſhip, and a ſingle Perſon, laſted not long: for, the Army having overthrown <hi>Richard,</hi> and again reſtored the <hi>Rump,</hi> another Oath was ordered to be taken, in theſe words;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You ſhall ſwear, That you will be true, faithful, and conſtant, to this Common-wealth, without a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip, or Houſe of Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after all this, as if one Oath ſignified nothing, ſome of them took a new-found-out Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> againſt Kingſhip, though poor Souls! only to their own ſhame and confuſion. And this was the pretty invention of the hot-headed Knight <hi>Don Haſlerigo,</hi> one, of <hi>Dr. Burges</hi>'s Principles, to abominate and hate all Biſhops, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and love their Lands dearly; but this fault is not only incident to them, it being the main reaſon, that there is ſuch a skip-jack as an <hi>Engliſh Presbytery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such horrid Perjury as this, and ſuch abominable Villanies commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our late Parliaments, made them not a little guilty of the higheſt Sacriledge.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Schoolmen and others, make a threefold Sacriledge, <hi>viz.</hi> either by taking away from, or violating in, a holy place, a holy thing; or ſecondly, an holy thing from, or in, a place not holy or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; or laſtly, a thing not holy, in, or from a holy place. And, that there are ſome places and things holy, I ſuppoſe, few (but thoſe who are wickedly intereſted in Church-Lands) will plead ignorance; For, though this or that, originally be not really holy of it ſelf; yet, the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Apellatione autem rei ſacrae accipitur ea quae ſanctita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aliquam habet, aut Chriſti inſtitutione, aut Ecclcſiae Conſecratione—ca item quam Eclleſia ad ſacros uſus &amp; Miniſteria deſtinavit. <hi>Jo.

                        <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s ſin was not ſo much for being drunk with Wine, but <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 2, 23.</note> his ſacrilegious drinking out of the Veſſels of the Temple: Thoſe who rob God of his Tithes and Offerings, are ſeverely curſt, and an <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8, 9.</note> expreſs command againſt exchanging or alienating thoſe things which are holy to the Lord, as the Lands of his Church. How highly did <note place="margin">Ezek. 48. 12, 14.</note> God puniſh thoſe who regarded not his Temple, every man running unto his own Houſe? and, what little impreſſion hath this made upon <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>England,</hi> where moſt forſook the Church, drawing themſelves to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Conventicles, and ſuch private Houſes, never intended for ſuch publick duties? 'Tis noted as a great aggravation of King <hi>Ahaz</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 22, 23, 24.</note> for deſtroying the holy Veſſels, and ſhutting up the doors of the Temple; though amongſt our late rebellious Reformers, ſuch actions were eſteem'd a true token of holineſs. <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> took <note place="margin">2 King. 12. 17, 18.</note> all the treaſure and holy things out of the Temple, and ſent them to <hi>Hazael,</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> for a bribe, and was recompenced by being ſlain by his Servants. But our Innocent King was murdered by thoſe who had fed their Brethern with Monies impiouſly rent from Church-Lands; whereby their Villanies were doubled, to make them more ſerviceable to their cloven-footed Maſter who ſet them on work.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> act, is held by Divines as a true pattern of Sacriledge; for which they ſuffer'd death by a ſpecial judgement of God, as <hi>Achan</hi> in the old time was ſtoned to death. St. <hi>Paul</hi> admires that any man ſhould <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 22.</note> be ſo wicked as to commit Sacriledge; and our late Sectaries wonder, that any ſhould ſtand in aw of it: Our Saviours whipping the buyers and ſellers, and ſuch like, out of the Temple, is no ſmall ſign, what reſpect ſhould be held to our Churches, not to be turn'd into Exchanges, as is well known, the once famous Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>For Confirmation of this, many heavy examples of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Ezra 6. 11, 12.</note> againſt thoſe, who have either violated his Church, or aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Meſſengers Lands, might be drawn out of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> and other Hiſtorians, but that the certainty of ſuch puniſhments are unqueſtionable.</p>
                     <p>Nor did the Reverend Fathers of the Primitive Church (led by the example of Gods ſevere threatnings and chaſtiſements of ſuch horrid wickedneſs) wink at ſuch faults as this.

                     <p>Nor hath it happened otherwiſe with our wicked Long-Parliament, and their ſacrilegious adherents, who could never keep their accounts ſtraight: for though in the heat of the warre they demanded not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 50000 <hi>l.</hi> a month to carry on their deſignes; yet in time of peace they could not obſerve juſt ſcores, though they had 90000 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; 100000 <hi>l. per menſem;</hi> and ſold all the Kings, and Biſhops, and ſuch like lands which amounted to a vaſt ſumme; beſides taxes, exciſe, cuſtomes, and ſuch like commings in.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That ſome, through ignorance, and a credulous diſpoſition, (promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to embrace their ſpecious Pretences) might be charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſide with the Parliament, though really they deſigned no damage either to the King's Perſon, nor Authority.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO vindicate Rebellion (as hath been the unhappy <hi>mode</hi> of late) is the worſt office that can be done to a Nation; yet to make all it's partakers of equal guilt, will be a token of no great ſhare of charity. I am apt to believe, that hitherto there hath never been any war, but ſome men as well of honeſt intentions, as others knaviſhly-deſigned, have been of both ſides. It is not all men that rightly underſtand the frame by which they are govern'd, either the Prerogative of the Supream, or their own Priviledges; and it is but few can ſee into the contriving hearts of their neighbours. A harmleſs woman may be deceived into the reality of the Actors, at the <hi>Hoſtel de Bourgogue</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> or an Engliſh Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: and 'tis no difficult thing, under the ſpecious vail of Religion, and Common good, to make many people believe, that actions which are really the moſt wicked, tend to the beſt; like the Phyſician in the Fable, who made his Patient think, that every Temper he was in, was ſtill for his health. By theſe inſinuations increaſeth the number of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and Rebels, many being rather miſled, then acting out of deſign, being not ſo much uſed for any benefit to themſelves, as ignorant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to promote their flattering Grandees to the deſired Haven of Supremacy; and, this once obtain'd are either thrown by, as Day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers when the work is done, as needleſs, and impertinent; or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully rewarded as <hi>Trebellius</hi> King of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> was by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <note place="margin">

                     <p>As I ſhew'd before, that the pretended ſqueamiſh ſtomacks of the Non-conformiſts, were, as <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Hermit,</hi> the firſt Trumpet to ſound Alarum to this ſuppoſed holy war; ſetting the Lecturers up to teach Non-conformity; ſchiſm, and diſobedience, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of Rebellion: ſo were the tongues, and pens of this Novel Covenanting fraternity, the main inſtruments that infuſed diſloyalty into the peoples hearts: which the Parliament did not onely approve of, but alſo protect, (thereby gaining infinite Proſelytes) as the Devil in the Northern Coaſts doth his ſubjects, by making them invulnerable. And theſe they feed up, and nouriſh with ſtrange fears, (more fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal then <hi>Lazarellos,</hi> when he thought the dead man would be carried to his Maſter's houſe) ſtrongly fomented, and agitated by unheard of Plots, ſet a foot to deſtroy Religion, and Nation; like the <hi>Roterdam-</hi>ſhip, which would kill the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under water, and all this upon worſegrounds, and reaſons, then the influence of a <hi>Taliſman.</hi>

Though nothing was more falſe, and impudent then theſe pretended dangers, yet what by the authority, and countenance of thoſe Grandees, who patronized ſuch rumours; and what by the power which the Tub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumping boute-feus had over the peoples inclinations, and judgments, (whereby the Pulpit became the worſt thing in the Nation) many had not onely a bad opinion of the King, but thought very well of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who in all their actions were far more ſedulous then his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; but moſt of all (as a hindg upon which themſelves, and deſigns hung,) in ſending forth their papers to abuſe the people, by making the King's actions odious, and their own for the beſt. And of this they <note place="margin">4 Jun. 1642.</note> took ſpecial care, not onely by appointing a Committee to conſider of the moſt convenient way to diſperſe them, and to give an allowance to their Meſſengers, but alſo by taking care by Order, that every <hi>Petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi> or <hi>Tythingman</hi> throughout <hi>England,</hi> ſhall have one of every one <note place="margin">6 June 1642.</note> of their Orders, Declarations, &amp;c. and to read them publickly to their neighbours.

The Noble Earl of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> that <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Oak and regal Buckler of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and valour; at firſt was as much peccant as the greateſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter, yet none proved afterwards more faithful to his Majeſty, and active againſt his former aſſociates (becauſe the King's enemies) then himſelf. The great Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Atturney General <hi>Noy,</hi> were look'd upon at firſt, great courters of the Commonalty, and diſ-regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prerogative, yet upon better inſight became the greateſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the King's Authority. And I have heard of thoſe who have ſo far grieved for their former actions, that they have wiſh't themſelves breathleſs, when they firſt drew ſword for the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>It is repentance that doth pleaſe God himſelf; and Kings (who are truely call'd God's upon Earth) have received into favour their greateſt enemies, upon remorſe of their former villanies. Yet all mens intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals do not ſo ſympathize as to perceive their errors at the ſame time. Some with Sir <hi>F.

As for the firſt, they deſerve pardon, and favour, becauſe they deal ingenuouſly, and like men of reaſon, and nobleneſs; whilſt the latter merit the ſeverity of laws, and ſcorn. And as I cannot plead for theſe, ſo ſhall I never for thoſe, who did not onely oppoſe all Treaties with the King; but thoſe alſo, who, when any ſuch thing was obtain'd, ſtill ſhoved it off, by uncivil, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, and abominable Propoſitions; framed, either for the prolonging of war, and bloud-ſhed, or the reducing of his Majeſty to be but a King of Clouts; and ſo under the obedience, and laſh of their Schiſmatical Presbyterian Tyranny: from which ſcourge, I hope theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and all good people, will for the future be delivered.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often ſmiled at the Story of an old Knight, who, in the ſmall ſpace of one Battle, changed his opinion twice; and that with ſo much zeal, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency, as to cry out [when his Clerk brought him news, that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had beat his enemies,] <hi>O the goodneſs of God! that will not ſuffer Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to proſper!

Bleſſed be God, who hath thus put to ſhame the enemies of Reformation! O! had the Malignants got the better, we ſhould have had Popery reſtored again: But, O the goodneſs of God, who hath thus diſperſed the members, and raggs, of Antichriſt! &amp;c.</hi> And after this manner did Maſter <hi>Gawen Hamilton</hi>

Old <hi>Savill,</hi> in the Play, rather then loſe his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved bunch of Keys, would comply with any thing; and how far a Presbyterian would ſtretch his Conſcience, rather then loſe Authority, muſt be left to judgment: for I am apt to believe, that many of them, are not unlike <hi>Paulet</hi> the old Marquiſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who would rather bow <note place="margin">Ortus ſum ex Salice non ex Quercu.</note> then break, being always of the King's Religion.</p>
                     <p>I have known ſome in theſe late times, ſeriouſly deny any difference betwixt the Miniſtry, and Laity; and yet upon this laſt change, have call'd thoſe irrational, who queſtioned the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy. And how many of our Presbyterians have declared their perpetual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to their <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt our preſent Church-government? yet, ſince the Change, have taken contrary preferments, with a pretty diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they onely ſwore againſt the wickedneſs, accidentally happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch forms. Theſe Non-conformiſts, have been originally the main enemies (as far as ſword would go) againſt the late King, and This preſent; yet now, that he is reſtored, none courts the riſing Sun-more then they, and that, with thwacking <hi>Rodomantado's</hi> of their activity for his Reſtauration, and what danger, and jeopardy, they have incurr'd for his cauſe: which puts me in mind of the firſt Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hiſt. Reformat. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> pag. 38.</note> When the Scriptures were allowed to be read in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> then thoſe who had ever ſcarce read ten ſentences of it, would chop their acquaintances on the cheek with it, and ſay, <hi>This hath lain under my beds feet theſe ten years.</hi> Others would glory, <hi>O! how oft have I been in danger for this book! How ſecretly have I ſtoln from my wife at midnight, to read upon it?</hi> All which was done meerly to curry favour, the <hi>Governour</hi> being then held one of the moſt ſervent <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Europe:</hi> And how far this ſtory quadrates with our Presbyterian temper, may be ſeen by the ſequel diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen ſome men in the <hi>Rump's</hi> time, when condemn'd to death for Felony, by the then Judges; earneſtly plead their former ſiding with, and activity for the Parliament, thinking thereby to gain ſo much favour from the Judge, (who had been formerly brothers in one and the ſame iniquity) as the procurement of a Reprieve, if not a pardon: But now, the plea is ſo much alter'd, that the ſame Faction, pretends to hold forth ſome ſmall favours to the preſent King, as a badge to denote the bearers ſo ſtuft with Loyalty, as to be capable of the greateſt truſt. When the Father was alive, then, they fought againſt him, to make him more glorious: And now that the Son's reſtored, they onely ſent the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to pelt him beyond ſeas, to learn humility, becauſe Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Presbytery, are the beſt Tutors to that vertue: For, rather then He, or his Father, ſhould ſuffer any real damage, or hurt, they would do—juſt nothing.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61643:84"/>
health, was by command ſlain, that he might not be for ſworn. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Afranius</hi> meant really or no, I know not, but this I am confident of, That our Presbyterians, take little care of any oaths tending to the ſafety, and peace of King, and Country; and therefore take what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they pleaſe to proteſt, knowing his Majeſties mercy is ſuch, that he had rather give them time to repent, for their former wickedneſs, and perjury, then put a period to their beings by the <hi>mode</hi> of Truſſing; as they had done formerly to many of his moſt faithful Subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Americus Veſpacian,</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> had the confidence to denominate the beſt Continent of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> by his name, though, if he had not had the benefit of <hi>Colono,</hi> or <hi>Colombo,</hi> (of <hi>Genua)</hi> his obſervations, he might as ſoon (it's probable) have found out <hi>Nigra Rupis,</hi> or the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Station of <hi>Ophir,</hi> as have ſeen that other world. And if the ever to be honour'd Duke of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> had not contrived, and, as I may ſay, of himſelf wrought out the happy Reſtauration of his Majeſty; The Brethren, alas! would as ſoon have found out the ten tribes, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves endeavoured the King's return; unleſs upon Tyrannical Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that if <hi>Virgil</hi> took it ill, that <hi>Bathyllus</hi> had robb'd him of the honour, but of one <hi>Diſtick;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Albermarle</hi> hath no reaſon to favour thoſe people, who would pluck from him, the greateſt glory, that in poſſibility could be thrown upon a Subject.</p>
                     <p>If the Presbyterians did any thing advance his Majeſties Reſtauration, it muſt either be by <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Induſtry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the firſt, they cannot expect any thanks; ſince this event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from reſolution, but rather contrary to their deſire, or at leaſt expectation. The Ape little thought, by putting on his Maſter's Cap to cure him of a <hi>Plureſy;</hi> and he who wrote to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> did not think thereby to diſcover the Gun-powder plot. The Surgion had no intention to deſtroy <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> by burning the thread too careleſly; and what reſolutions the Presbyterians had to reſtore our <hi>Charles</hi> II, I muſt yet plead ignorance, till better informed: but I am confident they would never willingly, have this way pleaſured King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.</p>
                     <p>And that they, ever ſo much troubled their thoughts, with the King, as to make his Reſtauration a part of their buſineſs; is hitherto as far from my diſcovery, as the true ſituation of the old Towns in <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> or the Northern bounders of <hi>America.</hi> I hear not of any of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>England,</hi> when his Majeſty was beyond ſeas, before his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Scots;</hi> I hear of none of their deſigns here, to aſſiſt the King, or their own Brethren for him, in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I know of no aſſiſtance that they afforded, or brought to the King, when he marched for <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi> but have heard of ſome, who have then oppoſed him with all their might: Nor am I informed of their activeneſs, in any of the many Plots againſt <hi>Oliver;</hi> and if, in none of theſe things they have been ſtirring, their Grand Plea of Loyalty muſt fall to the ground; unleſs they did his Majeſty good ſervice, by being obedient, and faithfull ſubjects to the <hi>Rump,</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> ſworn enemies to the King: and in this caſe their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61643:85"/>
plea cannot be ſo ingenious, as that of the immortal Poet <hi>John Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Petition to <hi>Oliver. Jardin de Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> Colloq. 3. pag. 29.</note> I remember <hi>Antonio de Torquemeda</hi> tells a ſtory of ſome men, and their horſes, that were carried to <hi>Granada</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by the advantage of one Cloak, though they thought they had onely been getting their dinners, not thinking of ſuch a journey. And if the Presbytery did any ſervice for the King, it was I ſuppoſe after this manner, when they never dreamed of it.</p>
                     <p>Nay I do not ſo much as hear the whiſpering of any relief [till the other day] of monies, or ſuch like conveniencies, that they aſſiſted the King with, or any of his diſtreſſed followers, Major General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and Captain <hi>Titus</hi> excepted: and that but a poor pittance too, ſome 400l. between them, not for any deſign, but a ſupply of perſonal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. And the reaſon of this beggerly liberality, was not ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſufferers for the King, as that the former had done good ſervices for the Presbyterian Parliament, as Maſter <hi>Love</hi> himſelf doth <note place="margin">Narrative.</note> more then hint; beſides this, we will not forget the huge ſumme of 40l. to Coll. <hi>Bampfield,</hi> and his man.</p>
                     <p>Yet as a pretty token of their Loyalty, they keep a great deal of clutter, concerning the actions of Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> and a few of his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, as if this were ſufficient, to afford ſcraps of Loyalty to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member of that Faction. But to this may be anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that if the ſtory were, as abſolute Royal as man could imagine, yet will it onely demonſtrate that there were ſome three or four and twenty Presbyterians, which were active for the good of his Majeſty, no more ſtirring in it, as Maſter <hi>Love</hi> himſelf doth confeſs, being utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the reſt of their party: profeſſing upon the Scaffold that <note place="margin">Narrat. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> the ſaying the contrary, <hi>is onely a politick Engine to make the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party odious;</hi> ſo that the actions of theſe men are nothing to <note place="margin">Speech Sect. 11.</note> the vindication of the reſt. Beſides, compleat Loyalty they looked upon as odious.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, the compleat honour of the ſtory, may, upon very good grounds, in the main be queſtioned: For though they did ſometimes meet at Maſter <hi>Love</hi>'s houſe, yet their Conſultations were rather for the miſery, then benefit of King, Church, or Kingdome: The main of their contrivances, being to ſend to ſome about his Majeſty; adviſing them by all means, to uſe their intereſts to <hi>Provoke Him</hi> [i. e. the King] <hi>to agree with the</hi> Scots, <hi>and to take the Covenant:</hi> as alſo to adviſe <note place="margin">Narrat. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> the <hi>Scots Commiſsioners,</hi> that, <hi>in their agreement with their King, they ſhould have a ſpecial reſpect to the Interest of Religion, and Terms of the Covenant;</hi> and to this purpoſe they muſt tumble out their prayers, and ſend into <hi>Scotland</hi> to know whether they did <hi>maintain Religion, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Narrat. <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Intereſt.</hi> So that the <hi>Scots</hi> were not onely guilty of their after Covenanting Tyranny with their betters, but the <hi>Engliſh Brethren</hi> alſo by their thus thruſting on the deſign.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto, we ſee all the Loyalty, and affection by theſe men ſhew'd to their Soveraign, was meerly conditionally, and that upon a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>account; little beneficial to the King, or his Party, as may appear by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61643:85"/>
the acknowledgement of one of their Patrons, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Love.</hi>

                     <p>In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the man was of a haſty and violent ſpirit, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath a rational or ſound foundation: and by many is accuſed to be the breaker up of the <hi>Uxbridge-</hi>Treaty, by his ranting Sermon, of which <note place="margin">Relat. of the paſſages of the Treaty. <hi>ſect.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> Preachment the Kings Commiſſioners complained, though to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as appears by the Anſwers: yet, I ſhall willingly quit him from this, knowing, that neither the Parliament, nor their Commiſſioners, would be guided by his pratling; and being fully ſatisfied, that the Parliament never really intended a Peace, unleſs they had thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>King</hi> to a Royal ſlave, or worſe, and have got liberty for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have acted Treaſon and Tyrannized over the poor Nation <hi>cum Privilegio;</hi> and this was the deſign of all their counterfeited Treaties.

I might here alſo intimate ſome of his ſacrilegious vapours, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon his extravagant reproaches thrown upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which I am confident, might lawfully defend herſelf, by force of Arms, againſt the impious actions of her ſpurious Antagoniſts, if that be true which Mr. <hi>Love</hi> affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is an <hi>hurtful Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">England'<hi>s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</hi> p. 17.</note> to imagine, that the people might not do ſo againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. I ſhall conclude with our ſuppoſed Martyr, by aſſerting, that he who had the ignorance, blind-zeal, and impudence, to tearm <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy and the Common-Prayer-Book</hi> the <hi>two Plague-ſores,</hi> ſeveral times in one Preachment, had need have ſet-Forms of Sermons enjoyned him, as well as Prayers; And the Presbyterian <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> who cleared Mr. <hi>Love</hi> from any ſlander, for pratling ſuch ſtuff, did plainly demonſtrate, what little deſire, they had for Peace, and thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated their abominable hypocriſie to the whole world; ſince the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (pardon the giving it ſo good a Title) ſeemed more like an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,</hi> to encourage the People to a bloudy ſlaughter, [and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, how oft he mentioned the neceſſity of drawing bloud] than the imbracement of a happy and ſetled Peace.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſufficiently proved Mr. <hi>Love</hi> to be no ſuch <hi>Martyr,</hi> as his Fraternity flab out (though much more might be enlarged upon this Subject), and upon every diſcourſe fly to him, as a ſufficient <hi>Aſylum,</hi> where they think they may handſomly ſecure a Reputation: I ſhall now ſay ſomething to another Objection, whoſe main force lyeth upon the credit of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo may with its Dam ſleep with ignominy, rather than be held forth as a badge of honeſty.</p>
                     <p>In this plea, they boaſt much in their taking the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in which there is one clauſe, for the Preſervation of the Kings Perſon; to which <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crofton's</hi> Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Fetters. <hi>pag.</hi> 146, 147.</note> League, one of their Chieftains, brags, that above 600. Miniſters did ſubſcribe.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſhall anſwer, that if he glory in the number; 600. is but a poor Bed-role in reſpect of 10000. for about ſo many Miniſters are there in <hi>England:</hi> But again, the taking of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a good and loyal Subject, but rather the contrary, being againſt the Kings expreſs command. But again, It is not the taking of an Oath, (provided it be a lawful one), but the keeping of it, that may demand commendations. And, when Subjects break Allegiance at pleaſure, as they are a trouble to their King and Countrey; ſo are they wicked before God, and ſo merit no commendation; no good being entended either to King or Countrey, by this knack of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
                     <p>What benefit was it for <hi>Ataulphus, Sigericus, Thuriſmundus, Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſilus, Agila,</hi> and <hi>Luyba,</hi> thoſe <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> or, for <hi>Friola</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> Kings of <hi>Leon,</hi> to confide in their people, and expect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſince they were ſlain by their own Subjects? What advantage was it for St. <hi>Wenceſlaw, Jaromirus,</hi> and <hi>Wenceſlaw</hi> the V. Dukes and Kings of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> or for <hi>Gotrick,</hi> and the three <hi>Eric</hi>'s of <hi>Denmark</hi> to truſt to the obedience, which Law and Nature might aſſure
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61643:87"/>
them of, ſince, contrary to all fidelity, they were murdered by their own People. Thoſe of <hi>Swedland,</hi> cannot handſomly boaſt of their Loyalty by killing <hi>Ingevallus, Eric Aorſel</hi> [or <hi>Stanchil],</hi> and <hi>Swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherus</hi> their Kings: Nor could the Queen of the ſame Countrey expect Commendations, by affirming her ſubjection and love to her King and Husband <hi>Ingemarus,</hi> ſince ſhe broak both, by hanging him in a Gold Chain; as Queen <hi>Fredegunde</hi> did hers, by procuring the murder of <hi>Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> as <hi>Ferguſius</hi> III. and <hi>Malvinus,</hi> Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were thus aſſaſſinated by their Queens. Will any man quit the Treaſons of <hi>Zedechias,</hi> for ſaying, that he was ſworn Phyſitian to the <hi>Emperour?</hi> or pardon <hi>Jaques Clement, Jean Chaſtel,</hi> or <hi>Francis Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaillac,</hi> if they ſhould ſay, Their Religion obliged them to obedience? ſince the firſt poyſoned <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> the ſecond ſtabbed <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France, Chaſtel</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the laſt man murdered him. Would it not heighten the wickedneſs of <hi>Dowall,</hi> the three <hi>Donalds,</hi> and the two <hi>Fidlers,</hi> by pleading that they were Subjects, when they were ſo farr from obſerving their Allegiance, that they impiouſly murdered their Soveraigns, <hi>Nothatus, Ethodius</hi> I. <hi>Findocus, Fethelmacus, Conranus,</hi> or <hi>Goranus,</hi> and <hi>Duffus,</hi> Kings of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to theſe, I may add the Aſſaſſinators of <hi>James</hi> I. of the ſame Nation. But to return home, (paſſing by the diſobedience ſhewn to ſome of our own Kings of former ages) will it any way diminiſh the crimes of the Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, with the reſt of the Schiſmaticks, if they ſhould plead, that they formerly ſubſcribed the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the 36. <hi>Canon,</hi> when they took their <hi>Degrees,</hi> [as appears by their own hands in the two <hi>Univerſities;</hi> a Catalogue of which, might be produced, to the eternal ignomy and perjury of the Brotherhood] ſince they violently broke all their promiſes, to the deſtruction of our Church and State? Can any quit the long Parliament of Hypocriſie, when they affirm that they all took the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> for the Kings Preſervation; and <note place="margin">Ex.

him, as appears by the <hi>ſeries</hi> of the whole Warr. When the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threw by their King and Oaths in the Votes for <hi>Non-Addreſs,</hi> the Nation ſaw, that they were then contriving his ruine.

                     <p>Thus the Kings Party (though deveſted of Arms and Strength) beſtirr themſelves like faithful Subjects. But what did the <hi>Brethren</hi> do? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! they acted very high too, though the clean contrary way; The Parliament curſing the Royal deſign with Bell, Book, and Candle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving night and day how to bring them to diſtruction, whilſt their Aſſociates in the Countrey and Army furiouſly oppoſed, and, at laſt, (as the Devil was permitted to triumph over <hi>Job),</hi> proved victorious, to the ruine of the Kings beſt friends. Yet, had theſe Zealots, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Oaths, taken up their Weapons, probably the Kings murder, and other following miſchiefs had been ſtopt. But God would not ſuffer ſuch wicked perjured Wretches to be Authors of ſo much good: It being miraculous, (which are now ceaſed) that the madd <note n="a" place="margin">Pet. <hi>de</hi> Natal. <hi>l. 6. c.</hi> 133.

                     <p>Thus did theſe people (for all their <hi>gude Covenant)</hi> ſuffer their King to be murdred before their faces, without moving one hand for a reſcue; unleſs you will allow the Petitioning of a few, when it was too late to do any good by ſoft words; though it was more than could be expected from thoſe, who had done him all the miſchief, that Sword, Gun, or Malice could do; which puts me in mind of a paſſage in a Paper printed for <hi>Robert White,</hi> before the decollation of his Majeſty.

                     <p>Here I would not be underſtood, of thoſe who at the beginning of theſe troubles, had the misfortune to be of that Faction, yet ſince turn'd to the true Church, with an acknowledgment of their former errours, and this through conſcience, not preferment; the once-flouriſhing Church, being then in a perſecution: But I intend thoſe whoſe fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick zeal yet binds them up to Schiſm, as well as thoſe who are ſtuft with Presbytery in Sr. <hi>George's</hi> riſing, and ſince of whom I believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not yet impoſſible, becauſe I read that the Devill himſelf <note place="margin">Caeſarii Hiſt. Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtr. Mirac. <hi>l. 3. cap.</hi> 26.</note> hath humbly acknowledged and confeſſed his offences.</p>
                     <p>But to the Query, if they would not have endeavour'd his reſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being ſo qualified, then muſt they needs have a large ſtock of confidence to demand thanks where none is due (but rather an halter) for their aſſiſtance in the buſineſſe. But if they did deſire the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo qualyfied, then muſt they either declare, that they have been wicked Villains and Traytors againſt the late King; or that this preſent King, was help'd in by them, more through their goodneſs to him, than his own deſert.</p>
                     <p>For my part I am apt to give credit to the negative, really thinking that if they had had as bad thoughts of this King as of his Father (who yet was better than the beſt of his enemies) they would have made it their buſineſſe to have kept him out, (though, under favour, 'tis as much Treaſon to depoſe a Tyrant; as a good King.) And I am drawn to be of this perſwaſion by theſe following Motives.</p>
                     <p>That they looked upon his Fathers non-complyance with their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh humours, as a monſtrous wickedneſſe, is a truth not hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. <note place="margin">Narrative <hi>pag.</hi> 9.</note> Wherefore elſe ſhould Mr. <hi>Love</hi> pray, that <hi>God would redeem him</hi> [i. e.

Which puts me in mind of a Quaker, who not long ſince through ignorance, led a friend of mine above 4 miles out of his way going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and when he perceived his error, greatly cryed up the good providence of God, which had brought them that way, becauſe (as he ſaid,) for ought he knew, they might have been rob'd had they gone the right road.

                     <p>As for the firſt, It is as true as <hi>Penry [Martin marre Prelat]</hi> was hang'd, or <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> eares cut off, that the members [and 'tis well known what they were] of the wicked Long Parliament remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> did declare the lawfulneſſe of the War; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, by their wicked Counſels, carryed it on: which is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be denyed, as the fight of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> or 88.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the malevolent humours of the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if their hearts may be known by their actions [and we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Index]</hi> they ſhall preſently appear as bad as their Neighbours. For after that God had allowed them ſome ten or eleven years time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61643:90"/>
they ſtill harden their own hearts, looking upon their former actions againſt their King, to be too honeſt, to require remorſe, or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as if they had done God good ſervice, by fighting againſt his Laws, and Anointed.</p>
                     <p>For no ſooner were they reſtored by the now Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> but they fell again to the adoring, and doing homage to, their long-forgotten Idol, the <hi>Holy-League;</hi> and, for it's greater honour, vomiting out this Order,</p>

                     <p>And to ſhew themſelves as pert blades againſt the King as ever, it was <hi>Ordered</hi> by their Worſhips, that no Commiſſioner, or Commiſſionated Officer, ſhould exerciſe any power, or Authority, till he had acknowledged as followeth,</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>the late King, was juſt and lawful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this all, (though enough in conſcience to make a Traytor, or elſe farewell <hi>Poulton);</hi> but, the better to make the inſuing Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Puritanical humours, thereby to bring the Nations again into ſlavery; They a little after the former Orders, Decree, that none ſhall be capable of being choſen a Member of Parliament, which hath any way aſſiſted the King againſt their Worſhips, unleſs he had ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted his former adhearing to the King.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we ſee no ſign of repentance for their former Rebellion, but rather a ſtubborn malepert zeal, ſwaying amongſt this Faction, and prompting them to a readineſs of their own juſtification, for their ſo doing. Though it is a certain truth, that they were the—<hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> of the King's Murther; they putting the ſword into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> hand, which gave the fatal ſtroke. And theſe who are thus ſo confident, to juſtifie their wickedneſs againſt the Father, will not be wanting to create the ſame jealouſies, that they might have the ſame op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity againſt the Son; as the multitude of ſcandalous, and ſeditious Pamphlets (and I wiſh many Lectures were not ſo too) yet daily flying abroad, doth ſomewhat intimate.</p>
                     <p>However, had their malice hurried them on to far more extravagant actions, (and who knows what they might have done, if their Carreer had not been ſtopt) yet had they done but like themſelves: A Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri an Parliament, being as far from doing Soveraignity any good, (for hitherto an inſtance cannot be cull'd out of any ſtory) as the reſt of the <hi>Puritans</hi> ſtudious for the reall peace of the Church and Kingdome; againſt both which, ſuch is their malice, that I could eaſily believe, that they Tutor up one another as <hi>Amilcar</hi> the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> did his young ſon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by making him ſwear to perſecute the <hi>Romans,</hi> with all fury

                     </p>
                     <p>Certainly Maſter <hi>John,</hi> was very well acquainted with the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>Collen,</hi> who bittingly diſtinguiſhed betwixt the <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> and the <hi>Arch-biſhop.</hi> And probably the <hi>Logicians</hi> in the long-winded <hi>Juncto,</hi> were beholden to theſe two cunning <hi>Pates,</hi> who could with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of dapperneſs, ſqueeze out of their infected brains, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten diſtinction, of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of a King, which is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Ex Coll. <hi>pag.</hi> 727.</note> ſome <hi>Pole-Axes,</hi> with a Gun, and tuck all in one piece: if one fail to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you, the other is certain of execution.

                     <p>However, if after all this, we ſhould grant (though I ſee ſmall reaſon for ſo doing) that the Presbyterians did contribute ſomething to his Majeſtie's reſtauration; yet will the credit (if rightly conſidered) be ſo little, that they have aboundance of confidence, who can boaſt of it.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did theſe three <hi>hopefalls</hi> retort, tearming all the old Knaves acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſelviſh, worldly, wicked, and onely of humany inſtitution: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his own <hi>Brats,</hi> ſo perplext old Father <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that (being naturally of a cholerick temper) he could no longer endure the injuries, and ingratefulneſs of theſe three <hi>Hot-ſpurs,</hi> who received life, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the ſhadow of his fiery zeal; but that which touch'd his heart moſt, was their plucking from him all Rule, and Authority, ſo that his credit could ſcarce obtain a beaſt to trott it to the next Lecture. Theſe affronts, ſufficient to make the Father run horn-mad, (and the multitude of <hi>Conventicles</hi> may allow ſome Presbyterian Cockolds, or elſe, what would the Siſter-hood do?) prompts him to a reſolution to free himſelf from the laſh of theſe his three boys, (who out ſtrip'd him in new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd zeal) and being thus grown mad with diſpair, and willing to ſubmit to any thing, ſo he might be freed from this yoak, and having conſulted his pillow, with aboundance of time and leaſure, he ſaw no way to quel theſe his inſulting Children, but the reſtauration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And becauſe a late repentance is better then none, he hoped by thus working his own benefit, to obtain his own pardon, knowing the King's mercy to be as great, as the Presbyterian wickedneſs. Thus for his own advantage, to obtain the return of his Majeſty, he procured a Parliament, which to the joy of the Nation recall'd the King, yet not according to the Presbyterian hopes, who expected not a free, but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional return.</p>

                     <p>And with this, I am pretty confident, the Brethren did not diſagree, is appearing by their long compliance, (yet hatred to be kept under) that they did not care, ſo be that they were but relieved from the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> ſlavery, though it were done by him, whom they always hated, and was the ſon of him, who they always held for the Common enemy; and whoſe friends, they had ſolemnly ſworn to puniſh, and ruin.</p>
                     <p>What good wiſhes theſe people had for the King, was meerly for their own ends, as I am apt to credit; when I conſider their high complying with <hi>Richard,</hi> one of their Chieftains, <hi>viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> applying himſelf ſeveral times to him by way of a <hi>faithful ſubject,</hi> and adviſing him how to behave himſelf the better to perpetuate his uſurp'd authority, and ſeem'd very diſcontented at his depoſing.

Thus I ſuppoſe the <hi>Query</hi> is ſufficiently ſatisfied, information being particularly given of their Opinions, and Actions, all running croſs-grain'd to the King, and his Intereſt; and therefore, I ſuppoſe, little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to his reſtauration: A taſt of which, you may ſee in theſe few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The late war againſt the King, was lawful, and commendable.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is lawful for Subjects to fight againſt their King; and ſo the oaths of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> of ſmall validity.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The King is not above the two Houſes of Parliament, and ſo they not ſubject to him.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. They are bound to oppoſe all Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, &amp;c. having exactly ſworn againſt them in the Covenant; and ſo againſt Church-government, appointed by the King, and the Laws.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. They are by the ſame Oath obliged to bring to condign Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all <hi>Malignants,</hi> that is, all thoſe who aſſiſted the King, and were ſufferers with him, here, or beyond-ſea: ſo that, had theſe men been ſuch a main ſtake in the King's reſtauration, they would, according to their Oaths, and Cruelty, either have ſtopt the King's friends (as the <hi>Scots</hi> did) from returning with him, or have proceeded againſt them as Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and Malignants, and ſo have butcher'd them out of this world, as they formerly did with the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bowcher,</hi> Maſter <hi>Yeomans,</hi> Maſter <hi>Tomkins,</hi> Maſter <hi>Challo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> Sir <hi>George Lyſle,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and ſeveral others; ſome by a diſſembling method of judicature, and other by the quick and ſpeedy mode of <hi>Abington.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. They never aſſiſted any Plot in behalf of the King: Nay, ſuffered him to be Murthered without one ſtroke, not taking the Royaliſts part in his relief. Nay, when a little before his murther, the Royal party roſe up in Armes for his reſcue, the Presbyterians of the Parliament oppoſed their actions, by Voting, and Ordering, whilſt thoſe in the Country fought againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. If this preſent King be as bad as his Father, [that is, thwart their Schiſmatical humours as much] they are bound to fight againſt him, and ſo not to reſtore him freely, as he was. For if they be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to oppoſe him ſo qualified, then was their late war againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unneceſſary, and ſo by their own confeſſion, themſelves Traytors. If again, they are bound to oppoſe him ſo qualified, then muſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the reſtauration of the preſent King, (ſo qualified) was more through their own goodneſs, and hopes of his amendment, than any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, or merit in himſelf. This ſhews, that they are for the King, onely when he is for their ends. And Conditional Subjects, in a Pure Monarchy, deſerve a Halter, rather then Commendation.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. None fit to be a Commiſſion-Officer, that would not affirm the late Rebellion lawful, ſo that it is no hard matter to judge, what a pretty <hi>Militia</hi> they would have had again; and being once up, God knows how they would have imploy'd them.</p>

IX. None is capable of being a Parliament-man that was ever on the Kings Party, unleſs he had recanted, and declared his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row therefore, by his after-adhering to the Parliament. So that the Faction of the Houſes ſo qualified, would preſently drive the King from <hi>White-Hall</hi> again, and, How would they then Tyrannize, having the <hi>Militia</hi> at their beck, as aboveſaid?</p>
                     <p n="10">X. They have quietly ſubmitted to every Party and uſurped Authority, yet grumble to live obedient to that commanded by the King and the Laws of the Land; ſo that it appears, that they have no great ſhare of Love or Obedience to <hi>Charles</hi> II. as their King and Soveraign; but it may be only, becauſe, he releas'd them from an <hi>Independent</hi> bondage, for which they deſerve no ſtore of thanks, their duty being rather bought, than freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
                     <p>How theſe Opinions and Actions can agree with honeſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, I cannot in the leaſt conjecture; And therefore, I muſt think it very improbable, that thoſe men ſhould freely, and without any Conditions, reſtore the Son, and ſet him over them, whoſe Father they had fought againſt, impriſoned, vilified, and baſely delivered up into the hands of his bloudy Executioners. Certainly, theſe Principles, can never quadrate with the free and uncapitulated Reſtauration of his Majeſty; ſome being unwilling to have him ride in on Horſe-back, and others looking as farr back as the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight.</hi>

                     <p>However, to pleaſure theſe people, I ſhall freely confeſs, that they have done <hi>this</hi> King a great deal of good, by making themſelves odious, his Parliaments obedient, himſelf by all confeſt to be Supream, and the People taught to beware of any more truſting to ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, ſince thereby, they are but cajoll'd to ſet up Uſurpers in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ruine themſelves; yet was all this not done by the conſent of the Brethren, they having all this while fought againſt them, and therefore cannot expect any thanks.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, if the Presbyterians did not aſſiſt the Kings return, then are they perjured, as neglecters of their Allegiance; And, if they were the Reſtorers, then are they perjured too, as neglecters of their <hi>League and Covenant,</hi> [For, its Obligation <hi>Crofton,</hi> and others of that gang, maintain to be perpetual] which, they ſo ſolemnly ſwore to defend, becauſe they did not bring to condign Puniſhment, the <hi>Malignants, (i. e.</hi> the Kings beſt friends) according to their Oath; all which they Voted <hi>Traytors.</hi> And how many of thoſe perſons of Quality, which return'd with his Majeſty, were by the Presbyterian faction excepted from Pardon, may appear in <note n="†" place="margin">1646. 1647. 1648.

That they all broak the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> is palpable; that they have not fulfill'd their <hi>Covenant,</hi> is as true: the firſt they did freely, the latter by conſtraint, as appears by their yet whining after it: So they could not be actively Inſtrumental: And, the <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> may boaſt of a forced Paſſive Subjection, as well as they.</p>

                        <p>What the <hi>Powder-plot</hi> intended, the <hi>Independent</hi> acted, and I am confident, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> acted more miſchief than <hi>Faux,</hi> or his Complices; Both of them were ſtopt in their deſigns and actions: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we know how farr the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would have gone, but we cannot underſtand what would have been the concluſion of the <hi>Puritans</hi> Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. As we have a <hi>fifth of November</hi> in memory of one, ſo ſhall we never think of the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> but in deteſtation of the other two.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Presbyter</hi> would repent his former Vindications of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their King. It would convert the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Indempnity,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> and people, inſtead of daſhing them in the teeth with their Iniquities, would pitty their former blindneſs. But, when at this day, they ſtill continue in the ſame faults, 'tis not a ſign of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, but real malice and enmity to that which is good. Still we hear them perſwade the people to the legality of the late Warr; and that, by conſequence, the ſame may be lawful againſt the Son, which was againſt the Father; and, that upon ſuch <hi>petit</hi> jealouſies as their factious brains can poſſeſs the poor people with all, whoſe eaſie natures are accuſtomed to take <hi>Pique</hi> againſt any thing, that their hot-ſpurr'd Parſon doth call <hi>Antichristian, Popiſh,</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> though two to one, that neither the Prater nor Hearer, underſtand what really, thoſe words ſignifie. Yet the Nation is come to that paſs, that the ignorant zeal of our <hi>Furies</hi> hath made the later drown the noyſe of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61643:106"/>
other two; That if the word <hi>Arminian</hi> be but named, How do the poor people ſtartle, and bogle themſelves into a ſweat? looking as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly, as if they had been rid with the <hi>Night-mare;</hi> a name, that gets a man more envy than the title of <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Infidel:</hi> the people in part knowing what theſe ſignifie; but for the <hi>Arminian,</hi> their ignorance of what he is, puts them into ſuch a fright, that they think themſelves never ſecure, till they get the deſtruction of theſe ſtrange creatures, for they do not know what things they are. Not unlike thoſe ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Facet. Bebel. <hi>lib. 3. p.</hi> 184.</note> of <hi>Munding</hi> (in <hi>Schwaben),</hi> who having by chance found a <hi>Crab,</hi> which none of them had ever ſeen before; by toling the Bell, as if their Enemies had been upon them, they all hurryed together, and did ſeriouſly conſult, what ſort of Animal it ſhould be; its creeping back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards putting a terrour into them all. At laſt, they enquired of a poor fellow amongſt them, becauſe, for his livelyhood, he had been farther from home than any of them, who ſaid it muſt be a <hi>Stag,</hi> or <hi>Pigeon:</hi> but this not ſatisfying, and they not knowing how to be reſolved; leſt it ſhould do them ſome miſchief, ſtanding a good way off, they, for the ſafety of themſelves and Town, very valiantly ſhot this Monſter; and leſt any of themſelves, or Cattle, ſhould be poyſoned or venom'd by it, they very carefully fortifi'd it about with a ſtrong fence. Thus ignorance muſters up all the jealouſies and fears that can be, and when theſe are once a Cock-Horſe, they can never want ſtuff to kindle up their hatred.</p>
                        <p>I need not trouble the Reader, by telling him, how Mr. <hi>John Corbet,</hi>

The beſt excuſe that I know for them, is; Their being drunk with Zeal, created in them a ſtrange ſpirit of Prejudice, which fancy'd the Nation to be in ſuch a diſtracted condition, that all things were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to diſtruction: And theſe good ſouls, thinking to free themſelves, and the Kingdom, from ſuch miſeries, buſled into a body to expel thoſe evils, which their debauch'd fury thought might give eaſe to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and quietneſs to themſelves.

But if theſe men have the liberty to create jealouſies and fears, they will alſo tell the people, that they are obliged to right themſelves, which is the only way to ſet up the Stage, that the Tragedy may be acted over again: But I hope the <hi>Lecturers</hi> and <hi>Pamphleters</hi> will forget their Parts, and then the People will be more unwilling and unfit for Action.</p>

And, which was an augmentation to their wickedneſ, they did not do this only to make themſelves Supream, but looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the higheſt Authority, they thought they might thereby law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do this and farr more; fancying the King to be as ſubject to their wills, as a Gally-ſlave to his Captain.

                        <p>How the Saints held theſe Queſtions, need not be ask'd; nor how partially they would go about them, (for I cannot well ſay, ſtudy them). When people once diſpute Authority, practice aſſures us that they are reſolv'd for the Negative; and, when ſuch queſtions as theſe are on purpoſe propos'd by a byaſs'd Zealot, the Intention is only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm people in Oppoſition. The Brethren long before this, had found the benefit of ſuch Diſcourſes, which made them now trudge in the ſame way: For their ſeditious Predeceſſors, in the Univerſity of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> inſteed of Divinity, had thruſt up theſe Politick Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>

Thus of one hand, I find the great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi>

However, this hits not our caſe, but the magnifying of thoſe who are really wicked, which <hi>Epithet</hi> (let them take offence that will) I ſhall freely beſtow upon our <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi> as being the Kings greateſt Enemies, the only cauſe of his ruine, and the murtherers of many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Loyal Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>By theſe Commendations, the People are made to believe that they are all <hi>Saints,</hi> thereby inticing the Countrey to chooſe them for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Repreſentees, that, under their protection, the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> might have more work to do: or elſe by having a good opinion of them, may ſtick cloſe to them upon all occaſions: and pitty, that the Cauſe theſe

                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe Commendations are but like <hi>Libanius</hi> the <hi>Sophiſter's</hi> applauding and praiſing <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> who amongſt the many moral vertues that there are, might poſſibly have a tincture of ſome. What goodneſs theſe people had, I know not, yet can I gueſs at a large portion of their miſchief. Only one ſhall be mine inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were the firſt Contrivers of theſe Wars, they conſulted the Rebellion, they broach'd it, and gave it life by their Votes and Declarations, whereby they cunningly inveagled others into their ſin; yet, (being degrees in wickedneſs), the worſt of their Souldiers, was not the tenth part ſo bad as theſe Members: the firſt being knaviſhly inticed to act the others Command; they contriv'd and plotted the Rebellion, and drol'd on the Countrey to be obedient to their Orders, under the ſpecious ſhew of <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> knowing the conſequence of the old Rule never fails:
<q>
                              <l>—Quoties vis fallere Plebem,</l>
                              <l>Finge Deum.—</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They cannot be good Subjects to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. that commend his Enemies; and, they deſerve no thanks from King <hi>Charles</hi> II. who praiſe thoſe, who did, and voted and declared it lawful to fight againſt his Father, thereby proclaiming to the World the legality of acting the ſame (if they could get occaſion) againſt the Son.</p>
                        <p>'Tis needleſs to tell you, how they violently made it their buſineſs, to clip and pare the Kings Prerogative, and Authority; and amongſt many other, frivolouſly plucking away the <hi>Militia,</hi> allowing the King through civility, to carry a Sword by his ſide, becauſe he's a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but not, upon any occaſion whatſoever, to draw it, that being forſooth, the office and priviledge of their hands; by which, hanging

a lock at his hilt, but they keeping the Keys; uſing him as they uſed their children, giving them Gold in a Box, which they muſt not finger, only pleaſe themſelves with its ratling; by which means, they will make themſelves a Negative Vote in Peace and Warr. And after this faſhion did their <hi>Covenanting</hi> Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> abuſe their King, taking all power of Arms into their own hands: their reaſon being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>The Kings Caſtles and Strengths are the Keys of the Realm;</hi> and <note place="margin">Large Declar. <hi>p.</hi> 379, 380.</note> they knew no reaſon to the contrary, but that they might keep <hi>their own Keys.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus would they make their King meerly Titular, and a perfect Slave and Captive to their Wills. Not unlike <hi>Sancho Panco,</hi> who for ſport-ſake was made Governour of the Iſlands, but had no Authority; nay, ſcarce liberty to eat his Victuals. The ruſtick <hi>Biſcayners</hi> cry up <note place="margin">Jo. de Laet. Hiſpan. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> their priviledges ſo much, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dare not go amongſt them but well armed and guarded: And good reaſon, for they think their King to have ſo ſmall Authority over them, that he muſt bare <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Geogr.</note> one of his legs, when he cometh upon the Frontiers of their Countrey; and, though they meet him as their King, with what bravery they can; and proffer him ſome few <hi>Maravidi's,</hi> [ſmall braſs-pieces, each of them about the value of a <hi>Scotch Turner,</hi> or <hi>Bodel,</hi> ſomewhat leſs than our <hi>Engliſh</hi> farthing] in a Leathern Bag, hung at the end of a Lance; yet, for all this ſhew of great kindneſs, they fairly tell him, that he muſt not take them.</p>
                        <p>This Nation hath long enough felt the ſmart of crying, <hi>Priviledges!</hi> and Majeſty it ſelf hath been dar'd by that ſpecious pretence. Though they give him the Name of King, yet they take all its Attributes to themſelves; though they call themſelves Subjects, yet like the <hi>Scots,</hi> they do not Petition, but with their Swords in their hands; at the firſt denyal ſounding an Alarum, and at the ſecond run themſelves ſo farr into Rebellion, that if ſomething be not granted them, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all: As if they had ſwallowed up their Obedience, with that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Whirl-pool in <hi>Pentland Frith,</hi> (in the North of <hi>Scotland)</hi> with which, if either Ship or Boat ſhall happen to encroach, they muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Lithgow's <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</hi> p. 505.</note> either throw over ſomething into it, as a Barrel, a piece of Timber, and ſuch like, or that fatal <hi>Euripus</hi> ſhall then ſuddenly become their ſwallowing Sepulcher. Thus the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> make their Obedience a Bargain, and, if Intereſt out-bid the King, He need not trouble himſelf by being a cuſtomer to theſe men: who allow him no power, but what they ſuppoſe he derived from them, and which they can take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again, when they ſee occaſion, or pleaſe.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are but <hi>Conditional Subjects;</hi> no longer obedient to their King, or acknowledging Him, than he ſerves their turn, and is ſubſervient to their fancies.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A <hi>Conditional Subject</hi> is the worſt Animal in a Kingdom, being the firſt Creature that ſhrinks from Government, and always ready to deſtroy the Peace of the Nation: for which, and other things, he will never want a reaſon grateful to the Rabble, as long as he can cry out, that his Subjection is but Conditional; and the Magiſtrate having broke his part, he's no more oblig'd to his duty: And this the people believing to be each mans caſe, will make themſelves Judges, by which means the Authority of a ſingle Perſon, will ever be out-voted, or over-worded.</p>
                     <p>That the King of <hi>England</hi> is Supream, is certain; That the greateſt wickedneſs in the World cannot un-King him, is as true. The Law of the Land obligeth us to ſubmit, and makes it Treaſon to reſiſt; and the Scriptures bids us <hi>Obey,</hi> but never Rebel, <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> Every man is born with the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and is as much obliged to its obſervance before, as after his taking it. Though the Prince were <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet would he be as much King, and have as much right to the Crown, and Rule, as if he were Presbyterian. 'Tis not the Religion of the Magiſtrate, but that in me (be what it will) that I do call Religion, or Conſcience, which obligeth my obedience to him. The <hi>Roman-</hi>Catholick had as much Reaſon and Law for their Gun-Powder Treaſon, as the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Puritans</hi> for their many Rebellions; and may, as to themſelves, as much rejoyce, for their delivery from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Tyranny, as they from the others intended cruelty; but in this they may both ſhake hands, and cry <hi>quits Brother:</hi> which hath made me ſmile as often as I hear a <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> rail againſt the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> for that wicked deſign, ſince themſelves have been as guilty; only ſome difference in the method, one putting their confidence in <hi>Fire,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Sword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The many Rebellions of theſe People, and their reſolutions never to lay down their Swords, till the King would ſatisfie them in what they pleas'd, is a ſufficient manifeſtation of their Conditional Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and, that they are not farther Subject to that Authority, than the King is obedient to their Wills; examples of which are yet freſh in every mans memory.</p>
                     <p>At the very beginning of their Rebellion, they having declar'd thoſe who adhear'd to the King to be Traytors, and He had done the ſame to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> unwilling to have the bloud of his Subjects ſhed, and delighting in Peace, ſent to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61643:113"/>
call in their <hi>Declarations</hi> againſt his Party, and he would call in all his againſt them and their Aſſociates; and, that both the Armies might be disbanded, an Act of Oblivion to be paſs'd, and a perfect Peace compos'd: And, What could be more gracious then this? yet this they deny: Nor will they hearken to any Overtures of a Treaty with him, unleſs he firſt call in all his <hi>Declarations</hi> againſt them, <hi>Disband</hi> his Army, yield himſelf to them, and permit thoſe who were with him to be proceeded againſt, and ſuffer as <hi>Delinquents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus will they have none of him, unleſs he ſubmit to them, and permit his beſt Friends to be ruined: And, yet theſe men muſt think themſelves ſo good Subjects, that they deſerve his Majeſties thanks for their ſo acting, and in ſo doing think themſelves Obedient enough in all Conſcience. But, if this be their duty, I wiſh they would tell me, what they think diſobedience to be.</p>
                     <p>This rejecting their Soveraign, is ſufficient to ſtop the mouths of theſe men from railing againſt Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. [call'd <hi>Hildebrand]</hi> who having excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> IV. would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve <note place="margin">Platina. <hi>p.</hi> 178.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Phaëton</hi> had no reaſon to queſtion his birth-right, unleſs <hi>Phoebus</hi> would allow him the command of his flaming Chariot, to the ruin of <note place="margin">Ovid. <hi>Met.</hi> l. 2.</note> the Youth and a great part of the World: And 'tis ſtrange <hi>Logick,</hi> and impudence in our <hi>Puritans,</hi> to deny themſelves to be Subjects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they command as Supream. A pretty mode to trample upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as if they had ſet for their pattern Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed <note place="margin">See <hi>Morney</hi>'s Hiſt. of Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>pag.</hi> 336.</note> of offering his Toe to be kiſt by <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> ſet his foot upon the Emperours neck.</p>
                     <p>If at the beginning of the Warr, they were ſo ſtubborn, as not to receive their King into their favour, unleſs he yield to their mercy, and ſuffer his friends to be diſtroy'd: he muſt expect ſtranger Conditions when they are heightned with bloud and villany. For then muſt he ask them Pardon, give them ſatisfaction, and carry nothing about him, but the bare Title, or elſe he ſhall be none of their King. To which purpoſe, a whole Club of them having ſufficiently rail'd againſt H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>How long before they had been reſolved to renounce their King and <note place="margin">In his Speech to the King at <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi> Auguſt. 1646.</note> his Government I know not, yet the Earl of <hi>Loudoun,</hi> then Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a pretty while before this, gave the King notice of their intentions, telling him that—<hi>Some are ſo afraid, others ſo unwilling, to ſubmit themſelves to your Majeſties Government, as they deſire not you nor any of your Race longer to raign over them.——If your Majeſty refuſe to aſſent to the Propoſitions, you will loſe all your Friends, loſe the City, and all the Country; and all</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>will join againſt you as one man, and (when all hope of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paſt) it is to be feard, They will proceſſe and depoſe you, and ſett up another Government.

                     <p>'Tis a pretty piece of Policy the People had got, firſt ſeditiouſly to ſwear a wicked Oath, and then to declare that it is ſo farr binding, That they cannot in Conſcience admit their lawful King to reign over them, unleſs he will ſwear and forſwear as faſt as they do. Should we ſwear to root out Presbytery root and branch, they would call it wicked, and no way obligatory; and, yet I am confident, we have as much right (if not more) to do ſo, than they had for the extirpation of Epiſcopacy. The Arch-Ducheſs ſwore never to put off her ſmock, and the Arch-Duke, that he would not eat, till <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſhould be taken; but Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> was not to be courted with ſuch babbles, but made them know the folly of ſuch raſhneſs, by the neceſſity of their nullity; and had he yielded upon the foppery of preſerving them from perjury, it's probable Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him with an halter; but he was too wiſe to be catch'd with ſuch chaffe.</p>

Is not this a very gratious Petition and Condeſcention? Can any man deſire the Society of more peaceable Brethren? Who only deſire, that their <hi>Covenant</hi> [made againſt all Laws and Authority, yet they hold its Obligation to be perpetual] might be confirm'd; yet, if it be not, for Peace-ſake, they are very willing to agree with the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party according to the Covenant. O theſe are loving ſouls, and hate Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a Beggar doth a liberal Alms; and truly the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy is as much beholden to them as <hi>Montroſs</hi> was.

                        <p>To me it ſeems a ſtrange piece of malicious Ignorance, in them, who will allow ſome knaviſh <hi>Lawyers</hi> to get by their prating, ſome ignorant <hi>Phyſitians</hi> by diſtruction, ſome couſening <hi>Trades-men</hi> by falſe dealing, and ſome murthering <hi>Souldiers</hi> by plundring [for ſome ſuch there are in all faculties, though their callings be lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable] two, three, or four Thouſand pounds a year: and yet think it an hard caſe or unlawful, for a Reverend Biſhop or Clergy-man [who hath ſpent many years, and all his own means in hard ſtudy, and is held the moſt honourable preferment, as much as the Soul excels the Body] to poſſeſs that which other good charitable men have freely given him: ſince ſuch a deed of gift is ſo farr from endamaging our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Grumblers, that it is a main encouragement for their ſtudies and preferment. If they ſay, as I have heard, that theſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorſhips were given not to the men, but the <hi>Dioceſſes;</hi> by this retort they malepertly reflect upon the Kings diſcretion, whoſe wiſdom thinks ſuch men fit for, and capable of, ſuch Places.

Beſides theſe and others, they have another way to ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">V.</note> of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and the peace of the Nation. They know full well that nothing ſeems more formidable to the vulgar, then a ſtory of Gods ſtrange judgments upon this or that: And if they queſtion the verball Narrative, ſhew it them in print and 'tis ſufficient; they having not confidence enough to deny that which cometh from the Preſs. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Spirit will fright theſe people out of their little witts, and the relation of ſuch a terrible accident (though falſe) will force the poor ſouls to a bleſſing of themſelves, from ſuch people againſt whom God hath ſuch an enmity.</p>
                        <p>Thus at the beginning of the Warres, <hi>John Vicars</hi> afrighted many of the weaker ſort, from having any agreement with the Kings party, by fobbing into their heads ſtrange ſtories of Gods wrath againſt <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</hi> And thus they now ſet themſelves awork again by abuſing the vulgar with ſuch fopperies. What ſtrange judgments do they threaten to theſe Nations, if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Common-prayer</hi> book be not taken away! And what ſad Revolutions do they denounce, if they be not remov'd!

                     <p>Since the reformation this <hi>mode</hi> of ſwearing againſt Authority, hath been commonly practiſ'd in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In their firſt Covenant [3 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> 1557.] An Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was the firſt ſubſcriber and chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter; and how active an Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> hath been in our days, about ſuch wickedneſſe, need not here be related, but I hope, as the other was the firſt, ſo this ſhall be the laſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet in this way, hath the <hi>Engliſh</hi> been as faulty as the worſt of them, <note place="margin">

For when at the beginning of the Warres, the <hi>Engliſh Commiſsioners</hi> went from the <hi>Parliament</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to deſire their aſſiſtance againſt the King; and having addres'd themſelvs to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Aſſembly delivering them a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubſcribed by ſome <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, in which they complaind that <hi>their blood was ſhed like water upon the grouud, for defence of the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion,</hi> they receiv'd a negative anſwer. The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> telling them amongſt other things, That—<hi>you cannot ſay</hi> you fight <hi>for the</hi> Reform'd <hi>Religion, ſince you have not begun to</hi> reform <hi>your Church; ye

had thriven better if you had don as we did; Begun at the</hi> Church, <hi>and thereafter ſtriven to have gotten the civil ſanction to what ye had don in the Church.</hi> A few days after Sir <hi>W. Ermin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners, were invited by ſome of their friends to make a new Addreſs to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> which they did the ſecond time deſiring a gracious Anſwer. Upon this requeſt, the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them this, <hi>Will ye join in</hi> Covenant <hi>with us to</hi> reform Doctrine <hi>and</hi> Diſcipline, <hi>conform to this of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and ye ſhall have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Anſwer?</hi> Sir <hi>W.

                     <p>Thus was this ſpurious Wretch illegally begotten, and brought forth by unlawful Parents, by the <hi>Scots</hi> worſhip'd and ador'd as the only Idol, fit to bleſs their undertakings; and by their Brothers in miſchief, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Long <hi>Parliament,</hi> embraced; who peremptorily enjoyn all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſwear Allegiance to it, as their only ſupream Law, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick <hi>Shibuleth</hi> to diſtinguiſh Treaſon from Loyalty. Though what authority they had to impoſe ſuch an Oath, (being againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand both of King and Law) muſt be left for Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to diſcover in ſome <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> ſince we have no ſuch cuſtome amongſt us.

                     <p>However it cannot but ſeem ſtrange to any that theſe men ſhould ſwear to extirpate the Government of the Church by Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have been confirmd by 32 <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> And they could never yet tell who made them Rulers over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and gave <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Pierce's</hi> New diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>pag.</hi> 222.</note> them power to ſuch actions, quite contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the laws of the Land, and the Kings expreſs command.

They ſwear to extirpate <note n="*" place="margin">When the <hi>Covenant</hi> was taken, they thought the King to be a Papiſt, which makes the Oath more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, becauſe thoſe who thought ſo, ſwore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate him.</note> Popery <hi>without reſpect of perſons.</hi> In which they might be ask'd, What they would do with the Queen?

                     <p n="3">3. §. By this Oath they commit abſolute High Treaſon, by nulling ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> made for the Preſervation of the King and his friends.

                     <p>In the year 1646. the <hi>Parliament</hi> remaining Conquerours, many of the Loyal Party thought it fit to compound for their Eſtates; better to have ſomething than nothing. Amongſt thoſe, in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who were put to this hardſhip, were Mr. <hi>Richard Brereton</hi> of <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> and others: This highly perplext the <hi>Committee</hi> then at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who therefore wrote ſeveral Letters to the Youths at <hi>Goldſmiths-</hi>Hall, deſiring them never to take ſuch friends to the King, into Compoſition; and one of their great ſticklers at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> [Mr. <hi>S.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61643:128"/>
by their late National</hi> Covenant, <hi>to do their duty in their place to bring</hi> Delinquents <hi>to condign puniſhment.</hi>—Here they will have no mercy, but ſtick cloſe to their wicked Principles. And this Oath muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Interpretation: For, if we endeavour but to mitigate it, then ſome ſtrange curſe or other will tumble upon the Nation, as <hi>Crofton</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. §.

                     <p>O the Obedience and Charity of a <hi>Covenanter?</hi> who, like the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> combine together by <hi>Oath,</hi> to kill thoſe more holy than themſelves; <note place="margin">Act. 23. 12, 13, 14.</note> needs muſt the malice of theſe men be ſo violent, that they may be excus'd from ſaying the <hi>Lords-Prayer;</hi> the very clauſe of <hi>forgiving their Enemies,</hi> being enough to fright them into Diſpair, I wiſh I could ſay, Repentance; but, that is a thing, their zealous fury will not give them ſo much as leave to think on: all of them hurryed on with that bloody rage, as to cry out with that <hi>Levite</hi> in the Poet;</p>

And, as they would thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it in fury, ſo did they begin it, as I have ſhew'd you before; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall afford you one other piece of Canting confidence. Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Cant</hi> the Father (for the Son is now as bad,) in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> told the <hi>Scots</hi> concerning their <hi>Covenant, That he

was ſent to them with a</hi> Commiſſion <hi>from Chriſt to bid them ſubſcribe</hi>

                        <hi>the</hi> Covenant, <hi>which was Chriſt's</hi> contract; <hi>and, that he himſelf, was come a Wooer to them for the Bridegroom; and call'd upon them, to come to be hand-faſted, by ſubſcribing that Contract.</hi> And told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That he would not depart the Town till he got the names of all, who ſhould refuſe to ſubſcribe that</hi> Contract, <hi>of whom he promis'd to complain to his Maſter,</hi> i. e. Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>As for the Obligation of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> they themſelves are ſometimes forced to deny it, unleſs they will make it a particular exception againſt all General Rules. When the <hi>Scots</hi> in 1639. were a little troubled that <note place="margin">Large Declar. <hi>p.</hi> 347.</note> 
                        <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was not abſolutely abjured in their former Oaths, which many thought binding to them; The <hi>Covenanters</hi> thinking to take away that rub, that all men might with more freeneſs embrace their <hi>Covenant,</hi> declare publickly to the World, that the ſwearer is neither obliged to the meaning of the preſcriber of the Oath, nor his own meaning, but as the Authority ſhall afterwards interpret it; and then, by this Heatheniſh rule, what will become of the binding force of the <hi>Covenant</hi> at this time? Which is void alſo in the opinion of a great <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> under the name of <hi>Theophilus Timorcus,</hi> who thus ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,—<hi>Suppoſe, that upon mature deliberation, the Miniſters</hi>

                        <hi>that ſubſcribed and took the</hi> Oath of Canonical Obedience, <hi>find that it was an unlawful Oath, or Subſcription,—They are in ſuch caſe only obliged to be humbled for their raſh ſubſcription and taking of that Oath, and their ſecond Oath againſt them will hold valid.</hi>—Now if they think, this a ſufficient <hi>ſalvo,</hi> I ſhall only inſert theſe four words, <hi>Holy League and Covenant</hi> inſtead of the fore-mentioned four words <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> and think the Abſolution ſufficient according to their own Argument.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Oath</hi> which the King taketh at his <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> for the defence of Biſhops, is of ſmall validity, becauſe limited <note place="margin">Faſtning of St. <hi>Pet.</hi> Fett. <hi>pag.</hi> 100.</note> to the Laws of the Land. But will this ſubordinate it to the <hi>Covenant?</hi> Or will he make a little ſcribble-ſcrabble of a few perjured Rebels to be the Law of the Land? If the Kings Oath, and other mens Oaths, muſt ſubmit to the Laws of the Land; I know no reaſon, but the <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhould too, being expreſly againſt them: So, that either the <hi>Covenant</hi> muſt null the <hi>Laws,</hi> or the <hi>Laws</hi> the <hi>Covenant;</hi> If the firſt, then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Poulton,</hi> ſince the ſwearing of <hi>Presbytery</hi> can make thoſe <hi>Statutes</hi> uſeleſs; if the latter, then adieu <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>League,</hi> and ſince that, the names of the Parliament-men ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Parchment, (a great ſign of the Loyalty and good Religion of the preſent <hi>Commons,</hi> (who in this have excell'd all other <hi>Parliaments,</hi> for many Generations paſt; let others commend themſelves for me) that were burnt by the hands of the Hangman in <hi>London,</hi> by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, a Supream Power to that which made and forced it.</p>
