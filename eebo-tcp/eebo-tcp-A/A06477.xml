         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Of this your godly change none is more glad then I: for I haue perswaded you as much as I might to despise worldly pleasures, to be patient in trouble, not to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly losses, not to mourne for the Godly death of your friends, nor to be carefull for any worldly calamitie: for I haue tolde you many a time and oft, that neither perfite felicitie, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame misery, are to bee founde in this life: Therefore this your godly alteration maketh me beleeue, that either you haue beene in some godly mans company, or at some learned mans Sermon, which is Gods appointed ordinarie meanes, to win the wicked.</hi>

               <p>Though I am changed, yet it is not

by any good counsell, nor by any preaching or Sermon, as you suppose, for I neuer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that company that vsed any vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous talke, or would giue any godly counsel: and as for preachings or sermons, I cared not much for them, mary sometimes (but that was verie seldome) I went to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">

My gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made me proude, my wealth made me stout, I disdained them that were poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then I, and I enuied the prosperitie of mine enimy, and (to say, the truth) I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worse after I had heard the Sermon then I was before. Therfore say what they

listed and preach what they woulde, all my whole minde was still in getting worldly wealth, pampering my bodie, and feeding my fancie, making no account of heauen nor hell, nor of God nor the diuell.</p>

                  <hi>That is most certaine, for who hath power to awake, when nature constraineth him to sleepe, who can remember all things that he will, and forget nothing? Who hath free will to performe to go to any place and at any time that he will appoint? who hath free will to be healthfull and not to be sicke? or to haue his wits perfitely and neuer to bee made? Or what healthfull man can fast foure or fiue daies, and will not bee hungry? None on the earth I am sure. Now, if we haue not free-will to doo the workes of men and earthly thinges, then howe is it possible that we should haue free-will to doo the woorkes of God or heauenlie things?</hi>

               <p>Seeing you are desirous to know, I will not be vnwilling to tell you: it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that of late I &amp; a sort of wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (that neuer loued God, nor feared the diuell) did sup altogither, where we lacked neither fine fare, daintie dishes, plentie of wine, pleasant musike, nor any thing els that might make vs merry. If you had seene our vnreasonable quaffing, our abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble talking, and heard our detestable swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, you would haue taken vs for diuels, correspendent to my name, in the likenesse of men. And when we were in the middes of our cups, one of our Minstrelles gaue vs a Song, touching Fasting, Praying, and Almes deeds, and reprooued swearing, drunkennes and other sinnes: but he might haue sunge it to the wall as well as to vs: and then one of my company saide to him that sunge the Song: Sirra, this Song is more meete for a Church then a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, few come to Tauernes to fast, pray, and giue Almes: I meane not, saith hee, to weaken my body with too much fasting, I will eate fast, and drinke fast, and that is the fast that I meane to fast. Then saide an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I meane not to wast my goods with giuing of Almes, I will not maintaine a
<pb facs="tcp:9437:7"/>
sort of idle knaues &amp; Drabs with my goods, I haue got it my selfe, and why shoulde I not spende it on my selfe? Let the sermon runners and pitifull protestantes releeue them: marry when I am at the point of death, and when I see that I can keepe my goods no longer, perhaps I wil appoint by my will, that some poore folkes shall haue halfe penny dole, or a halfe penny loafe, but surely as long as I liue, they get none. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> said the thirde, you are not so vnwilling to giue Almes, but I am as vnapt to pray, and (to say truely) what neede a man pray for any thing that lackes nothing: I haue health, wealth, and liberty, what would one haue more? Therefore, if I pray, I should pray for nothing, for I lacke nothing: but what mad man wil pray for nothing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore least I should be counted a mad man, I will not pray at all.</p>
               <p>Then said another of our company, Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, your Song is against drinking, which you call drunkennesse, but I will not leaue driming for al your song: for drinking wel ouer night maketh me to sleepe soundly all the night after, and my sound sleeping ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me haue a good memory. Sir (said the Minstrel) you are happy that such a good
<pb facs="tcp:9437:7"/>
commodity commeth vnto you by drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which you count quaffing or drinking, for I haue bin drunken diuers times, which I fore repent, and thereupon I haue slept soundly: but I could neuer perceiue that it brought me any good memory: For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not my sinne committed to God through my drunkennesse, which in deed had bin a good memory: for thereby perhappes might haue growne repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tance for the same, so that I cannot thinke that any such fruite as good memory is, can grow out of quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and drunkennesse. Howe like you this Minstrell (said I) hath he not made a good argument against you: I will haue no moe such minstrels in my company, (said he) at my handes therefore he shall fare the worse, and his reward shalbe the lesse. And now let both Ministers and Minstrels say what they will, I will quaffe and drinke whiles I may: mary some say it will make me blind before I am halfe old, but that is no matter: for I were as good drinke mine eyes out while I am aliue, as haue the wormes eate them out when I am deade. Thus euerie one said something in comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ding or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sinne that he liked and when we had thus wasted the time in surfeiting, too much
<pb facs="tcp:9437:8"/>
drinking, vaine sporting, and sinfull tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to the hurting of our bodies, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of our goods, to the euill example of our neighbours, to the griefe of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the daungering of our soules, and to the high displeasing of God, wee euery one tooke our leaue of other. But some (I may say to you) was enforst to be lead home. And so I for my part went to bed, without either knowledging of God, or feeling my sinne, and so more like a bruite beast then the Image of God, I fell a sleepe.</p>

You knowe that no man can repent, vnlesse he knowledge his sinne, neither can any be forgiuen, vnlesse he aske mercie, neither can mercie be graunted without firme faith in Christ, without al which (by your owne saying) you fell a sleepe. I assure you the stoutest man that euer was, neuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured himselfe in such a daunger, though he were enforced to fight alone, against ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, and as many monsters, neither was he in such a hazard, if he were of a perfite faith and put his whole trust in God (for he did but aduenture the losse of his short life in this worlde) but you did hazarde the losse of your
<pb facs="tcp:9437:8"/>
euerlasting life in the ioyfull kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, therefore it standes vs all vpon, to watch &amp; pray, both at our rising in the morning and in our trauels in the day time; yea, and at night before we fall a sleepe, and then to remember our sinnes past, to bewaile the same, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aske mercie of God therefore, and firmely to beleeue the forgiuenes thereof, through the death and passion of Christ. He that sleepeth on this pillow, sleepeth safely, though he sleepe not soundly, but he that slepeth on the softest down pillow in the world, without this, he may sleepe soundly, but I am sure he doth not sleepe safely.</hi>

                     <hi>marke this.</hi>
                  </note> though they haue earthly honour for awhile as I had, they shall haue endlesse horrour in hell as I haue: for graudy geere on earth, they shall haue gnashing of teeth in hell: for vaine same on earth, they shall haue shame in hell: for curtisy and waiting, they shall haue curssednes and wailing, for shorte wealth endlesse want, for fine fare continual famishing, for pleasant perfumes most stincking smels, &amp; for short pleasures on earth, euerlasting paines in hell. Oh if they felt that I feele, they woulde doe as I would doe on earth, if I were there: then said the diuell to him, what wouldest thou doe if thou werte liuing on the earth againe?</p>
               <p>Then saide Diues, I woulde to God
<pb facs="tcp:9437:13"/>
that I were there as I was to prooue: for then I would so repent my sinnes, and call to God for his mercie in Christ Iesu, that I would not doubt: nay, I am most assured I should not onely escape this doleful place where I am: but also attaine the endlesse ioyes of heauen: from whence I am nowe excluded for euer. If I were now liuing on the earth, and if I were ten thousand times richer then I was, and might liue ten times longer then I did, knowing that I know, and feeling that I feele, I would so frame my selfe to exercise the scriptures, and to followe the worde of God, that my flesh should not intice me, the world shoulde not allure me, nor all the diuels in hel should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me. Then said the diuell, hee were a wily fellow that I could not deceiue, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued thy first parents. Adam and Eue in paradise, and caused them to breake Gods commaundement, spoken to them there, then doost thou thinke that I coulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and allure thee to neglect God and his worde, declared on the earth, if thou were there aliue againe. Many that God plagues on the earth dayly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Promises to God broken.</hi>
                  </note> do call and cry vppon God in their tormentes and paine, and doo promise vehemently, that if euer
<pb facs="tcp:9437:13"/>
they recouer or be restored to their health againe, they will turne ouer a newe leafe, they will change their life, and amend their liuing, but when they haue their health as they had before, or be out of paines as they were before, then they are as euill, or worse then they were before. When God hath once serued their turne, they care no more for him, and then they are ruled by me, that could not helpe them: nay, seeke their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>Then said Diues, though they that God plagues with vehement sicknesse and other paines and torments on the earth, do forget God, and their promise when they be well: either for that they presume too much on Gods mercie, or els forget or beleeue not that there are such euerlasting paines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the wicked, or els assuring themselues to repent, and aske mercie at their death, which is but a very brickle staff to leaue or stay on: yet if I were aliue on the earth, no worldly felicitie should tempt me, no pleasure shuld procure me, no wealth should win me, nor no delicates should draw me, to forget that God, that made all thinges for man, that sent his onely sonne to dye for man, and hath prepared his kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:9437:14"/>
of heauen for man, neither to doo any thing to offende God, or daunger my soule, that flesh and blood through Gods grace, were able to refuse. For it is farre vnlike that they that are aliue on the earth, shoulde bee so earnest, and warie in the way to walke to heauen, or to flie from the way to hell, as I, that haue vtterly lost these euerlasting ioyes of heauen, and that feeles the fierie flames of hell. But when they are heere where I am, then they will lament as I doe and then they woulde giue all the world, (if it were theirs to giue) to bee but one houre aliue on the earth, to repent their sinnes, and to call for Gods mercy in the death of Iesus Christ. But then alas it wil be too late for them, as it is now for me. Oh the greatest paynes on earth is pleasure and ioy, in comparison to the torments of hell. Then said the diuell, and the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure on the earth are extreme tormentes to the ioyes of heauen.</p>
               <p>Then saide Diues, why didst thou lose the ioyes that thou hadest. Then the Diuell saide, why did thou lose the ioyes thou mightest haue had: to whom Diues saide, if I had knownes the ioyes of heauen as well as thou didst, and had beene in heauen
<pb facs="tcp:9437:14"/>
as well thou wast, I woulde not haue lost heauen as thou didst: then saide the diuell, I may thanke my pride for it: for if I could haue beene content with my estate, which was too good for me I had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there still, but I presumed to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and therefore I was brought lower: for whereas I was the chiefest Angell in Heauen, nowe am I the chiefest diuell in hell. And so haue I lost heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> for hel, where I with al my fellowes that tooke my part, and fel from heauen with me, shal remaine in most extreme and endlesse torments for euer: whereat I tremble and quake. Then said Diues, euen so I by my pride, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse on earth, haue lost God for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, heauen for hell, and endlesse ioyes for euerlasting paines: but thou wicked Fiend was the cause why our first parent Adam was cast out of Paradise which was the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting away of him and all his seede.</p>
               <p>Then saide the diuell, it spighted mee so much that man should haue my roome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I lost, that, wilily and subtily,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The enuie and spight of the diuel to man.</hi>
                  </note> I entised him to fall, whereby he did not only loose the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, and the ioyes that he prepared for him: but also he &amp; all his seede became the children of wrath and damnation: and so
<pb facs="tcp:9437:15"/>
they shoulde become my companinons in hell. Then said Diues, but God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull goodnesse preuented thy wicked and most enuious drift, in making his onely sonne being God, to become man, who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him selfe to the death of the Crosse for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> redemption of mankind which is a sufficient satisfaction for mans transgression, whereby the godly repentant sinners that beleeue in him shall be saued and clensed from their sinnes, and be counted the Sonnes of God, as though they had neuer sinned, I knowe that too well, saide the Diuell, which is almost as great a griefe vnto me as mine owne fall out of heauen. For, whereas before I thought to haue all mankinde to beare me company in hel: now I shal lacke a great sort of them: but I am glad of one thing, the greater number will bee mine, saide the Diuell: for all the heathen, and worshippers of Idolles, are the children of damnation, liue they neuer so honestly and vertuously in the sight of the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the most parte of the worlde doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
               <p>Then saide Diues, that is true, and onely the true and repentaunt Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that fauour and loue the Gospell, and
<pb facs="tcp:9437:15"/>
haue all their Faith and hope in Christe, touching their saluation shall be saued, and none els, brag they neuer so much? yea, said the diuell, that is it that maketh mee glad, for a great sort of them that are named Christians, doo liue worse then the heathen, and dye worse then dogs, so that they shall be damned as well as the heathen, whome Christes death can not profite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for all Christs-death.

                     <hi>Moe shall be damned then saued.</hi>
                  </note> hell shall possesse the greater part. That is too true saide Diues (the more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) for Christ saith (which is the very truth it selfe, and cannot lie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.</note>) <hi>Wide is the gate, and broade is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and manie there be that goe in thereat: but straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth vnto life, and fewe there be that finde it.</hi> And also be saith: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie are called, and few be chosen.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that there shalbe a far greater number that shalbe damned then saued, of which greater and damned number I am one: woe, woe, to mee therefore: but if I were aliue on the earth againe, but one halfe houre, as I was before (which can not be) I would not doubt, but to be one of
<pb facs="tcp:9437:16"/>
that litle small number, that shoulde enter into heauen: Nay, so that I were aliue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as I was,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble saying of Diues.</hi>
                  </note> I would not care to be all my life, though I liued fiue thousand years, in continuall paynes and tormentes: yea, and if it were possible, to bee all that while as a Log at a fire backe, continually bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without any ease or refreshing one minute of an houre, for that cruell bodilie burning would once haue an end, but this extreme spirituall torment in hell will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ende. Then the diuell answered him againe: yea, but when thou was on the earth, thou wouldest suffer no paine for Gods sake, thou preparedst so for thy vile and earthly carkasse, that no colde shoulde hurt thee, neither any heate might annoy thee, but thou couldest suffer Lazarus one of thy poore brethren, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bers of Christ (without all pittie and compassion) to lie in the streetes, most miserably in the cold, and to perish through hunger. But thou hast gained nothing by it: and he hath lost nothing by it. For hee shall haue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting ioyes, and thou shalt haue endlesse sorrowes. Therefore now he may be called rich Lazarus, and thou poore Diues. Wo is me, said Diues, therefore, I disdained
<pb facs="tcp:9437:16"/>
him so much, that I thought scorne to looke on him, I esteemed my Dogges bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then him: they were in my fine house, and were fedde from my table, but I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Lazarus to lye without my gates, and would giue him neuer a whit, O howe pittiles was I, I muse how I could bee so hard hearted, Fie on me wretch, fie on me caitife, would I haue bin contented to haue bin so vsed, if I had bin in his case? No no, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all earthly persons take heede by me, and do as they would be done vnto, and then they cannot doo amisse, and not to pamper their paunches, but to pittie the poore, nay, to spare from themselues, and to giue it to the poore. O howe many poore might I haue releeued, with that which I haue spent in vaine, and what am I the better nowe for any thing that I did spend on my selfe: Therefore I would to God that I had bestowed al my riches, treasure, and landes, in releeuing the poore, for then I should haue beene repayed at Gods hand hereafter: whatsoeuer is giuen to the poore is lent to the Lorde,<note place="margin">

               <p>No, that it did not, therefore now I will proceede with my dolefull dreame, Diues furthermore sayde, O how hapy are they that are on the earth, for that they haue time to repent, and to liue, godly, to whom the Deuill answered: yea, but how vnhappy are they that will not repent, but liues most abhomiably and wickedly. Then saide Diues, if their hearts were not hardned and their mindes bewitched, they woulde not doe so, they I perceiue make little account of that precious Iewell the Gospell, which teacheth them the high way to Heauen, and so to shune the fiery flames of hell. Oh, if I were a liue againe, it should neuer goe out of my hand. Then said the deuill many cary it in their hands but very fewe in their hearts. Then said Diues, yf they that haue the gospell walke in the way to Hell: then it is impossible for them that know it not, to walke in the way to heauen. But I damned wretch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am, (if I were

Then sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuil to Diues, if thou werte on the earth againe aliue as thou wast, yet I doe not beleeue thou wouldst doe as thou saist, thou wouldest play rather as many theeues do that are condemmned to death, which wil promise with vehement othes that if they might haue ther pardons, would liue honestly, ciuilly, and obserue their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lawes, but when they haue got their pardon, they forget either oth or promise,<note place="margin">

               <p>Yea, saide the Deuil, but because thou wast proude in thy apparell,<note place="margin">

now thou accurst and vnhappy, and shalt dwell with mee for euer in the fierie flames of Hell. Then said Diues there is no remedy, I must needes doe so, woe bee to me therefore.</p>

                  </note> and then I should obtaine mercy, and so I should be happye and blessed. Then sayde the Diuill, but because thou wast a mercilesse wretch, thinking all to little for thine owne backe and bellye, and fared dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, and was clothed sumtuously, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring poore Lazarus the member of thy christ to dye at thy Gate for wante of foode, (who had to little, thou to much of which thy too much, if he had had but a little, his life might haue beene saued, and thou the more healthfull,) therefore thou accurssed and exempt from the prescence of GOD, and shalt dwell in my companie and my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low deuiles for euer. How saist thou diues? hath not thy mercilesse minde, thy aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of fine fare, thy proud apparell, and thy greate riches and welth, brought thee into a good case? Then sayd Diues, if these greedy, pittiles, and mercilesse rich men now on the earth knew my case, vnlesse the

Deuill were on them, they woulde auoide my case. Then sayd the Diuell, I am not onely on them, but with them, and in them, nay, they are as thou thoughtst thy brethren were, they must haue one come from hel, to tell them newes that thou art heere, or els they will not beleeue. For I haue so harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, that they will not beleeue it, though one should come out of Hel to tel them thereof. For though Christ had come downe from the crosse, at the wicked Iewes commandement, yet they would haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in him neuer the more. Thy case is preached vnto them dayly out of the Gospel, but they are no more sterred thereat, then a milstone is mooued with a blaste of ones mouth. For when these rich gluttons come from the Sermon, wherein the preacher dooth threate them with thy being in hel, for thy vnmercifulnesse to poore Lazarus, and thundring out vnto them, that if they bee not mercifull to their poore Brethren, and releeue theire needy necessity, they shal with out all doubt bee companions with thee in hell: they for all that, doe goe shrinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or looking disdainfully on their poore, naked, and hungry brethren, without giuing them one penne or any mercifull or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="tcp:9437:20"/>
wordes, or causing any reliefe at al to be prepared for them: Which makes me hope verely, that I shal haue them here in hel with thee ere it be long.</p>
               <p>Then sayde Diues, Oh, but if I were in their place and case, I woulde make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing that I shoulde haue: al my minde shoulde be in shewing mercy and pittie, to the needie. For Christ at the last day,<note place="margin">

No, no, it is not money, but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not pride, but pittie, not lofttnesse, but loue, nor gay clothes, but charitie, that then wil serue their turne.

darlings, and the curssed children of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: and for their peace-breaking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention &amp; strife, though God forsake them, yet I will not refuse them, but they shall dwell with thee Diues, and me, in my fierie kingdome of hell for euer, and that is long enough: yea, and these lustie Cutters,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that for euery trifling quarrell, standing so in their reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of their manhood, wil make fraies, fight and kill: (yea, though they be killed or hanged for their labour) are my Curssed, Deere, and louing children (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that fighters be peace-makers) &amp; they shall dwell with mee for euer in the fierie flames of hell, if they proceede on as they do, and there I wil tame them wel enough, though nowe on the earth, they be lusty and liuely Laddes.</p>
               <p>Then saide Diues, it is a straung mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they will aduenture so desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to obtaine the terrible torments of Hel, but they will not aduenture their life: nay, haue their finger feele the fire for Christs sake, there by to inherite the endlesse ioyes of the kingdome of heauen. Marke what fonde fooles these fighters bee, though they neither kill nor be killed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet bee hurt or maymed, yet they

are Peace-breakers, and are in hatred with their brother,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke the fondnes of fighters &amp; what gaine they get.</hi>
                  </note> and so they are accursed, and are become the Children of the diuel, whose estate is most miserable, horrible, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: but if they be killed, their spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde hath made them loose their life, which they esteemed aboue any earthlie treasure, but if they died vnrepentantlie (which in their furious fighting is to bee feared,) then their enuious minde hath wrought the death, both of their bodie and soule for euer, in the fierie flames of hell fire.</p>
               <p>And if they doo kill their enemie with whom they fight, than they are in daunger of hanging, and so they shall loose their life, which is their greatest earthly treasure, for satisfying their spightfull and enuious mind one halfe houre: but in that he hath fought, being therby a peace-breaker, he is become the cursed childe of the diuell, and if hee repent not, and call not to God for mercie, then shall the bee damned for euer in the bottomlesse pit of hell, with me and the diuelles for euer. And if either chance too, to be wounded or maimed, then the pleasure of their short fighting, will not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the long griefe, or sorrow of their hurt.
<pb facs="tcp:9437:29"/>
Therefore, what fooles are these enuious and lusty fighters, that for so smale pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: nay, rather a deuilish satisfying of their wicked minde, will hazard themselues into such a daunger.</p>
               <p>Then said the deuill, I set them on, I tickle them to it, and I set one or other to whisper in their eare, saying: sir, you are a lusty gentleman, you are counted a man of your hands, if you suffer this, you wil neuer be wel though of, therefore, if I were in your case, I would not put it vp thus: and and then the other is on a fire, vntill he be a fighting: and so many giues wages &amp; gifts, to set themselues forward to the deuill. And thus both peace-breakers and such sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I account as mine own accursed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but if they once dye in their peace-breaking trade, and in their enuious and furious minde: then they are my children in deede for euer, and they shall neuer goe out of my kingdome, nor company.

and so enioy the euerlasting ioyes of heauen. Which suffrings, were they a whole thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres, are farre vnworthy thereof, whereas if I should reuengs mine owne wrongs, &amp; beare mallice and spight, though they bee my mortall enimies, God woulde cease to reuenge my cause: for hee wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge no causes, but such as are committed to him, then I shoulde be a peace-breaker, and so become the cursed childe of the diuel, as I am alredy.

If they search the Gospell, they shall finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places that make mention of hell. And in the same Chapter, where he saith they shalbe in daunger of hell fier, that say. Thou foole, hee maketh mention twise of hell, saying:</hi>

                  <hi>It is better for thee that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body shoulde be cast into hell. And likewise immediatly in the same place, he saith the like wordes. So that no wise mand will thinke, that Christ would haue made mention of hell thrise in one chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnlesse that there had beene a hell. They may as well say, there is neuer a heauen, as to say, there is neuer a hell,</hi>

                  <hi>and they may as well affirme there is neuer a diuell. And I feare such thinke thare is neuer a God: for if there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a hell, there is neuer a heauen, and if there be neuer a diuell, there is neuer a God, for the Gospell maketh mension of them all. Indeede, such by their liuing, shewe, that there is neither

Heauen nor hell, but let such take heede by dolefull Diues, and repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their life whilee they are lining, or els at length they shall feele with Diues, that there is a hel, when their ore burning in the fiery flames thereof, out of which tormentes they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get, doe what they can. I metuaile what deuill should moue them to say or thinke there is neuer a hell: seeing Christ, which cannot lye, hath made so oft mention thereof in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. But suppose there were no hell (as euery good christian doth beleeue there is one) what harme were it to thinke there were a Hell, nay, no harme but good would come thereof: for the feare of hell,</hi>

For by the one wee could haue no harme: but by the other wee might run headlong into hell, as they do, I feare that say there is no hell.</hi>

               <p>For let a poore man and a ritch man go to Law together, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wil not be long a trying, but wil be quickly ended, because the one hath money at wil, and the other hath little or non to fee or feede the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers, nor to pay the fees of the Courts: but let two ritch cobes sue one another in the Law, and let the case, be like to the poore and ritch mans case, it may chaunce be a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen yeere or more, are their matter bee tried and ended.

               <p>Then said Diues, I know their gaine wil not bee greater, a wo is me that I knew it so well. But if I were now on the earth feeling,<note place="margin">

The man hearing this, gaue him hearty thanks in the gentlemans behalfe: and after when hee had tolde the same tale to the said gentleman, he thinking that all had bin gold that glistred was very glad thereof, and saide, I meane to trouble him for 200. li. shortly: for I thinke I shall haue occasion to vse it. Then soone after the said gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> went to the vsurer, and gaue
<pb facs="tcp:9437:39"/>
him thankes for his gentle curtesie offred to him vndeserued, and said: Sir, where you offred to lend me 500. li. I am come nowe vnto you, to desire you to lende mee 200. li. which I hope will serue my turne at this time. Then said the vsurer, forsooth ye shall haue it, and more if you will: nay, saide the gentleman, 200. li. will satisfie me, therefore I meane to borrow no more: wel, said the vsurer I am content, you shall haue it: yea, but said the gentleman, what interest shall I pay for the hauing thereof a xii. month? To whom the vsurer answered, I would not haue you thinke but that I lend you my money more for loue then for gaine: marie if you will giue x.li. in the 100. as the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth allow. I will not refuse your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle curtesie therein. Then the gentleman said, I wil not only giue you that and more with a good will, but also I will put you in two sufficient sureties besides my selfe, for the paiment thereof: no, said the vsurer, I credit you so well, that you shall haue it without any such sureties, and I am loth to take any suerty wherby it should be knowne that I lend money vpon gaine, and that you should be driuen to borrow any mony, mary this ye must do, said the vsurer (because we

are all mortall, and perhaps they that come after you, will not haue that honest and good meaning that you haue) you shal assure vnto me and my heires such a farme, which lieth not farre hence, with a condition or prouiso, that if the money be repaide at the day appointed the said bargame and gift to be void. The gentleman hearing this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pause at the matter, and coulde not tell what to answere therein (for the thing that hee should haue thus assured, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woorth then a M.li.) Gentleman, saide the vsurer, I perceiue you haue me now in suspition, I am sorie that you mistrust me, especially seeing I meane so much good vnto you. Then saide the Gentleman vnto him: Sir, if you were as much my enimie, as you pretend to be my friend, if I pay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you your money againe at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, you can take none aduantage of me, neither doo me any harme. You say most true said the vsurer, the clause of prouiso in the writing dooth binde me from that, this assurance that I desire of you, is to make you carefull to keepe your day, and not that you shoulde haue any harme, if you breake your day. The Gentleman hearing this, thought no harme, so that the money was

                  <hi>That one daie is with the Lorde as a thousand yeeres, and a theusand yeares as one day.

is no verie vnlikelie. Marke also, how neere an other coniecture doth agree vnto this, Christ being our heade, dwelled heere on the earth, vntill his death, thirty and three yeeres &amp; three monethes, or more, that is, as much as from Christmasse, the time of his natiuitie, vntill the Easter following, the time of his Passion or death.</hi>

And thus if we accompt the thirtie and three yeeres that Christ remained here on earth to great yeeres, called of some Anni Apocto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici, euery yeere signifiyng fiftie yeeres, then we may easily perceiue, that the same dooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a thousand, sixe hundred, and fiftie yeeres, for three and thirtie times fiftie, is sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred and fiftie, and the odde moneths may bee applyed to the other sixe yeeres.

in the wearing of their ringes it is to puff them vp in pride, and to haue a vaine glorie in themselues, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my diligent seruants.

and prosperytie. But I haue founde it otherwise, and cleane contrary. Marke the madnesse and fondnesse of these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, they can bee contente to be very poore and verye beggeres for that space of three or foure yeeres or rather moe, to bee an earthlye Lorde or a Duke all their lyues after, which cannot last long, and whose estate cannot bee without greefe and other troubles: but they cannot bee contente to bee poore and in a beggerly estate for the tearme of this shorte lyfe, to haue a most ioyful Kingdome in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for euer, where is nothing but felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pleasure, comforte, mirth, and more ioy, then mans hearte can thinke: If Christ had thought the rich-mans state to be best,<note place="margin">

diuell. Yea, but all preachers on the earth can not make the ritch beleeue it neither can make them sel halfe of their goodes and to giue it to the poore.</p>
               <p>And if they shoulde sell all that they haue and giue it to the poore, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become poore themselues, if they liue as impatiently, enuiously, idely, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as doo the most parte of the poore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie the most beggerly sorte, they may happe to be shutte out of heauen from poore Lazarus, and bee throwen into Hell with thee Diues.

                     <hi>The poore estate most happy-</hi>
                  </note> and most necessary for them. For their hunger might make them call to their heauenly father for foode, their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might make them praie to him for clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, their greefes and sores might make them call to him for health and helpe or for the gifte of pacience therein, their lying in the streete without houses might make them to looke vppe to heauen, where they haue houses prepared for them, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanke God therefore and theyr pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mighte cause them to reioyce that they haue their ritches laide vp in heauen, and
<pb facs="tcp:9437:53"/>
so by this their patient pouertie, (if they repent their sinnes, and beleeue that they shall be saued onely by the death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Iesus Christ) they are sure to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the endlesse kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and to auoide this most dolefull dungeon of hell where I am. Therefore if I were on the earth againe as I cannot, I would haue a poore estate to choose, for riches procure pleasure, and pleasure increaseth sinne, and sinne bringeth Gods vengeance, and Gods vengeance bringeth damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and damnation bringeth hell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are ritch, vnlesse they bee plentifully endued with that feare and grace of GOD (as many great and rich men haue beene) are in such a daungerous estate as they little thinke off. Then saide the diuell, and many of the poore and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly sort, (considering their impatiencie, spite, enuie, and malice) are in a more daungerous case then they thinke of. For their pouertie and paine maketh them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, their want maketh them weepe, their hunger maketh them houle and crie, and their miserie maketh them mourne, and so through this their worldly care I
<pb facs="tcp:9437:54"/>
graunt, manie of them doo cleane forget God, and take not him for their father, and doo not onely wish themselues out of the worlde, but also doo ridde themselues out of the world, by cutting their throates and hanging themselues, and by diuers other meanes, which is no small ioy vnto me. For through this their wicked liuing and desperate deathes, they are mine owne deere children, and none can take them from mee when I haue them once in hell: then saide Diues,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note this.</hi>
                  </note> belike they thinke that all their cares, pouertie, miserie, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is ended, when this their life is ended, but that is not so, (but onely to the godlie and faithfull children of God,) for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer dieth impatiently, impenitently, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully, sinfully and desperately (whether they be poore or rich) though their earthly troubles, miseries, and calamities doo end yet then their euerlasting sorrowe, care, woe, griefe, and most extreame tormentes in hell doo beginne. So that whereas they thinke by their death, they goe from paine to ease, they goe from a sweete short com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable sorrowe, to a most terrible and vnsufferable endlesse woe and tormentes.
<pb facs="tcp:9437:54"/>
Therefore they that be aliue on the earth, may reioyce and be glad, though they haue neuer so great pouertie, trouble, miserie, or calamitie, for that is but short, and can last but a while, but if they once come hether to hell where I am, then their most intollerable paines shall neuer cease, nor the fire that shall burne them can neuer bee quenched.</p>
