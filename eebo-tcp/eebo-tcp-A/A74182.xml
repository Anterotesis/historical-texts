         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What a <hi>jealouſie</hi> upon his Counſels? Nay, what <hi>contempt</hi> upon His Perſon and Authority? The worſt of their Proceedings from thence received, (I will not ſay, <hi>Juſtice</hi>) nor ſcarce Colour; but ſure I am, that what pretence they had, they borrowed of you: Otherwiſe, his <hi>Innocency</hi> fighting with Arms (Charity binds me to believe in his judgement) purely <hi>defenſive,</hi> and with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sollicitations purſuing Peace, would either have prevailed with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for an Accommodation, or left them generally condemned, as <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Contrivers,</hi> and <hi>obſtinate Continuers</hi> of the <hi>WAR,</hi> whereby moſt of the <hi>good People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but eſpecially of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſociated Counties,</hi> would ſoon have been undeceived, as they have ſince been by late and wofull experience; for it is well known, that many (then) the <hi>fierceſt Zealots</hi> for our <hi>unhappy Reformation,</hi> never <hi>hated</hi> the Perſon of their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> nor <hi>envied</hi> his juſt Power, but <hi>ſincerely</hi> loved him, and <hi>heartily</hi> embraced his Government; yet being firſt terrified by your threats, and exaſperated with your Provocations, were, afterwards, by their <hi>factious Teachers</hi> and <hi>Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders,</hi> too eaſily cheated of their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and led captive, as it were, into <hi>meer Sedition,</hi> under the ſpecious but State pretence of removing evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, and reſcuing his Majeſties Authority and Perſon (as they were told) out of the hands of a deſperate Crew, which abuſed his goodneſs and facility: The truth whereof, doth ſince evidently appear, by their <hi>frank confeſſion, hearty contrition,</hi> and late moſt <hi>effectual endeavours,</hi> with <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>generous Actions,</hi> to cancel the <hi>memory</hi> of their <hi>former errors,</hi> and ſatisfie the World (at leaſt the judicious) they never ſinned <hi>preſumptuouſly;</hi> for <hi>inſolent</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Treaſon</hi> commonly fetters the ſoul, and ends in the gangrene of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing and implacable <hi>Guilt;</hi> whereas, their deſire to truſt that Prince, whom once they diſobliged, ſavours, though of much Errour at firſt, yet now of more Ingenuity, and muſt be conſtrued to proceed onely from ſuch ſoundneſs of heart, and clearneſs of ſpirit, as by good men ought to be highly cheriſhed; and perhaps, far better eſteemed, then the meer oſtentation of perſeverance in <hi>pretended Loyalty,</hi> but <hi>real Animoſity;</hi> Wherefore, Gentlemen, in true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to you, (whom I would willingly, in part, excuſe, upon the ſcore of your great ſuffering, and oppreſſion, which tranſports even wiſe men) but eſpecially, in zeal of his ſervice, whom we all profeſſe equally to deſire, give me leave without offence, a little to expoſtulate with you.</p>
            <p>Do you think it a ſmall matter, That after a long <hi>conſumption</hi> of our <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> in a <hi>civil War,</hi> or a <hi>Peace,</hi> more <hi>hoſtile</hi> then it, God hath, at length, miraculouſly afforded us a poſſibility of <hi>Settlement.</hi> That after a <hi>tedious</hi> night of <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs and bondage, God hath given you a <hi>glimpſe,</hi> and indeed as yet, but a <hi>glimpſe</hi> of hope, That you, as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> may as in due time, with others, enjoy your birthright, <hi>(viz.)</hi> an Equal Protection and Benefit of the Law; and will nothing, now, already, content you but <hi>abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and to have all things proſtrate at your feet? Is this a fitting return of <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> to God, for your deliverance begun, or a probable means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with him, to continue and perfect his mighty works? Have you ſo ſoon forgotten your Sequeſtrations, Priſons, and Scaffolds? Can you remember no ſins of yours, that entitled you to thoſe Puniſhments, or might modeſtly oblige you, at leaſt to confeſſe the juſtice of God, in the unjuſtice of Men; but muſt all your ſufferings be imputed to meet <hi>ſupererogation</hi> and <hi>glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom?</hi> Was it a Crime, unpardonable, in your adverſaries, as you pretend, to rebel, though many of them tranſgreſſed, more out of ignorance, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Duty; and is it no fault in you, who glory in being ſo Orthodox, to breath out Violence, cheriſh your luſts, and ſteep your ſouls in Revenge? Are you of the Nature of thoſe Elements, and which, in our Provervial dialect, <hi>are good Servants, but ill Maſters,</hi> and which, if not confin'd, will drown and devour all? Were you fatally deſign'd either to be <hi>Slaves,</hi> or <hi>Tyrants, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> or <hi>Bahawes?</hi> Are you like thoſe in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> not to be tamed but with hunger and ſtripes? Can you imagine, the lofty pretences of a Party, which hath been ſo often foyled, ſo long ſuppreſt, ſo much ſuſpected, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the ſatisfaction of others more conſiderable, the <hi>Settlement</hi> of the Nation, the <hi>Exigence</hi> of <hi>Affairs?</hi> Or can you ever hope to carry it with a high hand by your ſilly <hi>Rhodomontado's?</hi> Hath not experience yet made you ſenſible, That the People of this Nation, haying taſted the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> are now become <hi>ſinfully wiſe;</hi> That their eyes being indeed opened, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their natures vitiated, and wills depraved, they are quite fallen from their <hi>primitive innocency,</hi> ſo as I fear, the KING, if reſtored, muſt buckle to inconveniences, and Reign, at leaſt, for ſome time, rather as a <hi>Probationer</hi> then a <hi>Prince?</hi> Were not ſome of you drinking your late Maſters health, Whilſt his Cauſe, nay, perhaps, himſelf was bleeding his laſt? Have not you ſince ſerved his Son, much at the ſame rate, and with like ſucceſs? Will you never learn to govern your Paſſions, to allay your Cups, or turn, if not truly Virtuous, yet ordinarily Diſcreet, ſo at leaſt, as not to fall miſerably into the the pitty of your Friends, the Scorn of your Enemies, and Obloquie of the People: That a Righteous cauſe may no more be blaſted with your Scandals, Party (which certainly hath no Peer for conſtancy, juſtice, and modeſty) deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, as it were again in its reputation, for the Enormities, of a few who being (God be thanked) of your number? Do you not know, how the KING diſownes you, the People diſlike yov, our Friends bluſh for you, and the Enemies of your quiet now make uſe of your exorbitances or treaſuries (a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief whereof your irrational Ranting extorts from me) to obſtruct a <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>hapgy Settlement.</hi> And if (which God in mercy prevent) now in this <hi>Cryſis</hi> of our hopes, and fears, through your folly and frenzie (I wiſh I could forbear to ſay, ſome of your falſhood) the hands of true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſhould be weakned, the Factious exaſperated, the jealous alarm'd (though falſly) the tender ſprouts of Loyalty nipped and diſcouraged, ſo that our hopes and endeavours ſhould prove abortive, and your poor Countrey return to its thraldom, would not the Preſent Age and Poſterity, have cauſe to curſe you, more then any of our late Tyrants and Taskmaſters? And who indeed would then, be accounted ſuch Traytors, and firebrands, as you? However, think ſeriouſly, if you can, whether (you perſiſting) the Nation (now enclin' to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting) will not ſpue you you out amongſt the Phanataticks, as a morſel, which if it were ſwallowed, can never be digeſted, but muſt oppreſſe nature, putrifie in the ſtomach, and poyſon the blood; in fine, a meer Faction, and an Extreme, no leſſe nauſeous and dangerous, then the <hi>Rump</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And you my good Friends of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, know, that you are generally diſtinguiſhed into Two <hi>Claſſes,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Moderate</hi> and <hi>Rigid.</hi> You of the firſt rank are by all ſober men acknowledged, now, to be of the beſt ſort of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>-men, not differing (materially at leaſt? from the <hi>Moderate Royaliſt,</hi> Generous Aſſertors of our Liberties, ſtout Oppugners of encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and conſequently) Maintainers of Juſt Prerogative; above all, you are conſidered as Perſons, that will modeſtly <hi>acquieſce</hi> in Freedom of Parliament, the onely cure proper to our Diſtempers. For we ſuppoſe your Moderation, which to you was natural, cannot but be greatly improved, by your Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſince many, even the Principal of you, having been for your Loyalty, Temper, forcibly excluded from the Government, more then Eleven years, have thereby, had leaſute to reflect on Errours, to obſerve paſſages, and to deſign Expedients, without the Partiality of Gameſters; Great reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we have, to promiſe our ſelves, That you, who have not owely, with others, ſeen, and felt the fatal conſequences of the Swords interpoſing in our Laws, but more ſignally, in your Perſons, ſuffered thoſe memorable inſolencies and indignities from <hi>Red-coats,</hi> will be for ever moſt tenderly concerned for the honour of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and careful never to encourage, much leſſe (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any pretence, how ſpecious ſoever) your ſelves to practice that Violence, which you have ſo juſtly and notably branded in others, when exerciſed on you; And this honeſt Principle, wherein the <hi>Sober Royaliſts</hi> ſhake hands with you, I take for the onely baſis, upon which, we can poſſibly be ſetled.</p>
            <p>But for you, of the other ſort, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Violent and Rigid, I muſt tell you Plainly; You are eſteemed, but a kinde of <hi>Franticks,</hi> and very <hi>paltry ones;</hi> In your Policy, Pedantick, in your Juſtice, Narrow and Mechanick, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh in Converſation, Waſpiſh in Argument or Debate, Perverſe in Buſineſs, Excencrick in your Motions, and true to no Principle; You are obſerved not to walk by the Golden rule of <hi>doing as you weuld be done to;</hi> nor think your ſelves concerned in that Sacred precept, of <hi>doing no evil, that good may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; Per fas, aut nefas,</hi> and <hi>Flectere ſi nequeo ſuperos,</hi> are no ſmall part of your Decalogue.</p>
            <p>Waving therefore the deſign of convincing your Judgments, as impertinent, if not impoſſible, give me leave to acquaint you, That the Nation hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeen little of you to enamour then; That the moſt extravigant of Sectaries are more grateful to us, then you, in regard they allow others the ſame freedom they arrogate to themſelves; That the Diſcipline of <hi>Geneva is</hi> every where c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
