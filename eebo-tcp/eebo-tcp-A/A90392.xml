         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Righteouſneſs, and he alone
rightly weigheth, meaſureth
and adminiſtreth in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Truth. Man hath
a ſelfiſh Principle within,
which ſecretly blindeth and draweth him aſide
in his pureſt aims and intentions. Man knoweth
not his own heart, how much he is engaged for
himſelf, what little truth of love, mercy and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
there is in him towards others. Every man
thinks he minds the publique Good and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
little ſeeing or ſuſpecting how ſtraitly he is
bound up within the narrow compaſs of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Every man pretendeth to be juſt, and very
ready to amend the wilful or negligent miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of others: but where are the men, who
once attaining to greatneſs and power, ſlide not
by degrees into the ſame paths of Injuſtice,
which they condemned others for walking in?
Man cannot obſerve his own errors, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can he bear to hear of them: He loveth
himſelf ſo well, that he cannot diſcern that evil
which is in himſelf, nor endure to be told of it
by others; but thinks they deal injuriouſly
<pb facs="tcp:165855:3"/>
with him if they take notice of it, or warn him
againſt it: for it is not evil in him, but an evil eye
in them, which makes them look upon it as ſo.</p>
            <p>The Powers of this World being ſo apt to
err (and their errors being ſo like themſelves,
powerful) have great need of faithful Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and plain Dealers, but ſeldom meet with
them, and their condition makes them little
able to bear them. Their condition hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
this double bad influence upon them, it
maketh them able to do ill, able to do harm;
but unable to bear the ſight or repreſentation of
them. It blindeth their own eyes, in reference to
themſelves and their actions; and maketh them
enemies to him who is not equally blinded
with them. Nor can it be otherwiſe, Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take it well to have others telling him of
that evil, which he upon ſearch cannot find in
himſelf; or to have them ſtill blaming him for
that as evil, which he himſelf accounteth as
good.</p>
            <p>O ye preſent great Ones (I ſpeak it not in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect,
but in honor, acknowledging that God,
by his providence and diſpoſe of things, hath
made you great) Look upon that Snare, which
hardly ever man, in your condition, avoyded!
<pb facs="tcp:165855:3"/>
Conſider this poor Nation, its great Coſt, its
great Danger, your great Promiſes to it, and let
its Right and Liberty be precious in your eyes.
Conſider (if it be poſſible) impartially its Right,
and lead it into the poſſeſſion of it. If ye walk in
the way of man, ye will come to the end of
man: If ye be Succeſſors in unrighteouſneſs,
ye will end in ruine. Ye have an harder peece of
Self-denyal to practiſe then yet ye have met
with, if ye will be ſafe. (Your danger is greateſt
when ye ſeem moſt out of danger.) As there
have been hitherto many Cries for you, ſo there
are now many Cries to you, and Cries againſt
you dayly. Complaints have ſeldom been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it behoves you to look thorowly that it be
without a cauſe on your part. If the poor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
people be deſtitute of help, and have none
to cry to but the righteous One (being wearied
out with crying to man) it may make him the
more regardful of their Cries, and the more
ſpeedy and ſtrict in exacting an account of your
Stewardſhip from you.</p>
            <p>The FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY
AND SAFETY of the People is here
preſented to your view in general with others
(to whom alſo it appertaineth.) It concerneth
<pb facs="tcp:165855:4"/>
you moſt particularly to take notice of it, and to
uſe induſtry and fidelity, anſwerable to your
Power and Truſt, to inſtate them in it; which
how ever they may abuſe, yet they ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy:
And if ye cannot make them happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
putting things into their due order according
to right, this will be a comfort unto you, that
they are only made miſerable by themſelves:
whereas if ye detain their Right from them,
though with never ſo good an intent, that will
not excuſe you at preſent, nor afford you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at the laſt. Ye have expreſſed a great Senſe
of the Injuries which the People have ſuffered
by being deprived of their Rights and Liberties,
and have undertaken to reſtore them to the
poſſeſſion of them again; do it in truth. Let
not Jealouſies, of what may happen, cauſe you
to turn aſide from the direct path of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Put them, as well as ye can, into a way of
minding and proſecuting their own good; but
take heed of overthrowing their Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
though from never ſo great a deſire to do
them good. I am exceeding-jealous over you,
leſt ye ſhould unwittingly be deceived by your
own hearts, and unawares deceive the People:
forgive me this Jealouſie. It ariſeth both from
<pb facs="tcp:165855:4"/>
love to you and the People: becauſe my deſire
is ſo great, on the one hand, to have the People
free and happy; and on the other hand, to have
you the Inſtruments of it. For as my deſire was
towards thoſe which went before you, while
their day laſted, that they might rather have
found the way of adminiſtring Righteouſneſs
to others, then of occaſioning ruine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
So is my deſire now towards you, while
your day remains; and O that ye could ſee, at
leaſt in this your day, the things that concern
your peace, and the good of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Every thing is bounded, but few things
know their bounds; and ſo, paſſing beyond
them, both give and receive wounds, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſmart and afflict, be they never ſo ſlight;
but if they be very deep, tend to death. KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
POWER did paſs its limits, we may now
ſpeak it. Doth PARLIAMENTARY POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER
keep within its limits? How ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
this fairly and clearly (reſolve it indeed
we may in our own Judgments and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
when the limits of it are not determined?
And if things ſhould yet devolve lower, into
the great and confuſed Body of the People, is it
likely they would keep their limits?</p>

O GOD, how is man entangled! So far from
attaining true, inward, ſpiritual Liberty; that he
cannot reach the ſhadow, the outward part, the
earthly part, the liberty of man! So far are we
from enjoying Liberty under any Government;
that we can, at beſt, but groan and pant under
it after Liberty. Man cannot be free in himſelf,
not free from himſelf (while Self is in him, it
will make him ſelfiſh,) and while it is ſo, others
under his power or within his reach cannot be
free. O that the time of man were come to an
end; that he who is righteous, and cannot but
be righteous, would put unrighteous man out of
place, and adminiſter righteouſneſs himſelf. Till
then I expect no ſatisfaction, not only not in
ſpiritual affairs, but not ſo much as in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this World. Yet it behoveth you,
who are in place and Power, to remove as far
from your ſelves, and preſs on as near towards
righteouſneſs, as poſſibly ye may: for which end,
to provoke you ſomewhat towards it, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing

and are not yet come to the ſight of Land. The
neceſſities whereinto ye are caſt, cannot but
make your burthens heavy: yet this might ſomewhat eaſe them,
if ye could but once diſcern the approach of a long expected end.
Ye are far from attaining your Deſires, and yet that may not be
very ill for you, becauſe ye your ſelves are ſo apt to miſtake in
your Deſires, not truly underſtanding what may tend to make you
happy. There is no ſafe retreating, how ever ye may think, and

If I ſhould tell you, that it were better to lie ſtil and ſuffer then ſeek
after a diſorderly remedy (for that is likely ſtill to be worſe then
the diſeaſe) it cannot but ſound very harſhly in your ears. Man
is not very willing to ſuffer, yea hardly can he be caſt into ſuch a
condition, but he finds or at leaſt fancies ſome door of hope, at
which he thinks he might eſcape. It is not often changing either
backward or forward, or various kinds of changes, which will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
relief; but an orderly, a rational change, a change fitly
ſuited to the condition of that which changeth. If ye would move
aright, nay ſo much as deſire aright; ye muſt come to a true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of your condition. Do ye underſtand your ſelves? do
ye act like men? or are ye led and driven up and down like brute
Creatures? Have ye took notice what, this long ſeaſon, hath been
doing among you? Can ye tell me, whence ye came, whither ye
are going, where ye now are? Shall I put you in minde?</p>
            <p>Ye came from <hi>Slavery,</hi> from ſuch bonds and burthens as ye
were very weary of. Ye are marching towards <hi>Liberty,</hi> thither is
your intent to go, into a free ſtate and condition where ye may have
cauſe to complain no more of Oppreſſion or burthens. But where
are ye? who knoweth that? Why ſurely ye are in an <hi>entangled
eſtate</hi> and condition, wherein ye have loſt your way, or at leaſt the
ſight of it: Ye would fain return back or turn aſide, but ye have
no minde to go forward. Thus is it often in caſes of this nature;
The <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>paſſage</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi> (the Land of
Reſt) is many times ſo grievous, that <hi>Egypt,</hi> even the Land of
Bondage, ſeemeth more tolerable. That people was ready to
ſtone <hi>Moſes</hi> for leading them into ſuch a perplexed condition,
though <hi>Moſes</hi> guided them faithfully. I do not compare your Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with <hi>Moſes</hi> (yet it becometh you to remember, how ſtrangely
they were raiſed up to appear for you, when ye groaned under
ſharp and heavy preſſures) I do not think them ſo weighty in the
ballance: yet I doubt ye wrong them, when ye weigh them, your
ballance not being right, nor you affording them their due allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
They have met with real difficulties and ſtraits, which
hath made their way very uneven and hard to walk in: yea ſuch
a continued <hi>ſeries</hi> of distracting occurrences and affairs may
have tended to put them quite out of their way. Do ye conſider
this? I will tell you what I have much obſerved: Man is very
<pb facs="tcp:165855:6"/>
prone to do evil, to be unjuſt in every ſtate and condition, to bend
his truſt aſide, to neglect ſeeking and ſerving thoſe whom he ought
to ſeek and ſerve, improving that very advantage for the further
ſeeking and ſerving of himſelf. This is uſually the ſtate of man,
look on him where you will you ſhall finde him in this poſture: but
he that accuſeth is commonly as unjuſt, if not more, in the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the other was in the tranſgreſſion. The common people
are moſt ſubject to this of any, who receive things by rumors and
common reports, without examining or ſcanning whether things
be ſo or no. This is the common miſcarriage between Superiors
and Inferiors: The one doth not govern righteouſly, the other
doth not obey righteouſly: and yet they are both unjuſt in their
complaints of each other; the Superior complaining in an unjuſt
maner of the Inferiors Obedience, the Inferior complaining in as
unjuſt a maner of the Superiors Government. If every man
could once eſpy and grow moſt weary of his own faults, there might
be ſome hope of amendment. This World is a ſtrange <hi>Myſtery of
Iniquity</hi> in the whole courſe of it, in every piece and parcel of it;
every one being offended with each other, for adulterating in their
intentions, motions and actions, and yet the mean while, as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the very ſame way, they themſelves adulterating. If ye
ſhould encline to entertain this as a melancholly apprehenſion from
my pen (for man is very difficult to hear the ſound of ill concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, and ready to throw dirt into the face of him from whom
it comes) look into the Scripture, ſee if that do not ſpeak expreſly
to the ſame purpoſe. Particularly into that <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. where
the words run thus. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O Man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou art that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another,
thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Scripture is opened in that light which penned it, who
will be able to ſtand before it! What man is it that judgeth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
and he that judgeth another thinketh himſelf free, at leaſt
in that respect wherein he judgeth another: but what is ſaid
here? <hi>O Man, thou that judgeſt art inexcuſable.</hi> Yes, will man
ſay, ſuch as judg raſhly, ſuch as judg unjuſtly: nay but the words
here carry it further, <hi>whoſoever thou art that judgeſt.</hi> Why what
ground is there for this? Are not ſuch and ſuch things evil? doth
<pb facs="tcp:165855:7"/>
not the perſon deſerve to be judged for them? Yes, but not by thee,
who art guilty with him of the ſame things, though thou ſeest
it not, and ſo in judging him thou doft but condemn thy ſelf; <hi>for
wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf.</hi> How can
that be? I condemn onely thoſe that do ſuch and ſuch things, but
thanks be to God, though I have my failings, yet I am free from
thoſe things: I ſhould not think my ſelf worthy to live upon the
face of the Earth, nay I ſhould think my ſelf fit for nothing but
Hell if I were guilty of thoſe things mentioned in the latter of the
former Chapter. Thus thou ſayſt, this is thy teſtimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy ſelf: but he who knoweth thee (<hi>he who ſearcheth the heart
and tryeth the reins</hi>) accuſeth thee for thy judging, telling thee
that in ſo doing thou condemneſt thy ſelf, giving in this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, becauſe thou dost the ſame things: <hi>for thou that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
doſt the ſame things:</hi> If he cannot make this good againſt thee,
thou ſhalt eſcape. Ah poor man, how art thou hid from thy ſelf!
thou knowest not what is written in thine heart (even all that
which is mentioned in the latter end of the foregoing Chapter;)
thou knoweſt not the way thy heart hath to bring forth theſe
things; thou doſt not know how or when thou doſt them. When
thy heart ſhall be opened by him who knoweth it, and theſe things
plainly diſcovered to have been in thee, and drawn forth into act
by thee; when both the root and the fruit ſhall be made as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
as the day, what wilt thou ſay! Surely then O man, thou who
hast been ſo confident and abundant in clearing thy ſelf and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
others, wilt grow <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> and ſink under thy treble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
firſt for being and doing evil, then for juſtifying thy
ſelf, and laſtly for condemning others.</p>
            <p>I muſt contract my ſelf in what remains. <hi>Dear Country-men,</hi>
If I were able to ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon,</hi> I would commend a
little advice to you, but my condition maketh me unwilling to do
it, yet your condition overſwayeth me again, and extorteth it
from me. It may perhaps, where it taketh root and ſpringeth up,
tend towards the ſetling of ſome ſpirits, and towards a ſweet and
orderly guiding of them in publique acting. For clearneſs ſake,
I ſhall branch it into a few Heads.</p>
            <p>1. Apply your ſelves to be ſenſible what <hi>true Freedom</hi> is,
wherein it lies, and of what value it is. It is of more worth then
<pb facs="tcp:165855:7"/>
your Eſtates, yea then your Lives; and therefore deſerves to be
higher prized. It conſiſts not in licentiouſneſs, to do what ye will,
nor in having no Taxes layd upon you (this may be neceſſary for
your ſafety) but in theſe four things. Firſt, in having good
Laws, ſuited to your ſtate and condition. Secondly, in a good
method of Government, whereby ye may come to enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of all thoſe Laws, and whereby your remedies of redreſs may
be eaſie and cheap, not ſo hard to be come at, nor ſo coſtly, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they are. Thirdly, in having a good Governor or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
who may faithfully overſee the execution of theſe Laws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this method. Fourthly, in having a ſetled way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
to amend, alter or add to in any kinde (as need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire)
theſe Laws, this method of Government, theſe Governors.
And, which I might name of fifth, to have ſuch a clear way, for
theſe Parliaments to proceed in, as they might not eaſily miſs:
for otherwiſe, if the way be not very plain, ſuch a Body of the
common ſort, who are not ſuppoſed either to be very skilful or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in Government, are likely to do a great deal more hurt
then good.</p>
            <p>2. Be not weary of the purſuit after Liberty, becauſe of the
many difficulties and expences which it occaſions. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndergo the
pains of cure. What charge will a man be at, in a Suit of Law, to
recover a peece of Eſtate? Is it not worth more to recover the
Liberty of a man? The Nations of the Earth have ſtill layn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Slavery, have not ye your ſelves felt it? Would ye not creep
out, and do ye think to creep out with eaſe? The very caſting of
ſo great a burthen will make the Earth ſhake under you: Beſides
the oppoſition of ſuch who finde advantage by riding upon your
backs will heighten the difficulty of it. If ye will be cured of your
Sickneſs by Phyſique, ye muſt ſuffer that Sickneſs which comes
with Phyſique. O do not run into Slavery to avoyd a few preſent
burthens, but purſue your Freedom, what ever it coſt you. If
ever ye come to enjoy it, ye will not think much of what ye have
layd out for the purchaſe of it.</p>
            <p>3. Eye not man, no not in thoſe things wherein he appears as
the main agent. Conſider who it is that doth all, especially in ſuch
great changes. It is not the wit of man, the will of man, which
manageth theſe things, but one above man. He ſpeaketh Peace
<pb facs="tcp:165855:8"/>
and Settlement to a Nation, and who then can ſpeak Trouble or
Diſturbance? He alſo ſtirreth the mud in a Nation, and who then
can ſettle it? He throweth down the mighty from their ſeat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
them of low degree; and he doth not give liberty to man to
finde fault with him either for throwing down the mighty becauſe
he liked them, or for ſetting up them of low degree becauſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh
them. Read and conſider that place <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 7. (and ſhew
in practice, as well as in profeſſion, that ye reverence Scripture)
<hi>GOD is THE JUDG, He putteth down one, and ſetteth up
another.</hi> Take heed what ye do: If ye had only man to deal with,
ye might make your party good; but it is <hi>hard kicking againſt the
pricks.</hi> It may be his deſign at preſent (<hi>whoſe counſel ſhall ſtand,
and who will fulfil all his pleaſure</hi>) as it was once concerning <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
to make you alſo ſenſible, that <hi>the moſt High ruleth
among the children of men,</hi> dispoſing of <hi>Kingdoms, Powers</hi> and
<hi>Governments,</hi> as and to whom he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>4. Expect not help or ſatisfaction from man. Man hath no
worth in him, and for this end may he be made uſe of, by God, to
ſhew how vile and empty he is, how unable and unfit to produce
any thing of value. Truly I have often thought, that the Powers
and Governments of this World are intended, rather to make us
weary of them, then to yeeld us ſatisfaction in them. This whole
Creation is a meer peece of vanity, and (in all the changes of it)
can yeeld but vanity: What do ye mean to raiſe ſuch expectations,
concerning any thing or from any thing in it? It may be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of God to diſcover to you (by multiplyed ſenſe and experience)
that man cannot help you: While your expectations are from
man, or upon this or that change, ye are far from learning this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I know means are appointed and made uſe of by God in the
producing of effects, but ſometimes he withers them, to divert
our eyes from them, and to make us feel what empty, barren, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
things they are. While ye cry out ſo much againſt any
means or inſtruments, on the one hand, or ſo much magnifie any,
on the other hand (as every one almoſt doth according to his differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
eſteem of them) ye cannot ſo fully be taken up with obſerving
the principal Agent. If God intend himſelf to beſtow what ye
deſire upon you, he may hold his hand while ye expect it from man:
If God intend at laſt to put forth an excellent peece of ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:165855:8"/>
and wiſdom for your reſcue, he may defer till he hath tired out
yours: And if that ſhould be his intention, ye are out of the way
while your expectation is faſtened elſewhere.</p>
            <p>5. And laſtly; Groan and pant, unto him who is skilful to
ſave, after your own deliverance and after the deliverance of his
people. He who wanteth deliverance, and knoweth not where to
obtain it; what is more proper for him, then to groan and pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it? The whole Creation is continually in a condition of groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and travelling after deliverance, not of enjoying it. Bear a
part with the Creation, as ye are a part of it; yea the higher your
extremities grow, the greater let your groans be. Be content with
your travelling pangs, which is the common track and rode unto
bringing forth.</p>
            <p>And groan likewiſe for <hi>the liberty of the ſons of God:</hi> for what
do ye know but your Liberty may ſpring up with theirs? <hi>Iſrael</hi> is
in bonds, the Lord hath <hi>ſmitten</hi> him, the Lord hath <hi>hid his face</hi>
from him (yea the Lord hath made him <hi>a reproach</hi> and <hi>by-word</hi>
among all the Heathen) and while he frowns upon him, he knows
not how to ſmile upon any elſe. The people of God have ever had
hard uſage in this World, and particularly in this Nation. Can
ye expect that God, who dispoſeth of all things, ſhould be forward
to give you your Liberti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, while ye are not willing they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
theirs? Can they ſubmit to the Laws, Ordinances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of man concerning their God, while an higher light is
ſet up in them? No they cannot, though they were in the dark.
If ye can be content and deſire to do ſo, do ſo quietly, live your
ſelves in <hi>Egypt</hi> if ye like it (and ye may better do it, for it will not
be a Land of bondage to you) but <hi>let my people go that they may
ſerve me,</hi> ſaid God, concerning his people, when alaſs they knew
not how to ſerve him. This is a tickliſh point, and of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Welfare of Nations then they are aware of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ye love your ſelves, your own Peace, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

them in ſpiritual things, who were never in that respect (but only
in outward, in things common to man) put under your yoke. But,
in ſtead thereof, wiſh after their Liberty: and though ye
cannot heartily deſire it in respect to them, yet do it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the enjoyment of your own your ſelves, becauſe, for
<pb facs="tcp:165855:9"/>
ought ye know, yours may lie wrapped up in it.</p>
            <p>All this have I ſpoken unto you, not from any deſign in me in
reference to any thing or perſon: but truly and faithfully from
my very heart commending unto you, what to me (in this my ſtate
of weakneſs) appears beſt for you. Which having done, I now
take my leave of you, wiſhing you the beſt benefit this can afford,

<hi>the Choyce</hi> of their Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
in <hi>the Eſtabliſhment</hi> of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and thoſe Governors which
they ſhall chuſe, and in <hi>the Alteration</hi> of
either as they find cauſe. This belongs to
every people (though few, if any, are in
poſſeſſion of it,) and that people, which
enjoyeth theſe, enjoyeth its <hi>Right,</hi> is indeed <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſafe</hi> while it
ſo remaineth.</p>
            <p>1. The Right, Liberty and Safety of the People <hi>conſiſts in</hi> the
Choyce of their Government and Governors.</p>
            <p>It is their <hi>Right:</hi> for in <hi>Civil Societies</hi> Nature hath not cut out
the <hi>body</hi> into form and ſhape, but hath left it to be done by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165855:10"/>
               <hi>will and wiſdom</hi> of man, having imprinted in him a ſenſe of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
after the enjoyment of <hi>Juſtice, Order, Love, Peace</hi> (and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe is good and profitable for him) both particularly in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and in common with others; which deſire throughly kindled
in man, and guided by <hi>the true light of Reaſon,</hi> will lead man to
chuſe that which is properly good both for himſelf and others. And
though man may poſſibly or probably abuſe this, yet that is no
ſufficient ground for depriving him of his <hi>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Liberty</hi> lies in it too. They only are <hi>a free People</hi> who
have their <hi>Government</hi> of their own choyce. Such upon whom
others do intrude, or upon whom other <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Regents</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
then what themſelves judg meet and neceſſary, and beſides
that which they themſelves voluntarily and by <hi>free conſent</hi> ſubmit
unto for their good and welfare, are ſo far under ſlavery and ſuch a
miſerable <hi>ſubjection</hi> as Nature never appointed them unto.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Safety</hi> likewiſe lies in it: for to be ſure they will chuſe
nothing but what in probability will conduce to their own <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>happineſs;</hi> whereas others, making <hi>Laws</hi> for them, or ſetting <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi>
over them, may reſpect their own particular benefit and
advantage, and not ſo much the good of the People, which is the
main end why <hi>Laws, Governments and Governors</hi> are appointed,
and to which they ſhould in a direct line be guided.</p>
            <p>And upon this ground I conceive it very requiſite, that men who
are choſen to ſit in <hi>Parliament</hi> to make or alter <hi>Laws,</hi> to ſet up or
alter <hi>Governments</hi> or <hi>Governors</hi> for and in behalf of <hi>the People,</hi>
ſhould, as ſoon as any, lie open to the force of all the <hi>Laws</hi> they
make, or of any thing they do in that kind; that no <hi>Law</hi> they make
ſhould take effect till they be diſſolved, and come to lie as liable to
it as any, otherwiſe they will not be ſenſible enough of the Peoples
<hi>condition,</hi> and conſequently not fit to ſtand in their ſtead, or to act
for them in caſes that concern them ſo nearly. The greateſt <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
the People have concerning their <hi>Parliaments</hi> is that they
chuſe perſons whoſe condition will keep them from injurying
them, for if they prejudice them they prejudice themſelves, if they
neglect their good they neglect their own good: This <hi>ſecurity</hi> is
good while the people chuſe them that are of their own <hi>rank,</hi> and
while theſe make no <hi>Laws</hi> for them which ſhall have any <hi>life</hi> or
<hi>vertue</hi> to do <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurt</hi> till they come alſo to be expoſed to them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165855:10"/>
but otherwiſe it is very invalid, if not wholly loſt. They who
are to govern by <hi>Laws</hi> ſhould have little or no hand in making
the <hi>Laws</hi> they are to govern by: for Man reſpects himſelf in what
he does; (The Governor will reſpect himſelf, his own eaſe, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and honour in Government, and lay loads upon the people, but
make his own burthen light:) Therefore things ſhould be ſo o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
in the behalf and for the ſecurity of the people, that ſuch as
are choſen and appointed to act in this kind ſhould lay no <hi>load</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the people, but what their own backs may come as ſoon and
as fully, in their degree and ſtation, to bear, as any of the
peoples.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Right, Liberty and Safety of the People</hi> conſiſts in <hi>the
Eſtabliſhment of their Government and Governors.</hi> As they have
right to chuſe, ſo they have right to confirm what they chuſe, to
eſtabliſh that <hi>Government</hi> and ſuch kind of <hi>Governors</hi> as they judg
or find moſt convenient and neceſſary for them. Without this the
people can be neither <hi>free</hi> nor <hi>ſafe</hi> no more then without the other,
nay without this their <hi>right to chuſe</hi> would be to little purpoſe, the
end of choyce in things of this nature being for the <hi>duration</hi> of its
appointed ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>3. Their <hi>Right, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> lieth alſo in enjoying and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
(as need requires) <hi>the Power of altering their Government
or Governors:</hi> that when they find either burdenſom or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
they may lay it aſide, and place what elſe they ſhall judg lighter,
fitter or better in the ſtead of it. <hi>Nature</hi> ſtill teacheth every thing,
as it groweth, to reach further and further towards <hi>perfection.</hi> No
man is bound to that which he chuſeth or eſtabliſheth further then
he findeth it ſuitable to the <hi>end</hi> for which he choſe and eſtabliſhed
it: Now ſeveral <hi>ſtates</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of things and perſons chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
there muſt of neceſſity be an anſwerable change in <hi>Laws, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Governments</hi> or <hi>Governors</hi> alſo, or man will be inſtrumental
to introduce <hi>ſlavery, miſery and tyranny</hi> upon himſelf, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth every thing both to abhor, and as much as may be to
avoyd.</p>
            <p>It is the deſire of moſt men both in reference to <hi>Church and
State</hi> (as men commonly ſpeak) to have <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the <hi>Medes and Perſians,</hi> which cannot be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I cannot but approve the deſire, ſince it is written in mans <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:165855:11"/>
It is natural to man, and a <hi>ſtamp</hi> of the <hi>divine Image</hi> upon
him, to preſs after <hi>unchangeableneſs</hi> both in himſelf and in the
things which appertain unto him: But yet it is not ſuitable to his
<hi>preſent condition</hi> which will in no wiſe admit of it, becauſe it is
continually ſubject to change and alteration: And as it ſtill changeth,
ſo do his <hi>needs</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> as alſo his <hi>experience</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and
ſo muſt the <hi>Laws and Orders</hi> which he preſcribes to himſelf
and others, or he will be grievouſly cruel to himſelf and
others. <hi>Ages</hi> have their <hi>growth</hi> as well as particular perſons, and
muſt change their <hi>garments,</hi> their <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> their <hi>courſes,</hi> &amp;c. for
thoſe which are ſtill ſuitable to their preſent ſtate and growth.
<hi>Laws</hi> are but <hi>temporary;</hi> and as they are founded upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſo
they are no longer to laſt then <hi>the Reaſon</hi> of them laſteth, to which
they ought to give place, and admit of ſuch a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points.
Only herein hath <hi>Nature</hi> provided well for <hi>the people,</hi> if
they could fairly come to their Right, and had wiſdom to uſe it
(which ſenſe and experience is continually inſtructing them how
to do) in that ſhe doth allot them to make and alter their own
<hi>clothes,</hi> to ſhape out their own <hi>burdens,</hi> to form, renew or alter that
<hi>yoke of Government</hi> which is moſt neceſſary and convenient for
their necks.</p>
            <p>All this, or any part of this (<hi>either the chuſing, eſtabliſhing or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Governments, Laws or Governors</hi>) the people cannot do in
a Body; an whole <hi>Nation</hi> is too unweildy to act together them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
therefore <hi>Nature</hi> hath taught them to do it by <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi>
whom they themſelves chuſe to ſtand in their ſtead to do any of
theſe things for them as their preſent <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>need</hi> requires,
which Body of perſons is with us called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> who are
picked out by the whole to be the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of the whole, to
do that for the whole which they would have to be done, and
would do themſelves if they were a Body in a <hi>capacity</hi> to act.</p>
            <p>And from this firſt <hi>riſe</hi> of things may beſt be diſcovered the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ends, proper uſe and limits of Parliaments,</hi> all which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be known, both that they may move according to their

and that the people may clearly diſcern that they ſo do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

            <p>We ſee alſo their <hi>bounds</hi> in general, <hi>viz.</hi> the exerciſing <hi>the power
of the People</hi> in ſuch ways as were proper for the people to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it in were they capable of joynt and orderly acting.</p>
            <p>We ſee likewiſe their <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Constitution,</hi> what they are.
They are <hi>the ELECTIVE POWER, the CONSTIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TIVE
POWER, the ALTERATIVE POWER.</hi> What lies confuſed
and unuſeful in the people is treaſured up in them in order, and in a
fitting way for uſe. Is there a <hi>Government</hi> wanting? The people
cannot orderly or wiſely debate or chuſe that which is likely to be
moſt commodious and ſafe. Are there any <hi>Laws</hi> wanting? The
people cannot well ſet about making Laws. Are there any <hi>Laws,
Cuſtoms,</hi> or <hi>Encroachments</hi> burdenſom? The people cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcan how far they are ſo, or proceed to a regular alteration of
them. So that the whole <hi>Right, Freedom, Welfare</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of
the People conſiſts in <hi>Parliaments</hi> rightly and duly called, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
and ordered towards acting faithfully in the diſcharge of the
Truſt repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>Yea laſtly, Here we may ſee in a direct line <hi>the proper courſe
and way of Parliaments,</hi> which ſpeaks out it ſelf, and would eaſily
be diſcerned by us, if our eyes were kept fixed here, and not entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with other intermixtures, which are apt to ſeize upon every
thing, and interweave with every thing, hardly any thing keeping its
own pure <hi>nature</hi> or proper <hi>current.</hi> Take it thus, (with a little
kind of Circuit for the better illuſtration of it, yet very briefly.)</p>
            <p>All <hi>Governments</hi> (though intended for and directed towards
common good) are ſtill declining and contracting private, ſelfiſh
and corrupt <hi>Intereſts,</hi> whereby the people come to feel <hi>burdens</hi>
under them, and find want of <hi>fences</hi> to guard them from the <hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi>
and <hi>aſſaults</hi> of ſuch as are above them, which are very uſual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165855:12"/>
every where, for every man (I think I need not add, almoſt) though
he be unwilling to have any tyrannize over him, yet he is too prone
to tyrannize over ſuch as are under him. Who would not, when
he feels <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> if he were able, thruſt the <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> out of his
<hi>ſeat?</hi> and yet who ſees how ready he himſelf would be, ſo ſoon as
he hath done it, to ſeat himſelf in the ſame <hi>throne of oppreſſion;</hi> and
that he will as certainly do the one as the other, if he be not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>outwards force,</hi> or (which is better) by an <hi>inward principle?</hi>
Indeed man can by no means come to ſee this concerning himſelf,
but the people ſtill come too ſoon to feel it.</p>
            <p>Now the People, who wear their <hi>Government,</hi> finding <hi>by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
where it ſitteth eaſie or pincheth, what preſent <hi>loads</hi> they
groan moſt under, what future <hi>fences</hi> they ſtand in need of to ſhelter
them from the injurious aſſaults of <hi>Powers</hi> above them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
chuſe <hi>perſons,</hi> who lie under the ſame ſenſe with them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
conſult about, and redreſs theſe their <hi>grievances,</hi> by <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Offenders</hi> for miſdemeanors paſt, by <hi>opening the courſe of Law</hi>
for time to come, as alſo by <hi>adding</hi> thereto, or <hi>detracting</hi> therefrom,
as the condition and need of the people requires, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe perſons thus choſen are to come with the ſenſe and deſires
of the particular <hi>Counties, Cities or Boroughs</hi> for which they ſerve,
mutually to repreſent theſe, and to conſult together how all <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
may be taken off, and all <hi>deſires</hi> ſatisfied in ſuch a way as may
ſtand with the <hi>good</hi> of the whole.</p>
            <p>After full <hi>debate</hi> had how theſe things may be done, to come to
an <hi>agreement</hi> of full <hi>ſetling</hi> them accordingly in the <hi>firmeſt way</hi>
that can be, which having done to <hi>diſſolve,</hi> and leave the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
to try and reap the benefit of their <hi>care, pains</hi> and <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and to return immediately into their former <hi>condition,</hi> to lie
with them ſenſibly again under the <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>inconvenience</hi> of what
they have done.</p>
            <p>And this to be done with as much <hi>ſpeed,</hi> as the motion of ſuch
a kind of Body, in Affairs ſo weighty, can permit; that if they
chance to fail in effecting what is deſired and expected from them,
the people may quiet themſelves with the expectation of another
<hi>remedy</hi> in its ſeaſon approaching. The reaſon why <hi>Parliaments</hi>
ſhould with all poſſible ſpeed diſpatch their work, is for avoyding
of that <hi>corruption</hi> which <hi>ſtanding pools</hi> are ſubject to, and which is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165855:12"/>
moſt dangerous in <hi>them;</hi> for what ſhall rectifie <hi>the last remedy,</hi>
if that be out of order, and grow ſo corrupt, that it hath more need
of a <hi>Phyſician</hi> it ſelf, then to act the part of a <hi>Phyſician?</hi> All things
by degrees gather <hi>corruption,</hi> the <hi>governing Power</hi> by degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
from its firſt purity, and ſo alſo doth the <hi>rectifying</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Power,</hi> its <hi>deviation</hi> is as eaſie as the others, and of far
greater conſequence; more <hi>deſtructive,</hi> leſs <hi>curable.</hi> Therefore
better were it for <hi>Parliaments</hi> to leave part of their work undone,
then to ſit ſo long as to contract <hi>corruption:</hi> It is better to want
ſomewhat of the full <hi>application</hi> of a <hi>remedy,</hi> then to have it
poyſoned. But of this more by and by under a diſtinct head by it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now the whole <hi>Right, Liberty, Welfare and Safety</hi> of the People
conſiſting in <hi>Parliaments;</hi> the right <hi>Constitution</hi> and orderly
<hi>motion</hi> of them is of the greateſt conſequence that can be, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much embarqued in this <hi>Veſſel,</hi> where, if it miſcarry, it is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparably
loſt, unleſs it can be recovered again out of the <hi>Sea</hi> of
<hi>Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it becometh every one (both in reference to himſelf
and the whole) to contribute his utmoſt towards the right ſteering
of <hi>this Veſſel,</hi> towards the preſerving of it pure both in its <hi>ſtate</hi>
and <hi>motions,</hi> leſt both the <hi>good and welfare</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> and of
every <hi>particular</hi> miſcarry, for want of due care and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Towards which work, the further to incite and provoke others,
I caſt in this preſent <hi>offering,</hi> making mention of thoſe <hi>dangers</hi>
which lie open to my eye in reference to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> whereby
the <hi>true and genuine fruit</hi> of them may either be hindered from
<hi>growth,</hi> or come to be <hi>corrupted,</hi> whereby the People at leaſt cannot
but miſs of the proper uſe and benefit, which it ought to reap from
them.</p>
            <p>There are, in reference to Parliaments, ſix <hi>Caſes</hi> or <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
evident to me, whereby the hazard of the people may be very
great, which I ſhall ſet down diſtinctly that they may be the better
taken notice of, weighed and judged.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Want of Parliaments.</hi> Parliaments are the proper <hi>Remedy</hi>
to relieve the <hi>grieved People</hi> from their <hi>burdens and oppreſſions;</hi>
from any kind or the ſeveral kinds of oppreſſions that may befall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165855:13"/>
them; from the oppreſſions of any <hi>Government,</hi> any <hi>Governors,</hi>
any <hi>Laws,</hi> any <hi>Incroachments</hi> &amp;c. (for by ſeveral ways, means and
inſtruments the people may be oppreſſed) Now if <hi>Parliaments</hi>
be wanting, that is to ſay, be not duly called according to the need
of the people (it being their <hi>proper engine</hi> whereby alone they can
duly, orderly and ſafely act) their <hi>Right, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> is much
hazarded, and they obnoxious to lie under the burden of oppreſſion
without remedy. If <hi>diſeaſes</hi> grow, and a due <hi>courſe of phyſique</hi> be
not to be had, the body cannot but ſuffer damage and hazard.</p>
            <p>There are two things eſſentially neceſſary to the health and well-being
of a <hi>Nation,</hi> as well as of other bodies both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi>
which are, the cutting off of exuberances, and the ſupplying
of defects, both which in the principal and moſt weighty part of
them, are peculiar to <hi>Parliaments;</hi> ſo that where there is want of
them, the <hi>radical life and vertue</hi> of the people muſt needs be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
languiſh and decay. This is a very ill diſeaſe, how ever
thoſe who never knew or experimented the ſweetneſs of enjoying
their <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> may not be conſiderably ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Want of fair Elections,</hi> as thus, If the people be by any means
drawn from minding their own good, from bending themſelves to
chuſe perſons who may be fit to act for them. How eaſily may
<hi>Parl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aments</hi> warp aſide from eaſing and relieving the people unto
further burthening and grieving of them, if ſuch perſons be choſen
to appear in their behalf, who are friends to their Oppreſſors, and
have a particular advantage of ſharing with them in the benefit of
that which is the burden and cauſe of grief to the people? And
here is a great danger the people are very obnoxious to: Their
burdens commonly ariſe from the miſcarriage of the ſtill <hi>preſent
Governors,</hi> and theſe Governors cannot but have great advantages,
by their Power over them, to have an influence upon their choyce.
Therefore if the people be not ſo much the more wary, that which
was intended for their greateſt <hi>relief</hi> may turn to their greateſt
<hi>prejudice.</hi> O how miſerable is man, whoſe remedies againſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of dangers are ſo few, and even thoſe few all along ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to miſcarry! A <hi>Parliament</hi> may be prevented, that it may not
be to be had when there is moſt need of it: A <hi>Parliament</hi> may be
corrupt before it hath a Being, it may be ſo ill conſtituted in reſpect
of the <hi>materials</hi> of it, that it may be a fitter engine of ſlavery and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:165855:13"/>
miſery then of freedom and happineſs to a poor enthralled people.
And yet this is not all the danger that <hi>Parliaments</hi> are expoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as alſo the people, in relation to that good they hope for by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Short continuance of Parliaments.</hi> Suppoſe the people have
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> have a fair and free choyce without being over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
therein, or ſwayed aſide; nay ſuppoſe yet more, that they
chuſe well for themſelves; yet <hi>the Power</hi> they are to deal with
may overbear them, and (if they cannot bend them aſide) enforce
their <hi>diſſolution.</hi> And hereby the people muſt needs be deprived
of reaping that good they deſired and hoped for by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parliaments</hi> are <hi>great Bodies,</hi> and conſequently <hi>flow</hi> in motion,
which is their proper pace and advantage, for they can hardly do
any thing well but what they do ſlowly; for motions that require
ſwiftneſs <hi>Nature</hi> hath cut out other kind of bodies. Again, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
are to act very <hi>warily,</hi> (as the things they are to do, are
of great concernment, and require much <hi>circumspection</hi> and <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>)
and therefore in both theſe reſpects muſt have time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to act accurately in the diſcharge of <hi>ſo great a Truſt,</hi> and
in the managing of <hi>ſo weighty Affairs,</hi> which if it be not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
allotted them, they muſt of neceſſity be defective in.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Want of Power to Parliaments.</hi> Parliaments have a difficult
piece of work, <hi>viz. to chaſtiſe the greateſt Oppreſſors, and to ſtrike
at the very root and foundation of oppreſſion</hi> in any kind, and unleſs
they have Power anſwerable they cannot poſſibly go through with
it. <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> and <hi>interruptions</hi> from <hi>other Powers</hi> they muſt
expect to meet with, which if they be not able to graple with and
overcome, they cannot exerciſe the full Right and Liberty of the
People, either in <hi>puniſhing Offenders againſt the People,</hi> or in <hi>chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
eſtabliſhing or altering Governments, Laws or Governors</hi> for
the People. This muſt neceſſarily much hinder, if not put a ſtop to
their work: for if any fall ſhort of thoſe means which are proper
to an end, they cannot poſſibly attain that end: If the hand which
impoſeth and would keep burthens upon the back, be ſtronger then
that which would remove them; If the hand which would ſupply
defects, be weaker then that which ſtands in its way to ſtop it in
its courſe, vain and fruitleſs will all its endeavors be. (The Power
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:165855:14"/>
that relieveth from oppreſſion muſt of neceſſity be greater then the
Power that oppreſſeth.) And this was the condition of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Parliament,</hi> there was viſibly ſuch a <hi>Power</hi> over them as they
could do nothing to purpoſe for the good of the People; This
doubtleſs they had great reaſon to ſtrive to get looſe from, and the
people had great reaſon to ſtick to them in it, as alſo to expect from
them their own freedom after they were made free, the freedom of
the people being the end (theirs but the means,) and therefore moſt
to be eyed. 'Tis to no purpoſe at all to have never ſo free a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
unleſs we have alſo a <hi>People</hi> put into the poſſeſſion of their
freedoms by the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Over-long-duration of Parliaments.</hi> This was glanced at
before, but yet it will be requiſite to conſider of it further, becauſe
after thoſe many changes which of late we have been much driven
and neceſſitated into, we may at preſent lie more open to the <hi>ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
of this, then of any of the former: and it ſhould be the eſpecial
wiſdom and care of man to take moſt heed of that danger which he
lieth moſt open to. Every thing hath its <hi>appointed ſeaſons, bounds</hi>
and <hi>proper way of operation,</hi> within which it is very beautiful and
profitable, but beyond it very uncomely and dangerous. <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
in their ſeaſon, may bring forth a moſt ſweet and excellent
kind of fruit, which may vigorouſly refreſh the ſpirits, and recover
the decaying Liberties of a dying <hi>Nation;</hi> but continuing longer
then its ſeaſon, the <hi>Root it ſelf</hi> may eaſily grow corrupt, and <hi>the
fruit</hi> prove ſowre, harſh, and deadly, yea may tend to a more bitter
death then it was ordained to prevent. Many dangers <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are expoſed to by long continuance, whereby their <hi>nature
and constitution</hi> may be depraved, or they induced to act after a
different nature, or in other ways then is proper for them, or good
for the people. Thoſe dangers which more principally in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
repreſent themſelves to my eye, I ſhall here make mention
of.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by long continuance, will be ſubject to fall into
<hi>factions,</hi> which is the foundation of ſo many breaches and diviſions
in the whole, upon which they cannot but have an influence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them unto themſelves, the eye of the people being ſtill upon
the <hi>fountain-head.</hi> We have had ſufficient experience to evidence
the truth of this, for ſtill as the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath been divided, there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165855:14"/>
have alſo been diviſions throughout the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> Perſons
who act joyntly and uniformly at firſt, (having one and the ſame
<hi>ſenſe</hi> upon their ſpirits, one and the ſame <hi>end</hi> in their eye, one and
the ſame <hi>deſire</hi> in their hearts) may in proceſs of time loſe this
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> this <hi>deſire,</hi> this <hi>end,</hi> and be drawn aſide to another <hi>ſenſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
end,</hi> and differ alſo in their new choyce, which may inſenſibly
creep in upon them; and according to this difference, there will
enſue a diviſion among them both in their motions and actions.
Now how dangerous this is to have a breach <hi>in the Root,</hi> to have a
ſeed of diviſion <hi>in the heart,</hi> working there, ſpringing forth from
thence, and diffuſing it ſelf throughout the whole body, I think it
will be needleſs to expreſs.</p>
            <p>2. Parliament men, by the long continuance of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> will
be expoſed to the temptation of <hi>ſeeking themſelves,</hi> of minding and
proſecuting their ſeveral particular <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>interests.</hi> A Parliament
man, as he is choſen to be, ſo he ſhould ſet himſelf to be <hi>a publique
perſon,</hi> as it were forgetting himſelf, and giving up himſelf to be
taken up only with the <hi>publique good,</hi> for the ſeaſon of this work.
This a good <hi>Patriot</hi> may find ſomewhat eaſie to do for a while, but
if the <hi>Parliament</hi> laſt long, Self which is very ſtrong in him, and
may challenge a right to be looked after, will revive its right, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> in its own behalf. That man, that
could be content to lay all aſide, and bend himſelf wholly for the
publique for a ſhort time, cannot hold out in doing ſo, but will be
enforced to look after himſelf, his own affairs, his own profit and
thriving in the world, &amp;c. And when he comes to manage theſe
and the other together, it will be very difficult for him to avoyd
making uſe of that advantage, which both his power and the long
continuance of it affords him, towards his own particular benefit.
And Self, having thus crept in, will grow more and more upon him,
and will be continually, ſecretly and ſubtilly drawing him more and
more towards himſelf, and more and more from the publique: and
killing thoſe affections in him (which are too apt of themſelves to
do) which were very lively at firſt for the publique, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much unfit him for his work.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Parliaments</hi> by long continuance are in danger of contracting <hi>a
particular Intereſt</hi> (an Intereſt diſtinct from that Intereſt which
they have as a part of and in common with the people) in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165855:15"/>
Government.</hi> Every man hath an allowable <hi>Intereſt</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the whole, ſo that if it goeth well with the whole, every
one ſhares in it: This is a good, a profitable Intereſt, no way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to any elſe. But then there is <hi>a particular Interest,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may go well with ſome, though ill with the generality; nay
the welfare of ſome may ariſe out of the incommodity of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
That wind which bloweth ill upon the publique, may blow
profit to ſome. This <hi>Intereſt</hi> all Powers do readily contract to
themſelves, partly by their own <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and partly by their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to winde into other Powers, the greater ſtill bringing the leſs
into ſubjection, which muſt be at its command and uſe, or be
broken by it. This ſnare which other Powers by their continuation
are ſtill running into, the <hi>Parliament</hi> is to redeem and purge them
from; but to take heed leſt their own continuance ſhould be ſo
long, as to bring them into the ſame ſnare; which may both <hi>unfit
them for their proper work,</hi> which is to be Judges on the behalf
of the Commonwealth, which how can they truly execute, who
have a particular intereſt and ſhare of their own (beſides that which
they have in common with the people) in the preſent Government,
whom as it favours, ſo they muſt again favour it? As alſo it may
<hi>engage them in an improper work, viz.</hi> in becoming Adminiſtrators
in the preſent Government, which is no way proper for ſuch as are
appointed to be the Judges of Adminiſtrators and Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Parliament</hi> have an intereſt in the Government with the reſt
of the people, yea a right and power conferred upon them by the
people to <hi>order, ſettle, amend,</hi> or (if need be) <hi>new-make</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for themſelves and the people; but not to meddle with
the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of it, or to endeavor to bend it aſide, in the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi>
of it, for any particular end or advantage of their own;
which their Power may eaſily do, and which their over-long-dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may too much intice them to aſſay to do.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by long continuance, may incur the danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting,
if not of ſwallowing up the <hi>ordinary courſe</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
enjoying their <hi>Right</hi> in obtaining <hi>ſpeedy, free and impartial
Juſtice</hi> by the adminiſtration and execution of the Laws. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doth commonly weaken, if not devour the leſs. Extraordinary
remedies are apt to thruſt into the place of the ordinary, eſpecially
when by long duration they may ſeem to challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165855:15"/>
the right of becoming ordinary.</p>
            <p>5. (Which is worſt of all) <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by over-long-duration,
may ſlip into danger of depriving the people of the proper uſe and
benefit of Parliaments. The proper uſe of Parliaments is to be a
<hi>curb</hi> to the extravagancy of Power, of the <hi>higheſt ſtanding Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
But if they themſelves become <hi>the ſtanding Power,</hi> how can
they be a fit curb for it? A <hi>Parliament</hi> is to be ſuch a Body as
may have the ſenſe of the people upon them, that ſo they may be
led by that ſenſe to eaſe, relieve and ſafeguard the people: But if
once they become <hi>Governors,</hi> they will loſe that ſenſe, and have a
ſenſe of a different nature upon them: They will (like other
Governors) have a ſenſe of the <hi>duty</hi> of the people which they
owe to their Governors, but loſe (by degrees, ſtill more and
more) their ſenſe of the <hi>burthens</hi> and <hi>grievances</hi> of the People.
So that if Parliaments ſucceed in the place of the <hi>ſupream-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring-power,</hi>
there will be as much need of ſomewhat elſe to
ſtand between the people and them, as there was of them to ſtand
between the people and <hi>Kingly Power:</hi> for they coming into
that place and Authority, the people are in as much danger of
them, as they were of the Power of Kings: for it is not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſimply, but the power, wherein the danger or benefit lieth.
And this doubtleſs is the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the People, and
herein lieth their <hi>Safety, viz.</hi> to have an <hi>extraordinary, legiſlative,
alterative, corrective Power</hi> above the <hi>ordinary ſtanding Power;</hi>
and this Power, as to conſiſt of <hi>the Body of the People,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to be kept altogether free from having any particular <hi>hand
in Government,</hi> (but to keep within the bounds of their own
extraordinary work, which is not ſo much in as about Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
that ſo they may both have and retain the ſenſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
being engaged by their ſtate and condition to do nothing which
may prejudice the people, becauſe in caſe they do, they themſelves
will ſuddenly feel the ſmart of it.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>The laſt</hi> danger, <hi>which I ſhall at this time mention in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to</hi> Parliaments, <hi>is this.</hi> The aſſuming a Power of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature from them, not proper to them; and intermedling
with a work which they are not fitted for, entruſted with, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Powers,</hi> like other things (and ſomewhat more advantagiouſly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:165855:16"/>
then other things, having ſtronger hands) are ſtill gathering in to
themſelves. The rich man will be gathering riches, the wiſe
man will be gathering wiſdom, and the powerful man will be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
power: And in attracting to himſelf (eſpecially where he
is the <hi>ſole Judg</hi>) it is very difficult for him to be <hi>moderate</hi> or
<hi>innocent.</hi> He who hath a right power in ſome things, it is hard
for him to keep there, and not to ſeek after and lay hold on, if he
can, that power which he ought not to have, and in thoſe other
kind of things wherein he ought not to have power. That a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as well as other <hi>Powers,</hi> is ſubject to this temptation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed.</p>
            <p>This is dangerous every where. (To have things endowed
with a different, if not contrary nature, to have things employed
about a different, if not a contrary work to neglect their own
work for which they are fit, to which they are appointed, and
execute another work for which they are not fit, to which they
are not appointed; this, let it be never ſo carefully and faithfully
managed, muſt needs bring <hi>diſorder, confuſion,</hi> nay greater <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</hi>)
But the greater the power is, the greater is the
danger: becauſe as the greateſt power may do moſt good in its
own way, ſo it may do moſt harm in a wrong way. <hi>Powers</hi>
that are great, bring forth great effects either of <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Order</hi> or <hi>Confuſion, Salvation</hi> or <hi>Destruction.</hi> No reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſo ſoveraign, ſo reſtorative as a <hi>Parliament</hi> rightly conſtituted,
rightly applyed, and rightly acting: No diſeaſe more deadly,
more conſuming the very <hi>heart-life</hi> of the Rights and Liberties
of a Nation, then a <hi>Parliament</hi> miſconſtituted, miſapplyed, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting.</p>
            <p>But every one here will be ready to ſay, What is <hi>that Power</hi>
which is proper to <hi>Parliaments?</hi> what is their <hi>proper work?</hi>
what is that Power of a different nature, which will be ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for them to aſſume? and what is that work, which they are
not fitted for, entruſted with, or appointed to?</p>
            <p>To ſatisfie the deſire of ſuch as may greedily enquire after this,
I ſhall anſwer ſomewhat, according to that inſight which is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me into the nature of things, ſhewing (from the <hi>Principles</hi>
foregoing) both what their proper <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> is, and then
what <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> is improper for them. And it is a clearer and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165855:16"/>
far ſafer way, to ſearch out and diſcover things from their firſt riſe
in Nature, then from ſucceeding <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Practiſes,</hi> which
may eaſily decline awry and cover the true knowledg and intent of
things.</p>
            <p>Now concerning their proper <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> I ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to define the particular limits of it, it will ſuffice to my
purpoſe, to expreſs the general nature of it, which to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
thus.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAL (Humane</hi> or <hi>Civil) EXTRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORDINARY,
CONSTIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TIVE, CORREC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE,
ALTERATIVE POWER.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak
chiefly of their <hi>Power,</hi> which will of it ſelf diſcover their <hi>Work,</hi>
therefore that will not need ſo particularly to be opened.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay it is <hi>NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAL:</hi> ſuch a Power as is ſown in
<hi>man,</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of man. Man hath a power over himſelf, to
diſpoſe of himſelf, according to that wiſdom and righteouſneſs
which is ſeated in him, grows up with him (if it be not blaſted or
kept under,) which he further attains to, or is in a further degree
beſtowed upon him. Of this common kinde is this, with all other
earthly Powers.</p>
            <p>But this expreſſeth onely the <hi>kinde</hi> of it, we are yet far from
the <hi>particular nature, end,</hi> or <hi>uſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore to deſcribe it further, I term it <hi>EXTRAORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARY,</hi>
which it diſcovers it ſelf to be, being a thing not for
common and conſtant uſe, but for extraordinary ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
and the nature of things muſt be ſuited to their end, for
thither it is to direct them.</p>
            <p>Then more particularly there is expreſſed what kinde of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Power it is, namely, <hi>CONSTIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TIVE, COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECTIVE,
ALTERATIVE:</hi> It is a Power of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up or eſtabliſhing Laws, Governments, Governors; of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
them, of altering them.</p>
            <p>This is the nature of their Power, which pointeth out their
work ſo plainly, as it will not need more particularly to be ſpecified
in this place.</p>
            <p>Now by this there are two ſorts of Power cut off from them,
one whole kinde of Power, and one main branch of another
kinde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:165855:17"/>
1. <hi>Spiritual Power,</hi> which claimeth its deſcent from <hi>Christ
as the Head of his Church,</hi> and is appropriated by its nature, end
and uſe, unto his Body the Church, which is his <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
to be governed by him, even by that power of his <hi>Spirit</hi> which
he pleaſeth to exerciſe upon them, whether immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or mediately by ſuch as he ſubſtituteth under him. This
Power, as it is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ſo it is fit to be managed onely by <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
hands: Not by <hi>Men,</hi> but by <hi>Christians;</hi> nor by every
Chriſtian, but by ſuch onely as can clear the derivacy of it from
<hi>Christ</hi> to them, ſuch as are fitted and appointed by him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in his own ſeat and place of Government. Nor are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to exerciſe this Government over other men, but onely over
Chriſtians, whom alone it is ſuited to. Nor are they to govern
as men; by outward force; but as Chriſtians, by ſpiritual vertue
and efficacy upon the Conſcience, the ſeat of <hi>Christ</hi> in man, ſo
that it may appear that not they, but <hi>the Spirit of Christ, the
Spirit in Christ,</hi> doth rule and govern. O how ſweet would this
Government be! how pleaſant to a Chriſtian the ſtricteſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſharpeſt Laws in it! <hi>Christs yoke is eaſie, and his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
is light,</hi> even in the ſharpeſt and weightieſt part of it.</p>
            <p>But this Power belongeth not to any <hi>Nation</hi> or People under
Heaven, there being not any Nation or People which can evidence
the fair and clear derivacy of this Power from <hi>Christ</hi> to them: (as
it was not intended for any Nation or People, ſave onely <hi>his own
Nation, his own People.</hi>) Therefore not to any <hi>Parliament,</hi> who
are but the People in a repreſentative Body, in a Body contracted
into a narrower compaſs for the uſe and ſervice of the People;
who as they ſtand in their ſtead, ſo they have onely their Power.
The People being the ſtock or root from whence their Power and
Authority doth ſpring, it can riſe no higher, not be of any other
nature, then that which is in the People.</p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Civil Power,</hi> the adminiſtrative or governing part of it
appeareth from hence not to appertain to them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> as well as in <hi>natural,</hi> Nature hath cut out
the proportion (in general, though not in particular.) There is <hi>the
Head</hi> and <hi>the Members,</hi> having each their ſeveral innate <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Motions, Laws</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> which cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
without violence to Nature, or without danger to that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:165855:17"/>
Body or Society which breaketh the bounds limited by Nature. In
every Society which is orderly, there is the Head and the Members,
part to govern, and part to be governed; to each of which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their particular Rights: to the one ſuch as they may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged
for and in government by, to the other ſuch as they may be
advantaged under government by; that the <hi>yoke</hi> may be gently,
orderly, and ſweetly managed by the one, and ſweetly born by the
other.</p>
            <p>Now this is moſt evident, that the People are <hi>the Body,</hi> the
People are <hi>to be governed;</hi> not to be <hi>the Head,</hi> not <hi>to govern.</hi>
The <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> indeed belongs to them, that their yoke
might be the more eaſie: But the <hi>Adminiſtrative Power</hi> doth in
no wiſe belong to them, but to thoſe who are to govern. And
though the People might be flattered and encouraged, from ſenſe
of the miſuſe of this Power, to take it into their own hands, yet
it can never thrive there: and though they ſhould ſet themſelves
to reſt content, nay to pleaſe themſelves with it; yet you muſt
needs grow weary of it, and that very quickly, the inconveniences
will multiply ſo faſt, and grow ſo unavoydable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parliaments</hi> are the Body of the People, choſen by the People
to ſtand for them, to repreſent them, to act in their ſtead: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably,
They have that Power which is proper to the People,
the <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> the <hi>Supremely-Judicative;</hi> but not that Power
which belongs not to the People, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Administrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like maner this diſcovers a double kinde of work improper
for them.</p>
            <p>The one is, <hi>medling with ſpiritual affairs.</hi> The <hi>conſtituting</hi> of
theſe, the <hi>amending</hi> of theſe, the <hi>altering</hi> of theſe is onely proper
to ſuch as are inveſted with <hi>ſpiritual Power and Authority.</hi> The
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> were never appointed to be ſet up by the Power
of man, but by the <hi>Power of his Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Conſcience.</hi> It is
accounted profane, and much ſtartled at, to touch that which man
hath <hi>made holy,</hi> which man hath <hi>ſeparated</hi> and conſecrated to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
uſe;</hi> and yet how propenſe are, almoſt all perſons, to be lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hands on that, <hi>which God hath made holy and ſet a part</hi> for
himſelf! How ſad an effect we have ſeen and felt from underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
in this kinde, cannot but be freſh in our memories; what a
ſad <hi>breach</hi> and <hi>diſunion</hi> it hath occaſioned throughout the whole
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:165855:18"/>
               <hi>Nation,</hi> and particularly in the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Nor can I conceive
readily, how it could be otherwiſe; The cloſeſt bond of union miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and miſapplyed muſt needs become the greateſt inſtrument
of diviſion (to let paſs Gods intereſt to blaſt men, when they will
be venturing upon that work which he hath not appointed them
unto, but reſerved for himſelf.) The wound thus made may prove
incurable. Men differing in their judgments, and conſequently in
their deſires; differing in the apprehenſion of their duties; their
motions and endevors muſt needs run croſs and become irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable,
while the foundation of this difference remains. While a
man is ſtrongly perſwaded, that this or this is the way and Will
of God, that it is his duty to uſe the utmoſt of his abilities, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunies
and advantages for the promoting of it, that this is the main
end for which power is put into his hands, the chief thing God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from him, and will call him to a very ſtrict account about the
improving of all his power and intereſt unto the advancing of this;
I ſay while things ſtand thus, how can he with the quiet of his
Conſcience neglect acting accordingly? The <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> is now
engaged indiſſolubly, to uſe his utmoſt ſtrength and endevor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the advancing of <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> which is Gods inſtituted way
of Worſhip in his eye; and ſo the <hi>Independent</hi> of <hi>Independency,</hi>
which is Chriſt Inſtitution in his eye. Now having taſted ſo much
of this, and ſmarted ſo much by this, men ſhould be very wary of
intermedling in things of this nature, further then their ground is
clear.</p>
            <p>The other is, <hi>The taking upon them the Adminiſtration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or intermixing with the adminiſtration of Government.</hi>
This is the moſt pernicious thing to a <hi>Parliament</hi> that can be, for
it both diverteth them from their own work, and out of their own
way, into one of another nature; and ſo thruſteth them into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of doing diſſervice, and into an incapacity of doing ſervice.
This may make uſeleſs, nay may make burthenſom, the beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<hi>Parliament.</hi> Suppoſe a <hi>Parliament</hi> of never ſuch entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted-honeſt-men,
moſt ſtudiouſly bent and applying themſelves
to publique ſervice; yet if they be over-full of another kind of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
then their own, or intermix another kinde of buſineſs with
their own, they can neither well diſpatch that other kinde of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which they are ſo over-full of, or which they ſo intermix; nor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165855:18"/>
ther own neither. And it is the ready way to turn the hearts of
the People from <hi>Parliaments:</hi> for finding things go ſo grievouſly
amiſs (as by this means they needs muſt,) and in the hands too of
ſuch men, as they can hardly hope for better, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to look on a <hi>Parliament</hi> no longer as a <hi>remedy,</hi> but as a worſe
<hi>diſeaſe,</hi> then that which they addreſſed themſelves to it for cure
of. O conſider your ſnare, ye who are in danger of it! How prone
was the <hi>Adminiſtrative</hi> Power to intrench upon the bounds of the
<hi>Legiſlative,</hi> and how afflictive did it become thereby! Is not the
<hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power as prone to intrench upon the <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive?</hi>
and in ſo doing, is it not likely to prove as afflictive?</p>
            <p>Look into <hi>Nature,</hi> See if ever this kinde of Body was cut out,
fitted or appointed by it to govern. It hath not a fit form or ſhape
for it; it is unweildy for ſuch a kinde of motion.</p>
            <p>Again, Look into <hi>the tenor of your Call and Truſt:</hi> Were ye
ever entruſted herewith by the People? Is it, or ever was it, the
minde of the People? Did they chuſe you for this end? Have ye
a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from them, I mean not formally, but ſo much as
vertually, intentionally? They called you to rectifie Government,
that is clear enough; but did they call you to govern? O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
remember, when any ſuch motions ariſe in you, when any
ſuch temptations beſet you; Ye are not fitted to it by Nature:
your motion is ſlow, but the work and way of Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſpeed and ſwiftneſs; And if ye ſhould from a deſire, from
an apprehenſion of advantage, from ſenſe of preſent need, or any
other never ſo good an intent, alter your own ſlow pace and ſtrive
to act ſwiftly; it will quickly appear how uncomely it is in you,
and how unſafe for the People. Remember alſo, that ye are not
called to it by the People: and if ye will yet be venturing upon it,
doubtleſs ye will run the hazard of ruining both your ſelves and
the People.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>dangers</hi> which <hi>Parliaments</hi> (and through
them the People) are obnoxious to. How far <hi>this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
hath been overtaken with any of them, or how far the People
hath ſuffered thereby, I ſhall not take upon me to determine. Only
thus much I cannot but expreſs, That <hi>the preſent ſtate of affairs</hi> is
(to my eye) much <hi>entangled,</hi> and that <hi>the true foundations of Right
and Freedom</hi> (ſo far as I can diſcern) are not yet layd; and I could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165855:19"/>
earneſtly deſire and much entreat thoſe in whoſe power it is, to do
<hi>the main work,</hi> and to do it throughly: To let fall all deſire of
<hi>Power or Supremacy</hi> (whoſe ſweetneſs will be tempting the beſt)
to ſtrike at the root of all <hi>particular Intereſts</hi> which ſtand in the
way of <hi>publique good,</hi> and to ſet upon ſuch ways of publique
good, ſo evidently and directly tending thereto, as might be forcible
to convince very <hi>enemies</hi> to them by their clearneſs in reaſon, and
by the ſweet benefit which they ſhould not be able to avoyd taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reaping from them. Having ſuch advantage of Power in
their hands, what is it which might not be done for publique good,
if men had hearts, and were in a right way?</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſaid, that <hi>a ſtander by may ſee more then a game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi>
which if it be true, I may aſſume unto my ſelf ſome freedom
of ſpeech more then ordinary, my condition intereſſing me in it.
For I have been long taken off from being an <hi>Actor</hi> in any kinde, to
become only a <hi>Spectator;</hi> yea and I think I may ſay ſafely, not an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
but a free Spectator. I have not been intereſſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of any party whatſoever, nor ſo much as in deſire to have any
party thrive, further then they have been guided by <hi>Principles</hi> of
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> unto common good. There is not one
ſort of men upon the face of the Earth, to whom I bear any enmity
in my ſpirit (though in ſome reſpect I muſt confeſs my ſelf an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to every ſort of men) but wiſh, with all my heart, they might
all attain and enjoy as much <hi>Peace, Prosperity,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as
their ſtate and condition will bear. There are not any to whom I
ſhould envy <hi>Government,</hi> but, who ever they are, they ſhould have
my vote on their behalf, whom I ſaw fitted for it and called to it.
Indeed I am offended, very much offended with moſt perſons and
things, and I have a deep Charge againſt them, which at preſent I
keep ſecret, not intending to bring it forth till I come upon that
ſtage where I may have fair play. Yet thus much I will ſay, which
toucheth a little upon it. I am offended both with <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or rather with that which pretends to be Light, and
that which is acknowledged to be Darkneſs. <hi>I am offended with
that which pretends to be Light,</hi> becauſe it doth not more fairly
overcome Darkneſs; but while it blames it for its dark paths of
<hi>Tyranny, Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> it ſelf ſeeks (not by the pure
vertue and power of Light, but) by the ſame weapons, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165855:19"/>
               <hi>dark violence</hi> to conquer it; and if it ever prevail this way to do
it effectually, I ſhall be much miſtaken. <hi>I am</hi> alſo <hi>offended with
Darkneſs;</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>true</hi> to it ſelf, not <hi>juſt</hi> to it ſelf, not
<hi>at peace</hi> with it ſelf, nor keeps within the <hi>ſphere</hi> of its own <hi>dark
Principles</hi> (even thoſe which it doth acknowledg) in its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or in its oppoſing either Light or Darkneſs <hi>Christians</hi>
diſhonour themſelves and their Principles; They ſpeak indeed of
<hi>the Light of God,</hi> of <hi>the Life of God,</hi> of <hi>the Power of God,</hi> of <hi>the
great Name of God,</hi> but are fallen ſhort of the true <hi>vertue</hi> and
<hi>glory</hi> of all theſe, both in <hi>Religion,</hi> and in their <hi>courſe</hi> in the
World. <hi>Men</hi> diſhonor themſelves and their Principles, falling
ſhort of that <hi>common love, good will</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature would teach them to obſerve, notwithſtanding its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation,
were their ears open. But I delight neither to complain
nor accuſe, onely I cannot but wiſh that all cauſe and occaſion of
complaint and accuſation were taken away from him who doth
delight in either. All the liberty I ſhall now make uſe of, is onely
freely to expreſs what I conceive neceſſary, in the preſent confuſed
ſtate of things, to reduce them into ſome certain ſafe and well-grounded
order, according to plain Principles of Reaſon and
Righteouſneſs, without aiming either at the throwing down or
ſetting up of any perſon or thing: Which, what interpretation
ſoever of weakneſs, folly or diſaffection may be put upon it, I finde
not my ſelf very prone to value. This <hi>temper</hi> hath long attended
my ſpirit, not much to regard, what account either I my ſelf or
any elſe put upon things, but rather to expect what things will
then appear to be, when they ſhal be made manifeſt by <hi>that Light,</hi>
which doth diſcover them as they are, and will paſs ſuch a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
upon them as they deſerve, and ſhall not be able to gainſay
or avoyd.</p>
            <p>It is a kinde office and a commendable peece of ſervice to help
out of the mire, or to offer ſo to do, yet can hardly be ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him who obſerveth not himſelf to be in the mire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
hath no ſenſe of any need of help: He will rather enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it with diſdain then acceptation, it implying him to be in ſuch
a condition as he is unwilling to own or acknowledg. But how
ever, as I have on the one hand expreſſed my ſence (though very
ſparingly) of our preſent <hi>entangled condition,</hi> wherein we finde
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165855:20"/>
our ſelves at a loſs in our very <hi>remedy:</hi> ſo I ſhall on the other
hand offer what help my Reaſon and Judgment preſents to me as
proper and neceſſary to diſ-involve us and bring us into a right
courſe.</p>
            <p>To come then to what I drive at, firſt I ſhall ſpeak a word in
general towards ſetling, and then propound more particularly,
what things are needful (conſidering our preſent ſtate) towards
the ſetling of affairs in order, juſtice and ſafety, both to diſ-engage
us from fundamental miſcarriages and dangers (which it is very eaſie
to ſlip into, and very hard to wade out of, eſpecially after our ſo
long treading in ſuch an unuſual track, as of late we have been
much driven into) and to ſet us ſtraight.</p>
            <p>Towards ſetling in general I ſhould ſay three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That we ſhould look well to our ſetling, look well how
we ſettle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we ſhould be careful of avoyding <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi>
of <hi>Government</hi> in our ſetling.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That we ſhould have regard to the <hi>Rights of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and eſpecially to their <hi>rectifying Right,</hi> that it have
its free current.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We ſhould look well to our ſetling.</hi> Shakings generally tend
to ſetling; and ſetlings frequently make way for future ſhakings.
Shakings are ſudden and violent moſt commonly, not flowing ſo
much from deliberation as from force: but ſetlings require great
warineſs and circumſpection, leſt that <hi>corruption</hi> which cauſed
our diſturbance (and ſhould be ſhaken out) put on <hi>a new guiſe,</hi>
and ſettle again on our <hi>new foundation;</hi> whereby there are not
onely new ſeed plots ſtrown of freſh enſuing miſeries, but alſo
preparation made for a new <hi>Earthquake.</hi> Therefore it behoveth
us to look well about us, and to ſettle warily, that we may ſettle
ſurely.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>We ſhould be careful to avoyd Arbitrarineſs of Government
in our ſetling.</hi> If <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi> of Power, and a <hi>Government</hi> by
<hi>Will,</hi> not <hi>Law,</hi> was our burthen, and that which we ſo ſtrongly
deſired and endevored to throw off from our backs: then ſurely
they to whom it appertaineth, and who have engaged themſelves
to free us from it, ought to be exceeding careful and watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
involving us again in it. If it hath already miſcarryed in one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165855:20"/>
hand, it may alſo do in another: However, in reaſon we are not to
be tyed to run the venture. It is not the change of the hand, but
the change of the Rule, which we expect as our <hi>foundation</hi> of
Safety. He that doth us good in an arbitrary way, and by an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power to day, may by the ſame way and power do us harm
to morrow.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In our ſetling regard ſhould be had to the Rights of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and especially to their rectifying Right, that it have its free
current.</hi> The <hi>Rights</hi> of the People were the main thing preſented
to view in this great conflict, and therefore in equity ſhould be
mainly proſecuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt principally thoſe which are their
moſt needful and uſeful <hi>Rights.</hi> Our <hi>Laws</hi> are our Rights, and
we ſhould be loth to be deprived of any of them (whoſe reaſon
was both good at firſt, and remaineth ſtill in force:) But there are
ſome Rights and Liberties which are the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of
our Laws, and our <hi>ultimate Refuge</hi> for ſuccour and ſafety; and
therefore much nearer to us, and more eſſential to our happineſs,
then others are. Theſe are eſpecially to be regarded. And this ſo
much the rather, becauſe the people are ſo fit a Body to be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and trampled upon, that it is very hard for thoſe which are great
in power, to keep their feet from off their necks. Alas, the people
have no way to avoyd danger but by running upon the <hi>Rocks;</hi> they
have no way to ſhun ruine, but by haſting into ruine. Thoſe they
chuſe to govern them gently, to defend them, may fit hard upon
their backs, yea themſelves may make a prize of them: And if they
can in length of time, through many difficulties, obtain and appoint
Truſtees to rectifie theſe miſcarriages, yet how many temptations
they have to miſmanage it, they think not of, and how they will
manage it, they know not. <hi>Experience</hi> doth ſtill ſhew how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
it is throughly to mind the good of the people. One half of
the work is ſometimes done (ſometimes very often) <hi>viz. the
cruſhing of Oppreſſors:</hi> but the other half, <hi>viz. the breaking the
yoke of oppreſſion,</hi> is very rare and hard even for them to do who
have prevailed to ſhake the Oppreſſors out of their ſeats.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general. Now more particularly, there are four
things appear to me as neceſſary, unto a fair and firm ſetling.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A clear distinction between the adminiſtrative or executive
Power, and the legiſlative or judicative:</hi> that as they have in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:165855:21"/>
themſelves, ſo they may retain in their courſe, their clear and diſtinct
natures, the one not intermixing or intermedling with the other:
That the <hi>adminiſtrative</hi> may not intermingle it ſelf, or meddle with
the <hi>legiſlative,</hi> but leave it to its own free courſe; nor the <hi>legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
with the <hi>adminiſtrative</hi> by any extemporary precepts, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or injunctions, but only by ſet and known Laws. Things which
are ſevered in their nature muſt likewiſe be ſevered in their uſe and
application, or elſe we cannot but fail of reaping thoſe fruits and
effects which we deſire from them, and which otherwiſe they might
bear, and we enjoy.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A preſcription of clear and distinct Rules and Bounds to
each.</hi> That the <hi>Trust, Power, Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> of each,
which flow from the common light of man, and are intended for
the common good of man, may be made evident to that common
light; that the people may know hereby what they are to expect
from each, what they are to expect from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> what
they are to expect from their <hi>ſupream Governor</hi> or Governors, and
ſo may be underſtandingly ſenſible of good or ill uſage. There is
nothing (among that nature of things we now treat of) of it ſelf
unlimited: and the more clearly the limits of any thing are ſet and
known, the greater advantage hath it both to move ſafely, and to
vindicate the integrity and righteouſneſs of its motions. If the limits
of Power be not deſcribed and made known, it will be left too looſe
in its actings, and the people alſo will be left too looſe in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of its actings (neither of them being groundedly able to
juſtifie themſelves in either unto the other) neither of which is ſafe.
If the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath one apprehenſion of its limits, and the
people another, they can neither be ſatisfied in the other; but the
people muſt needs diſreliſh the actions of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the
<hi>Parliament</hi> cannot but think themſelves injuried by the people,
which may occaſion the laying of a dangerous foundation of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and diviſion between them. Yea hereby the Parliaments beſt
friends may be forced to become its enemies, and it may be forced
to deal moſt ſharply with its beſt friends, and ſo weaken its beſt
ſtrength, and the beſt ſtrength of the <hi>Nation.</hi> Thoſe that are friends
to <hi>things</hi> are not friends to <hi>perſons,</hi> any further then they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to <hi>things.</hi> It is as hateful to <hi>true-bred-ſpirits</hi> to idolize
the name of a <hi>Parliament</hi> any more then of a <hi>King:</hi> it is <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:165855:21"/>
rightly adminiſtred in its own <hi>proper way</hi> and <hi>channel,</hi> by
perſons in place and power, which alone can make them lovely to
ſuch as love not <hi>men,</hi> but <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> It was the error of the
foregoing governing Power to eſteem it ſelf more at liberty, then in
right it was; it may alſo be the error of the preſent legiſlative
power, yea their condition expoſeth them more unto it (their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
being larger, or of a larger kind;) and therefore they ought
the more abundantly to beware of it, and to apply themſelves to
produce, or cauſe to be produced, a true and fair diſcovery of thoſe
bounds and limits wherein they are (by the nature of things) cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed:
for if they do not know them, it will be impoſſible
for them to keep within them; and if the people do not know
them, it may be difficult (in many conſiderable caſes) to them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they do keep within them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>An unqueſtionably free and equal Parliament.</hi> It is not
every <hi>cauſe</hi> which will produce a true and genuine <hi>effect,</hi> but the
cauſe muſt be rightly tempered to bring forth kindly fruit. It is
not every <hi>Parliament</hi> which can heal or ſettle a <hi>Nation,</hi> or that the
people have juſt cauſe to reſt ſatisfied in; but a <hi>Parliament</hi> fairly
choſen, equally repreſenting the people, and freely acting for the
people.</p>
            <p>Now every man knoweth <hi>force</hi> to be oppoſite to <hi>freedom.</hi>
That which is <hi>free</hi> is not <hi>forced,</hi> and that which is <hi>forced</hi> is not
<hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Parliament</hi> hath, viſibly to every common eye, been more
then once forced; and it is not very eaſie after violence to break
forth again into perfect liberty: the ſenſe and remembrance of the
former force, together with an inward fear of the like again (if the
like occaſion ſhall happen) may be a ſecret, though not ſo apparant
a <hi>bond</hi> upon their ſpirits, which may in ſome particulars incline them
both to do what they would not, and to neglect the doing of what
they would.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it may be conſidered how far that <hi>viſible force,</hi> which
cauſed ſo great an <hi>alteration</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſuch a change
in affairs, did intrench upon the <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For though
every <hi>detention</hi> of ſome or many Members may not diſanul the
freedom of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet ſome kind of detention, ſo and ſo
qualified, neceſſarily doth. An <hi>occaſional</hi> or <hi>accidental detention</hi> is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165855:22"/>
not of ſo great force as an <hi>intentional:</hi> yet if ſuch an accidental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of ſome of the Members ſhould happen, whereby the <hi>ſtate</hi>
and <hi>courſe</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be changed, it might well be
diſputed, whether the reſt (ſtill ſitting and acting contrary to what
was done before thoſe Members were detained) might be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a free <hi>Parliament,</hi> (when ſuch a force was viſibly upon ſome
part of it, as changed the whole ſtate of affairs in it:) for this were
plainly an accidental bending of the <hi>Parliament</hi> from its intended
<hi>courſe,</hi> from its <hi>free current,</hi> and ſo far as it is bent it is not free.
But in the caſe in hand there was yet more, There was an <hi>intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
bending of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> (as was expreſly declared by them
who were the inſtruments to bend it) there was a culling out of
thoſe who ſtood in the way of what the <hi>Army</hi> thought juſt, ſafe
and neceſſary to be done. And this was done purpoſely that the
<hi>Parliament</hi> might be put into another poſture, and act other things
different from what, as they were then conſtituted, they could be
drawn unto. Now though there ſhould be a violent detention of
divers Members of the <hi>Parliament</hi> from doing that ſervice, which
they ought and deſire to do according to their Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
yet if the <hi>Parliament</hi> be not bent hereby, but go on in
the ſame path it was walking in before, it hath the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereby to argue and to make good its freedom: But if by
this force it be viſibly and apparantly bent, put into another poſture,
and into contrary ways and motions, the evidencing of its freedom
will, in this caſe, be more difficult.</p>
            <p>There might yet be further added the Judgment of the <hi>Army</hi>
concerning this action of their own, who were likely to look fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably
upon it being their own, but I purpoſely wave it: for I do
not go about to make the moſt of theſe things, but deſire only the
granting of thus much to me, that this <hi>Parliament</hi> is not unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
free, and ſo the people, who are ſenſible thereof, cannot reſt
fully ſatisfied in their ſpirits, that this preſent engine is their evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-genuine
and proper engine.</p>
            <p>And as this preſent <hi>Parliament</hi> is not unqueſtionably free, no
more is it an unqueſtionably equal Repreſentative of the people,
neither in reſpect of the number of the perſons, nor in reſpect of the
qualification of the perſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for <hi>the number of the perſons.</hi> Every <hi>County, City, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:165855:22"/>
having their ſtock going, their right and intereſt concerned
in the whole, their particular advantage or diſadvantage while <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
ſit; ſo they ought to have their proper <hi>Substitutes</hi> or
<hi>Repreſenters</hi> to appear for them, to ſtand in their ſtead, to have an
influence in the managing of their particular caſes, and their right in
the whole, which, as the caſe now ſtands, many do want.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for <hi>the qualification of the perſons.</hi> For it is not a
number of perſons (though choſen by the people) ſimply conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that do or can repreſent the people: They are but <hi>ſhadows,</hi> not
the <hi>true Repreſentatives</hi> of the People (though deſigned by the
people to that end) unleſs they be rightly qualified. How is that?
Why thus: by underſtanding the condition and deſires of thoſe
they ſtand for, and by repreſenting thoſe deſires ſeaſonably in their
ſtead: for they are choſen to be <hi>common perſons,</hi> and therefore
ought to have the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Rights, Liberties, Safeties,
Needs, Deſires</hi> of thoſe they ſtand for. If a man undertake to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
for me, and doth not know or care to know what I need or
deſire, he doth me a double injury; both putting me to the loſs of
that which I might obtain, and depriving me of the means I might
otherwiſe have attained it by.</p>
            <p>Now there is a great exception againſt theſe preſent Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in this reſpect, the ſtate of things, and conſequently burthens
being much changed, ſince they were choſen to repreſent them. It
is a long while ſince the firſt ſitting of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the
change of Power, with other things, may have cauſed many new
burthens, which they, being in power, cannot ſo fully feel, nor ſeem
ſo fit to be <hi>Judges</hi> of. The <hi>burthens</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> ſtill ariſe from
the <hi>preſent Power,</hi> that power from which they did formerly ariſe
is removed, another hath ſucceeded: Now they who are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in the <hi>ſucceeding Power</hi> ſeem no way fit to repreſent the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
of the people under that power: but ſuch of the common
people as lie moſt under them, and moſt feel them, are likely to be
moſt fit to repreſent the ſenſe of them. Theſe indeed might be fit,
when they were choſen, to be Judges of former burthens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
but they ſeem not now ſo fit to be Judges concerning
preſent burthens and oppreſſions: Not that which manageth the
power can ſo fairly, clearly and ſenſibly judg whether it be eaſie or
grievous, but that which lieth under it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:165855:23"/>
And here I may not unfitly add one thing concerning the way of
managing affairs in <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo much in uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Votes;</hi> the
neceſſity whereof in ſome caſes, and the multitude of tranſactions,
may have been an occaſion to draw into more common uſe then is
either fit or ſafe. My ground of excepting againſt it is this. The
actions of the people (and ſo of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who are the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
body of the people) ſhould be very clear and evident to the
eye of <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> ſo as to bear down all oppoſition or gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The <hi>people</hi> ſhould deſire the removal of nothing but what is
evidently burthenſom, the addition of no <hi>Law</hi> but what is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, the puniſhment of none but him who hath evidently been
an <hi>offender.</hi> But the putting things to Vote is an argument againſt
this clearneſs and evidence, and doth ſeem to whiſper, if not to
ſpeak out, that things are doubtful, and that the determination is alſo
doubtful, ariſing not neceſſarily from the ſtrength of reaſon, but
perhaps from the number of voyces. I confeſs it is impoſſible for
ſuch a body to manage many affairs without this courſe: but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive that ever <hi>Nature</hi> cut out ſuch a <hi>body</hi> for the managing
of many affairs. It is a body of the common people, who are not
ſuppoſed to be skilful in adminiſtring <hi>Government,</hi> nor intended to
meddle in managing of <hi>affairs,</hi> but only to ſet them in a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and in a fair way of <hi>administration.</hi> A few, eaſie, neceſſary
things, ſuch as <hi>common ſenſe, reaſon</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> inſtructeth the
<hi>common ſort</hi> of men in, are the fitteſt things for them to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto. Indeed the people ſhould have no more hand in or
rather about <hi>Government,</hi> then neceſſity requires for their own
preſervation, ſafety and welfare; and diſpatch quickly what they
have to do (as a few plain things may quickly be done) and ſo return
into <hi>ſubjection</hi> unto <hi>Government</hi> again, whereby alone they will
be able to know whether they have done well or ill in what they
have done. Again, as it is a Body of the <hi>common people,</hi> ſo it is of a
<hi>great bulk</hi> (it cannot be otherwiſe formed,) and therefore not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for many motions, but only for ſuch as are flow and ſure. Yet
their ſlowneſs of motion (the right order of <hi>nature</hi> being obſerved)
will be neither burdenſom to themſelves nor others, being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
by the fewneſs of thoſe things which <hi>Nature</hi> (I mean the
nature of their end, call and truſt) hath appointed for them
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:165855:23"/>
4. <hi>A regular way of Elections:</hi> that the people might be put
into a fair, clear, underſtanding way of managing this: that they
might not be urged from favour to the preſent <hi>adminiſtring power</hi>
to make their choyce according to their deſires, but might be left
free therein, and might be incited to warineſs by being inſtructed
of what concernment their choyce is: that if they chuſe amiſs they
contribute towards the laying a foundation of enſlaving themſelves
and the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> The people have a ſenſe of their own
<hi>good,</hi> as well as a deſire to pleaſe their <hi>Superiors,</hi> and if that ſenſe
were by ſuitable means quickened in them at the time or ſeaſon
when they chuſe, they would be ſo much the more careful to make
choyce of ſuch as were fitteſt to repreſent that ſenſe. In ſuch a
great and extraordinary <hi>Remedy</hi> there ſhould be extraordinary care
about every ſtep and degree of the framing and conſtituting of it,
that we may be ſure (as ſure as poſſibly we can) to have it right and
fit for its appointed end and uſe: for one error here is as it were a
<hi>womb</hi> of danger and miſery, which hereby it is in a way to bring
forth. Now that the people might put themſelves, or rather be put
(for they can hardly do any thing themſelves orderly) into ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
as they might chuſe moſt advantagiouſly to their own good;
and that thoſe whom they chuſe might the better underſtand the
<hi>end, work,</hi> &amp;c. for which they are choſen, and the better apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thereto; that both theſe might be more commodiouſly done,
I ſhall propound theſe three things. (And here I deſire free ſcope
in the ballance of every ones Judgment, for I propoſe not theſe
things from any conceit of them, but meerly from the ſtrength of
that <hi>reaſon</hi> which repreſenteth it ſelf to me in them, having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
they ſhould take place, ſo much as in any ones mind, any further
then the <hi>reaſon</hi> in them makes way there for them, and it will be
my delight and joy to ſee them give place to any thing which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or more ſolid.)</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Counties, Cities</hi> or <hi>Boroughs</hi> meet together (as
they were wont to do to chuſe their <hi>Knights, Citizens</hi> or <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes</hi>)
to chuſe a convenient number of their Commonalty as a
<hi>Committee</hi> to chuſe their <hi>Knights, Citizens</hi> or <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> for them
for that one time.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak now in general concerning a convenient way of chuſing,
but if I were to ſpeak concerning a ſudden new choyce, I ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:165855:24"/>
add this. That none ſhould be admitted either to be choſen or to
vote in this choyce, but ſuch as have been <hi>faithful</hi> to their <hi>Country</hi>
in the late great <hi>defection:</hi> for which end, that <hi>exceptions</hi> ſhould be
drawn up, and great <hi>penalties</hi> annexed to them, to be inflicted on
ſuch as ſhould venture to give their vote, who are excepted from
chuſing; or ſuch as ſhall accept of the choyce, who are excepted
from being choſen. (Only theſe <hi>exceptions</hi> ſhould be ſo plain,
as there may be no cauſe of doubt or ſcruple concerning the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of any of them, leſt they prove a <hi>ſnare</hi> to any to deprive
them of the exerciſe of their juſt Right and Liberty herein.) It is
undeniably juſt and rational, that the people having fought for their
<hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and purchaſed them with the expence of their
<hi>blood,</hi> ſhould now enjoy them, and not permit ſuch a participation
of thoſe among them, who endeavored and fought againſt them,
as may cauſe a new hazard of the return of that into their hands,
which hath been thus difficultly and coſtlily recovered from
them.</p>
            <p>2. That this <hi>Committee</hi> immediately upon their being choſen
(before or at their firſt ſitting) may have an <hi>Oath</hi> adminiſtred
unto them, to this intent. That without <hi>partiality,</hi> regard to
<hi>friendſhip,</hi> or any other <hi>by-respect,</hi> they ſhall chuſe (either from
among themſelves or elſewhere) him whom they ſhall judg
moſt fit, both for ability and fidelity, to ſerve his <hi>Country</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and that <hi>County, City,</hi> or <hi>Borough</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>3. That this <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittee,</hi> immediately after they have finiſhed their
choyce, conſult about and draw up (and that an <hi>Oath</hi> be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
for this end likewiſe, or a clauſe for it inſerted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Oath</hi>) a Copy of what, according to their Conſciences, they
conceive them to be entruſted with by the people; with what
kind of <hi>power,</hi> in what <hi>ſphere,</hi> and to what <hi>end;</hi> which might be
before them as a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> unto them, though not abſolute,
yet it might be very helpful: Whereas otherwiſe (without ſome
ſuch help) perſons called to that employment may be ignorant
what their work is, and from this ignorance (and their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
together) may joyn with others in the way they find them
in (if a <hi>Parliament</hi> be ſitting) or in the way ſome, who are moſt
looked upon, may propoſe; in the mean while they themſelves
not underſtanding where they are, to what direct <hi>end,</hi> or upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:165855:24"/>
what <hi>ground</hi> they act. And I muſt confeſs this hath ever made me
unwilling to venture upon that <hi>employment,</hi> not having clear and
certain <hi>instruction</hi> how or what to act therein: and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my ſelf ſomewhat unſatisfied to undertake a <hi>Truſt,</hi> the nature
whereof is not clearly manifeſted unto me. I am content to ſerve
my <hi>Country</hi> with all my poor ſtrength, but withall cannot but
be ſhy of ſuch a ſnare of doing them diſſervice in ſtead of
ſervice, as my own remedileſs ignorance herein may neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
expoſe me to. And perhaps there may be ſome others
who may ſtand in need of this help as well as I: however,
a clear and plain way of knowledg, methinks, ſhould be burdenſom
to none.</p>
            <p>Such kind of things as theſe are proper tranſactions for a
<hi>Parliament,</hi> for there may be errors or defects in this kind
which the people cannot come together to conſult about and heal,
yet it is requiſite ſuch things, in this kind amiſs, ſhould be healed,
who therefore fitter to do it then their <hi>Repreſentatives?</hi> And
what might not be done in this nature, and entertained thankfully
by the people, if it were ſo managed, upon ſuch plain <hi>grounds</hi> of
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>plain clear way,</hi> as
might carry <hi>conviction,</hi> that it was not done from any <hi>ſelfiſh reſpects,</hi>
but for <hi>common good.</hi> It is a jealouſie in the people, that their <hi>Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
neglect them, and mind themſelves, which makes them inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
their actions ſo ill, which jealouſie by this means would eaſily
be rooted out of the people, nay it would fall of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the things which to me ſeem neceſſary to ſet us right.
And if it were once thus, that <hi>Powers</hi> were rightly diſtinguiſhed
according to their own <hi>natures,</hi> rightly bounded within their own
<hi>ſpheres, ranks, orders and places;</hi> if there were alſo a <hi>Parliament</hi>
in every reſpect fairly choſen, ſet right in its <hi>conſtitution,</hi> and rightly
acting according to its own <hi>nature, end</hi> and <hi>work</hi> within its own
<hi>bounds,</hi> there might be ſome ground of <hi>hope</hi> both towards the well
ſetling of things at preſent, and the eaſie further amending of what
ſhould be found amiſs afterwards. But I dare confidently affirm
it, that until the <hi>true way, courſe</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of Nature be diſcovered
and obſerved, let there be never ſo many other advantages; a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
never ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> never ſo <hi>induſtrious,</hi> never ſo <hi>faithful;</hi> a
<hi>People</hi> never ſo <hi>pliable</hi> and <hi>thankeful,</hi> never ſo <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:165855:25"/>
both in ſubmitting unto the pains of their cure, and in continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of their expectations when it will once be; yet the deſired
end will never be effected by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor enjoyed by
the <hi>People.</hi> If a <hi>Parliament</hi> will produce ſuch or ſuch effects,
it muſt become ſuch or ſuch a cauſe as is proper to produce thoſe
effects, (and operate like that cauſe) otherwiſe it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more I deſire to mention, of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
(with the ſame freedom which I have uſed hitherto)
which hath been acted publiquely in the ſight of the world, and
will one day be examined more publiquely. That which is well
done will endure a review; and that which is ill done doth deſerve
a review, that it might be amended: yea that which is of very great
conſequence may in equity require a review.</p>
            <p>The thing is this, that there might be a Reviſal of this preſent
<hi>Government</hi> (whether by this preſent Parliament, or an enſuing,
or by both, I determine not) wherein it might be taken into full
conſideration (more full perhaps then that preſent <hi>exigence</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
when it was firſt pitched upon, would permit;) Firſt, the
<hi>neceſſity</hi> of a change; and ſecondly, the <hi>commodiouſneſs</hi> of this
change, or certainty of <hi>advantage</hi> by this change: for changes are
never good but when they are neceſſary, and when the change is
certainly, or at leaſt very probably, for the better. Now as there
is at ſome times <hi>need</hi> of a <hi>change,</hi> ſo there is at other times an <hi>itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humour</hi> in man after change, when there is no need: yet a man
who hath a mind to change, will take it for granted that there is
a need of change, and run greedily into it though he ſuffer loſs
thereby, changing for that which is ten times worſe, even in
that very reſpect, becauſe of which he changeth, only his eye
being blinded by his preſent deſire and intereſt, he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it.</p>
            <p>There ought to be much <hi>circumſpection</hi> in all weighty changes:
This, being the moſt weighty and of moſt concernment to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
deſerves the greater warineſs and the more thorow ſcanning.
It doth not become <hi>wiſe men</hi> to take a prejudice againſt a thing
becauſe they have ſmarted by it, or to conceive well of another
thing becauſe it is <hi>different</hi> from that, or becauſe it appeareth <hi>plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
at firſt view, or becauſe they have not yet had experience of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165855:25"/>
the <hi>incommodiouſneſs, evil</hi> or <hi>danger</hi> of it; but narrowly to pierce
into the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of things, and from a clear ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to bottom their change.</p>
            <p>In changing either <hi>Governments</hi> or <hi>Governors,</hi> it is very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to man to be unjuſt. Man ordinarily doth that unjuſtly which
is juſt to be done. Becauſe of his ſenſe of ſmart, he is become an
<hi>enemy</hi> (and ſo far an unfit Judg) to that and them which he ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by; and can very hardly afford them a fair hearing of what
they can ſay for themſelves. Yet this is the due of every thing
which is layd aſide. And for my part, though I ſhall not plead for
the reſettlement of <hi>Kingly Government</hi> (for I am not ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in my affections to it, as it yet hath been) yet I would have
a fair and friendly ſhaking hands with it, and not any blame layd
upon it beyond its deſert: For doubtleſs it is both <hi>proper, good</hi>
and <hi>uſeful</hi> in its kinde, and hath its <hi>advantages</hi> above any other
<hi>Government</hi> on the one hand, as it hath alſo its <hi>diſadvantages</hi> on
the other hand.</p>
            <p>Now ſince I have waded thus far herein, I will proceed a little
further, propounding what way I ſhould judg moſt convenient for
my ſelf to take, if I were to have an hand in this particular, ſo as I
might diſcharge it with moſt <hi>Juſtice</hi> in reference to the thing it
ſelf, and with moſt <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in reference to my own ſpirit.
(Every man muſt be maſter of what he doth in his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or he cannot act juſtly; and his heart is poor and
weak, if it can be ſatisfied in managing things beyond his
ſtrength.)</p>
            <p>In the firſt place (ſuppoſing I had Power) I would require ſuch
<hi>learned Lawyers,</hi> as I ſhould judg moſt fit, to give me a plain and
full deſcription of <hi>Kingly Government;</hi> of the <hi>Duty, Power, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives</hi>
of it, with all the <hi>ſeveral bounds</hi> of it, according to
the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I would conſider, whether any of theſe were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;</hi>
and particularly ſince the <hi>Prerogative part</hi> was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching,
what <hi>bonds</hi> might be layd upon it for the future, and
how far they might be able to binde it faſt from intrenching upon
the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would conſider, what <hi>ſecurity</hi> or <hi>certainty</hi> might
be had of a ſetled courſe of <hi>Parliaments</hi> in fitting ſeaſons and with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:165855:26"/>
ſufficient Power for remedying any grievances which might ariſe
to the People from this <hi>Government,</hi> or from any <hi>Governors</hi>
which might be employed in it: for in every <hi>Government</hi> there
are (beſides the Supreme) <hi>Sub-governors,</hi> who are uſually the
greateſt Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Having done this, fully and fairly, to the ſatisfaction (not of
my <hi>will</hi> or <hi>deſire,</hi> but) of my <hi>underſtanding unbyaſſed;</hi> I would
as fairly propound, to my view, the other <hi>Government,</hi> which
might ſeem fit to ſucceed in the ſtead of this. I would take a full
draught of it; the <hi>Duty, Power, Prerogatives</hi> (for ſuch it ought
to have; its work being hard, in equity it ſhould have priviledges
to ſweeten it) and <hi>ſeveral limits</hi> of it. I would conſider again
and again, how it could be bound faſter then the other: How
the <hi>Convention</hi> and <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> in ſeaſon, with full
<hi>Power and Freedom,</hi> might be more certain under this. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
full and thorow conſideration of every thing needful to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
if it did indeed appear that <hi>Errors</hi> in the former kinde of
<hi>Government</hi> could not ſafely or eaſily be amended, nor the <hi>dangers</hi>
thereof well prevented, but might with much more ſafety and
eaſe be both amended and prevented in the latter; then would I
aboliſh the former, and ſettle the latter.</p>
            <p>This, in my apprehenſion, would be a fair and juſt way, and
would not expoſe me to drink in <hi>prejudices</hi> (which become not a
<hi>Judg</hi>) againſt the <hi>Government</hi> which is to be called into queſtion;
or to lay that as a particular <hi>Objection</hi> to it, which other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are as liable unto. <hi>Neglecting of Duty, grasping of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Power, enlarging of Priviledges and Prerogatives, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
upon them that are low, that are as it were the earth under
them, riding in pomp upon the backs of the People, &amp;c.</hi> theſe are
common to every <hi>Government,</hi> and will be growing up under
every <hi>Government</hi> further then they are powerfully ſuppreſſed. As
for that great Objection of the enmity of <hi>Kingly Government</hi> to
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> any other Government may be as liable to it. No
ordinary ſupreme Power loveth an extraordinary ſupreme Power;
and what Power ſoever be ſet up, it will go neer (if much care be
not uſed to prevent it) to have an influence upon the choyce of
<hi>Parliament</hi> men, and will be molding the <hi>Parliament</hi> to it ſelf,
which if it cannot do, it will hardly look upon it as its friend. I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:165855:26"/>
muſt confeſs the changing of the form of <hi>Government</hi> is not ſo
conſiderable in my eye, but the fixing of ſo ſtrong and ſafe bounds
and limits, as a good Governor or Governors may delight to keep
within, and a bad or bad ones may not be able to break through:
which may be much helped by the frequent uſe of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> if
they can be kept within their bounds, or elſe that will be worſt
of all according to that known Maxim, <hi>Corruptio optimi peſſima,</hi>
the beſt thing being corrupted proveth worſt.</p>
            <p>When this is done (for I do not look upon it as yet done, till all
reviews, which in reaſon and equity can be deſired, are firſt over)
and <hi>the ſupreme Governor</hi> or <hi>Governors</hi> fully agreed upon: then it
will be ſeaſonable, juſt and requiſite to reſtore to them thoſe <hi>Rights</hi>
and <hi>Priviledges</hi> which belong unto them, and which it is the
minde of the People they ſhould have: as particularly his or their
<hi>conſent</hi> in making <hi>Laws.</hi> It is great reaſon the People ſhould make
their own Laws; and it is as agreeable to Reaſon, that he who is
to govern by them ſhould conſent unto them. As the People (ſo far
as they underſtand themſelves) cannot but be unwilling to be made
ſlaves by their <hi>Governor,</hi> to be governed by ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as he
ſhould make at his pleaſure: ſo neither ſhould they deſire to make
him a ſlave, by putting what <hi>Laws</hi> they pleaſe into his hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
him to take care of the obſervation of them: but a mutual
agreement &amp; tranſaction in things of this nature is faireſt and moſt
juſt. Yea this would be moſt advantagious to the people, for he
who conſtantly weilds the <hi>Scepter</hi> is in likelyhood beſt able to give
advice concerning <hi>Laws,</hi> and may put them into a better way (by
vertue of his <hi>experience</hi>) of attaining their <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>deſires</hi> then
they of themſelves can light upon. If <hi>the chief Governor</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi>
ſhall refuſe to aſſent to ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as are evidently good
and neceſſary, a better remedy may be found out then the depriving
of him from this Liberty. The true way of curing is difficult, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
much <hi>skill, care</hi> and <hi>pains;</hi> the common way of man is by
running out of one <hi>extream</hi> into another, which he is apt to
pleaſe himſelf much in, becauſe he obſerveth himſelf at ſuch a
diſtance from that which he found ſo inconvenient and perhaps ſo
miſchievous before. But this is neither juſt in it ſelf, nor can prove
either eaſie or ſafe in the iſſue.</p>
            <p>To draw to a <hi>concluſion;</hi> I ſhall onely mention ſome few <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:165855:27"/>
of a <hi>good Governor,</hi> to which the people ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in their choyce, and to which he who is choſen by the
People to that degree and honor, ſhould have reſpect in his
acting.</p>
            <p>There are two <hi>properties</hi> or <hi>proper ways of motion</hi> (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in them ſeveral properties) of a good <hi>Governor,</hi> which, if he
will be furniſhed unto, will make him very uſeful and ſerviceable
in his place.</p>
            <p>1. To manage his <hi>Truſt</hi> with all <hi>care</hi> and <hi>fidelity.</hi> To neglect
himſelf, his own particular <hi>eaſe, pleaſure, advantage;</hi> and apply
himſelf to the <hi>good</hi> of the whole. To miniſter <hi>Juſtice</hi> equally,
fairly, freely, ſpeedily; and <hi>mercy</hi> tenderly. To puniſh meerly for
neceſſity ſake, but to relieve from his heart.</p>
            <p>2. To ſettle the <hi>Foundations</hi> (ſo far as lies in his way and within
his reach) of the <hi>Peoples Liberty, Peace</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> that it
may be in a thriving condition growing ſtill more and more: For
the welfare of the People doth not ſo much conſiſt in a quiet,
proſperous, ſetled ſtate at preſent, as in a good ſeed for future
growth, whereby alone the Government can come to yeeld the
good fruit of a preſent good ſetling. It may coſt much at preſent
to manure the ground and plant a good Government, the benefit
is to be reaped afterwards, which will lie much in the <hi>Governor,</hi>
who may help much to cheriſh or blaſt it.</p>
            <p>The main thing in a <hi>Governor</hi> (which will much fit him unto
both theſe) is to keep within his bounds: Not to think or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to do all the good which is needful to be done, but that good
which belongs to his place and office: Not to avoyd bonds, but
to deſire to be bound as faſt as may be. He who is indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to <hi>tranſgreſs, to do evil;</hi> is willing to be tyed up, as faſt
and cloſe as can be, from all <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Good honeſt plain-dealing-hearts are too apt to deſire
ſcope, thinking onely to improve it for good; and others are too
apt to truſt them, little ſuſpecting that they will do otherwiſe, till
at length on a ſudden ſo evident ſnares and temptations overtake
them, as give too plain a proof of the contrary. This <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
is ſo deep, that it may well be queſtioned, <hi>Whether it
were better to have a bad Governor being fast bound, or a
good Governor being at liberty;</hi> which would be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:165855:27"/>
to reſolve, becauſe on the one hand it is ſo hard to finde
bonds to binde a bad Governor faſt enough, and ſo difficult
on the other hand for a good Governor being left at liberty,
to act well. He who hath had experience what he is, when he
is left <hi>at liberty,</hi> and what others are when they are left <hi>at
liberty</hi> (how eaſily his or their <hi>Judgment, Will</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are perverted) will neither deſire to be left at liberty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor to have others left at liberty. A good <hi>Governor</hi>
might do great ſervice in this reſpect, namely both by a ready
compliance with his bonds (for the good and neceſſary uſe
of them) which is very rare; as alſo by ſeeking further
bonds, where he can diſcover ſtarting holes, which is yet more
rare.</p>
            <p>Man naturally ſeeketh <hi>liberty from bonds,</hi> deſireth to avoyd
them: He would binde others, but be without bonds himſelf:
Others need bonds, but he can act well without them, yea he
can do more good without them then with them: They may be a
fit <hi>curb</hi> for others, but they will be but a <hi>clog</hi> to him in the purſuit
of the peoples happineſs, whereby he ſhall be hindered from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that good ſervice which he would and otherwiſe might: Thus
the beſt men, many times, come to do moſt hurt, leaſt ſuſpecting
themſelves, and being leaſt miſtruſted by others. (Who would
not beleeve his own heart, that if he were in place and Power he
would not do thus or thus, but amend this and that and the other
thing; and the more ſcope he had, the better and more ſwiftly
would he do it?) But to ſeek <hi>bonds,</hi> to deſire to be hedged up
from every thing that is <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>unfit;</hi> to ſeek where one
might evade and prepare before-hand <hi>ſtrength</hi> to reſiſt it, <hi>engines</hi>
to oppoſe and keep it back, this is as unuſual an undertaking in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi>
as needful and profitable for the people.</p>
            <p>There would one great <hi>advantage</hi> from this arrive unto
<hi>Posterity,</hi> beſides that which the People themſelves might
enjoy under it at preſent: for it would make the fruit of a
good <hi>GOVERNORS</hi> Government extend it ſelf to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Generations,</hi> in this reſpect, becauſe by this means
there would be bonds prepared to tie up ſuch as ſhould
afterwards ſucceed, who might be more inclinable to break
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:165855:28"/>
forth into unjuſt and by-ways, then a preſent Governor or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.
There are none who have ſuch advantage to eſpy ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-holes,
as thoſe who are penned up: and if they be careful in
eſpying and faithful in ſtopping up thoſe holes (by putting the
<hi>Parliament</hi> upon ſetting ſuch fences of Laws ſo made about them,
as may beſt ſecure the People in this reſpect) the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi>
will ſoon prove both regular and ſafe, as alſo in a thriving conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in ſo much as that the <hi>Liberty, Safety,</hi> and <hi>ſound Prosperity</hi>
of the People will grow more and more upon them.</p>
