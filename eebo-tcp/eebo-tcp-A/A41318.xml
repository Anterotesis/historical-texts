            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CASE
OF
<hi>Mr.</hi> JONAS PROAST,
Late CHAPLAIN of <hi>All-Souls</hi> College in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp;c.</head>

               <p>MR. <hi>Proaſt,</hi> late Chaplain of <hi>All-Souls College,</hi> thinks
himſelf unjuſtly treated, in being removed from
the ſaid College, for theſe ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſays that a Warden of <hi>All-Souls</hi> cannot by
his own Authority, even for a juſt Cauſe, diſplace a
Chaplain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He urges, that if a Chaplain was remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Warden alone for a juſt Cauſe, yet here in
this Caſe, there was no good ground for his removal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, He inſiſts, that if a ſtatutable War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
could remove a Chaplain, yet Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> could not
challenge any right of expulſion, being no Statutable
Warden.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="rebuttal">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108324:3"/>
               <head>To each of which Propoſitions, be pleaſed to conſider theſe
following Anſwers.</head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s firſt Propoſition. That ſuppoſing Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> to
be a Statutable Warden, yet he could not of his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
expel him, becauſe a Chaplain falls under the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as a Fellow of the College; and ſince a Fellow
cannot be expelled by the Warden, without the Officers,
therefore neither can a Chaplain.</p>
               <p>In giving ſatisfaction to this Argument, I ſhall, firſt, by
way of Introduction, ſhew what ſort of Officer a Chaplain of
<hi>All-Souls</hi> is; and then, ſecondly, endeavour to prove, that he
is amoveable <hi>at the pleaſure of the Warden alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, A Chaplain in <hi>All-Souls College</hi> hath a <hi>Miniſterial,</hi>
and <hi>Precarious</hi> Office; he is provided by the Head, for the
Service of the College; he is brought in by him alone, and is
removeable by the ſame Authority. From his attendance
on the Chappel he is often called <hi>Miniſter Capellae;</hi> from the
Incertainty of his Intereſt, he is as frequently named <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductitius.</hi>
And in any College, whenever the Founder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to veſt a laſting Eſtate in a Chaplain, he conſtituted
him a Chaplain-Fellow, and by that Addition, gave him an
higher and more durable Intereſt. This uſual and ordinary
diſtinction would be altogether unneceſſary, if, without that
extraordinary Proviſion, a Chaplain, <hi>de Communi jure</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
to the Rights of a Fellow; This is the Notion of a
Chaplain in general, and in <hi>All-Souls College</hi> in particular:
There is no one Statute that hath any relation either to the
Election or Government of a Chaplain, they being no where
ſo much as mentioned, but in thoſe paſſages where it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to aſſign them their Commons, and their Places in the
Chappel, and Hall; And it is obſervable, that above their
bare Commons, they ſtand meerly upon the Courteſie of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108324:3"/>
Accountants at the end of the year, for any further Gratuity.
They take no Oath as Fellows do. They are Inrolled in
no Regiſter as Fellows are. They are not ſubject to the
ſame Penalties inflicted by the ſame Officers, and (which is
a plain Argument of their dependance on the Warden) they
have their Degrees given them in the Houſe, not as Fellows,
by the Warden's conſent and Fellows, but by the Warden
only; in a word, they are in all things, but that of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon the ſame bottom as Clerks, and Choriſters, who,
ever ſince the Foundation of the College, have been turned
out, as well as put in, by the ſole Authority of the Warden;
all of them have had no other Admiſſion, than that of the
Warden's putting their Names into the Buttery Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Fellows are admitted by the Warden, in the preſence,
and by the conſent of all the Society, and by ſuch Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
entitled to a laſting Title to their Fellowſhips.</p>
               <p>How precarious an Office a Chaplain is I ſhall not judge,
but ſhall repeat in the words of the Learned Judges of the
<hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s Cauſe was before them.</p>
               <p>They ſolemnly declared, That a Chaplain had ſo good
and durable an intereſt in his Place, as a Cook, and Butler;
and that he could not pretend to the ſame rights as a Fellow.
Of this we have frequent Inſtances in the Univerſity; and
One more particularly remarkable in <hi>New College,</hi> of which
our Founder was formerly a Member; and from whoſe Statutes
ours are chiefly compoſed; when Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> by his own
Authority, expelled Nine Chaplains with one daſh of his Pen;
One of them upon ſubmiſſion was reſtored, but the others
appeal'd to the Viſitor, who, with a Reprimand, ſent them
home, owning that he had no Cognizance of the matter,
the Power lying in the Warden, and they never were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
All which being premiſed, I am to ſhew,</p>
               <p>That a Chaplain of <hi>All-Souls</hi> is amoveable at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Warden alone.</p>
               <p>In order to make this out, I ſhall ſuppoſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108324:4"/>
and take it for granted, that the Chaplains for juſt cauſes are
deprivable, ſince the Fellows, the principal Members, and the
Warden, the Head of it, are ſo, as the Statutes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
evidently evince. For it were abſurd and unreaſonable,
that the inferiour Members ſhould have a more firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Intereſt, Eſtate, or Tenure in the Foundation, than the
principal part, the Head of it; which being granted, I proceed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who in Societies have the ſole Power of putting in
Members, have always Power likewiſe to turn them out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the local Statutes do otherwiſe direct, and limit that
Authority. Now the Wardens of <hi>All-Souls</hi> College have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
alone nominated and placed Chaplains in the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
neither do the Statutes appoint any other in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, who can either appoint or diſplace the ſaid Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</p>
               <p>That the Warden alone puts them in, will not, it is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
be denied by the Complainant himſelf; for if it is, he never
was Chaplain, and conſequently not injured by his Removal,
ſince he was put in by Dr. <hi>Jeames,</hi> without the concurrence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Officers or the majority of Fellows. Never ſince
the Foundation of the College did either of theſe lay claim
to the placing or diſplacing a Chaplain, as is moſt notoriouſly
known beyond the poſſibility of a Denyal. So that it remains
to be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>That in Societies thoſe that have a power of putting in
the Members, have likewiſe a power to put them out; and
that the Statutes of <hi>All-Souls,</hi> in relation to the Chaplains do
not otherwiſe ordain and appoint, and thence it will follow that
the Chaplains being put in by the Wardens, and the Statutes not
appointing any other perſon to turn them out, are to be deprived
upon juſt occaſion, by the Warden; according to the known Rule
of the Canon Law. <hi>Cujus eſt Conſtituere ejus eſt Deſtituere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give inſtances in other Societies of the Univerſal truth
of this general Propoſition, is a Task proper for the Pen of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108324:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Civilian.</hi> It will be ſufficient for my purpoſe, to ſhew how
it would follow in the Fellows themſelves, that they being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by the Warden and majority of the Fellows, were by
them to be deprived, if there were not a particular Statute
that gives ſuch power only to the Warden and Officers.</p>
               <p>It is plain in the next place, that the Statutes of <hi>All-Souls</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
do not at all direct how, or by whom, the Chaplains are to
be expelled. There is not a ſingle word about it in the whole
body of them; ſo that it ſeems plain that the Chaplains muſt
be put out by the Warden alone, who alone puts them in,
or elſe (which is abſurd) that they are not at all liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.
But come now to his <hi>2d.</hi> Objection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr.<hi> Proaſt </hi>ſays, the Warden is bound by the Statute<hi> de
Totali numero Sociorum, &amp;c. Socios Scholares, Sacerdotes ac Miniſtros

               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, That the Statute <hi>Propter quas Cauſas,</hi> &amp;c.
the only Statute that treats of the Expulſion of any under
a Warden, gives no power to the Warden to expel any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> I anſwer, That the Statute <hi>Propter quas Cauſas</hi> ſpeaks
only of the expelling of Scholars (<hi>i. e.</hi> Probationers) and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
who are in that manner deprivable; not of Chaplains,
or any other inferiour Foundation Men, as Clerks, Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> That the other two Statutes are to be interpreted
<hi>referenda Singula Singulis, i. e.</hi> Thoſe under the Warden, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom there are any Statutes, are to be governed,
corrected, and puniſhed according to thoſe Statutes. Thoſe
other, concerning whom there are no Statutes made, either by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108324:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Founder, or the ſucceeding Arch Bps. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (and there
are none about the expulſion of Chaplains) are left to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
corrected, and puniſhed by the Warden, <hi>de jure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni
ad ipſius arbitrium &amp; juxta bonam conſcientiam;</hi> and ſo
has it been and no otherwiſe ſince the Foundation of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</p>
               <p>The Clerks and Choriſtors of the College, whoſe tenure
is exactly the ſame with the Chaplains, as they have ever
been put in ſolely by the Warden ſo likewiſe have they been
expelled. Inſtances of which done in the time of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
remain freſh in the memory of many in the College.</p>
               <p>All thoſe Statutes that are objected againſt the Wardens
Authority do here directly confirm it. For wherever the <hi>ſole
Power</hi> of Government is lodged, there the right of <hi>Expulſion</hi>
is conſequently veſted; and tho' that power may be ſubject
to reſtrictions, yet upon the failure of any ſubſequent limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is left at large, and is to be taken in its full extent and
latitude. Now the Government of Fellows, and of Chaplains,
is equally placed in the Warden, and by conſequence the power
of diſplacing both is in the ſame hands. The only difference
is, that ſucceeding Statutes qualifie this Authority in one,
and do not reſtrain it in the other, and therefore the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
coercive power is limited in reſpect of the Fellows, but
remains entire and unreſtrained over Chaplains.</p>
               <p>But after all, if it were requiſite (as I hope it appears o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe)
that the Concurrence of the Fellows ſhould be had
to the expelling a Chaplain, yet it will appear, that I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that too, at leaſt ex <hi>poſt facto,</hi> as may appear by an Act of
the whole Society, Dated the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>Dec.</hi> 88. which at leaſt
imlpys the ratifying and Confirming my Act of expelling Mr.
<hi>Proaſt</hi> in a moſt Solemn and publick Manner.</p>
               <p>Now by what hath been ſaid it is hoped that it appears
that the Warden has the Sole power of diſplacing a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
it is preſumed that he is not <hi>Accountable to any</hi> for it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108324:5"/>
ſince by it he is not Guilty of the leaſt Breach of any
part of the Statutes. But ſince there are ſo many who have
taken upon them to Cenſure this Action, I am contented to
have the Merits of the Cauſe truly expoſed, and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haſten to anſwer his Second general Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> He urges, that if a Chaplain was removeable by the
Warden alone for a juſt Cauſe, yet here in this Caſe there
was no good Ground for his Removal.</p>
               <p>It will be juſtly granted, that there are many faults in
Members of a Society deſerve Expulſion, which yet it freed
diſengaged Perſons are hardly lyable to Cenſure. Firſt, of
thoſe Cauſes there are none that merit a more ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than thoſe which tend to the Diſturbance, or to the
Diſgrace of the College. All Founders were careful as for
the Peace, ſo for the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the Society, and ſufficiently
knew that a College would ſo long continue in eſteem, as
the Members of it were Advanced and Promoted. Hence it
is, that in all Colleges the Members are under a Common
tye of not diſgracing each other, and the neglect of this
Rule in <hi>Apleford</hi>'s <hi>Caſe</hi> was thought a ſufficient Ground for
the Expulſion even of a Fellow: How far Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi> hath
upon other Grounds deſerved his Puniſhment is reſerved for
<hi>another Opportunity;</hi> at preſent it will be ſufficient to ſhew,
that by his own Confeſſion, the diſgrace that he put on his
College, and upon the firſt Member of it, was ſufficient ground
for his Removal.</p>
               <p>The Matter of that was in ſhort this: About the middle
of <hi>March.</hi> 88. Dr. <hi>Lamphire</hi> the Hiſtory Profeſſor lying ill,
there were ſeveral of the Gentlemen of the Univerſity, who
thinking Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> a proper Perſon to ſucceed him, went
about to Colleges to form an Intereſt in his behalf. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that long before the Dr. dyed, Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> was lookt
upon as ſecure of the place.</p>
               <p>The Indecency of making ſo Publick a Canvaſs for a place
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108324:6"/>
not yet Void, made ſeveral Gentlemen think it a juſt Cauſe
to oppoſe what had been ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonably</hi> carried on. And
many of Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s and my Betters <hi>in all Reſpects,</hi> lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as a Reflection upon <hi>Oxford,</hi> that a Gentleman of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> ſhould come among us, and take away, by
much, the beſt Preferment in our Diſpoſal. It was therefore
propoſed by them, that ſome body ſhould be put up in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Mr. <hi>Dodwell;</hi> and to be ſhort, they pitcht upon me.
I entertain not a thought ſo vain as to deſire the World ſhould
think I was ſet up upon the account of any <hi>Great Abilities</hi>
I pretend to; but the true reaſon doubtleſs was, that they
imagined I might have intereſt enough in the Univerſity to
make ſome oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s <hi>Election;</hi> as thro' the
favour of my Friends it did appear, ſince in near 300 Votes
(with all imaginable foul play) there were but 6 different
between us.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo fooliſhly vain as to pretend to vye with Mr.
<hi>Dodwell,</hi> in any part of Learning, but I hope on the other
hand, that for endeavouring to put by a Stranger, I may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
excuſed without Cenſure, ſince in the Judgment of ſo
many and ſo great men (whoſe Character I preſume Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
will not eaſily approach to) I was judged fit to oppoſe him
in his Pretenſions.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, when Dr. <hi>Lamphire</hi> was actually dead, I appeared,
and acquainted our Society with it, deſiring the favour of their
Aſſiſtance, I particularly ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Proaſt,</hi> who denyed me,
However I thought I might reaſonably repreſent to him the
indecency as well as the unkindneſs that would appear in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of our own College that ſhould oppoſe himſelf againſt
the Head of it, eſpecially a Chaplain who had ſo great a
dependance on him. But he was pleaſed not only to oppoſe
me in his own Perſon, but got two of the Fellows within our
own Walls to joyn with him, and became a publick Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
againſt me; and not only ſo, but carry'd his kindneſs to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108324:6"/>
his Friend, and his contempt of me a little further; he
brought great numbers of Out-liers againſt me, ſo many,
that it can be made out, that for Horſe-hire, and other
Charges in the Election, he was reimburſed the better part
of Twenty Pound. To conclude, the day of Election came,
and I loſt it by three Votes he had made againſt me in our
own College: I ſhall not inſiſt on the diſhonour of loſing
the Preferment, nor upon the value of it, though it is, or
ſhortly will be <hi>200l. per An.</hi> And conſequently a young
Man might have reapt great profit from it; and if ſo, the
loſs muſt be conſiderable.</p>
               <p>But let any indifferent Impartial Man judge, whether this
Behaviour may be call'd Provocation: He is pleas'd indeed
to ſay for himſelf, that he thought me unfit for the Place.
Had any <hi>Oxford</hi> Man beſides ſtood, it is very poſſible that
I had been of his mind: But let me be ever ſo meanly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
I preſume, without the imputation of arrogance, I might
in this Caſe have expected, if not his Vote, yet a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
reſpect; a more civil, if not a more kind behaviour;
and I ſhould reaſonably have thought he might have been
abſent, did it not appear by the whole drift of his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that he was reſolved to ſhew the utmoſt of his Skill
and Induſtry to diſappoint me.</p>
               <p>He is pleaſed to affirm, that this was no Provocation. But
I ſhall take upon me to ſhew him, that for one Member of
the Society to oppoſe the Majority, even in the caſe of a
Fellow, had formerly, in the Opinion of no leſs a Man than
one of our Viſitors, Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> been look'd upon as
a high Offence, no leſs than the violation of an Oath; and
if this be a great Fault in a Fellow, I may preſume I may
infer that it is a Provocation in a Chaplain, not indeed a
breach of an Oath, for he takes none at his Admiſſion.
The Caſe was this; Before the <hi>Cicle</hi> for the Proctors was
made; the Univerſity annually choſe Proctors out of any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108324:7"/>
College. The Fellows of <hi>All-Souls</hi> in the year 1617. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for a Gentleman of <hi>Wadham,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Duppa</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi>) diſſented from the reſt, which gave
occaſion to our then Viſitor, to write this following Letter,
and the Officers to proceed accordingly, as appears by our
<hi>Regiſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>

have of preſerving the reputation of your worthy College,
whoſe welfare your Honourable Founder has in eſpecial manner
recommended to my truſt, I have thought fit, upon ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that are come to my ears, to write this my Letter unto
you; whereby I am to adviſe you, that, <hi>as in all other Acts of
your College,</hi> ſo eſpecially in <hi>that Publick Act of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
one for the Proctorſhip,</hi> you embrace <hi>Unity and
Concord,</hi> and not make your ſelves a <hi>Scorn</hi> to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,
by any diſtractions touching that particular, whereof there is
ſome report, and noiſe abroad: And therefore, as your Viſitor,
do admoniſh you, that upon whom a major part of the Fellows
that uſually have intereſt herein, ſhall concur for this Office, <hi>no
Man do publickly diſſent from this agreement.</hi> Becauſe I
take it to be againſt this Clauſe of your Oath, at your admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

               <p>The uſe I make of this Letter is this. Every Maſter of
Art has as much a right of Voting for a <hi>Proctorſhip,</hi> as a
<hi>Profeſſorſhip</hi> in the Univerſity: A <hi>Fellow</hi> of the College was
judged by that <hi>Viſitor himſelf</hi> to have committed a great
Offence, to have violated his <hi>Oath,</hi> by diſagreeing from the
Majority, in favour of <hi>another College;</hi> he proves further,
that joyn'd with willfulneſs and contempt, it may be a fault
of a higher nature, by which we may not unreaſonably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that it would merit expulſion. Here is a Chaplain,
a Servant to the Houſe, in our Caſe, that not only gives his
own Vote againſt the reſt of the College, but he ſeconds his
Proceeding with <hi>Contempt,</hi> and <hi>Willfulneſs;</hi> inſomuch, that
he not only perſwades two of the Fellows to joyn with him,
but likewiſe prevail'd upon great numbers in other Colleges
to oppoſe his own.</p>
               <p>Now whether this deſerves Puniſhment, or Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whether it be not Willfulneſs, and Contempt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Conſcience, or Provocation, is the queſtion to be
ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ground upon which he juſtifies his Practice,
is,</p>
               <p>That every Man has a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Voting</hi> as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>If the Gentleman means, That as a Maſter of Arts he is
qualified by the <hi>Statutes of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> to diſpoſe of his
Vote in all Elections, as he ſhall think convenient, I readily
grant it. But then. by the Authority we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108324:8"/>
in the Caſe of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> it will not ſo clearly
appear, that when our College ſhall ſet up a Member of
their own, much more a Governour: One Man; though a
Fellow, has ſo far a right of Voting againſt the Majority,
as to do it with Impunity; it being in Fellows a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Clauſe of their Oath, and certainly a great Offence
in a Chaplain, when circumſtanced with that open <hi>Diſreſpect</hi>
and <hi>Contempt</hi> Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi> was pleaſed to ſhew in my Caſe.</p>
               <p>Every Counſellor or Advocate has a right of giving his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as he pleaſes; But if his advice be againſt the Intereſt of
the College, whereof he is Member, the Juſtice of the Cauſe
which he eſpouſes will not purge the perjury, nor excuſe the
contempt. The liberty or indifferency, which either Party
hath in themſelves is, by thoſe relations they have to the College,
reſtrained and determined. And as man, howſoever a free born
<hi>Engliſhman,</hi> has a right to an exerciſe only of ſuch Arts as are
conſiſtant with the by-Laws and Cuſtoms of the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof he is a Member, ſo are the publick Priviledges of
every Member of the Univerſity contracted by the capacity
of the ſame perſon, as more immediately a part of a private
Society.</p>
               <p>But then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Let him ſhew, if he can, that he has ſuch <hi>a Right
of Voting</hi> as may be called <hi>an Obligation of Voting.</hi> For unleſs
he makes that out, he cannot have much to ſay for his
Behaviour; he cannot eaſily juſtifie his rude and undecent
oppoſition to his own College, and to the Head of it more
eſpecially. It is to be feared, that in Arch Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s time
had Mr. <hi>Duppa</hi> pleaded that in his opinion the Candidate of
<hi>Wadham</hi> was not a <hi>proper Perſon</hi> for the Office, or that every
one has a <hi>Right of Voting</hi> at diſcretion, tho' againſt his own
Society; theſe Arguments would not have deferred his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
or have been lookt upon as a ſufficient excuſe.
Neither can I think, that amongſt unprejudiced Men, Mr.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108324:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s expoſing me as an unfit Man, can juſtifie his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
againſt me. And to ſhew you that it is not his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that he is bound in Conſcience to be at the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Houſe,
and diſcharge himſelf of his Vote ſome way or
other, without being tedious, I ſhall take the liberty to cite
this <hi>Famous</hi> Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> a Fellow
of <hi>All-Souls,</hi> appeared to be Burgeſs of that Univerſity in his
place. The College heartily eſpouſed his Intereſt, and finally,
the Univerſity very <hi>unanimouſly</hi> choſe him as a perſon very
well qualified for their ſervice. Mr. <hi>Proaſt,</hi> it ſeems, could not
bring himſelf to entertain good thoughts of the Gentleman (who
would be a great credit to any Society) neither could he be
wrought upon to joyn with his own houſe in his Election, but
choſe rather to Abſent himſelf. By which proceeding, be pleaſed
to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s practice ſhews that he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a Right of voteing to be an Obligation of voteing,
that if he thinks a man unfit he thinks himſelf obliged to give
voice againſt him. And beſides, you have a farther proſpect
of the Temper of the man, by his having before refuſed to joyn
with the Houſe in favour of the greateſt Ornament of it. It
appears that he does not think there lies any obligation upon
him to be concluded by the ſenſe of the Society, and has no
notion of the honour of the College, or any authority he lies
under to maintain it. But we come in the third place to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Whether he was turned out by the Warden purely
for voting againſt him, without any previous offence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I loſt the Preferment I appear'd for, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
that the <hi>ill uſage</hi> of ſome, and the <hi>unkindneſs of others,</hi>
provoked me to the leaſt degree of heat or Paſſion. I do ſolemnly
proteſt, that I had not any thought or intention of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kind of notice of Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s Behaviour, till I was ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome of the Officers, and others the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108324:9"/>
men of the College, to this effect. They complained to me
that Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi> had long been a Burthen to the Society, by
his making ſo many and ſo frequent quarrels and diviſions in
the Houſe. That in all our private Elections he conſtantly
made Parties, to the great diſhonour and diſquiet of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
That he fix'd ill Characters upon any body at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and upon account of his troubleſome and unquiet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
had frequently deſerved a removal; that I ought not
now ſo much to neglect the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>good</hi> of the Society, as
to let this injury, however in appearance private, yet in the
effects of it publick, go altogether unpuniſhed. For that
ſhould I not upon this affront diſplace him, his <hi>Inſolence,</hi> which
before was <hi>inſupportable,</hi> would encreaſe ſo far, as to put the
Fellows out of hopes of having any redreſs for the future;
for that he had formerly lookt upon himſelf as above <hi>reſtraint,</hi>
and <hi>independent of any power whatever.</hi> I was very deſirous
to reſiſt the Importunity of the Society, but thoſe whom I
conceived to underſtand beſt, and promote moſt the Intereſt
of the Houſe, inſiſting upon it, I proteſt ſolemnly, without
any inclination to revenge upon my own particular, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
him no Chaplain, giving him fourteen days to remove.</p>
               <p>This is the matter of Fact, and by it I preſume it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that I did not expel him <hi>upon my own head;</hi> that I did it
at the inſtance of the Fellows, not ſo much for Voting only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, as for his former rude <hi>behaviour to them.</hi> This, I
confeſs, that had he not ſo openly oppoſed the College in my caſe,
it is not probable that the Fellows would at that time have
made their complaint; but this I declare on the other ſide, that
had they brought this accuſation at any time againſt him,
(ſince I my ſelf have formerly been a Witneſs of the truth of
it) I ſhould have thought my ſelf obliged to do them ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>After 14 days were given, it was the expectation of moſt
People (how reaſonable a one, I am not a proper Judge) that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108324:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Gentleman would have made ſome ſort of ſubmiſſion,
by which he might have reconciled himſelf to the Society,
but inſtead of that, he took another ſort of Courſe, that of
diſturbing me with rude Letters; upon which, I publickly
declar'd, that the next I received, without opening it, I
would that moment ſhorten his ſtay, by ſtrikeing his
Name out of the Book, as upon having another Letter left
for me at my Lodgings, I ſoon afterwards did.</p>
               <p>This is the truth of the whole matter, and I am in hopes
it does not deſerve ſo <hi>ſevere a Cenſure</hi> as many have thought
fit to paſs upon it, without truly knowing the Caſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
any thing of our Statutes. But I ſhall not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that thoſe Perſons who were for having Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>
come in <hi>by any means, fair or foul,</hi> take upon them to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the <hi>inſolence</hi> of thoſe who ſupported his intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
weighing their <hi>Obligations to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were the turbulent and reſtleſs temper of the Gentleman
as well underſtood at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> as it is known <hi>in every part
of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxford, I perſwade my ſelf, that inſtead
of his having any Countenance from a Viſitor, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receive his Commendation, for removing the diſturber
of that <hi>Peace,</hi> that is ſo earneſtly recommended to his Care
by our <hi>Beneficent Founder.</hi> I would not, by any means, lay
any thing to the Gentleman's Charge, but what is <hi>litterally</hi>
true, and therefore have, in ſpeaking of him, purpoſely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all diſreſpectful Language; but being call'd upon to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
my ſelf, I muſt ſay that he is abſolutely Unfit for a
College. I am not ſingular in this Opinion. Dr. <hi>Barlow the
Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln <hi>having removed him from</hi> Queens-College
<hi>for the ſame reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As to the third Point, which is a cavil againſt Mr. <hi>Finches</hi>
Title to the Wardenſhip, it might, with ſubmiſſion, be prov'd
to be falſe, if it was not a more eaſie, and more proper task
to prove it immaterial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108324:10"/>
1. For it it was granted, that he was only Warden <hi>de facto,</hi>
and not <hi>de jure;</hi> yet ſince he was then admitted, and own'd
as ſuch by the whole College, and more eſpecially by the
Viſitor himſelf, and by Mr. <hi>Proaſt,</hi> in the ſuperſcription of
his Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and had then, if not a lawful, yet an unconteſted
Title: It muſt follow, that he was at leaſt in <hi>Poſſeſſione Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictionis,</hi>
and that all Acts of diſcipline for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the College were Valid, and Authoritative.</p>
               <p>2. If the Conſequence ſhould be allow'd, that all the Acts
of a Warden, who had no good Title, were void; then all
the Leaſes made in his Wardenſhip would be invalidated, all
Fines muſt <hi>de novo</hi> be paid, and the common ſecurity of thoſe
that tranſacted with a College would be overthrown: For
it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that a Warden <hi>de facto</hi> ſhould be
admitted to have Power of granting Leaſes, and not of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
Acts of Diſcipline, and Juriſdiction; ſince the one
Power is of more immediate and preſſing neceſſity, for ſupport
of the College, than the other; and conſequently the one is
often lodg'd in Inferiour Officers, the other is reſerv'd to the
Warden alone.</p>
               <p>As to the Title it ſelf, how far the King's Mandat <hi>in Re licitâ</hi>
can diſpence with the Ceremonies of Election enjoyn'd by
the local Statutes of a College, The Warden takes not upon
him to determine; he is inform'd however, that this Point
was admitted, and judicially ſettled in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> in
the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. It is
improper for him to State the bounds and extent of
the Diſpencing Power; and no ſign of Modeſty in Mr.
<hi>Proaſt,</hi> without any great pretenſions to Law, at one blow
to diſannul and overthrow it. But this the Warden knows,
that however unwarrantable the exerciſe of his diſpenſing
power may be, the uſe of a Mandat could not be ſo prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Rights of the College, nor ſo derogatory to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Viſitor; as Mr <hi>Proaſt</hi>'s Appeal from the Dean and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108324:10"/>
Chapter of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who <hi>ſede vacante</hi> were the proper Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors)
to the Privy Council, (who had no cogniſance of the
cauſe at all.</p>
               <p>As to the Mandat it ſelf, it ſhould be known, that it was
obtained by the Warden at the requeſt of the beſt Members
of the Society: That it was by them then eſteemed a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the College; and was uſed in other Societies at that
time, as the beſt method to hinder the incroachments of men
of ill Principles. That his Government of the College in the
late Reigns was ſuch as was ſuitable to this deſign, and was
ſo far from being unacceptable to the beſt part of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi> will gain very few or none of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that College, that will concur in theſe unwarrantable
exceptions to the Wardens title.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Proaſt</hi> hath put himſelf under a double capacity of an
Informer, and an Appellant. As to his Information, it is
humbly preſumed, that if any weight at all be laid on it, the
<hi>Moſt Reverend the Viſitor</hi> will give the Warden time to ſhew the
weakneſs of thoſe Suggeſtions; before his <hi>Grace</hi> gives himſelf
the trouble of any proceedings upon it. As to the Appeal, it
is hoped that upon the reaſons abovementioned, it will receive
no other favour from <hi>our Moſt Reverend Viſitor,</hi> than it
hath hitherto found from the <hi>Dean and Chapter of</hi> Canterbury,
from the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> eſpecially
ſince his caſe hath been ſo often conſidered; and ſince after ſo
long a circuit of proceſs, after ſo great and frequent troubles, and
expences; it will probably ſeem reaſonable to his Grace in his
Wiſdom to excuſe the Warden, and Fellows of that Society,
from any new <hi>charge,</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> upon this occaſion.</p>
