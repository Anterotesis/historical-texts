            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord Elect,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Duty of that Place wherein as yet I serve Their Majesties, doth oblige me to say something to Your Lordship upon this Great and Solemn Occasion. I thought I might have been excused by reason of great Indispositions of Body that are at present upon me. But since it is my Duty, By the Grace of God I will endeavour to discharge it with all Faithfulness and Freedom. And I am the more encouraged to undertake it, because of the great Merit of the Excellent Persons that are before me, to whom I must more particularly apply my self in what I have to say.</p>
            <p>I shall raise my Discourse from Two Heads, and they are very Vulgar, and they are very short, each of them consisting but of two Words in <hi>Latin, Foris Arma, Consilium Domi</hi>: Wars abroad, but Counsel at home; the first tells us of our Danger, the latter teacheth us our Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66462:3"/>
               <hi>Foris Arma</hi>: It pleaseth Almighty God, that after some Years gone over our heads since the last Revolution, and after so much Blood spilt, and so much Treasure spent, we yet continue in a State of War, and that with a Prince who is very powerful, is highly enraged against us, and is very prosperous. His Power at Land appears in this, that he has raised three great Armies, and maintained them, and whith his single Force is able to Cope with almost all the United Forces of <hi>Europe.</hi> His Power at Sea appears in this, that he can encounter with the United Strength of three great Nations, the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> each of which (single) not long ago had been too hard for him.</p>
            <p>I shall tell you in a few words, what the Design of this Great Enemy of ours is; not that I mean to tell you News, for I suppose there are none here present but know it; but I am afraid, we are not so sensible of it as we should be, we do not so well consider it as we ought. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I must mention it, because it induceth much of what I have to say.</p>
            <p>The Design of this Great Prince, the King of <hi>France,</hi> is this: First, To make himself Universal Monarch of the <hi>West</hi>; and if that were all, it were not so bad: For it doth not so much concern the World who governs, as how they govern. But in the next place, it is to establish an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Arbitrary Power every where: He would rule us with a Rod of Iron; His Will and Pleasure must be the only Law. And in order to this, he doth endeavour to make all other Princes and Monarchs seek to be Absolute and Arbitrary too, in their Dominions, that he alone may have the Power of ruling them, and that they may have their Dependence alone upon him: And therein he would have the Prerogative that belongs to Almighty God, to be King of kings, and Lord of lords: He would be the great Proprietary Owner and Disposer of all Estates and Possessions at his Will and Pleasure; to lay what Taxes and Burthens upon them he pleaseth; they shall Toil and Moil, they shall Plow and Sow, and he shall reap and divide all among his Bashaws and Janizaries, and Men of War. He would destroy the Protestants, and root out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66462:3"/>
their Religion, and suffer no Religion to be professed any where, but the Popish; and that not out of Zeal or Love to Religion, but he would make it a State-Engine, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religion being most suitable to serve his Ambitious Designs.</p>
            <p>These are his Designs, and I shall prove it to you by some most manifest undeniable Instances. And I have them already collected to my hand by an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Author, and his Name is Dr. <hi>King</hi> (late Dean of St. <hi>Patricks</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but who since that, was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London-Derry</hi>) in a Thanksgiving-Sermon of his preached at St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church in <hi>Dublin,</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of that Kingdom, before the Lords Justices of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is in print, and any one may have recourse to it.</p>
            <p>In the first place, He does state this to be the Design of the <hi>French</hi> King, as I have stated it; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the proof of it. And the first thing is a Paper found in the Closet of the late Lord <hi>Tyrconnell,</hi> then Colonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> where the Design is laid open; it is da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1671. (now two and twenty years ago) There is the first Scheme of the Design laid between the <hi>French</hi> King and our late King, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and it is a Scheme of such a Design as I have told you of; and then it proposeth the means for effecting of it.</p>
            <p>First, To procure Popery to be established in <hi>England</hi> by a Toleration; next, To suppress the Insolency (as that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calls it) of the <hi>Dutch</hi>: And the last is, To have a strict Alliance between the <hi>French</hi> King and the King of <hi>England.</hi> And by this means (as that Paper concludes) would the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> be Absolute Monarch over his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>Another Proof he produceth, is a Memorial delivered in to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> in the Year 1688. and that was by Monsieur <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, then at the <hi>Hague.</hi> In this Memorial all this Design is stated bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. There he tells the States, There was a Treaty between our then King, formerly the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his Master the <hi>French</hi> King, in the Year 1671. and that was to this purpose; To bring about such a Design as I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66462:4"/>
have spoken of; by which means (as that Paper hath it) the <hi>French</hi> King would be Universal Monarch, and the King of <hi>England</hi> Absolute over his own Subjects; and by this means there would be a Re-establishment of Popery in these Three Kingdoms. That is his Second Proof. The</p>
            <p>Third is a Letter written by <hi>Moloony,</hi> the Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Killaloo</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and directed to another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he states this to be the Design of the <hi>French</hi> King, that I have mentioned, and the means the same to effect it. In which Paper, saith my Reverend Author, there is great Anger expressed, that some Trimmers about the late King do disown any such Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>So that here are clear Proofs, that this was the Project between the two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> of a very long standing. They are Proofs in Writing, and under the Hands of those who were eminently instrumental in the carrying on of the Design. But had I time, and were it so pertinent (especially here) I could make that Design between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> elder than 1671. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, I need but mention the business of <hi>Rochel.</hi> You may see how that Atchievement of that King (this <hi>French</hi> King's Father) by the management of his Politick Minister Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> is celebrated with wonderful Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums by him that was then Secretary of State. They date their Freedom (as they call it) and their Power over the Protestants, from that Acquisition, and acknowledge that it came by the help of <hi>England</hi>; which is a great shame to be said. The poor Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> particularly in that City, prayed Aid from hence, and they had some Ships, six Merchant Ships sent them; they expected their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by this means; but when they came, instead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, their Men and Provisions were delivered over into the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King; which when they saw, they presently threw open the Gates, and submitted to mercy. And ever since that, the <hi>French</hi> Kings have been Absolute over their own Subjects.</p>
            <p>But I must not enlarge much more upon that Head, else I could tell of some great Designs of the same kind at the same time here at home. The striking out of that part of the Ancient Oath in King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Time, at his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66462:4"/>
Coronation by Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> (that the King should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to such Laws as the People should chuse) and instead of that another very unusual one inserted, <hi>Saving the King's Prerogative Royal.</hi> I do not deny but the King of <hi>England</hi> has a large Prerogative, as much as a good King can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: He has a Prerogative to do good; He is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from doing hurt: For our Law says, <hi>The King can do no wrong.</hi> He has we say a Prerogative that is part, and an eminent part of the Law; but it is not above the Law.</p>
            <p>And I could tell you of something more of that kind done since in the time of the Late King <hi>Iames,</hi> at the time of his Coronation, there was much more struck out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath, which might be well worth the enquiring how it came about. But I let that pass; I have made out to you what our great Enemy's Design is; I will now tell you by what means he has endeavoured to effect it.</p>
            <p>He doth first confederate with the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> that professed Enemy of the Christian Religion; he has brought him into <hi>Europe</hi> to destroy Christianity: And as this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ours, the <hi>French</hi> King, would destroy Protestants; so would that Confederate of his destroy and root out all Christianity; and yet must this Great Prince the <hi>French</hi> King (forsooth) be called the most Christian King.</p>
            <p>He doth break through all the Bonds of Religion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Common Justice; he hath openly and publickly professed he would not be a slave to his Word and Oath. He values not all the Edicts, under which the poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of <hi>France</hi> had their Protection. He did take a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath, and he took it upon the Sacrament, that he would renounce all Pretensions of Title to the <hi>Spanish Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> and yet you see he is gaining the Possession of it through a Sea of Blood. He doth (as we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect) by his Agents and Ministers, corrupt with Bribes and Pensions (or at least endeavours to do it) those that are Agents, and imployed under his Opposers, to get Towns and Fortresses into his hands, those Unmanly, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous, Unprincely Means. And we have reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him to have had an hand in Designs of assassinating those that are his Enemies, and to have joined with Dealers in poisonings. This, I say, we may very justly suspect,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66462:5"/>
though we cannot offer undeniable Proofs of it. But after all, I should instance in that base, corrupt way of sending <hi>Midianitish</hi> Women, according to the Counsel of <hi>Balaam,</hi> to lull Princes asleep; and dive into their Counsels, and betray them to Death.</p>
            <p>But besides, There is one piece of Policy of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he outdoeth all other Princes whatsoever; and that is the great thing of maintaining and managing Intelligence. He can tell when your Merchant-Ships set out, and by what time they shall return. Nay, perhaps, he does take upon him to know by the help of some Confederacy with him that is Prince of the Power of the Air, that the Wind shall not serve in such or such a Corner, till such a time. He knoweth when our Royal Navy is to be divided, and when it is united.</p>
            <p>And shall I guess how he comes to have such Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? that were well worth the hearing: I would but guess at it; and I would in my Guesses forbear saying any thing that is dishonourable to any among our selves. We all know the Scripture tells us, That the good Angels are Ministers of God for good to the Elect. It is the comfort of all good men that they are so. It is said, <hi>He will give his angels charge over thee to preserve thee in thy way</hi>; and, I hope, we are every one of us in our way. But we have reason to believe, that the wicked Angels are very instrumental in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on such Designs as this Great Man hath undertaken.</p>
            <p>It is a vulgar Error that hath obtained among some of us, That these Wicked Spirits are now confined under Chains of Darkness in the place of Torment. I remember that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some of them to our Saviour, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> It was not then the time of their being tormented. It is rather to be believed, that they are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about in the Air, and there fleeting too and fro, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on such Wicked Purposes as this our Enemy is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in.</p>
            <p>We know Grave and Serious Historians give us Instances of Correspondences held by both Good and Bad Spirits here; the Wicked by God's Permission, the Good by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and particular good Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66462:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>So the Death of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate Heathen Emperor, who was killed in his Wars in <hi>Persia,</hi> was known in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment of it at the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> at a great distance from the place of Battel, to the no little Joy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. And this I suppose was by the Ministry of a good Angel.</p>
            <p>We have instances of another nature, of what has been done by Evil Angels. In the instant of our Saviour's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, if we may believe credible Historians, it was known at a vast distance from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at Sea among some who were then in a Voyage. They heard a Voice in the Air, crying out of the Death of the great God <hi>Pan.</hi> After which followed great Howlings and Screechings; whence we may suppose by the Expression, that this was by some wicked Spirits that were hovering then in the Air, and did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this piece of Intelligence.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more on this Subject; but before I go off from this Head of <hi>Foris Arma,</hi> I would observe one word that may afford Your Lordship and us some Comfort, or at least some Mitigation of what may else be afflictive upon this account. We have <hi>Arma</hi> in the Case, but they are <hi>Foris</hi>; the War is Foreign. We have cause to bless God it is not yet in our own Country. We are not sheathing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Swords in the Bowels of one another, as some of us know it heretofore hath been. It is abroad, we know not how soon it may come home to our own Doors. But it pleaseth God of his great Mercy, that our Nation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Providence hath placed us, is an Island which lies not so open to the Incursions and Invasions of a Ravenous Enemy, as the Continent doth. What a desperate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ours been, if it had not been for this our Scituation long er'e this. Consider what a sad Condition those poor Creatures are in, who live in the Seat of War; themselves, their Wives and Children, all Slaves to the Conqueror's Sword, daily under Oppressions, Rapines, and Cruelties; one day under one Power, another day under the opposite Power. This is their Condition; blessed be God it is not yet ours.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more upon this Head, but resort to the other Head that I mentioned at first, <hi>Consilium Domi.</hi> And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66462:6"/>
it is a mercy from God, that we have an Opportunity yet left us for Counsel, a Winter before us to consult in; and wherein, tho we do not doubt but our great Enemy will be very active, yet he cannot make such a vigorous Progress in his Designs, as he may at another time of the Year. We have yet time to consider, and confer together.</p>
            <p>And it is the Happiness and Blessing of Almighty God, that we have the so near prospect of the Great Assembly of Parliament, that will be <hi>Consilium Domi</hi> indeed. If there be any Miscarriages, any ill Intelligencers, any inbred Traytors and Enemies within our selves, they will we hope take care about them. The House of Commons we know is the Grand Inquest of the Nation. It is one of their great Offices and Duties to make enquiry after, and prosecute such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and we doubt not they will do it.</p>
            <p>It is not lightly and groundlessly to be suspected, that those who lye in the Bosoms of Princes, should betray them. But yet I will tell you, that no Prince hath reason to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in that point. I cannot read that Passage of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Psalmist without a great deal of Compassion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Princes in this respect. <hi>David</hi> was an Holy Man, beloved of God, of great Courage, Parts, and Piety, yet consider what he makes his own Case to be. My Familiar Friend, he that eat of my bread, hath dealt treacherously with me. But he describes him further than that; We took sweet Counsel together: So that it should seem he was a Privy Counsellor, as well as a Familiar Friend. Nay, yet further, We went to the House of God together: So that he was of <hi>David</hi>'s Religion; he was one that joyned in the same Worship with him; he was no Dissenter. Nay, he was one that professed great Love to the House of God; possibly he might be a great Champion for the Church, and the Head of the Party. Yet such an one <hi>David</hi> describes him to be, who had betray'd him.</p>
            <p>We have besides this, (which brings the matter home to what we have now before us) great need to take care to chuse Excellent Persons into Offices of Magistracy, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for this great City, upon whose good depend many things, that I shall tell you of by and by, and on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends so much the good of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66462:6"/>And, my Lord, here we have cause to rejoyce that that Great and Wise Body have made such a Choice for their prime Magistrate as your Lordship, one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way so fitted and qualified for that great Office. My Lord, I will tell you what comfort I hope for from it, and I make no doubt, many others that are here do the same; That hereby we have a Token for good in the Inclinations of the Citizens, we feel their Pulse, we know what their Temper is, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it; it is spoken in their Choice of you. They appear to be Lovers of their Country, lovers of their Religion, lovers of the true English Interest, and well inclined to set the World at liberty, as to their Civil and Religious Rights.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have a further Comfort in this matter; the Election of Officers is a deliberate Act, it is the Fruit of Counsel, (which is the Head we are now discoursing of) and the Result of Wisdom. But, my Lord, we may look higher, even in this Action of the Citizens, there is, as in all great Human Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Primus Motor,</hi> to be considered, the Mighty God that governs in the Hearts of the People, He hath put it into their Hearts to fix upon you. What do we gather hence? <hi>Vox Populi est vox Dei</hi>; Almighty God hath chosen you.</p>
            <p>It is a mighty Curse as we read in the Book of God, to have a wicked Ruler set over a People: On the other hand, it is a great comfort and happiness to see a good Man chosen to bear Rule among us. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath given us in this an Earnest and a Pledge that he will not yet leave and forsake us, and I raise to my self a good ground of great Comfort from it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, in the third Century, after the time of our Saviour, there was one <hi>Antenor</hi> the eighteenth or nineteenth Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> died, and the See became vacant, and the Christians in a great Body met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuse a Successor, and being in the Field toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a great many Names were tossed to and fro of Persons that might be fit to be chosen. But there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66462:7"/>
was in the Crowd one that was known to a very few of that Multitude, he was among the <hi>Ignota Capita,</hi> one <hi>Fabianus,</hi> who was a plain Country Parson; very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, but a pious meek Man, who little thought of, or sought the Bishoprick. As they were tossing about se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Names, at last, in the open view of the Assembly, there was a Dove lighted upon the Head of <hi>Fabianus,</hi> which when the People saw, they presently with one Voice chose him to be Bishop. You have the Relation in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> an Ecclesiastical Writer of great Note and Credit.</p>
            <p>A Dove lighted on his Head! an excellent Emblem for a Bishop, who ought to be of a meek and Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like temper and dispositon: <hi>Amari non timeri debent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi.</hi> It was the blessed Spirit of God in that simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which lighted upon the Head of our Saviour, to give Testimony to him as the Son of God at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. And it was a Dove that brought the Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch into the Ark. It is an excellent Emblem of a Magistrate, who ought to be like a Dove without Gall.</p>
            <p>My Lord, indeed there was no Dove lighted upon your Head at your Election, nor was there need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any; for Miracles were never done in vain: it had been a Miracle if you had not been chosen. Your every way being so fit and qualified for this Trust and Command, did bespeak your Election.</p>
            <p>It is a dispute among the Learned, whether Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be of Natural Right of Human Institution. I remember the Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> says some Persons have a natural Right to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; that is, Men of great Vertue, Parts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Spirits, that are Mercurial: Others again are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Subjection, being of duller Tempers, and more sluggish heavy Spirits; some are fit for Hands, others for Heads.</p>
            <p>There was a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who was called <hi>Mecoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> of whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, He was never Consul in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor Senator, but yet had as great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both with Senate and People, as any of those who had triumphed, because of his excellent Parts and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66462:7"/>
great Vertue. It might have been said of him, He loved our Nation, and hath built as a Synagogue; that is, he delighted to do them good; and they would all listen to him upon all occasions, tho' he never had any of the Badges of Authority conferred upon him.</p>
            <p>It is taken care of by our Law, That that Coin which is current among us must not be of the baser Mettals, but of one of the two finer Species, Silver or Gold; it must have intrinsick Value, as well as the Royal Impress. This Election of your Lordship, and our Swearing you and all this Ceremony, gives but the Stamp and Impression, it was your own intrinsick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue before that intitled you to the Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I shall say no more upon this Subject, but shall make all the hast I can to conclude with that which is my Duty, to give some Advice to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Not but that you know your Duty as well as I can teach it; but I must not neglect any part of my own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I must advice your Lordship to take care, First, of Religion, and of the Service and Worship of God in the City, to keep it up in Power and in Purity. If we would have God to be our God and our Friend in a time of Distress, we must carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him Dutifully and Religiously, and then we shall have him always our Friend, our Father and Protector. Therefore, my Lord, be severe upon all open Profane Persons, Swearers, and others, and those who are not afraid to vent their Artheistical loose Opinions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. There are a great many profess'd Atheists amongst us; and there are, I fear, a greater number that pass under a new Name of Deists, that are of as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles, and indeed, I fear, more dangerous; who throw off all revealed Religion whatsoever. Pray have a care of these, and such as lead dissolute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Lives; for if they be tolerated, they will prove great Snares and Mischiefs to us all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope your Lordship will look carefully after them.</p>
            <p>In the next place, pray, my Lord, take care of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66462:8"/>
Peace and Quiet of the City, upon which the Peace of the Nation so much depends. We have those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and a great many, who, what with false Rumours and Reports, and other Artifices and cunning Contrivances would disturb the Peace of the Nation, and put Frights and Fears into the Multitude. It would be a desperate Remedy, that of Insurrections and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. Your Lordship will do well to have an Eye upon them, and prevent the beginnings. They are well joyned together in Holy Writ; it is Almighty God alone that can still the Raging of the Sea, and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of the People. Whatsoever may be the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon which they are first got together, we know not what they may turn about to when once they have a Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> You will likewise do well to take care that the Proceedings of your Courts of Justice be clear and speedy, and not too chargeable to the Suitor. And here I cannot but renew the mention of a thing that I have often spoken of. I wish there were a good Law against selling of Offices in the City, and every where else; it doth corrupt the Fountain of Justice. I speak not so much of your other Offices, but of those in your Courts of Justice; it may prove the Ruine of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Destruction of the Government.</p>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, take care of Charity; look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Poor, especially in this hard Winter, and now there is such a Scarcity of Corn, and the Dearness of Coals: Your Lordship in great Prudence and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of your great Charity, will, I hope, think of it in time, and provide Stores for the poor People, that they may not be in extream Want as to Food or Fewel.</p>
            <p>I beg of your Lordship to be vigilant over those who meet together, and cabal, and study how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb our Peace. My Lord, they do now appear open-faced, and affect to be known as Enemies to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They will not joyn with us in observing our Fasts, but take occasion on those days to feast and be jolly with one another; they purposely pride
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66462:8"/>
themselves in paying double Taxes, because thereby they are known to be against our present Settlement. These must have a strict Eye kept upon them.</p>
            <p>I had much more to say upon that Point, but I have been too long already. I come now to the last part of this Work, that lies upon me, that is, to offer your Lorship some Considerations, that may encourage you in the chearful Discharge of your Office.</p>
            <p>Among other things, you have the good Examples of your two last Predecessors, who indeed are so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and worthy Persons, that they may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Worthies of <hi>David</hi>; and in particular, your immediate Predecessor that stands by you, who hath, during his time, well preserved the Peace of the City, and delivered it fairly into your Lordships hands. Tho' we cannot say, he hath brought the Ship into Harbour, yet he hath fairly performed his part of the Voyage, notwithstanding the Roughness and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuousness of the Season.</p>
            <p>My Lord, You have the Example of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to encourage you, who hath, with great Courage and Love to our Nation, exposed his Person to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Perils and Hazards for us. And it is not only his Vertue that may be an Encouragement, but it is evident now to all the World, that there hath a blessed Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence attended him in the greatest Dangers, to preserve and protect him. In the business of Fights, there is not a Bullet that flieth, but it is under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Direction of Providence. And it is to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle apparent, that the Hand of Providence is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually over the Head of our King.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was in great Distress, <hi>Pompey</hi> his Enemy having possessed himself of all the Power, and shut him up under great Difficulties, he puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Disguise, with a purpose to make his Escape, and embarqued himself in a small Vessel. When he was there, he could not prevail upon the Pilot to put to Sea, it was rough and tempestuous, like the Times we are now in; all the Arguments he could use would by no means do with him: At length he was forced
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66462:9"/>
to throw off his Disguise, and shew himself, and tell him, <hi>Caesarem &amp; Caesaris fortunam vebis</hi>: You have <hi>Caesar</hi> aboard, and <hi>Caesar</hi>'s good Fortune. That which he called Fortune I will call Providence: And that Providence which preserved the King, I make no doubt will protect you in your Great Station.</p>
            <p>My Lord, You have under your Care (and I am glad the Care is in such hands) the Worship and Service of Almighty God and his Glory is engaged on your side. Our Great Enemy, that I have spoken so much of before, most blasphemously and impiously arrogates Glory to himself, which is God's Prerogative. <hi>My Glory,</hi> saith God, <hi>I will not give to another.</hi> But the French King snatches at it; he declares openly, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> are an Hindrance and Diminution to his Glory; and we may expect to have the same said of our selves.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I say, you have this Glory of God on your side, and you have the Prayers and Assistance of a great many that love God; a great many in your City, I dare pronounce, more than in any place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven. The Prophet complained, That he was left alone to serve God. But God answered him, that <hi>he had seven thousand in</hi> Israel <hi>who never bowed the Knee to</hi> Baal. I may multiply that number of <hi>Seven</hi> as our blessed Saviour doth in the case of Forgiving our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; There are seventy times seven thousand in this City, and about it, <hi>that never bowed the Knee to</hi> Baal, never had a hand in all the Miscarriages and illegal Actions of the late Times, would never own Popery and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power</p>
            <p>And I question not there are a great many more in the rest of the Kingdom: These may be an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you. You have the Interest of all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in the World, and all that are concerned for their Civil Rights, and their Religious ones too on your side.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I shall only conclude with one Word: Your Entrance into this great Office is very hopeful; we all of us heartily wish your <hi>Exit</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi> may be as happy.</p>
