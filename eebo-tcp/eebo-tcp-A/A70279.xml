            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And truely, in my judgement, this custom may be termed not onely a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,</hi> but the basest kind of <hi>Burglary</hi> that can be, 'tis worse then picking of a lock, or breaking into a roome by violence for he who doth so, robs us peradventur of some outward pelf or baggage offortune; but he who breaks open ones private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or seale, may be said to plunder his very brains, and rob him of his most precious meditations.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon a time, the <hi>Stars</hi> complained to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his beames too much upon some malignant <hi>Planets;</hi> That the <hi>Moone</hi> had too great a share of his influence, and that he was carryed away too much by her motion: They complained also, that the constellation of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> (which holds the ballance of Justice) had but a dim light, and that the <hi>Astrean</hi> Court was grown altogether destructive, with divers other grievances. <hi>Apollo</hi> hereupon, commanded <hi>Mercury</hi> to summon a generall Synod, where some out of every <hi>Asterisme</hi> throughout the whole Firmament were to meet; <hi>Apollo</hi> told them, I am placed here by the finger of the Almighty, to be Monarch of the <hi>Skie,</hi> to be the Measurer of <hi>Time,</hi> and I goe upon his errand round about the world every foure and tweny houres: I am also the Fountaine of <hi>Heate</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> which, though I use to dispence and diffuse in equall proportions throughout the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; yet there is difference 'twixt objects: a <hi>Castle</hi> hath more of my light then a <hi>Cottage,</hi> and the <hi>Cedar</hi> hath more of me then the <hi>Shrub:</hi> But touching the <hi>Moon,</hi> (the second great <hi>Luminary</hi>) I would have you know, that she is dearest unto mee, therefore let none repine that I cherish her with my beames, and confer more light on her then any other. Touching the malignant <hi>Planets,</hi> or any other <hi>Star,</hi> of what magnitude soever, that moves not in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motion, or hath run any <hi>excentrique exorbitant</hi> course, or that would have made me to move out of the <hi>Zodiak,</hi> I put them over unto you, that upon due examination and proof, they may be <hi>unspher'd</hi> or extinguished. But I would have this done with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; I would have you to keep as neer as you can betweene the <hi>Tropiques</hi> and temperate <hi>Zones:</hi> I would have things reduced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57275-01:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to their true Principles, reformed, not ruin'd; I would have the spirit of malice and lying, the spirit of partiality and injustice, the spirit of tyranny and rigour, the base spirit of feare and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie to be farre from this glorious <hi>Syderean</hi> Synod; I would have all private interests reflecting upon revenge or profit, to be utterly banished hence: Moreover, I would not have you to make grievances, where no grievances are, or dangers, where no dangers are; I would have no <hi>creation</hi> of dangers; I would have you to husband time as parsimoniously as you can, lest by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long together, and amusing the world with such tedious hopes of redresse of grievances, you prove your selfe the greatest grievance at last, and so from <hi>Starres,</hi> become <hi>Comets:</hi> Lastly, I would have you be cautious how you tamper with my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, and chop Logicke with mee in that point; you know what became of <hi>Him,</hi> who once presumed to meddle with my Chariot. Hereupon the whole Host of <hi>Heaven</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellated thus into one great <hi>Body,</hi> fell into a serious deliberation of things; and <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe continued his presence, and sate amongst them in his full <hi>lustre,</hi> but in the meane time, whilest they were in the midst of their consultations, many odde <hi>Aspects, Oppositions,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> hapned betweene them: for some of the <hi>Sporades,</hi> but specially those mongrel small vulgar <hi>stars,</hi> which make up the <hi>Galaxia</hi> (the milkie way in <hi>Heaven</hi>) gather in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous disorderly manner about the body of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many strange insolencies, which caused <hi>Apollo</hi> (taking young<note place="margin">The <hi>Prince</hi>

               <p>UPon a time the <hi>Birds</hi> met in Councell, for redresse of some extravagancies that had <hi>flowne</hi> unto the <hi>volatill Empire;</hi> Nor was it the first time that <hi>Birds</hi> met thus; for the <hi>Phrygian Fabler</hi> tells us of divers meetings of theirs: And after him we read that <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus,</hi> undertook the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of their language, and to be their <hi>Drogoman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They thus assembled in one great <hi>Covie</hi> by the call of the <hi>Eagle</hi> their unquestioned hereditary King, and by vertue of his Royall Authority, complaints were brought, that divers <hi>Cormorants</hi> and <hi>Harpies,</hi> with other <hi>Birds</hi> of prey, had got in amongst them, who did much annoy and invade the publique liberty: sundry other <hi>Birds</hi> were questioned, which caused <hi>some</hi> to take a timely flight<note place="margin">Finch, &amp;c</note> into another ayre.</p>
               <p>As they were thus consulting for advancement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Mechanick Mariners.</note> good, many <hi>Rooks, Horne-Owles</hi> and <hi>Sea-Gulls</hi> flock'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fluttered about the place they were assembled in, where they kept a hideous noyse, and committed many outrages, and nothing could satisfie them, but the <hi>Griffons</hi> head, which was therefore chopt off, and offered up as a sacrifice to make them<note place="margin">E. Straff.</note> leave their chattering, and to appease their fury for the time.</p>
               <p>They fell foule afterwards upon the <hi>Pies,</hi> who were used to be<note place="margin">Bishops.</note> much reverenced, and to sit upon the highest <hi>pearch</hi> in that great Assembly: they called them Idolatrous and inauspitious <hi>Birds,</hi> they hated their mixt colour, repined at their long traine, they tore their white feathers, and were ready to peck out their very eyes: they did what they could to put them in <hi>Owles</hi> feathers (as the poore <hi>Sheep</hi> was in the <hi>Woolfs</hi> skin) to make them the more hated, and to be star'd and hooted at wheresoever they passed. The <hi>Pies</hi> being thus scar'd, presented a Petition to the royall <hi>Eagle,</hi> and to this his great Counsell, that they might be secured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire safely thither to sit and consult, according to the ancient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57275-01:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lawes of the <hi>Volatill Empire</hi> continued so many ages without controllment or question: in which Petition they inserted a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi> or <hi>Caveat,</hi> that no publique act should passe in the interim. This Supplication, both for matter and form, was excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and cryed up to be high Treason, specially that indefinite <hi>Protest</hi> they had made, that no Act whatsoever should be of any validity without them, which was alledged to derogate from the High Law-making power of that great Counsell, and rended to retard and disturb the great Affairs which were then in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so the poore <hi>Pies,</hi> as if by that Petition they had like the <hi>Black-bird</hi> voyded Lime to catch themselves, for <hi>Turdus cacat sibi malum,</hi> were suddenly hurried away into a Cage, and after ten long Moneths canvassing of the point, they were <hi>unpearch'd,</hi> and rendred for ever uncapable to be members of that Court, they were struck dumb and voice-lesse, and suddenly blowne up away thence, though without any force of <hi>powder,</hi> as once was plotted against them. But this was done when a thin number of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <hi>Birds</hi> had kept still together, and stuck close against them, and after that the <hi>Bill</hi> concerning them had been once ejected, which they humbly conceived by the ancient order of that Court could not be re-admitted in the same Session. They peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from the place they were cooped in, that for heavens sake, for the honour of that noble Counsell, for Truth and Justice sake, they being as free-born Denisons of the ayrie <hi>Region,</hi> as any other <hi>Volatills</hi> whatsoever, their charge might be perfected, that so they might be brought to a legall triall and not forced to languish in such captivitie.

               <p>The foresaid destractions continued still, and increased more and more in that generall convolation of <hi>Birds;</hi> therefore the <hi>Turtle</hi> would stay there no longer, there was so much <hi>gall</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: the <hi>Pelican</hi> flew away, he saw <hi>Piety</hi> so vilified; the <hi>Dove</hi> was weary of their company, she found no <hi>simplicity</hi> and plain dealing amongst them: And the <hi>Kings-Fisher,</hi> the <hi>Halcyon,</hi> (the Embleme of <hi>Peace</hi>) quite forsook them, he found so much<note place="margin">Arondelle.</note> jarring, dissentions, and bandings on all sides; the <hi>Swallow</hi> also, who had so ancient and honourable a ranke amongst them, got into another ayre, he fore-saw the weather was like to be so foul:<note place="margin">Her <hi>Majesty</hi>

the <hi>Rose,</hi> they had priviledge to speak all things with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Complaints were made that much <hi>Cockle</hi> and <hi>Darnell,</hi> with other noxious <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> were crept in amongst them, that the <hi>Poppie</hi> did <hi>pullulat</hi> too much, with divers other grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>THere was an ancient goodly <hi>Palace,</hi> composed of divers pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and partition'd into sundry <hi>Chambers, Halls</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> which were supported by mixt <hi>Pillars,</hi> partly <hi>Corinthian, partly Ionique,</hi> but principally by the <hi>Dorique,</hi> the King of <hi>Columnes,</hi> having the firmest <hi>Pedestall:</hi> Some tooke exceptions, and alledged, that some of the said <hi>Courts</hi> were too high, and some of the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> in this <hi>Structure</hi> were too wide.

If you desire a further intimation of things, I referre you to a Discourse, call'd <hi>The True Informer,</hi> who will give you no vulgar sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <hi>So I am</hi>
               </p>
               <closer>Yours as at first inalterable.</closer>
