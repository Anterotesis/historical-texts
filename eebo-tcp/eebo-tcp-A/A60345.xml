            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my dearly beloved Friends and Fellow-members, the Inhabitants of Katharines Tower, and others, who are called to hold communion together in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel.</head>
            <p>IT is a disputing age wherein we live, abounds with Controversies; Religion in the Practicals, yea in the Doctrinals and fundamentals of it, is by adversaries loudly alarum'd, and hotly charg'd; even that which in <hi>Paul</hi>'s account was beyond the line of Controversie, is yet at this day brought within the lists. And if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations be undermined, it's no wonder that that which is superstructory hath strong Battery made against it. Such is the present condition of the Ordinance and exercise of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some endeavour the invalidating of its authority, by Arguments framed against it: Others discourage from the practise, by reproches and scorns cast upon it, and upon those helps which have been afforded for the managing of it; making no more account of the composures of holy men of God, famous in their generations, then of loose Poems, and profane Jigs. Let such take heed lest they be found under a malignant influence, and acted by an Antichristian spirit, blaspheming God and his Temple, his holy Institutions, and them that attend them. A Vindication of this blessed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and exercise, hath been made by M. <hi>Cotton</hi> of
<hi>New England,</hi> M. <hi>Manton,</hi> on Jam: the 5<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> and of very late days, by M. <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Exon;</hi> who have all appear'd in a Polemical way, and militated in this behalf: And I do heartily wish there were better improvement made of such Provisions, and that the Saints would not suffer themselves to fall under a suspension from practising Gospel Duties, meerly upon this account, that they are questioned and<pb facs="tcp:43713:4"/> contradicted; that they would not fall off from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause others fall foul upon them. My business at present is, to promote the practise of that which my self and others have so justly pleaded for. I engaged at first to deal with
<hi>Solomon's Song,</hi> that mysterious Marriage Song; moved thereunto by considering the sutableness of it to Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Communion. Having performed that task, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my papers to some of my Learned Brethren, they perswaded me in like manner to deal with some other Scriptural Songs, and so make them publike. Accordingly I have digested the Songs of <hi>Moses, Exod. 15. Deut.</hi> 32. The Song of <hi>Deborah, Judg.</hi> 5. The Song of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and the <hi>Churches</hi> Song, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. into a familiar Meeter; and in all, have endeavoured to keep as close as I possibly could, to the letter of the Bible. If what I have done may be in the least to the honour of God, and your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, I have my aym. It is the priviledge that Christ our blessed Redeemer hath purchased for you, and others of his Saints that when his enemies shall weep and howl, you and they shall sing and rejoyce. It shall be my Prayer for you and them, that when others shall lament and mourn for the destruction of Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. you may be counted worthy to stand on Mount Sion, and sing the Song of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and of the Lamb.</p>
