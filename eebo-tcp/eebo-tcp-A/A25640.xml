            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>FRancis Charleton</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> having Reverſed an <hi>Outlawry</hi> of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> ſued out againſt him in the Reign of the Late King, and prayed, <hi>That he might have a Legal Tryal at the King's-Bench-Bar;</hi> And, upon his Arraignment, pleading <hi>Not Guilty</hi> to the <hi>Information:</hi> The Tryal commenced on the 7th Inſtant, when, about Ten in the Morning, the Court being ſat, the Cryer made Proclamation for Mr. <hi>Francis Charleton</hi> to render himſelf, who accordingly appeared, and then Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for any that would come and give Evidence. Whereupon the Clerk of the Crown proceeded to ſwear the Jury, being all ſubſtantial Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> who were ſworn without any Challenge or Exception. Then being directed to take Notice of the Priſoner, and hearken to his Cauſe, the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was read, charging him <hi>the ſaid</hi> Francis Charleton, <hi>together with Sir</hi> Thomas Armſtrong, <hi>and divers others, with conſpiring to compaſs the Death of King</hi> Charles II. <hi>levying War, and ſubverting the Government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Pariſh of</hi> St. Giles's in the Fields <hi>in the County of</hi> Middleſex, <hi>on the 30th of</hi> May, <hi>in the 35th Year of the Reign of the ſaid King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Information</hi> read in Form and Manner, but in Particulars as aforeſaid, the Court ordered the Cryer to call the Witneſſes, and accordingly the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> were called; but, after ſome ſtay, they not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or anſwering, the Court proceeded to give the Charge to this purpoſe: <hi>That whereas</hi> Francis Charleton, <hi>the Priſoner at the Bar, ſtood charged of High-Treaſon by Overt-Act,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and having put himſelf upon his Tryal, no Witneſs appearing againſt him, they muſt acquit him, unleſs they had any thing of their own knowledge to charge him with,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown asking the Jury, after they had, had a ſhort Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at the Bar, <hi>Whether they were agreed in their Verdict?</hi> And they anſwering in the Affirmative, requiring the Foreman might ſpeak for them, he further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and demanded, <hi>Whether</hi> Francis Charleton <abbr>
                  <hi>Eſq</hi>
               </abbr>
               <hi>the Priſoner at the Bar, was Guilty of the High-Treaſon whereof he ſtood charged in the Information, or that he fied for the ſame?</hi> To which the Foreman, in the Name of the reſt, replied, <hi>That he was not Guilty, nor that he did flie for it.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> having paid his Reſpect in making Obeiſance, departed the Court.</p>
