            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ACADEMIANS TEARES, OR, THE UNIVERSITIES FEARES for the decay of LEARNING.</head>
            <l>LIke to the Swan or Augur of the Spring,</l>
            <l>In depth of woe thus I your sorrow sing</l>
            <l>Learned Academians, eies dimm'd with tears,</l>
            <l>The diapason of my sorrow beares:</l>
            <l>I grieve, and for my griefe am checkt by those</l>
            <l>Who seeme well learned, yet are learnings foes.</l>
            <l>Wise they doe seem to be, but yet are fooles</l>
            <l>For loving Wisdome, and yet hate the Schooles</l>
            <l>Wherein the nutriment of wisdome dwels,</l>
            <l>What! Is it wisdome for to seek new hels</l>
            <l>In an eternall Theame of blisse? i'st fit</l>
            <l>To approve non-sense to be reall wit?</l>
            <l>How shall the Eunuch Scripture understand,</l>
            <l>If <hi>Phillip</hi> not ascend the Chariot, and</l>
            <l>Instruct? how shall dark sentences be made</l>
            <l>cleare as the Sun, when Masters of each trade</l>
            <l>Will be interpreters? Can Lands be free</l>
            <l>From heresies, where all will Preachers be?</l>
            <l>O surely no, where ignorance doth raigne,</l>
            <l>Wisdome to visit that coast will disdaine;</l>
            <l>When all shall teach, who will be learners then?</l>
            <l>Sure brutish beasts must act the parts of men,</l>
            <l>They must the audience be, and learne as much</l>
            <l>As those which doe at learned fountain grutch.</l>
            <l>The Universities I meane, who have</l>
            <l>Too much they say, and yet do daily crave:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="1" facs="tcp:55441:3"/>Suppose that some doe avarice affect,</l>
            <l>Doe therefore all? suppose that some neglect</l>
            <l>The feeding of their flocks, all don't doe so,</l>
            <l>Why should then any seek all to overthrow?</l>
            <l>Some Bishops have done ill (as heretofore</l>
            <l>I have declar'd) let them then pay the score</l>
            <l>They owe to death, let not such servants frowne</l>
            <l>Have power to cast a faithfull Prelate downe,</l>
            <l>Though <hi>jure divino</hi> Bishops must not be,</l>
            <l>Yet from derision they ought to live free,</l>
            <l>Which have not tainted been, such sordid slave</l>
            <l>(Whose basenesse my sharp pen shall strike to's</l>
            <l>Ought not to rail at them, which cannot tell (grave)</l>
            <l>How they have liv'd, whether bad or well.</l>
            <l>Ironmongers, Glovers, and each Coblers wit</l>
            <l>Is bent to shoote, what is the mark they hit</l>
            <l>But only Bishops? Lord Bishops they must fall,</l>
            <l>The reason why? they are turn'd Papists all.</l>
            <l>They love the Pope, and therefore they must down,</l>
            <l>The Miter never shall ore top the Crowne:</l>
            <l>God forbid that it should, O first let all</l>
            <l>Which think but such a thought, by justice fall.</l>
            <l>Let them be kept from the bright shining Sun,</l>
            <l>I love <hi>Minerva,</hi> but <hi>Medusa</hi> shun.</l>
            <l>Let vertue flourish, and let right take place,</l>
            <l>But those confounded be, which vice imbrace.</l>
            <l>Yet give me leave once more for to revie</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Minerva's</hi> torment, <hi>Oxfords</hi> miserie.</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55441:3"/>The very hearts of well affected men,</l>
            <l>Who said, what would become of learning, when</l>
            <l>Each Libeller durst scandalize it, none</l>
            <l>Being cal'd in question for't; but yet did pray,</l>
            <l>Schollers would patient be, untill a day</l>

            <l>Should come, wherein bad minded mens intent</l>
            <l>should hindered be, scandalous Libels stopt,</l>
            <l>The authors being hang'd, or their eares cropt.</l>
            <l>This cordiall did give some ease, but still,</l>
            <l>They are abus'd by Brownists words and quill,</l>
            <l>Some of whose actions to you Ile descrie,</l>
            <l>But first view Academians miserie.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Which thus begins.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Once <hi>Oxfords</hi> merits were accounted great,</l>
            <l>Our learning reverenc't, but now are beat</l>
            <l>To'th ground by each illiterate pen,</l>
            <l>Being term'd no better than Romes serving men.</l>
            <l>Like dolefull mourners we are forc't to walk,</l>
            <l>Finding no fitter Theame on which to talk</l>
            <l>Then our misfortune, which is Englands hate,</l>
            <l>But yet are ignorant from whence our fate</l>
            <l>proceeds, some say from envy it doth come,</l>
            <l>Others because we much affected Rome,</l>
            <l>By loving Canterbury, whose sad teares</l>
            <l>We doe present you, being writ in our feares.</l>

            <head>Of a reverend Coachman which preached before a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Separatists.</head>
            <l>AN honest Gentleman of the Inns of Court,</l>
            <l>Amongst the Brownists meaning to resort:</l>
            <l>His haire he cropt, and with a brothers pace,</l>
            <l>With turn'd up eyes, he went to seek the place</l>
            <l>Of their abode, at length he it doth finde,</l>
            <l>And comming in salutes a sister kinde.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55441:5"/>Sister quoth he, who i'st doth teach this day,</l>
            <l>Insooth I know not brother she did say;</l>
            <l>Last Sabbath day did teach a worthy man,</l>
            <l>Whom once againe I'le heare if that I can.</l>
            <l>What was his name said he, she could not tell,</l>
            <l>Her only plea was, he taught very well;</l>
            <l>A worthy man he was, a Coachman too,</l>
            <l>He thought it strange a Coachman so should doe.</l>

               <l>A Coachman, and a Preacher, O 'tis strange,</l>
               <l>What meant these ideots for to exchange</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Levi</hi> for <hi>Benjamin?</hi> What did they skip</l>
               <l>From doing evill by his Coach-horse whip.</l>
               <l>I doe conceit a whip would have been fit</l>
               <l>Laid on their backs t'have taught them better wit.</l>
               <l>If Coachmen turne Divines, poore Schollers take</l>
               <l>Their office, perhaps in time they'le make</l>
               <l>You Chaplaines to them, serve the Hall table,</l>
               <l>And afterwards they'le make you able,</l>
               <l>To minister the Sacrament, but oh!</l>
               <l>I quake to tell it, too many have done so.</l>
               <l>When I perceive Ironmongers, Walkers are</l>
               <l>In Gods own Tabernacle, and doe not feare</l>
               <l>His thundering rage (although they know full well)</l>
               <l>For peeping in the Ark, how many fell.</l>
               <l>My eyes I can't abstaine from springing teares,</l>
               <l>Lest truth should cease, I'me fil'd with 1000 feares.</l>
               <l>But yet I'le pray such things may be altered,</l>
               <l>Or those which are upholders of them haltered.</l>
               <l>Coachman, get up thy Box, Audience return,</l>
               <l>Lest the same place doe prove your fatall Urn.</l>
