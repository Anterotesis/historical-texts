         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which you may beſt have of thoſe that ſell
Charcoal ready burnt for your uſe; theſe are to
be prepared by ſharpning them at the point, their
uſe is to touch over your Draught lightly at the firſt:
you may know Sallow coals from others by the
fineneſs of their grain.</p>
               <p>2. You muſt alſo have a Feather of a Ducks
wing, with which you may wipe out at pleaſure
what you deſire to alter in your Draught.</p>
               <p>3. Black-lead Pencils, to go over your Draught
more exactly the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>4. Pens made of a Ravens quill, to finiſh your
deſign; which will ſtrike a more neat ſtroke then
the common quill: but you muſt be very exact
here, for there is no altering what you do with the
Pen.</p>
               <p>5. A Rule and a pair of Compaſſes with three
Points to take in and out; one for Chalk, another
for Black lead, or red Chalk, or any other Paſte.
The uſe of the Compaſſes is required in moſt things
you draw, which you are to uſe after your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroke
is done, by trying how near your Draught
and Pattern agree, and this being only toucht out
in Charcoal, you may alter at pleaſure.</p>

6. Paſtils made of ſeveral Colours, to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
coloured Paper or Parchment, the making where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>How to make Pastils of ſeveral colours.</label>
Take the Colour that you intend to make your
Paſtil and grind it dry, or rather only bruiſe it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fine; to your Colour (whatſoever it be) add
a reaſonable quantity of Plaiſter of <hi>Paris</hi> burnt and
finely ſifted, mix and incorporate the Colour and
Plaiſter together with fair Water till it be ſtiff like
Clay or Dough; then take it and rowl it between
your hands into long pieces, about the bigneſs of the
ſhank of a Tobacco-pipe, then lay them in the Sun
or Wind to dry. They being thus dryed are ready
for uſe, being finely ſcraped to a very ſmall point;
and if they be ſhort, put them into an ordinary
Gooſe-quill to lengthen them.</p>
               <p>And here note, that you may by this means
make Paſtils of what Colour you pleaſe, either ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or compounded, if you know what ingredients
and mixtures will make ſuch a Colour as you deſire;
which you will underſtand in the third Book, where
we treat of the Mixture of Colours. And further
obſerve, that the Plaiſter of <hi>Paris</hi> is only to binde
the Colours together; and therefore according as
your Colour or Colours you are to make are more
hard or more ſoft, you muſt add the greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
quantity of Plaiſter.</p>
               <p>By this means of tempering and mixing of ſeveral
Colours together, you may make (indeed) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60341:15"/>
colour you pleaſe; as all manner of Colours
for the Face or Bodie of Man or Woman, all kind of
Greens for Landskip, for Rocks, Skies, Sun-beams;
all colours for Buildings, with their Shadows.</p>
               <p>Theſe Paſtils are very fine and commodious for
drawing upon coloured paper, and therefore I
would have you,</p>
               <p>7. Provide your ſelf alſo of fine Blew paper;
ſome light-coloured, other-ſome more ſad; as
alſo with Paper of divers other colours, which now
is very common to be ſold in many places.</p>
               <p>8. Have alwayes in a readineſs by you the
Crumbs of fine Manchet or White-bread; the uſe
whereof is, when you have drawn any thing with
Black-lead that diſliketh you, you may ſtrew ſome
of theſe Crumbs upon the defective part, and
with a linnen cloth rub hard upon that place,
and it will fetch out the Black-lead, and leave
the Paper or Parchment fair and white. It is alſo
uſefull when you have finiſhed a piece, either Head,
Leg, Arme, or whole Bodie with Black-lead, and
would trace it over with Ink to finiſh it, the Black-lead
will be ſeen in many places, being thicker then
the line of your Pen; wherefore when you have
finiſhed your Drawing with Ink, and that dry, rub
it over with theſe Crumbs, and it will not only take
off the ſuperfluous Black-lead, but all other ſpots of
your Paper.</p>

                  <p>1. A Point is void of magnitude.</p>
                  <p>2. A Line is a length without breadth or
thickneſs; and of the three kinds of magnitudes in
Geometry, <hi>viz.</hi> Length, Breadth, and Thickneſs,
a Line is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>3. The ends or bounds of a Finite-line are points;
but in a circular Line, the points motion returns to
the place where it firſt began, and ſo makes the
Line infinite, and the ends or bounds undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
                  <p>4. A Right-line lyeth equally betwixt his points.</p>
                  <p>5. A Superficies hath onely Length and Breadth.</p>
                  <p>6. A plain Superficies is that which lyeth equally
between his Lines.</p>
                  <p>7. A plain Angle is the inclination, or bowing of
two Lines the one to the other, the one touching the
other, and not being directly joyned together: an
Angle commonly ſigned by three Letters, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt
whereof ſhews the Angular point.</p>
                  <p>8. If the Lines that contain the Angle be right
Lines, then it is called a Right-lined Angle.</p>
                  <p>9. When a Right-line ſtanding upon a Right-line,
makes the Angles on either ſide equal, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe Angles is a Right-angle, and Right-line
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60341:17"/>
which ſtands erected, is called a Perpendicular-Line
to that wherein it ſtands.</p>
                  <p>10. An Obtuſe-angle is that which is greater
then a Right-angle.</p>
                  <p>11. An Acute-angle is leſs then a Right-angle.</p>
                  <p>12. A Limit or Term, is the end of every thing.</p>
                  <p>13. A Figure is that which is contained under
one Limit or Term, or many, <hi>viz.</hi> a Round-line,
three Right-lines, four Right-lines, five Right-lines,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. A Circle is a plain figure contained under
one Line, called a Circumference.</p>
                  <p>15. A Diameter of a Circle is a Right-line drawn
by the Center thereof, and ending at the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>16. A Semi-circle is a figure contained under the
Diameter, and that part of the Circumference cut
off by the Diameter.</p>
                  <p>17. A Section or portion of a Circle, is a figure
contained under a Right-line, and a part of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
greater or leſs then a Semi-circle.</p>
                  <p>18. Right-lined figures are ſuch as are contained
under Right lines.</p>
                  <p>19. Three-ſided figures are ſuch as are contained
under three Right lines.</p>
                  <p>20. Four-ſided figures are ſuch as are contained
under four Right lines.</p>
                  <p>21. Many-ſided figures are ſuch as have more
ſides then four.</p>
                  <p>22. All-three-ſided figures are called Triangles.</p>
                  <p>23. Four-ſided figures a Quadrater; a Square is
that whoſe Sides are equal, and his Angles right.</p>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60341:18"/>
24. A Long-ſquare is that which hath right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
but unequal Sides.</p>
                  <p>25. A Rhombus is a figure having four equal
Sides, but not right Angles.</p>
                  <p>26. A Rhomboides is a figure whoſe oppoſite

                  <p>IN Drawing the Face, obſerve its motion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forward, upward, downward, or ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
by your Eye; touch lightly the features
where the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, and Chin ſhould
ſtand, and then go over them more perfectly.
The Circle, Squares, and Triangles that are uſed in
a Face, ſerve to guide your judgement where to
place the ſeveral features.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve diligently the principal Muſcles of a
Face, theſe appear moſt in an aged man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
face.</p>
                  <p>There is uſually a three-fold proportion obſerved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60341:21"/>
in a Face: 1. From the top of the Fore-head to
the Eye-browes: 2. From the Eye-browes to
the bottom of the Noſe: 3. From thence to the
bottom of the Chin; but in ſome the Fore-head is
lower; others Noſes are longer.</p>
                  <p>The Diſtances between the Eyes, is the length of
one Eye in a full face; but in a three-quarter, or
ſide-face, the diſtance is leſſened anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>The Noſtril ought to be plac'd exactly againſt the
corner of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>In a fat Face you will perceive the Cheeks ſwell,
in a lean Face the Jaw-bones ſtick out, and the
Cheeks fall in.</p>
                  <p>A ſmiling countenance is diſcerned by the Mouth,
when the corners of the Mouth turn up a little.</p>
                  <p>A frowning countenance is diſcerned in the Fore-head,
Eye-browes, bending and ſomewhat wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about the top of the Noſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In theſe Formes you muſt be very perfect, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Rule that in moſt Faces you may have occaſion
to make uſe of: for of all the parts of Mans bodie the
Face is the moſt diffcult. But having got the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Rules: Begin at the <hi>Head,</hi> and ſo proceed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as your pattern directs; and be carefull that
your parallel <hi>Joynts, Sinews,</hi> or <hi>Muſcles</hi> be directly
oppoſite; alſo that the Motion of the Bodie be
anſwerable one part to another, and that the parts
and limbs of the bodie have a due ſymmetrie; not
a great <hi>Arme,</hi> and a ſmall <hi>Leg;</hi> or a ſmall <hi>Hand,</hi> and
a great <hi>Finger,</hi> &amp;c. Let not one part be too long
for another. Of all which, you muſt know, that
at firſt you will be apt to commit many errours, but
be not diſheartned; proceed, and your labour will
not be loſt, experience is gained by practice; be but
diligent, and you will find more eaſe then you could
imagine: at firſt all things that are attainable ſeem
difficult; we have a good old ſaying, <hi>Nothing is
hard to a willing mind,</hi> and I can ſpeak it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
I might ſpend time to tell you many ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
how to proceed to Figures clothed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
if you can draw a Naked figure well, for the order
of Garments, you will be able to do that with eaſe.</p>

And now, having brought you thus far in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and given you a more exact order to proceed
with ſo many ſeveral Examples more than larger
Volumes have produced; which you having well
followed, and attained to ſome reaſonable meaſure
of Proportion, you may now proceed to that which
may be more profitable, if you firſt practice thoſe
things that may be eaſily ſhadowed with a Pen,
and that will fit your hand for Etching with <hi>Aqua
fortis,</hi> which ſhall be perfectly taught in the next
Chapter; wherein you have the mixture of the
Ground to Etch upon, the order how to prepare
your Copper, and how to order your <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
what Inſtruments you are to uſe about the ſame,
and how to take off your deſign on the Plate;
which is an experimental Rule practiſed by the
beſt Etcher in <hi>England,</hi> namely Mr. <hi>W. Hollar.</hi>

                  <p>A Man ſtanding, from the top of the Head to the

within a ſpan of the Knee.</p>
                  <p>A Hand muſt be the length of the Face, the Hand
ſpread abroad muſt cover the Face, and no more.</p>
                  <p>Note, that in Drawing a Figure ſtanding, you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60341:33"/>
muſt firſt draw that Leg which the Body ſtands
firmeſt upon; otherwiſe your Figure will yield one
way or other, as it were falling.</p>
                  <p>A Mans Armes extended is the juſt length of the
whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The like proportion is obſerved for Women, and

give the Symmetrie or Proportion, which
is enough to a good judgement: So the
Figures before in this Book have only the out-lines,

the Out-lines ſhew the Proportion to a good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but the Lines and Shadows give the lively

               <p>
                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE I.</label> Caſt your Shadows alwayes one way, that is,
on which ſide you begin to ſhadow your Figure,
either on the right or left ſide, you muſt continue
ſo doing through your whole work. As in the
figure of a Man, if you begin to ſhadow his left
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60341:34"/>
Cheek, you muſt ſhadow the left ſide of his Neck,
the left ſide of his Armes, the left ſide of his Bodie,
the left ſide of his Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Except the light ſide
of the Figure be darkned by the oppoſition of ſome
other body ſtanding between the light and it. As
if three Men were ſtanding together, that Figure
which ſtands in the middle muſt be darkned by the
foremoſt, except the light come between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE II.</label> All Shadows muſt grow fainter and fainter, as they
are farther removed from the opacous body from
whence they iſſue.</p>

                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE III.</label> In great Windes, where Clouds are driven to and

muſt concur, as ſtriving for ſuperiority: here in
ſuch caſes you muſt be ſure to ſupply the greateſt
firſt, and from them, according to your judgement,

               <p>
                  <hi>LAndskip</hi> is that which expreſſeth in Picture
whatſoever may be beheld upon the Earth,
within the <hi>species</hi> of Sight; which is the

Villages, Caſtles, Promontaries, Mountains, Rocks,
Vallies, Ruines, Rivers, and whatſoever elſe the
eye is capable of beholding within the <hi>species</hi> of
the Sight. To expreſs which, and to make all things
appear in Draught or Picture according to true
proportion and diſtance, there are ſeveral Rules to
be obſerved, of which take theſe few following.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE I.</label> In every <hi>Landskip</hi> ſhew a fair Horizon, the Sky
either clear or overcaſt with Clouds, expreſſing the
riſing or ſetting of the Sun to iſſue (as it were)
from or over ſome Hill, or Mountain, or Rock;
the Moon or Stars are never to be expreſſed in a
fair Landskip, but in a Night-piece, I have often
ſeen it, as in a piece of our <hi>Sarinus</hi> being taken by
night, and in others. As an Aſtronomer with his
Quadrant taking the height of the Moon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Croſs ſtaff taking the diſtance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Stars, their Man ſtanding at a diſtance with his
Dark-lanthorn, to ſee their Degrees when they had
made their obſervation; theſe things, as taking of the
Partridge with the Loo-bell, and the like, become
Night pieces very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60341:35"/>
                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE II.</label> If you expreſs the Light of the Sun in any Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip,
be ſure that through your whole work you
caſt the light of your Trees, Buildings, Rocks, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
and all things elſe expreſſed within the verge
thereof thitherwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE III.</label> Be ſure in Landskip that you leſſen your bodies
proportionably according to their diſtances, ſo
that the farther the Landskip goeth from your eye,
the fainter you muſt expreſs any thing ſeen at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
till at laſt the Sky and the Earth ſeem to
meet, as the Colours in a Rainbow do.</p>
               <p>There are many excellent pieces of Landskip to
be procured very eaſily; as alſo of Landskip and
Perſpective intermixed, which pieces to me were
ever the moſt delightfull of any other; and ſuch I

good, being the only helps to teach you proportion
of Bodies in any poſition, either near or a-far off.</p>

hot, for if it lie until the Ground ſmoak all the

then take a Hand-bruſh or great Pencil that is very
ſtiff, and rub it up and down till it be fine and even,
and ſo lay down the deſign on your Plate, and with
a blunt Needle or Point draw over the out-ſtroke;
you muſt have ſeveral Needles, ſome bigger, and
ſome finer, put them into a pencil-ſtick of the length
of a writing-pen, and on the other end keep one
Pencil to wipe away the Ground that your Needle
fetches off when you work. To blunt your Needle
point you muſt do thus, blunt it on a Table, or on
the back-ſide of a Copper plate, ſtill holding the

you keep the point round; the fineſt Needles you

the Turners do their work, to keep it round, then
after ſmooth it upon a Table-book leaf; and as you
work you need not ſcratch hard into the Copper,

open in the air, and the moiſture drawn out of the
Ground, and the ſame inconveniency will accrue
by letting your Ground lie too long upon your
Plate before you finiſh, three or four moneths time
will eat out the moiſture of the Ground, and in
Etching it will ſeem broad and deep, and when you
think it eaten enough, you will find it to be eaten
little or nothing: in Winter time wrap your Plate
in a Blanket as well as Paper when you leave your

which chuſe thus; Take a File and touch the edge
of the Graver therewith, if the File cut it, it is too
ſoft and will never do you good; but if the File will
not touch it by reaſon of the hardneſs, it will ſerve
your occaſion, although ſuch a Graver be apt at firſt
to break ſhort off, after a little uſe by whetting it
will come to a good temper and condition, as by
experience I have found; though ſome ignorant of
what they have writ, would puzzle you about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the temper.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe upper part of this figure will ſhew two ſorts
of Graving-tools, the one formed ſquare, the
other lozeng: the ſquare Graver makes a broad
and ſhallow ſtroke, or hatch; and the lozeng makes
a deep and narrower ſtroke. The uſe of the ſquare
Graver is to make the largeſt ſtrokes, and the uſe of
the other is to make the ſtrokes more delicate and
lively. But I preferre a Graver made of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſize betwixt both theſe two, which will make
your ſtrokes, or hatches, ſhow with more life and
vigour, and yet with ſufficient force, according as
you ſhall manage it in your working: The forms
of which will appear in the 1. and 2. figures.</p>
                  <p>The 3. figure ſhews you how to whet the two
ſides of your Graver, which is to be done in this
manner following; you muſt have a very good Oyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
ſmooth and flat, and having powred a little
Sallad-oyl thereupon, take the Graver, and laying
one ſide of it (that which you intend ſhall cut the
Copper) flat upon the ſtone, whet that ſide very flat
and even; and to that purpoſe have an eſpecial care
to carry your hand ſtedfaſt, and with an equal
ſtrength, placing your fore-finger very firm upon
the oppoſite ſide of your Graver, to the end that
you may guide it with the more exactneſs: then
turn the very next ſide of your Graver, and whet
that in the like manner, as you did the other; ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60341:41"/>
that there may be a very ſharp edge for the ſpace of
an inch or better; then turning uppermoſt that
edge which you have ſo whetted, and ſetting the
end of your Graver obliquely upon the ſtone, carry
your hand exactly even, to the end that it may be
whetted very flat and ſloping, in the form of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeng,
making to the edge a ſharp point, as the
figure 4. ſhews you.</p>
                  <p>It is very neceſſary that you take great care in the
exact whetting of your Graver; for it is impoſſible
that you ſhould ever work with that neatneſs and
curioſity as you deſire, if your Graver be not very
good, and rightly whetted.</p>
                  <p>I cannot demonſtrate it ſo plain and fully by
figures, and diſcourſe, as I would: if you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with an Artiſt in this way, you may eaſily

                  <p>THe uppermoſt part of this figure deſcribes to
you the form of two Gravers, with their
handles, fitted for the whetting. They that uſe this
Art, do before they make uſe of them, commonly
cut away that part of the knob or bowl that is at the
end of their handles, which is upon the ſame line
with the edge of their Graver, to the end it may not
hinder them in their graving, as the figure 2.
ſhews you.</p>
                  <p>For if you work upon a large\late you will find
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60341:41"/>
that part of your handle (if it be not cut away) will
ſo reſt upon the copper, that it will hinder the
ſmooth and even carriage of your hand in making
your ſtrokes or hatches; alſo it will cauſe your
Graver to run into the copper in ſuch ſort, that you
ſhall not be able to manage it at your pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The 5. figure deſcribes to you the way of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Graver; which is thus, place the knob
or ball of the handle of your Graver in the hollow
of your hand, and having extended your fore-finger
towards the point of your Graver, laying it oppoſite
to the edge that ſhould cut the copper, place your
other fingers on the ſide of your handle, and your
thumb on the other ſide of the Graver, in ſuch ſort
that you may guide your Graver flat and parallel
with the plate; as you may ſee in the figure.</p>
                  <p>And be very carefull that your fingers do not
interpoſe between the plate and the Graver, for
that will hinder you in carrying your Graver level
with the plate, ſo that you cannot make your
ſtrokes with that freedom and neatneſs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
you may. This I think fit to give you notice
of, becauſe the skill of holding your Graver is that
which you muſt firſt perfectly learn.</p>

                  <p>HAving deſcribed the way of holding your
Graver, the next thing is to ſhew you how to
guide your Graver upon the plate in making of your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60341:42"/>
ſtrokes, which are ſtraight or crooked; that you
may work with the more eaſe and convenience, you
muſt have a ſtrong round leather Cuſhion fill'd with
ſand or fine duſt; let it be made about half a foot
broad in the diameter, and three or four inches deep;
lay this upon a table which ſtandeth faſt and firm:
then lay your plate upon the cuſhion, as is deſcribed
in the 6. figure.</p>
                  <p>When you are to make any ſtraight ſtrokes, hold
your Graver as is directed in the former Section;
and if you will have your ſtrokes deeper or broader
in one place than in another, in that place where
you would have them deepeſt you muſt preſs your
hand hardeſt; but eſpecially in making of a ſtraight
ſtroke, be carefull to hold your plate firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
upon the cuſhion.</p>
                  <p>And if you make any crooked or winding ſtrokes,
then hold your hand and Graver ſtedfaſt; and as
you work turn your plate againſt your Graver; for
otherwiſe it is impoſſible for you to make any
crooked or winding ſtroke with that neatneſs and
command, which by this means you may, if you do
not move your plate, and keep your arm and elbow
fixed or reſted upon the table.</p>
                  <p>If as you are working your Graver happen to
break often on the point, it is a ſign it is tempered
too hard; to help this take a red hot charcoal, and
lay the end of your Graver upon it, and when you
perceive your Graver to wax yellowiſh, dip it in the
water: If your Graver become blunt without
breaking, it is a ſign it is nothing worth.</p>
                  <p>After you have graved part of your work, it will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60341:42"/>
be neceſſary to ſcrape it with the ſharp edge of a
Burniſher, carrying it along even with the plate, to
take off the roughneſs of the ſtrokes; but in ſo doing
take heed of making any ſcratches in your work.</p>
                  <p>To the end you may better ſee that which is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they commonly roll up cloſe a piece of a black
Felt or Caſtor, liquored over with a little Oyl, and
therewith rub the places graven: And if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any ſcratches in your plate, rub them out with
your Burniſher: and if you have graved any of
your ſtrokes too deep, you make them appear fainter
with rubbing them with your Burniſher.</p>

you muſt note it muſt ſtand the contrary way in the

over in every limb with a good Black-lead Pencil,
eſpecially if it be an old picture, which having done,
take an old Ivory haft of a knife, and placing your
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60341:43"/>
picture exactly on your copper, the face downward,
take your haft and lightly rub over your print, and
you ſhall perceive the perfect proportion remain
upon the wax that is upon the plate; then take a
long Graver, or another piece of ſteel grownd ſharp,
and with the point thereof go over every particular
limb in the out-ſtroke, and there will be no difficulty
to mark out all the ſhadows as you go to engrave
your work, having the proportion before you.</p>
                  <p>And it will be more ready, if alſo you note your
ſhadows how far they be dark, and how far light
with your black-lead, before you rub it off; but a

obſervations.</p>
                  <p>At firſt you will find ſome difficulty for carrying
your hand, and for the depth of your ſtroke you are
to engrave; but take this experiment in your firſt
beginning; learn to carry your hand with ſuch a
ſlight, that you may end your ſtroke with as light
a ſtroke as you began it, and though you may have
occaſion to have one part deeper or blacker than
another, do that by degrees; and that you may the
more diſtinctly do it, obſerve your ſtrokes that
they be not too cloſe nor too wide: and for your
more exact obſervation, practice by thoſe prints
that are more looſly ſhadowed at firſt, left by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
thoſe dark and more ſhadowed, you be at a

or other Mathematical Inſtrument, every circle,
ſquare, or perpendicular muſt be drawn over as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

but if you be to cut any Face, Armes, Inſtruments,
or Map not to be printed, then if you black over

                  </head>
                  <p>I Have in the laſt Section told you what Colours
are to be Grownd, which Waſhed, and which
to be Steeped; it reſteth now, to ſhew you how to
Grind thoſe Colours that are to be grownd; I ſhall
not run over every Colour particularly, but ſhew
you how to grind one Colour, which take as an
example for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>For our example in grinding of Colours, let us
take the original of Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Ceruſe, or White-lead,
there is little difference between them, only
one is refined, the other not.</p>
                  <p>To grind it do thus; Take a quantitie thereof,
or of any other Colour to be grownd, being cleanſed
from all manner of dirt or filth, which you muſt
firſt ſcrape off; then lay the Colour upon your
Stone, and with your Muller bruiſe it a little, then
put thereto fair ſpring-water, and between your
Muller and Stone grind the Colour well together
with the water till the Colour be very fine, which
when you find to be enough, have in a readineſs a
great Chalk-ſtone, in which make certain troughs
or ſurrows, into which pour your Colour thus
grownd, and there let it reſt till it be thorough
drie, then take it out and reſerve it in papers, and
thoſe papers in boxes, for your uſe. This order
you are to obſerve in all Colours that are to be
Grownd.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>Of thoſe Colours that are to be

                  </head>
                  <p>AS in the Grinding of Colours I gave you an
inſtance but in one for all the reſt, the like I
ſhall do for thoſe Colours which are to be <hi>Waſhed;</hi>
I will make my inſtance in <hi>Red-lead,</hi> which you are
to Waſh in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Put a quantity thereof into a clean earthen diſh,
and pour thereto fair water, ſtirring the colour and
water together with your hand or otherwiſe, then
let it ſtand a while, and you ſhall ſee a filthy greaſie
ſcum ariſe and lie above the water, with other filth;
pour this water quite away, and put other clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Colour, and ſtir it about again, pouring
away the water (if foul) the ſecond or third time;
then add more water, and ſtir the Colour about
again till the water be thick and troubled; but yet
free from filth, then gently pour this troubled water
into a ſecond earthen diſh, leaving in the firſt diſh
all the dregs.</p>
                  <p>Into the ſecond baſon put more fair water, and
with your hand ſtir about the Colour as before; do
thus two or three times, and take (if your Colour be
very foul) a third earthen diſh, and add more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and keep ſtirring, till at laſt the water become
clear, and the Colour remain fine at the bottom
of the diſh; pour away your water gently, and you
will find ſome Colour remaining and ſticking to the
edges of the diſh, which when it is dry, you may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60341:48"/>
(with a feather) ſtrike away like flower, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
as the choiceſt and pureſt of all; if in a pound
of this Red-lead you have an ounce of good indeed,
Prize it, for it is troubleſome to procure. The
other, which is not altogether ſo pure, may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
for ſome uſes, though not for all. What
hath been ſaid of this Colour is to be underſtood of
all other that are to be waſhed; there<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for which take one example <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or all.</p>
                  <p>Take any Colour, a ſmall quantitie thereof, and
put it into a clean ſhell, then add thereunto a drop
or two of Gum-water, and with your finger (being
clean) work it about the ſides of the ſhell, and there
let it ſtick till it be dry; when the colour is dry in
the ſhell, draw your finger over it; if any Colour
come off, you muſt add ſtronger Gum water to it.
But, if when your Colour is dry in the ſhell, it glitter
or ſhine, it is a ſign there is too much Gum in it;
therefore remedy that by tempering your Colour
up again with fair water only, without any Gum.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Colours, as <hi>Lake, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mber,</hi> and
other hard Colours, which when they are dry in
the ſhell will crack, and look like parched ground
in a drie Summer; to ſuch colours as theſe, when
you temper them for uſe, add to them a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of white Sugar-candy in fine powder, which
temper with your Colour and fair water with your
finger in the ſhell till the Candy be diſſolved; and
this will keep them from peeling when you have
laid them on your Work.</p>
                  <p>Note here, that theſe Colours following, <hi>viz.
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mber,</hi> paniſh-<hi>Brown,</hi> Colen-<hi>Earth, Cherry-ſtone</hi>

                  <p>To burn any of them do thus, put the Colour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Crucible, ſuch as <hi>Gold-ſmiths</hi> melt their ſilver
in; if you will, cover the mouth thereof with clay,
and ſet it in a hot fire, there let it reſt till it be red
hot when the Colour is cold you may Grind or

                  </head>
                  <p>1. YOu muſt have two ſmall Sawcers or other
<hi>China</hi>-diſhes, in either of which there muſt
be pure clean Water; the one of them is to waſh
your Pencils in being foul, the other to temper your
Colours with when there is occaſion.</p>

bring it to its true colour, it being firſt too light;

the directions before delivered, upon that
part of your Card where you intend the
Face of your picture to be, lay that part of the
Card over with your Colour that you have before
prepared, anſwerable to the Complexion of the
partie; it being well tempered, pretty thin, with
a <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>encil bigger than ordinary, ſpread your Colour
very even and thin, free from hairs or other ſpots,
in your Pencil, over the place where you are to
make the Face of your Picture. The Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid, you may begin the Draught, the partie
being ready to ſit. Now to the finiſhing of a Face
there will require three Operations or Sittings at
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60341:52"/>
the leaſt. At the firſt ſitting you do only dead
Colour the Face, and this takes about two hours
time. At the ſecond ſitting you are to go over the
Face more curiouſly, obſerving whatſoever may
conduce to the graces or deformities of the partie to
to be Drawn, together with a ſweet diſpoſe and
couching of the Colours one within another, and
this ſitting will take up ſome four or five hours. At
the third ſitting you may finiſh the Face, this takes
up ſome three hours time; in which you perfect
what was before imperfect and rough, in putting
the deep and dark ſhadows in the Face; as in the
Eyes, Eye brows hair, and Ears, which things are
the laſt of the Work, and not to be done till the
Hair-curtain or the back-ſide of the Picture, as alſo
the Drapery be wholly finiſhed. Of theſe three
ſittings or operations we ſhall make three Sections,
as followeth: Then in the next Chapter ſhew how
the Drapery and other ornaments are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
then in the next Chapter ſomething of
<hi>Landskip</hi> in Miniture, or Limning, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>

                  <p>YOur Ground for the general Complexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid, the firſt work at your firſt ſitting
muſt be to draw the Porphile or out-lines of the
Face, which you muſt do with Lake and White min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled;
draw it very faintly, ſo that if you miſs of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60341:53"/>
your Proportion you may alter it with a deeper
mixture of the ſame Colour.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of the Face being drawn, add
to the former colour ſome Red-lead, temper it to
the colour of the Cheeks, Lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but faintly, for
(as I ſaid before) you cannot lighten a deep Colour
when you would. You muſt now put in the Red
ſhadows in their due places, as in the Cheeks, Lips,
tip of the Chin, about the Eyes, the tip of the Ears,
and about the roots of the Hair. All theſe Shadows
muſt be put in, not with the flat of the Pencil, but
by ſmall touches, after the manner of Hatching; in
this manner going over the Face, you will cover
your ground with theſe and the following ſhadows.
In this Dead-colouring you need not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious,
but ſtrive to imitate Nature as near as may
be, the roughneſs of the Colours may be mended
at the ſecond Operation.</p>
                  <p>Having put in your Red ſhadows in their due
places, put in next your faint Blew ſhadows about
the corners and balls of the Eyes, and your Grayiſh
blew ſhadows under the Eyes and about the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
work theſe ſweetly and faintly all over by
degrees, heightning your ſhadows as the light falls;
as alſo thoſe harder ſhadows in the dark ſide of the
Face, under the Eye-browes, Noſe, Chin, and Neck,
with ſome ſtronger touches in thoſe places than on
the light ſide of the Face. Bring all your Work
together to an equal roundneſs, and give perfection
to no particular part at this time, but view your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
well, and ſee how near you hit the Life, not only
in ſeeming likeneſs, but in roundneſs boldneſs of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
colouring, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60341:53"/>
Having wrought your fainter ſhadows into the
Red ones before laid, you may now have a touch at
the Hair, diſpoſing of it into ſuch curls, folds, or
form as ſhall beſt grace the picture, or pleaſe the
partie. You muſt only draw the Hair with ſome
colour ſuitable to the life, fill up the empty and void
places with colour, and deepen it ſomewhat more
ſtrongly than before in the deepeſt ſhadowed
places. And let this be your firſt operation.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AT the ſecond ſitting let the partie ſit in the
ſame place and poſture as he did at the firſt
ſitting, then obſerve and delineate with your Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
thoſe varieties which Nature affords you; and
as you did them but rudely before, you muſt now
with the ſame Colours, in the ſame places, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drive and ſweeten the ſame Colours one into
another, ſo that no lump of Colour, or any rough
edge may appear in your whole work, and this
work muſt be performed with a Pencil ſomewhat
ſharper then that which you uſed before, ſo as your
Shadows may be ſoft and ſmooth.</p>
                  <p>Having made this progreſs in the Face, leave it
for this time, and go to the back-ſide of your Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
which is ſometimes a piece of Landskip, but
moſt commonly a Curtain of blew of red Sattin. If
it be of blew Sattin, temper as much Biſe in a ſhell
as will cover a Card, let it be moiſt, but well bound
with Gum; then with a Pencil draw the Porphile or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60341:54"/>
out-line of your Curtain, as alſo of your Picture, then
with a large Pencil lay over carefully, but thin and
aery, the whole ground you mean to lay with Blew;
then afterwards again with a large Pencil, as before,
lay over the ſame again with a ſubſtantial bodie of
colour; in doing of which you muſt be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
keeping your Colour alwayes moiſt, letting
no one part thereof be dry till you have covered the
whole.</p>
                  <p>If your Curtain be Crimſon, then trace it out with
Lake, and lay the ground with a thin colour, then
where your ſtrong lights and reflexions fall, there
lay your lights with a thin and Wateriſh colour,
and while the ground is yet wet, with a ſtrong
and dark colour tempered reaſonable thick, lay
the hard and ſtrong ſhadows cloſe by the other
lights.</p>
                  <p>After you have thus laid the back-ſide of your
Picture with Blew, or Red, or any other Colour,
lay your Linnen with a fair White, and the Drapery
likewiſe flat of the colour you intend it.</p>
                  <p>Then repair to the Face again, and view your
object well, and ſee what ſhadows are too light or
too deep for the Curtain behind, and the Linnen and
Drapery may ſomewhat alter the propertie to the
eye, and make the Picture appear otherwiſe than it
did when there was only the colour of the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about it; I ſay, view your object well, and
endeavour to reduce each Shadow to its due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
then draw the lines of the Eye-lids, and
ſhadow the entrance into the Ear, the deepneſs of
the Eye-browes, and thoſe more eminent notes and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60341:54"/>
marks in the Face, and theſe muſt be done with a
very curious and ſharp Pencil.</p>
                  <p>The Face done thus far, go over the Hair, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or deepning it as it appears in the life, caſting
over the ground ſome looſe hairs, which will be
pleaſing, and make the Picture ſtand as it were at a
diſtance from the Curtain.</p>
                  <p>To ſhadow your Linnen, uſe Black, White, a
little Yellow, and leſs Blew; the Black muſt be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with lvory-black, with which mix a little Lake
and Indico. And thus far have we proceeded at the
ſecond operation.</p>

ſome general Rules for painting of Landskip, and ſo

               <p>In painting of any Landskip alwayes begin with
the Sky, the Sun-beams, or lighteſt parts firſt; next
the Yellow beams, which compoſe of Maſticote
and White; next your Blew skies, with Smalt only.
At your firſt colouring leave no part of your
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60341:56"/>
ground uncovered, but lay your Colours ſmooth
and even all over. Work your Sky downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Horizon fainter and fainter, as it draws
nearer and nearer to the earth, you muſt work
your tops of Mountains and objects far remote, ſo
faint that they may appear as loſt in the Air: Your
loweſt and neareſt Ground muſt be of the colour of
the earth, of a dark yellowiſh brown Green, the
next lighter Green, and ſo ſucceſſively as they loſe
in their diſtance they muſt abate in their colour.
Make nothing that you ſee at a diſtance perfect;
as if diſcerning a Building to be fourteen or fifteen
miles off, I know not Church, Caſtle, Houſe, or the
like; ſo that in drawing of it you muſt expreſs no
particular ſign, as Bell, Portcullis, or the like; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it in colours as weakly and faintly as your eye
judgeth of it. Ever in your Landskip place light
againſt dark, and dark againſt light, which is the
only way to extend the proſpect far off, occaſioned
by oppoſing light to ſhadow; yet ſo as the ſhadows
muſt loſe their force in proportion as they remove
from the eye, and the ſtrongeſt ſhadow muſt
alwayes be neareſt hand.</p>

               <p>Thoſe Colours that are to be Burnt, you muſt put
them into a Crucible, ſuch as <hi>Gold-ſmiths</hi> melt their

               <head type="sub">Of your Eaſell, Straining-frame, Cloth, Pallat,
Pencils, and Stay.</head>
               <p>I Might here deſcribe the form and faſhion of
your <hi>Eaſell</hi> and <hi>Pallat,</hi> but I think I need not;
for he that ever ſaw a <hi>Painter</hi> at work, muſt
needs ſee theſe two Inſtruments, but what they are
I ſhall here deſcribe.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Eaſell</hi> is a frame made of wood, not much
unlike a Ladder, only the ſides are flat, and full of
holes on either ſide, to put in two pinns to ſet your
Work upon higher or lower at pleaſure; it is
broader at the bottom than at the top, and on the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60341:58"/>
back-ſide there is a Stay, by the help of which you
may ſet in the middle of any room, more upright or
ſloping at pleaſure; when you do not uſe it, you
may clap it together and ſet it behind any door, or
hang it againſt any wall out of the way.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pallat</hi> is a thin piece of wood, and is neceſſary
to be about twelve or fourteen inches long, and nine
or ten inches broad, in form of an egge, at the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
end whereof is a hole made alſo of an oval
form, about an inch and a half in length, and an inch
broad; this hole is to put in your thumb of your
left hand, upon which you muſt alwayes hold it
when you are at work; out of the ſide of your
Pallat neer unto the thumb-hole is cut a notch, by
the ſide of which the Pencils which you hold in your
left hand alſo may come through, by which means
you may take any of them out, or put another in
at pleaſure. Theſe Pallats ought to be very thin
and light, eſpecially at the broad end, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the thumb-hole ſomewhat thick, yet not
above half a quarter of an inch; the beſt wood to
make them of is Pear-tree of Walnut-tree.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Straining-frame</hi> is nothing elſe but a frame
made of wood; to which with nails you muſt faſten
your Cloth that you are to paint upon; of theſe
Frames you ſhould have of ſeveral ſizes, according
to the bigneſs of your Cloths.</p>
               <p>By your Cloth I mean <hi>Cloth primed,</hi> I could
teach you how to prime it, but it is a moiling work,
and beſides, it may be bought ready primed cheaper
and better than you can do it your ſelf. Few Painters
(though all can do it) prime it themſelves, but buy
it ready done.</p>

tie a little ball of Cotton hard in a piece of Leather

                  <p>Put more White to that which remains, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60341:59"/>
To the remainder add yet more White, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it upon your Pallat till you have brought it to
the lighteſt colour of your Face.</p>
                  <p>Your Carnations being thus tempered, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
laid upon your Pallat, prepare your faint Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
For which,</p>
                  <p>Take Smalt, and mix it with a little White, which
may ſerve for the Eyes; lay aſide the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,

ſhadows in the Face.</p>
                  <p>Now prepare your deep Shadows; for which
take Lake, Pink, and Black, of each a like quantity,
temper all theſe together.</p>
                  <p>If the parties Face you are to draw, or the Picture
you are to copie do require the Shadows to be red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

a Face, and how to diſpoſe them.</head>
               <p>EVery <hi>Pencil</hi> muſt have a ſtick of about nine
inches long put into the Quill thereof, the
farther end of which ſtick muſt be cut to
a point.</p>
               <p>When you are to begin any Face or other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
lay together two Ducks quill-fitch-Pencils,
and two Ducks-quill-pointed-Pencils, alſo two
Gooſe-quill fitched and two pointed, two Briſtles
both alike; one Swans-quill fitched, and another
pointed; then a larger Pencil than any of theſe,
which no Quill will hold, and therefore they make
caſes of Tinn to put them in, you muſt have one
of theſe Fitched, as alſo a Briſtle of the ſame
bigneſs.</p>
               <p>Your Pencils being in a readineſs, when you are
to uſe them, your Pallat being upon your thumb,
you muſt take your Pencils in your right hand, and
put the ends of their ſticks into your left hand,
keeping (when you work) the hairy ends at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
one from touching another, leſt the Colours
in them intermingle.</p>
               <p>Your Pallat of Colours being prepared, and
your Pencils and Molſtick alſo in a readineſs, you are
to uſe them as is hereafter taught.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">How to Paint a FACE in Oyl-Colours.</head>
               <p>YOur Cloth being ready primed, and
ſtrained upon your Frame, take a knife,
and with the edge thereof ſcrape over
your Cloth, leſt any knots or the like ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it which may diſryme your Work.</p>
               <p>Your Cloth being ready, draw forth your Eaſell,
ſetting your Frame &amp; Cloth upon it at a convenient
height, ſo that you ſitting upon a ſtool, (level with
the party you draw) may have the face of the
picture equal, or ſomewhat higher than your own.
Then ſet your Eaſell according to your light, which
let be the ſame as I have deſcribed in <hi>Limning,</hi>
namely, a Northerly light, free from ſhade of trees
or houſes, but let it come in on your left hand, and
ſo caſt the light towards the right hand.</p>
               <p>All things being now in a readineſs, let the party
you are to draw ſit before you in the Poſture he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be painted, about two yards diſtant from
you.</p>
               <p>Then with a piece of Chalk pointed, draw the
proportion of the Face upon the Cloth, with the
place of the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, Ears, Hair, and
whatſoever the poſture affordeth the Eye; here is
no curioſity in this, only ſee that you keep a good
<hi>decorum,</hi> if you miſs a good deal, the Colours will
bring all to rights; but I ſuppoſe you know already
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60341:61"/>
whether the deſign will make a Face proportionable
to the parties. And ſo of that no more.</p>
               <p>Your Deſign being drawn in Chalk, take one of
your Swans-quill-pointed-Pencils, and ſome of your
lighteſt Colour, and begin with the lighteſt parts in
the Face, as the <hi>heightning of the Forehead,</hi> the <hi>Noſe,</hi>
and the <hi>Cheek-bone</hi> of the lighteſt ſide: when you
have done the lighteſt parts, do the mean parts next;
that is, thoſe parts not altogether ſo light as the
other, as the <hi>Cheek-bone</hi> of the fore-ſhortning or
dark ſide, the <hi>Chin,</hi> and <hi>over the upper Lip;</hi> and ſo
proceed gradually till you come to the Reddeſt parts
of all.</p>
               <p>Then lay your faint Greeniſh ſhadows in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
places, and where you ſee cauſe to moderate
harder ſhadows; but you muſt have a care you put
not Green ſhadows where Red are required.</p>
               <p>Thus all your faint or light beginnings being put
in, take one of your Gooſe-quill-pointed-Pencils,
or one of your Ducks-quill-fitched, and begin at the
Eyes to ſhadow with Lake, becauſe you may eaſily
overcome it if it ſhould chance to be wrong: I do
not mean you ſhould go all over the <hi>face</hi> with Lake,
but trace out theſe parts of the Face therewith, as the
<hi>Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, Compaſs of the Ear,</hi> &amp;c. This
tricking or tracing out of theſe parts with Lake is
to be done before you lay on any Colour, wipping it
lightly over with a linnen rag, to prevent the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
of the other Colours.</p>
               <p>Having thus put in all your Colours both light

therewith; by ſweetning, is meant the going
over theſe ſeveral Shadows thus laid with a clean
ſoft Pencil, which with orderly handling will drive
and intermix the Colours one into another, that
they will appear as if they were all laid on at once,
and not at ſeveral times. If this great fitch'd Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
be too big, you may uſe a leſſer; but note, that
the bigger Pencils you uſe, the ſweeter and better
your Work will lie; and it is as eaſie to handle
a great Pencil as a little one, if you uſe your ſelf
to it.</p>
               <p>At your Second ſitting (for this is enough at
once) begin again with your clean Pencils of ſuch
bigneſs as the piece you are to work upon does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Then the party ſitting in the ſame poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at the ſame diſtance as before, the light
alſo being the ſame, Obſerve well the party, and
ſee what defects you find in the Work at your
firſt ſitting, and amend them; then heighten or
deepen your Shadows according as you ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>This done, take a Gooſe-quill Briſtle and put
in the Hair about the Face, and rub in the greater
Hair with the greater Briſtle, and heighten it up
with your Gooſe-quill Pencil.</p>

               <p>IN <hi>Landskip,</hi> variety of Colours are required;
I will therefore begin with thoſe firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Colours for the Skie.</label>
For the Aiery skie that ſeems a great way off,
take Oyl-Smalt or Biſe, and temper it with Linſeed-Oyl,
for a Red sky uſe Lake and White, and for
Sun-beams or Yellow clouds appearing at Sun-riſing
or ſetting, uſe Maſticote and White; for Clouds in
a ſtorm, or for a Night-sky uſe Indico deepned with
Black, and heightned with White.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Colours for Trees.</label>
For ſome uſe Lake, Umber, and White; for
others Charcoal and White, for others Umber,
Black, and White, with ſome Green, you may add
Lake, and ſometimes Vermilion among your other
Colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Of ſeveral Greens in Landskip.</label>
For a light Green uſe Pink and Maſticote height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with White.</p>
               <p>For a ſad Green, Indico and Pink heightned
with Maſticote.</p>
               <p>You may make Greens of any degree what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>In Painting of Landskip I ſhall ſay nothing here,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60341:66"/>
that which I have already ſaid in the Sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Book of <hi>Limning</hi> being ſufficient.</p>
               <div type="section">

                  <p>OYL-Colours if they be not uſed preſently, will
have a skin grow over them, and in time will
quite dry up; wherefore if you have any quantity
of Colours grownd, to keep them from skinning or
drying, ſet them in a veſſel of fair water, three or
four inches under water, and they will not skin
nor dry.</p>
                  <p>If your Grinding-ſtone be foul, grind <hi>Curriers</hi>
ſhavings upon it, afterwards crumbs of bread, and
it will fetch off the filth.</p>
                  <p>If your Pencils be foul, dip the ends of them in
Oyl of Turpentine, and ſqueeze them between your
fingers.</p>
                  <p>When you work in Oyl, let a little pot of Oyl
ſtand by you, into which dip your Pencil, and ſtreak
it by the ſide of the pot, and the Colour will go out
that is within it, and you may uſe it with another
Colour.</p>

               <p>TAke your pureſt white Wood-aſhes you can
get, and ſift them very well in a fine lawn
ſieve; or elſe ſome Smalt, which is as ſome call it
Powder-blew, and with a fine Spunge and fair
water waſh the Picture you intend gently over,
but be ſure you have a great care of the Shadows;
for by the ignorance of many perſons many good
Picture hath been abuſed; but having carefully
waſh'd it, as before mentioned, take ſome of theſe
Verniſhes, of which there be ſeveral, but ſome are
more prejudicial than others, therefore chooſe thoſe
which may upon occaſion be waſh'd off again.</p>
               <p>As Gum-water purely ſtrain'd, or pure Size<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelly,
or the whites of Eggs well beaten; all theſe
will waſh off.</p>
               <p>Your common Verniſh will verniſh over any
dark part of a Picture.</p>
               <p>But your diſtill'd Verniſh is the beſt of all; this
will not waſh off.</p>
               <p>But obſerve, that when you have waſh'd the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60341:67"/>
you muſt dry it very well with a clean cloth
very dry before you verniſh it.</p>
               <p>Divers there be which have pretended to be well
skill'd or knowing in the Cleanſing of Pictures, and
skill in Painting, and have undertaken the ſpoyling
of things they have been unworthy to underſtand;
as with Sope, or Aſhes, and a Bruſh, and divers
other inventions, by their ignorance to deface and
ſpoyl thoſe things which otherwiſe might have been
worth great value, and in ſtead of hindering the
Painter of his employment, have indeed created
them new work.</p>
