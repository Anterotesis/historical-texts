         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O all the Profeſſions of the World: And to all the forms which all the profeſſors lives in. To the light in all your conſciences which comes from Jeſus, who is the fathers Covenant of light and life. The Lamb, who is the light of all the Nations that are ſaved, which now ſhines in all your conſciences: to this in you all do I ſpeak, that with it you may ſearch and try your ſtanding, and ground, and foundation. The Church is in God the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt Jeſus the corner ſtone, who hath ſaid, upon this Rock I build my Church.</p>
            <p>Paul writ to Timothy how to behave himſelf in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God the Pillar and ground of Truth. For ſaith he, without controverſie great is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up to glory.</p>
            <p>Now Profeſsors look about you, and ſee where your footing, and where your foundation is; who do profeſs a God and a Chriſt afar off, and denies the light of Jeſus Chriſt which manifeſts him in the fleſh. How can you know him, or confeſs him in the fleſh; who denies him to be manifeſted in you? What ground have ye to build upon, when you know nothing of him, but what ye have from a profeſſion without you? Oh conſider ſeriouſly! and turn your minds to the light, which will let you ſee your foundation to be rotten and ſandy: which ye flooliſh builders are building in your imaginations, Babel in the Air, profeſſing the Scriptures without, which were declared and ſpoken from a living and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principle within. And this ye take and build upon. But where is your foundation? where is your ground? where is your root, who denies the corner ſtone, the light Jeſus Chriſt, the light and Rock of ages, which all the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and holy men of God is founded and built upon? A profeſſion of this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52821:3"/>
will ſtand you in no ſtead, for the holy ſeed is riſen, the ſubſtance of all, and the life of the Scriptures which ſpoke them forth is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted The word which was in the begining, which was with God, which word was God: he who was dead is alive, whoſe name is called the Word of God, who lives for evermore. This word which we have ſeen, which we have heard, which our hands have handled: this we declare unto you, by which Word the World was made, and without which nothing was made which was made. This is manifeſted, and witneſsed praiſes, living praiſes be to the living God. And this is he that will break to pieces all your rotten profeſſion you cannot ſtand before him: his rod of Iron, where he rules, will daſh you all to pieces ye potſheards of the earth, who have ſet up the Image whoſe head is of gold, whoſe breaſt is of ſilver, whoſe feet is part Iron and part Clay. The little ſtone cut out of the Mountain without hands, ſticks at his feet, and overturns his foundation, you and your Diana ſhall fall, and ſtone ſhall become a great Mountain, the mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it; and you who take the words ſpoken from the life of God, and profeſſeth them, and God and Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, and ye proſecute the ſame life which gave them forth, which now is made manifeſt in his people.</p>
            <p>Ye make up the meaſure of your fore-fathers, which ſhew the Prophets and ye garniſh their Sepulchres: ye are in their ſteps that killed the prophets, that beat the ſervants and would alſo kill the heir, your fruits makes ye manifeſt. Ye are the graves which men go over, painted Sepulchres, with words and profeſſions of their outſide, but within are full of rotteneſs, and dead mens bones. The Candle of the Lord God is lighted by which he ſearcheth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and hath found you out; the day of the Lord which is coming upon you, which makes all things manifeſt. This will lay you open, To the light in all your conſciences do I ſpeak, that to it you may learn to ſee what ye know of the living God there, there he is unknown to you yet, as he was to the Athenians, whom ye ignorantly worſhip, though he be not far from every one of you. Therefore put him not far off you, but call upon him while he is near, and ſeek him while he may be found. If ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts while it is called to day. Now you have time prize it, this is the day of your viſitation; your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52821:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without you will not ſerve you, it ſtrikes in the Lords noſtrils, and all your righteouſneſs ſhall be ſpread as dung upon your faces, it is as filthy rags, and as the early dew it ſhall paſs away, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be mentioned. He is come who convinceth the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of Judgement; therefore your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is not the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is condemned by him, who is the righteouſneſs of the father, and the expreſſe Image of his glory. The glorious brightneſs of his coming makes manifeſt the man of ſin, which hath ſo long ſitten in the Temple of God, exalted above all that is called God in you; it is time to come wherein he is revealed. Therefore ceaſe from your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and outward profeſſions of forms and colours without the life, and power, and purity of truth it ſelf. For the glorious light makes you manifeſt, and all your covers is too narrow, the roe from the living God is to them, and all coverings which is not his pure ſpirit it is to be rent. And though ye may ſeem fair on the outſide, this will not hide you, he who ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reins is come, before whom all ſecrets is bare and naked.</p>
            <p>Therefore turn into the meaſure of the light which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the fountain of light, and ſee what ye have there in poſſeſſion. There you will finde your houſe unſwept and unclean, and the woman that had loſt the groat, ſought without, but ſhe found it not, till ſhe came to ſweep her own houſe, and there ſhe found it. This Parable ye muſt read within: Jeſus Chriſt likened the Kingdome of heaven unto a Merchant man, who was ſeeking for goodly pearls, who digged deeply in the earth and found it, but when he had found it he was to ſell all and buy it. And again, be likeneth the Kingdome of heaven to a little leaven which a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hid in three meaſures of meal, till it was leavened: though ye have the letter without you, yet theſe parables ye have to learn. Now turn to the light, and there you will come to ſee, learning there in the light ye will come to ſee and know the myſteries of God, which to the world is parables, and to all you who denies the light ſhall be ſhut for evermore. Though ye may get all the words of the whole Scripture in your brains and comprehenſion, ſo long as ye deny the light, and turn your minds from the light, and ſeek to know theſe things without you, ye ſhall never know them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52821:4"/>
but they ſhall be as a book ſealed unto you, the depth and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of them ye ſhall never know, eternally ye ſhall witneſs me; Therefore as ever ye deſire to know the myſteries of God, which is hid from all the world, and the worlds profeſſion, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high, turn to the light, wait in the light, keep your minds within to the light, and walk in the light, which checks you, and convinceth you of ſin and evil, and diſcernes the thoughts of your hearts, and lets you ſee the out-goings of your minds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerns every ſinful luſt, even in the very appearance and riſing of it, this is that which the Lord God teacheth in this his day; which Teacher never is removed into a corner, who hearkens diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and turns their minds to it.</p>
            <p>This is the eye which is blind in all the world, though they have eyes they ſee not, and eares they hear not, and hearts they do not underſtand; the God of this world hath blinded this eye, and his Miniſters would keep it blinde and ſhut up, and denies it to be a teacher ſufficient. And ſo your leaders cauſeth you to erre, who are blinde, and leads you that are blinde, and ſo ye may follow them, till ye both go into the pit. But eternally if ever ye come to know the living God, ye muſt turn your minds to the light which is in you, which Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, take heed that the light that is in you be not darkneſs; for then how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſo all your blinde guides which keeps your minds from this light, which is in you. So your minds being from it, it is to you darkneſs, and ſo then how great is that darkneſs. But turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your minds to this light, and joining your mindes to it, and hearkening to it; then will ye come to ſee this blinde eye opened. And the blinde man which hath been born blinde from his birth will come to ſee, and his eyes will be anointed with eye-ſalve; which thoſe blinde guides which leads you from the light, never knew. And this ye ſhall eternally witneſs to be truth: If ye turn your minds to the light, then will ye come to ſee what I ſpeak, and witneſs me to be true, and all your blinde guides Lyars, who denies the light, and would not have you to minde the light, but hearken to them who hates the light, and loves darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evil. But the light is riſen, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for evermore, which is their condemnation and hath found them out, who are the theeves and Robbers who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52821:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and climbe up another way. But Chriſt Jeſus ſaith I am the door of the ſheep, all that ever come before me are theeves and Robbers. I am the door, by me if any man enter, he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſaith Chriſt Jeſus who is the light. And theſe theeves and Robbers who denies the light, draws from the door Chriſt Jeſus, by which all that ever are ſaved enters, who is the good ſhepherd, and who hath given his life for the ſheep. But he that is an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing and not the ſhepherd, whoſe own the ſheep are not, ſeeth not themſelves to be the wolves; for they are blinde, the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, who denies the light, and ſo they leave the ſheep and flie. And the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael which Chriſt Jeſus is ſent to ſeek and to ſave they know not, but lets the wolf deſtroy the ſheep in every boſom of their flock. But now is the ſhepherd of the ſheep come, whoſe own the ſheep are, who is the good ſhepherd, and knows his ſheep, and is known of them; who hears his voice, and knows his voice, and he puts forth his own ſheep; he goes before them, and the ſheep follow him, for they know his voice, and a ſtranger will they not follow. Glory and praiſes be to the living God for ever; who is redeeming his ſheep from under the mouths of the wolves and devourers, who hath ſcattered them upon every mountain and hill in the cloudy and dark day.</p>
            <p>But now is the light of the glorious Goſpel riſen, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon the mountains is his feet, that brings glad tydings of this Goſpel that publiſheth peace, that ſaith unto Sion, thy King reigneth. To all who deſires to know the way to Sion doth this voice cry to turne your faces thitherward. To the light of Jeſus Chriſt, who comes riding upon an Aſſes colt, to the joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of all Sions children. Therefore turn again all you who are wandring from mountain to hill, ſeeking reſt, but finding none. Turn to the light in every one of your conſciences; this is the word of faith which we preach which Moſes taught Iſrael; and the Apoſtle Paul the Romans, which is nigh in the mouth, and in the heart: here is your teacher if you hearken to the pure light which ſhews you the deceit of your hearts and your unclean thoughts, from which proceeds uncleanneſs, which the light makes manifeſt, which will reap you up, and reprove you in ſecret. The Lord God of life and power is fulfilling his everlaſting Covenant in this his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52821:5"/>
day; he is writing his law in the heart, and putting it in the inward parts, that none need ſay know the Lord, but all who turn to the meaſure of God ſhall know him, from the leaſt to the greateſt of them. And by no other way or name under heaven ſhall ye know the living God, but by this pure light and law written in the heart. Here will ye come to witneſſe the Lord to be your God, and your King, and your Law-giver, which all the profeſſions of the world is ignorant of; therefore to this pure meaſure of God in your inward parts have your minds: that ye may come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cleanſing and purging within, that ye may come to ſee the uncleanneſſe which proceeds out of the heart, which defiles the man, Mat. 15.18, 19. For out of the heart cometh evil thoughts, murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe teſtimony, ſlanders, theſe are the things which defiles a man.</p>
            <p>How will you teachers and you profeſſors who looks without you, and turns from this which ſhould cleanſe you within? How do you look, that that which is without you ſhould cleanſe from this uncleanneſſe within. Let that of God in your conſciences now ſee how you can be cleanſed by this, when ye turn from it. But now if ye turn to the light which makes theſe things manifeſt, and dwell and abide in it, then will ye abſtain from them, and ſo come to witneſſe cleanſing. For he that walketh in the light as he is in the light, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin. And Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, Luke 6.45. A good man out of the treaſury of his heart bringeth forth that which is good, and an evil man out of the treaſury of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth ſpeaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? Whoſoever cometh to me, and heareth my ſayings, and doth them, I will ſhew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a Rock, and when the floods aroſe, the ſtreams beat violently upon the houſe, and could not ſhake it, for it was built upon a Rock. But he that heareth and doth, is like a man that without a foundation built an houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, againſt which the ſtreams did beat violently, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it fell, and the fall of that houſe was great.</p>
            <p>Now profeſſors here's your building, eternally you ſhall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this Parable fulfilled upon you, the tempeſts and ſtorms is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52821:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
coming upon you, your houſe will be beaten down, it cannot ſtand, for ye have been ſayers a long time, and not doers of the word; your houſe which ye have built is without foundation, it is not founded upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus. Ye who denies the light, he ſaith into you, why call ye me Lord, &amp; do not the things which I ſay? upon him ſhall ye be beaten to pieces; and all your prefeſſion. It is known and ſeen, ye are made manifeſt, ye cannot hide your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the time paſt of your lives ſuffice, and repent while ye have time, leaſt the whirl-winde of the Lord come upon you, and deſtroy you ere ye are aware; and remember that ye are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your life time: Ye who, talkes of faith, where is your foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? who denies the light Chriſt Jeſus the corner-ſtone, whoſe blood waſheth, and cleanſeth, and purgeth away the filth of the daughter of Sion. What will your faith advantage you who are yet in your ſin? Is not that faith vain which doth not purifie the heart? The Apoſtle Paul ſaith, Now the end of the Commandment <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned, 1 Tim. 1.5. And again he ſaith, Holding the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of faith in a pure conſcience, 1 Tim. 3.9. And the Apoſtle John ſaith, For whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith, 1 John 6.4. Now ſee your faith hath overcome the world, and given you victory over ſin, elſe never talk of faith; for ye are yet in your ſins, all who is of the faith by which the juſt lives, denies your faith: for ye who are alive to ſin, crucifies and ſlayes the Juſt. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et who is in the faith of God? the juſt lives by his faith: And ſo now here ye may read your faith by your works. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle James ſaith, What doth it profit though a man ſay, he hath faith, and hath not works; that faith cannot ſave. See what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon James makes, James 2.16. Even ſo faith, if it hath not works is dead being alone. Yea, a man may ſay, thou haſt faith, and I have works; ſhew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Now ſee how blinde ye are, who reads theſe Scriptures and profeſſes them, and yet talks of faith, and lives in your ſins. Oh the righteous God will plead with you, for all your deceit and hypocriſie. Thou believes there is a God, thou doſt well; the devils believe alſo and tremble. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know Oh vain man, that thy faith without works is dead. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52821:6"/>
what is thy works, who art yet in thy ſins? Is not ſin the work of the devil? Oh that ever ye ſhould be ſo blinde and befotted! Will the fig-leaves of your profeſſion cover your nakedneſſe? Nay, the Lord hath found you out, and all your coverings is too narrow. And your faith which is holden with reſpect of perſons, which the Apoſtle exhorts from, the Lord God abhors. But if ye had true living faith as a grain of muſterd-ſeed, ye might ſay to this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be thou removed into the Sea, and it would be ſo. But to you whoſe faith is dead, who are yet in your ſins, this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
            <p>Therefore repent and turn to the Lord God, and believe in the light, which is riſing and ſhining in your conſciences; he it is who is the reſurrection and the life: whoſoever believeth in him, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live. Therefore hearken diligently to the Prophet which the Lord is raiſing in this his day, and believe in the light: For whoſoever doth not hearken to this Prophet is to be cut off. Turn to the light and believe, and hearken diligently that your ſouls may live. Why will ye give your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which profiteth not? The pure everlaſting fountain of life is ſet open, and the voice is calling to every one to come. All that thirſteth to come and buy wine and milk without money; they that have been ſold for nought ſhall be redeemed without money. The blood of the everlaſting Covenant, which brings again the Lord Jeſus from the dead, is poured forth, and ſhedding for the redemption of Iſraels ſeed. Therefore all turn to the voice that calls ye, this is the way, walk in it: And that which turns and draws your minds towards God, the light which cometh from the father of light turn to, and there will ye witneſſe a living hope, which was that hope which Paul the Apoſtle was called in queſtion for, the reſurrection of the dead, who was a Miniſter of God, who watched for the ſoul, which your Miniſters of death knoweth not, nor hath no hope of; but their labor is to keep you in the death. But if ye wait in the light of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is the reſurrection and the life, which is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory. For this is he which is the bringing in of a better hope, by which ye draw nigh unto God. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifies himſelf, even as he is pure, 1 John 3.3. And the Apoſtle Peter ſaith, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               </gap>oe and living hope, which is the promiſe of the Lord, to the heirs of his promiſe. The Immutability of his councel, confirmed by in oath; that by two immutable things, by which it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us; which hope we have as an Anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſteadfaſt. But this is nothing to the diſſembling hypocrites and profeſſors of the world, who deny the light Chriſt Jeſus, the ſecond Prieſt, and hath ſet up a Prieſt without them, and hath a Church without them, and I hope without them, and a rule without them, and a guide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are none of the heirs of the promiſe, for the Promiſe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God is within, and the ſecond Prieſt, the unchangeable Prieſt, which is ſurely of a better Teſtament, and bringeth in a better hope; who is the Covenant made with an oath, who is the refuge for the righteous to flie to, which is the hope ſet before them. But this is a myſterie to all ye carnal profeſſors, who are yet in your ſins and your uncleanneſſe, and yet will tell of faith, and hope, and God, and Chriſt: But your root is rottenneſſe, your ground is curſt and corrupt, and your chaffe is to be burnt. The fire is kindled which cannot be quenched, and the day of the Lord is come, which burns as an oven, and all your filthy profeſſion, and deceitful rotten hypocriſie ſhall be as ſtubble. And though ye give your goods to the poor, and your bodies to be burnt, and do not believe in the light, and turn to the light, and walk in it, it is nothing; for ſo long as you do not walk in the light, ye know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Charity, which ſuffereth long, which envieth not, which vaunteth not it ſelf, puffeth not up, rejoyceth not in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rejoyceth in the truth. This ye are far from, who are in your envy, wrath, malice, perſecution, pleading for ſin, againſt perfection, and againſt the light which diſcovereth and makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt all ſin and uncleanneſſe; your profeſſion of God and Chriſt in word, when in works ye deny him, will not ſerve you; the Lord
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52821:7"/>
abhors all your profeſſion and hypocriſie. Therefore give over your deceitful diſſembling, and turn to that which rips you up, and layes you naked and bare before the Lord God, from whom you cannot hide your ſelves. And to the light of Chriſt come to be tryed and ſearched, the tryed ſtone which layeth judgement to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet, for Sion is redeemed through Judgement, and her converts with righteouſneſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give over deceiving of your ſouls; for he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous, even as he is righteous. And all ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the light condemns: And if your hearts condemn you, God is greater. Therefore do not deceive your ſouls, but ſearch and try your own ſelves, for if ye know not that Chriſt is in you, ye are Reprobates. And ſo all forms, and all profeſſions try your own ſelves, and to the light come to be tryed, and there you will ſee your rotten profeſſion will be too light: and do not deceive your ſouls, but now ye have time prize it, while it is called to day; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and do not forget God, leſt he tear you to pieces, while there be none to deliver you.</p>
            <p>And this is in love to all your ſouls, which ye ſhall eternally wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be truth. If ye turn to the light which is my witneſſe, and if ye hate the light, and turn from the light, the light is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And when the books of conſcience is opened, and all Judged out of them, then ſhall that witneſſe of God in you witneſs me, that this is love to your ſouls. And ſo whether ye hear or forbear, I have cleared my conſcience, and the Lord is clear of your blood.</p>
            <p>And your foundation and bottom I know and comprehend, but the Rock which ye know not ſhall break you to pieces, though ye have the outward writings and declaration which was ſpoken from another ſtate, and condition then ye are in. And theſe words ye take and make your own, when as ye are in another condition, and of another ſeed, then that which the promiſe is to. For it is not to ſeeds, as to many, but to one ſeed, which is Chriſt the light, and corner-ſtone, which ye builders refuſeth, &amp; yet ye account it railing to be called Theeves and Robbers, though ye have nothing but what ye ſteal from others. Ye take Moſes words, who was a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, ſent to bring Iſrael the ſeed of God out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and ye who are the Egyptian task-maſters with his words
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52821:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keeps the ſeed in bondage. To Moſes ſtate ye never came, which brings out of the houſe of darkneſs, you who denies the light, and yet you will profeſs Moſes word. Now let that of God in all your conſciences, which is juſt and equall, judge whether ye be not theeves and robbers in this, yea, or nay?</p>
            <p>And ye take the Prophets words which received the word from the Lord, which the Lord ſpoke to them; and ye profeſſe theſe words, and ye ſlay the Prophet which the Lord promiſed to raiſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now ſee if ye be not the blinde guides and hopocrites in this, which Chriſt Jeſus cryed woe againſt, to them whom he found in the ſame ſteps as ye are in, who had Moſes and the Prophets words, which writ of him, and propheſied of him, but he told them they knew them not: For if they had known Moſes, and the Prophets, they would have known him. And ſo ye go beyond thoſe in Chriſts time, and exceed them in hypocriſie and deceit; for ye take Chriſt Jeſus his words which he ſpoke before he was offered up; and ſince he is riſen again, and ye profeſſe them, and with theſe words ye deny the light; which he hath ſaid he is the light, and which John, who was the faithfull witneſs, and more then a Prophet, witneſſed of him, which he witneſſed to be the greateſt that was born of women; and Chriſts teſtimony, and Johns teſtimony ye deny, who denies the light. And yet ye take theſe words, and profeſs them, and perſecute the light and life that ſpoke theſe words. Now to that of God in your Conſciences, which cannot bear falſe witneſſe nor lye, do I ſpeak; let all that try you, and examine you whether you do not exceed the Scribes and Phariſees, who crucified Chriſt Jeſus, who had writings of him, that he ſhould come, yet when he came, they did not know that it was he, and ſo they crucified him under the name of a Blaſphemer and Prince of Devils. But ye ſay and profeſſe that he is come, and profeſſe that that was he which they crucified, and ye profeſſe that he is riſen again, and yet ye perſecute and deny his light and teſtimony, where it is riſen and made manifeſt. Now ſee whether ye be not blinde indeed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52821:8"/>
when as ye go about to oppoſe, deny, and perſecute that which ye your ſelves profeſſe.</p>
            <p>Now ſee what a God this is ye ſerve, who keeps ye ſo blinde in your profeſſion, that ye perſecute thoſe who poſſeſſeth that which ye your ſelves profeſſe. Ye exceed all that ever went before you, that ever was read of, and yet ye are ſo blind, as ye do not ſee your ſelves. For thoſe whom ye perſecute and oppoſe, ye have nothing againſt them, but that they witneſſe and profeſſe, that which ye blinde hypocrites poſſeſſe, but knows nothing of. So ye make clean the outſide with an outward profeſſion, and a form, and an Image, and a likeneſſe, but your inſide is ſin, uncleanneſſe, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, envy, wrath, malice, ſtrife and perſecution; this is of the Devils Kingdome of ſin, and this is the inheritance and poſſeſſion which ye poſſeſſe. Though ye profeſſe a God and a Chriſt from Records without you, yet your poſſeſſion and inheritance is the Devils Kingdome of ſin. Let that of God in your conſciences, which is pure, now examine and try you, and ſearch you, and ſee if ye be not found in ſin and uncleanneſſe, and denies being free from ſin and perfection and purity; and plead for ſin and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdome, and yet profeſſe God and Chriſt. Oh that ever ye ſhould be ſo abominably blinde and fottiſh! Do ye look upon the pure and holy God, who cannot behold iniquity, with whom dwells no unclean thing, to be like your ſelves?</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe ye take the Epiſtles and writings of the Apoſtles to the Church of Chriſt, which is in God, and which is the houſe of God, the ground and pillar of all truth which is built upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus. And ye take the words which were written to theſe who were born of the immortal ſeed, to which the promiſe of God is; and ye who live in your ſin, and filthineſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, takes theſe words and profeſſeth them, and makes them your own, as though they were ſpoken to you when as ye never knew their condition nor the Apoſtles, which was their Miniſter, and begot them into the everlaſting truth by the immortal ingrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word of God.</p>
            <p>And this ye who denies the light which the Apoſtles preached, who was a Miniſter of the Spirit and not of the Letter.

            <p>But your day of lamentation and howling is coming upon you ye cannot eſcape; the righteous God hath found you out; the acceptable year of the Lord is proclaimed, and the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our God is come; and the Prince of the world is come to be judged; and the day of the Son of man is come, in which he is lifted up; and where he is lifted up he draws all men after him. Praiſes be to the living God for ever. And your Covenant with hell and death is diſanulled, and your refuge of lyes and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſwept away; the overflowing ſcourge is coming upon you. Therefore as ye love your ſouls give over your diſſembling and vain imaginations, and hypocriſie, and vain deceit, and ſee what ye have, and what ye know ye do enjoy in the light and in the life and in the power of the living God; for our Goſpel ſtands not in word, but in life and power. And he is manifeſt, who is the power of God unto ſalvation unto all that believe. And this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is not hid, but to thoſe that are loſt.</p>
            <p>Now if ye turn your minds to the light of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the light of the glorious Goſpel, ye will ſee that this Goſpel hath been hid from you, and from your profeſſion. But if ye wait in the light, then will ye come to know the power, and the power will raiſe the life. And he that walketh in the light ſhall not abide in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life.

And then your profeſſion in words, where you have neither bottom nor foundation, will not ſerve: for the ſword of the Lord is drawn, which cuts down all fruitleſſe trees and groundleſſe profeſſions; and your forms and covers is to be ripped off, and ye will be found naked, miſerable, and blinde.</p>
            <p>Therefore now ye have time prize it, and harden not your hearts while it is called to day, but repent and turn to the Lord, who waits to be gracious, who will not give his honour to another, but will be inquired of.

            <p>Now all people try and ſee your teachers, whether all your Prieſts of England be not witneſſes contrary to John: He bears witneſſe to the light that lightens every man that cometh into the world; and they bear witneſſe againſt the light, and ſay he doth not inlighten every one that cometh into the world: And tells people they muſt look after them for means and ordinances, and ſo blinds poor people, and keeps them in ignorance and darkneſſe. But all people as ye love your own ſouls ſearch into the Scriptures, and try them by the Scriptures which ye call the Word, and your rule to walk by, and you ſhall finde them the deceivers and the Antichriſts and falſe Prophets, which they tell you ſo much of, that ſhould come in the latter dayes. John ſaith, Many falſe Prophets
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52821:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are gone into the world. Now try your teachers by this, and ſee whether they be not in the world, not ſeparated from the world, but draws from the light, which ſeparates from the world, and leads out of the world, but they witneſſe againſt the light, and pleads for ſin, and for the Kingdome of Antichriſt, which is of the world. And John ſaith, this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds are evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither bringeth he his deeds to the light leſt they ſhould be reproved; but he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt whether they be wrought in God. Now all poor people, ſee whether theſe be not the falſe Prophets which are entred into the world, which draws from the light, which is the worlds condemnation? And whether theſe be not the deceivers and Antichriſts which John ſpeaks of, which are entred into the world? which doth not confeſſe Jeſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, but doth deny the light, and doth perſecute and call them deceivers and falſe Prophets, which do witneſſe him come in the fleſh, and walks in the light which he hath enlightened them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Theſe they ſtock, and priſon, and cauſe to be beat in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, as all did that went before them, which ever perſecuted the righteous ſeed, who denies the light. The ſame John which ſaith, falſe Prophets and Antichriſts and deceivers are gone into the world; ſaith, Theſe things have I written unto you concerning them that ſeduce you; but the annointing which ye have received of him abideth in you; and yee need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth and is no lye; and even as it hath taught you ye ſhall abide in him, 1 John 2.26, 27. Now all people, ſee who be the falſe Prophets, whether John, and they who witneſſe the anointing, or your teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which draws from the annointing. Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, I am come a light into the world; that whoſever believeth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs. This ſame Chriſt ſaith in Mat. 7. Beware of falſe Prophets which comes to you in ſheeps clothing; but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ravening wolves; by their fruits ye ſhall know them. Now try your teachers by this Scripture, and ſee whether they have not been cloathed all this while with the ſheeps cloathing, the Saints cloathing, the words and a profeſſion of Chriſt. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52821:11"/>
now when the ſheep comes who knows his voice and will not follow ſtrangers, ſuch as they; Now ſee if they do not appear outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ravening wolves; what they were before inwardly their fruits do make them manifeſt: therefore let that Scripture try them. The ſame Chriſt Jeſus ſaith unto the diſciples, who came unto him privately on the Mount of Olives, Mat. 24. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you, for many ſhall come in my name, ſaying I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many. Now try your teachers, and ſee if they have any thing but a name, and a profeſſion of Chriſt, who draws from the light, when as Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, I am the light. And Chriſt ſaith, then ſhall they deliver you up and kill you, and ye ſhall be hated of all Nations for my names ſake. Now ſee whether theſe Prieſts of yours be hated and killed, which drawes from the light, or thoſe who witneſſe Chriſt Jeſus who is the light, which ſaith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, which ſhall deceive many. And try if they be not them, who ſaith, loe here is Chriſt, and loe there; but Chriſts command is, believe them not, for there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in ſo much, that if it were poſſible, they would deceive the very Elect. But the Elect, who dwells in the light which comes from Chriſt Jeſus, they cannot deceive, in it they are ſeen, and known, and tryed, and made manifeſt to be deceivers, to be the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Antichriſts, and with the light which comes from Jeſus they are condemned with the world, and turned from withall the children of light. Therefore poor people, who are out of the light, you they do deceive. But thoſe whoſe minds are turned to the light and abides in the light they cannot deceive. And Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith, woe unto you when all men ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their fathers of the falſe Prophets, Luke 6.26. Now try them by Scripture, and ſee whether this woe be not upon them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not of the falſe Prophet. And Peter ſaith 2 Pet. 2. But there were falſe Prophets among the people. Now try them by that Chapter, and ſee whether theſe be not the falſe Prophets which denies the light which comes from Chriſt Jeſus, their Lord that bought them, and through covetouſneſs ſhall they with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed words make merchandize of you. Let that in your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now try and ſearch them by the Scripture. The ſame Apoſtle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52821:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the foregoing Chapter ſaith, ye have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn; and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts; knowing this firſt, that no propheſie of the Scripture is of any private interpretation, for the propheſie came not in the old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpoke is they were moved by the holy Ghoſt. Now ſee whether Peter, and thoſe that draws to the light be the falſe Prophets, or them that denies the light and hates it. Read the 2 Tim. and the 3. Chap. Try them by that Scripture, and ſee if they be not found them that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of there, having a form of godlineſſe, but denying the power, and he ſaith, from ſuch turn away. And ſee if they be not of this ſort which creeps into houſes and calls them Churches, when as the Apoſtle ſaith the Church is in God, and leads captive ſilly women laden with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now ſee and try your teachers by theſe Scriptures, and ſee what ye have learned of them all your dayes, that ye have followed them, what you can witneſſe of God or of Chriſt made manifeſt in you: nay, that in your conſciences will confeſſe that ye do not know this outward Scripture, which makes them manifeſt to be the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and deceivers, who draws from the light which gave forth the Scriptures. Even in the knowledge of the outward letter you are blinded by them. Read the 2 Pet. 3.3. ſee if you and they be not found thoſe ſcoffers walking after your own luſts, ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming, and read Jude, and try them, and ſee if they be not found there under the woe that he ſpeaks of, whether they run not greedily after gifts and rewards, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the gain-ſaying of Corah. And let that in your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which is of God, which reſpects no mans perſon, read and examine thoſe Scriptures, and try them, and ſee whether they be not erred from the light, and ſo draws others from the light, which is and ever was the Saints teacher, and ever ſhall be; from which all the holy men of God ever ſpoke, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt, and from which light all the Scriptures were given forth, which theſe deceivers takes into their mouths, and draws people from the light that gave forth the Scriptures, and ſo betrayes their ſouls. Therefore all people, to the light in your
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52821:12"/>
conſciences which Chriſt Ieſus hath enlightened you withall; turn within, keep to it, and go not forth, nor look not outward; and it will let you ſee the deceivers and betrayers of your ſouls. And if you be faithfull and obedient to it, it will let you ſee your Saviour. Falſe Prophets is in the world, and Antichriſts is in the world, and the deceivers is of the world, and thoſe that do not confeſſe Chriſt come in the fleſh, is of the world. But thoſe that dwells in the light, which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened them withal; this leads out of the world, out of the worlds wayes, faſhions, and cuſtoms; and this makes a ſeparation from the world; and this leads up to God. And this light is the condemnation of the world, and the condemnation of all the falſe Prophets and deceivers and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts which are in the world. And who is faithful and obedient to the light witneſſeth Chriſt made manifeſt, and come in the fleſh, and theſe are no Antichriſts. And theſe are they that goes forth to bear witneſſe againſt the falſe Prophets and Antichriſts which are in the world. And theſe are they that are ſtockt and beat, and impriſoned and perſecuted by thoſe which is of the firſt nature, which is Cains, who ſlew his brother, and this is of the world. And by this generation all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution; and it is our joy and rejoycing not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</p>
            <p>All poor people who are in the dark world, blinde, led with the blinde guides; beware and look where you are, leſt both you and they fall into the ditch. And try your leaders by the Scripture, who are pleading for ſin and tranſgreſſion, and telling you that you ſhall not be free from ſin, nor perfect while ye are upon earth. Now is that fulfilling which the Apoſtle Paul ſpoke of, 2 Tim. 3. And the perillous times are come, and woe unto you if ye do not hearken unto the warning of the Lord God, who calls unto you for repentance. And to return to the light of Chriſt Jeſus in your conſciences. And to turn from that ſort which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, having a form of godlineſſe but denying the power; of this ſort is your teachers, which are to be turned away from, which creeps into houſes, and leads ſilly women captive, and ſo keeps you ever learning, and tells you none can be perfect while they are here upon earth. And ſo they plead for ſin and againſt Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtles and Prophets, and all the holy men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52821:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God. For Chriſt ſaith, be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect, Mat. 5.28. And again, Chriſt ſaith unto the young man which asked him what he lacked yet, if thou wilt be perfect, ſell all that thou haſt, and give to the poor. And again, the Apoſtle ſaid, he preached wiſdome among them that are perfect. And when he parted with the Brethren he bid them be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, 1 Cor. 2.6. &amp; 2 Cor. 10.11. And your teachers tells you that you muſt never be perfect, but that you <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt ſin ſo long as you are upon the earth; and ſo they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Antichriſt and upholders of ſin, and the Devils Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Try them by the Scripture, and you ſhall finde them contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles, and not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gifts which he gave to the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, for the perfecting of the Saints, as ye may read Eph. 4.11, 12, 13. And the ſame Apoſtle went about warning every man in all wiſdome, that he might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Ieſus. Now ſee your leaders and teachers if they have not another ſpirit then Chriſt and the Apoſtles had; who makes it their trade to plead for ſin and againſt perfection, which all that ever were ſent of God preached and prayed for, as the Apoſtle did night and day, praying exceedingly that he might ſee their face, and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that which was wanting in their faith, 1 Theſſ. 3.10. And the Apoſtle Peter prayed that they might be perfect when they had ſuffered a while. And the Apoſtle ſaid, who was a miniſter of Chriſt, that the Scripture was given forth by inſpiration of God, that the man of God might be perfect: and here your teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are found to be denyers of the Scriptures, and not ſo much as Miniſters of the Letter; who pleads againſt it, &amp; the end it was given forth for: and ſo are found to be Miniſters of Antichriſt, and out of the practice of all that ever taught for God. Noah was a Preacher of righteouſneſſe, and he was a perfect man. Abraham was a friend of God, and God ſaid unto him walk before me, and be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and Lot was a juſt man, and the Lord delivered him. And Iob was a perfect and juſt man: And David ſaith, mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, Pſal. 37.37. And Solomon ſaith, that the upright ſhall dwell in the Land, and the perfect ſhall remain in it, Prov. 2.21. And again he ſaith, That the righteouſneſſe of the perfect ſhall direct his way, Prov.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52821:13"/>
11.5. Now all people ſearch the Scripture, and try theſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and betrayers of your ſouls; and let them be witneſſes againſt themſelves that they teach, nor you receive nothing of God from them; for whatſoever is of God in the leaſt meaſure is perfect. The firſt principle that comes from God is perfect; every perfect gift is from above, Jam. 1.17. And the Apoſtle ſaid, as many as be perfect be thus minded: and the Apoſtle ſaith again, we are glad when we are weak, and ye are ſtrong; and this alſo we wiſh, even your perfection, Phil. 3.15. And again he ſaith, Let us go on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection. Now ſee your blinde guides, whether they be not the Miniſters of the myſterie of iniquity, and under the dark pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who pleads for ſin, and againſt perfection; which all that were ſent of God preached for, and prayed for, and laboured for the perfecting of the Saints, and the perfecting holineſſe in the fear of the Lord, 2 Cor. 7.1. Eph. 12.</p>

               <p> That is Blaſphemy, and thy meſſage is for the Prince of darkneſſe, and thou art in the Land of darkneſs, and the ſhaddow of death, where thy light is darkneſſe, where thou art driven from the light into darkneſſe, under the curſe, ſeparted from God, under the power of the Prince of the Air, which rules in the children of diſobedience, and there thou ſhalt have thy portion. And he who is the meſſenger of the living God, who declares that which was from the beginning; which he had heard, which he had ſeen; and handled the word of life, which bears witneſſe unto the living God; this is the meſſage that he declares; that God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all, 1 John 1.

And thy actings doth not advantage, for thou treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the wrath of the Lord God will finde thee out, and the plagues of God thou ſhalt witneſſe, for they are thy portion.</p>

               <p> Them whom thou calls quakers doth utterly deny thee, and all of thy Principles, and all the Ranters is by us deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and your Practiſes we abhor. And in the eternall light which never changes do we ſee you and know you. And with that which was before the world was; do we try your ſpirits, and comprehend your bottom and foundation, and Race you out from the preſence of the Lord, and all who are of him; And in the dread and power of the living God, do we Judge and try you and your God, which is the God of the world and the Prince of the Air which now is come to be judged; and do judge and condemn both him and you into the Lake which burns. And this is from the quakers which you ſay is not yet come to you, but is from you ſeparated eternally.</p>
