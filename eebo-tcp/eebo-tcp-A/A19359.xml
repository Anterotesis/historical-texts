            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lastly I haue touched, (though not neere to the life) the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happines of this Iland in our Prince; A Prince whose vertues giue luster to his authority, and that authority to his actions; so as he needs not the pruiledge of his fortune, since all his performances are able to stande vpon their owne force, needing neither countenaunce nor power to giue them reputation. Amongest his vertues I haue showed his vprightnes, that lighted by that great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may bee free from all partialities. Thus haue I

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end of knowledge, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, for since we can looke vpon nothing that is not deriued from God, and that beareth not a testimonie of his power and goodnesse, gratitude must follow vnderstanding, if not to recompence, yet to witnesse the feelings of his benefits. From this consideration (louing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen) I haue presumed to offer you this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. We haue all fealt, I doubt not the mercy of God in this late happy and admirable alteration, and I hope not alone fealt it with our bodyes,
<pb facs="tcp:9169:4"/>
but our mindes; for to haue so great a benefit, from so great a power, rewardes the minde with such a satisfaction as earth cannot giue. What you haue thought, pardon mee though I presume to speake, since my end is not to challenge any superiority, but to preuent (if my end may bee as happy as my purpose) the incident diseases of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine prosperity. My proiect is then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this blessing, and not alone the blessing, but to oblige vs the more; the consideration by what vnexpected meanes, and how much beyond either the common course of things, or the strength of man it is effected. Next how free it is from all the inconueniences incident to the common altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or augmentations of Empires: and lastly since it is aboue the course of nature, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary disposition of things, being full of profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either daunger or former hazardes, that like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuine and supernaturall blessing wee entertaine and vse it. Thus farre goeth the scope of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, destinating my labours to bee the seruants of your memory, for which I desire no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, but your owne happy and iust procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, taking the aduenture of your acceptance, and leauing vnto you the glory of so great an action, as the due of those progressions that are performed with iust and vnspotted mindes.</p>
            <p>This realme hauing a long time laboured in the
<pb facs="tcp:9169:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preuention of dangers, and enioying an outwarde rather then inward peace, like a body that fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the health from Phisicke, and was of late yeares come to that weaknesse, as in a short space had she continued in her course her preuentions had prooued vaine. For the aduantage of others disagreement was by agreement taken from vs, our treasure spent, our souldiers of experience consumed, the subiects purse emptied, and in fine, like a shippe that had throwne out her goods to saue her carkasse, we floated with our liues rather repriued then saued.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, and in all this time, this realme resisted none of her griefes by a naturall course, which is by her owne strength, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather feathers then winges, neither the glory nor profit was hers, but our blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, was the medicine of our suspected constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is necessary I bring you thus farre backe (good Countrimen) aswell because man knowing nothing in his originall, cannot iudge singlie; but by coupling contrarieties, seeth the difference by the effects: as also feeling your prosperitie and from whence it commeth, you may loose the sight of no part of this blessing. Nowe may you perceiue the nature of it, and the greatnesse, that from a weakned &amp; almost breathlesse state, is come
<pb facs="tcp:9169:5"/>
to be the most opulent, strong and entire Empire of the world. What shall we call it? no naturall name can expresse it, it is a miracle; <hi>Take vp thy bedde and walke.</hi> It is a miracle in the cure, it is no lesse in the meanes; for if the marriages of Princes, the issue of Princes, the prayers of men, the plottes of our Enimies, or the Iealosies of greatnes, could haue hindered it, England had not beene happy. We had yet laboured vnder the burthen of a torne and dismembered kingdome. How much the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting these impediments, passeth the common course of nature euery Iudgement may easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne: but we haue yet but halfe the sight. A midst all these courses swaied by Ambition, and vniust Iealosies, behold our Prince, prouoked by al means; and by some where his patience might be called in question, suffering all, induring the plots of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against his right, his person against their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, he withstood all their hates with his loue, his loue to this his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try made him suffer his wrongs, and where the hot ambition of some Princes, would easily haue couered the inuading of this Kingdom, vnder the reuenging of his wrongs, and the feare of filling it with the horrible effects of ciuill wars was a curbe to his iust mislikes, choosing himselfe to feele wronge, rather then they should.</p>
            <p>Surely if we consider this truly, wee shall finde the obligation we are bound in to the diuine power, no
<pb facs="tcp:9169:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lesse stronge heere, then in the rest. For if the resisting wronge bee a warrant of nature to the simplest creatures, and that there is nothing more opposite to euery disposition; how much more in Kinges, vnto whome God hath giuen both power and authority to iudge and punish iniuries and wronges? So that for the good of this lande, he hath not alone resisted the prouocations of flesh &amp; blood, but a liberty, for a more pleasing colour and stronger excuse, no Prince euer had to make warre vpon another. Thus you see the straunge and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous passages of former times, from how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proceedings your safety is deriued, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold another part of your blessing. You buie not your peace, your plenty, your strength, your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, no it is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, for wheras your safties abroad might haue bin purchased, with a Prince that might haue line heauie vpon you at home, &amp; by exactions haue but excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged your burthens from your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to your hartes, you are blessed with one, that in his whole life, hath approued the happines of the subiect and the flourishing of his Kingdome to be his chiefe contentments. For otherwise, who would haue indured the slaunder of a iust title, the death of his friendes, the plots against his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but hee onely that valueth iustice and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preseruation aboue any humaine prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ambitious enticements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9169:6"/>
Wee haue now heard how much we are blessed and by how strange and extraordinarie meane, and more, that we enioy all this without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenince, either passed or to be discerned. Let vs then examine what the alteration and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this kingdome hath done. Insomuch as all changes are Earthquakes to a State, shaking the very foundation of gouerment; and augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and increases, are neuer vnaccompanied of present daungers, and future burthens. To exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this by history, behold the Auntients, where for the passing of simple lawes, the whole body of the common-wealth, laboured betweene life and confusion. And in those changes where reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and amendment bare the name, yet did they neuer alter without hazard, the medicine being as dangerous as the disease. How different is this from ours, where the Axeltree or vphold of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth being changed, we rather heard of it, then fealt it; or if we fealt it, it was the comfort of it. What vproare was there? what confusion? what surfet of the former gouernment brake out (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable accident of an Interraigne) what factions? what misorders of discontented and desperate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? but on the contrarie as men expecting a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a generall quietnes possessed the whole land, &amp; as it were inspired with the age to come, gaue ouer the care of their own mislikes to the generall redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
<pb facs="tcp:9169:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; all the different humours nourished either by former griefes, or this long expected day, grewe in an instant to be turned to the generall good, and to prepare an entertainement for the elected both by God and man, both by his title and vertues. In a worde, neuer was Prince receiued with so generall an applause, nor was there euer Prince that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued better of vs: for laying by the iustnesse of his owne title, the remembrance of his sufferings (which to another nature would haue beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an earning of this kingdome) the need we had of him, the testimonies giuen to the whole world of his abilities for gouernment, laying by these considerations, he hath beene yet content to acknowledge the loue of his subiects; &amp; not alone to acknowledge it in wordes, but to assure them of it, he hath not respected his priuate gaine, beyond their profits: To this end hath he abolished Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies &amp; other prerogatiues of the Crowne, rather then to let his subiects feele any greeuance, though he might haue kept them without any colour of mislike, being to him inheritances no exactions. But his loue to vs will not permit excuses, but on all sides sheweth he will performe the office of a King, without mingling it with the Iusts of man. But this is but one; on all sides appeare actions of the same quality; how hath he of late, to giue vs yet more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of his loue, taken offendors of the highest
<pb facs="tcp:9169:7"/>
nature out of the hands of Iustice and giuen them mercy? Whereno excuse, no priuate petitions, no not where mercy it selfe (being gouerned by her owne nature) could haue intreated it; For our sakes they liue, and for our sakes, against the rules either of lawe, iustice, or pollicie. Let vs behold these parts with a true consideration, and we shall finde neuer people had so infinite blessings laid before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For wheras it hath bin too common amongst some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to esteeme handsome colours good paiment for subiects: our Prince, hath not onely not held them good enough for vs, but euen iust reasons, if they haue any way seemed to concerne him more then his subiects, (though that which concerneth him, must them) haue bin laid by &amp; not respected. To be short, neuer was there Prince, that avowed al his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be grounded vpon a more vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which doth not onely represent vs this great blessing of ours more fully, but with all disburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs of all iealosies of partiality. For he that in all questions between himselfe &amp; the subiect, hath not spared himselfe, cannot betweene man and man be partiall, since all partialities are begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by self-loue. By this we may cleere the doubt of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi> since he is King of both, he is father of both, and (being equally charged by the King of Kings with both) owing vnto both one duty, he will giue vnto both one affection. But least I be called into question

for a proofe, behold his former gouernment, where his vprightnes had that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with him, as neither the generality, nor the custome, could make him yeeld to the common defence &amp; nourishing factions by names, euer protesting him highest in his opinion, that was owner of a good life, aswell as a great name. So that to be knowne for an honest man, was more then to beare the sir-name of <hi>Steward.</hi> He that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in how contrary a course the example of that kingdom might haue nourished him, &amp; how the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of their Clannes had brought this integrety to the suspition of a vice, will ask no more instances for cleering all suspitions, that foreknowledge shall neuer bar merit. For since he defended his yongest years, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most receiued vice of his countrey, we must expect in this riper time the habituall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Regall vertue.</p>
            <p>Now to the increase of Empire, which though it carieth the face of the happiest alreration, yet being an alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can hardly escape defects. For not only the nature of all humaine accidents approues it, all things being deliuered to vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixt, we being not to be trusted, either with good or ill alone, separated, such are our frailties &amp; weaknes, presumption or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, growing mightie if fed with either fortune single. But more particularly to illustrate the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences of the increase of kingdomes, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon examples are either by power or ambition in one
<pb facs="tcp:9169:8"/>
body, or by necessity compelled to offend defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely in another: Both are by conquest, whose vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent effects leaue for euer an equall mistrust both in Prince and subiect, an humor of that fatall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as nothing but bloud and oppression followeth. What shall I say now of our encreased domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that haue made vs terrible to the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any terror to our selues: But so happy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent meanes are the long disioyned partes of this Kingdome, brought to an inseparable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement. And if the long receiued Axiome of pollicie shall bee beleeued (that kingdomes must bee maintained by such meanes as they were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) vnto what an excellent necessity are we tyed? marriage was the meanes, a friendshippe of that high nature, that God himselfe daineth to bee a witnesse of this indissoluble knot; we must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it with the neerest resemblance, that is by a constant friendship and loue. Verely I beleeue it impossible for man to thinke, how so infinite a blessing to both sides could haue beene accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by any other so easie and euen conditions. For neither side sought others friendship, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming past the boundes of the reputation of a nation, there were no threates, no violence, no swordes drawne of neither side. So that as if God would prouide to satisfie euen our most distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and sicke affections, least such sparkes might
<pb facs="tcp:9169:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inflame this great action, neither nation can charge other with needing, or yeilding, or giuing way to other. So are they met, so are they prepared as they shall scarcely need eyther time or custome the vniters of flesh to assist their incorporating, since they are by the diuine wisdome, so knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it resembleth a new creation. When wee shall haue beheld on all sides the cleerenes of this benefit, how all things answere one another, and all without the least signe of any inconuenience or daunger, what place is left for suspition? or if not for suspition, was there euer any benefit possessed so entirely? who is there now that shall bring in questions of seperation and be beleeued? since we may easily determine all such differences, arise out of the malignity of such dispositions, not the cause. It is most true if you will (happy Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) that the streames of the common wealth and people runne contrary (for flourishing states haue commonly dissolute inhabitants, poore countreies honest people) this is because we borrowe our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours from our fortunes not discourses, being good or bad, according to the floud or ebbe of our estates. But if you will be owners of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, you will proceed with more aduised consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and iudge of your Councellors as well as Councels. If they tell you of the pouerty of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, examine whether our wealth shall not come
<pb facs="tcp:9169:9"/>
from the addition of their Kingdome, for at once we receiue from them the stopping of our vnnece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary warres, and the vse of trafficke. How infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue we beene consumed in the vpholding the low countryes, which we were enforced to vse for a stillt to vphold the body of our state. Shall not a naturall limme, nay another body, that doth not onely rescue vs, but becometh vs, be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of entertaining? There is none of vs that worne with the trauailes of the world and time, but would buy a new strength and youth at any rate: Be now ashamed to be taken with this selfe-loue, or els value the new youth and strength of our commonwealth. Since gratitude and the knowledge of benefits, cometh from the looking back vpon former times, let vs not be ashamed to remember times past: How was the wealth of our lande decayed? how full of doubt stood wee? with what Prince or state durst we enter league, that was able to be our enimies? nay to such a state wee were come, as wee were as much afraid of peace as warres, and durst trust nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At once to bee deliuered of these, without feeling any alteration but the ease, what doth it not deserue? Without feeling any alteration, for what hath hapened in this change that we can complaine of? Warres are ceased, peace is entreated on all sides, oppressions are abolished, in the meane time, the Prince exercising al those vertues that may make
<pb facs="tcp:9169:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the subiect happy, his Iustice, his mercy, his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his benignity. And whereas euen the best Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, haue thought it sufficient to exercise certaine generall vertues, who is there that could demaund particular fauours of any kind, and hath beene sent away empty? Truth cannot be flattery, and that which so many can wittnes ought not to be suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Not alone the deseruers of him haue tasted of his bounty, but the assisters of the gouerment past, haue founde it as sure a plea to be able to proue, they serued his predecessor loyally, as those nearest vnto himselfe. What shall wee gather of this? but that this Kingdome is beheld of him, with the same care that his others are, and that the seruants of it are as deare to him. A rare example of equity, since in the succession of Princes wee see nothing more ordinary, then that the fauour of the seruants dieth with the master. After this assurance to doubt his partiality, and that the number of his auncient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance will rob the English of places and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, cannot come but from a minde, that speaketh his owne vices in anothers name. For since wee cannot Iudge the thoughts but by the actions, and that all his actions haue bene found of another nature, from whence issue these suspitions but out of their owne bosomes? Shall it bee thought an answere that the old seruants of his Scottish Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue beene rewarded? the same minde would
<pb facs="tcp:9169:10"/>
haue pronounced ingratitude if they had beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded. For who is hee that censureth honestly, and houldeth not this an argument for our incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, who being in the beginings of our times, cannot knowe him but by his vsage of others, who hauing spent for him in a time of lesse expectation, &amp; so lesse to be suspected, their youthes &amp; strengths, how could any indifferent iudgment hould them vnworthy of rewardes? It hath then rewarded vs in them, for the example hath giuen vs encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the very food of the soule, and the greatest prouocation of vertue. Shall wee yet doubt and desire more assurances? behould euery man that hath not had a more capitall fault, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a stranger to him, holdeth the same place hee possessed before? from the highest to the lowest, yea euen the seruantes of the person and house of the last Prince are his. An vnusuall satisfaction and so to be esteemed, and an action of a Prince, that cannot suspect that in another, that hee findeth not in himselfe.</p>
            <p>Can there now be such another testimonie of his vprightnesse, when by the changing the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of this state, by another disposition, would haue bin thought so important a part, as he should by the alteration not onely haue rewarded others, but assured his owne person. But from the generall consent of his entrance, hath he framed the rest of
<pb facs="tcp:9169:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his proceedings; he found vs then, ioyfull, loyall, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing subiects, and according to that demeanure hath he vsed vs: which if we do not acknowledge, and acknowledge in making the same vse of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to vs, we are vnworthy of so happy a gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But yet saith some body, how can it be that the number of that nation shall not shorten the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the <hi>English?</hi> If they brought men without a kingdome it were an obiection, or if men vnder this Prince must not bring somewhat besides a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. They haue a Countrey of their owne that yeeldeth so much plenty, as their plentie breedeth their want; for concerning the necessaries for mans life no countrey is better furnished: and for wealth, the happinesse of their latter gouernment hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such testimonies of encrease, as already they possesse enough both to defend themselues and to free their countrey from the imputation of sterility. But this is not all, the number of able men is not a discommoditie, for how commeth it (thinke you) that all the Princes of Christendome thinke well of our friendship, but because wee haue many able men: So that either it must be confessed, enuy is better food then safety, or else that two offices in one hand is not so important, as two kingdomes vnder one Scepter, vnder one Lawe, becomming one body. Neither doth the commodity of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny able men end thus, but as it bringeth reputation
<pb facs="tcp:9169:11"/>
and safety from abroade, so ease and wealth at home. For when this multitude of able men shall disburthen the officers of their too much businesse, they shall not excuse vnder-briberies by their ouer many emploiments, and so shall the poore subiect escape paying fees vpon fees, and sometimes dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and trebble briberies.</p>
            <p>By this time it is apparant, that neither the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie nor multitude of our connexion can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall, since it is prooued they will be the onely instruments of our enriching; and that this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude bringeth a happy necessitie for the redressing the griefes of the greatest part of our people. Let vs then come to the beholding this happinesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which since wee finde so infinitely full of blessings as the sharpest sight cannot discerne any inconuenience or future perill, what shall I call it? but a diuine and miraculous blessing of God. Now should we bring vnto this great benefit our sicke and corrupt affections, though neuer so well couered vnder the names of foresight or preuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall we not worthily deserue punishments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to our fauours? Let this learne vs (good countrimen) our duties to the Common-wealth, whether we ought not to bring our bodyes, but to cary our mindes, for to bring priuate driftes to the publique busines, is an impietie of the highest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What shall we say now to their imaginations
<pb facs="tcp:9169:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that hold our vnity most profitable if it were inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, but if the Kings issue should faile, say they, and seuerall titles disvnite vs, then would their neighbourhood be more dangerous: for by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating being growne more riche, they would be more able to affront vs. How doe these striue to bury benefits with suspitions? they haue forgot who ended our warres without miserable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who hath enforced <hi>Ireland</hi> to lay downe armes, who hath made vs capable of forreigne leagues without buying them, but beholding all these and many more both defences and benefits as things past, and now in their owne possessions they are as weary of their assisters, as they were of their feares. Or els being people of such a condition as finde most contentment in troubled and doubtfull states, because setled and flourishing are the lights that discouer ill affected and ill disposed persons, they desire to shroud themselues still in the darkenesse of confused and perplexed gouernments. But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere their obiection without them, how vnlike is this to the English stile, that lately durst not thinke beyond one life, and now out-runneth foure, and by Gods grace many more. And are there foure betweene this feare and vs, and is it yet a feare? It is no preuention but an impious forecast; for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide beyond probability, armeth our imaginations against the will of God. A strange office for man
<pb facs="tcp:9169:12"/>
to vndertake, since if it were a part of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heauen and Earth, and all their generations, reuolutions and changes, and euen God himselfe were idle and vnnecessary powers. But still we insist vpon our wealth and their inriching, which either we mistake or vnderstand not. For if we haue the aduantage of wealth we shall hold it, for since they neither can nor will demaund any thing but by way of commerce or traffique, the long and great concourse of trading to the cheife city of our Iland, will sucke vp still the greatest part of our weath. But might it be that their wealth would be encreased, the publique good purchaseth not losse but profit, for by the dispersion the state findeth the people more able and more industrious, from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth the increase of traffique to the subiect, and of custome to the Prince, the most honest and easy way of enriching the Kings coffers. Not vnlike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this obiection is the mislike that they would lay vpon the disposition of the people that because they haue in times past giuen way to their priuate mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and drawne priuate quarrells to multitudes; that wealth vnto such natures being like oyle to fire, might drawe their fewds from a sparke to a flame, and so inwrappe vs in an vnnecessary warre. But they are much deceiued in the generall operation of wealth that suspect that, since if there be any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in riches more then our opinion hath forced, it
<pb facs="tcp:9169:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this that it ordinarily maketh ill men good citizens. For it is not the goodnesse of lawes, their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor good effects in generall, that maketh all men obserue them, but that their wealth hath no other defence, so doe they loue Iustice and her obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of their owne particular, there being no way to make them conceiue that foundation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie <hi>(suum cui<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> tribuere)</hi> to yeeld euery man his owne, except they haue of their owne to make the instance. But were these probable, are wee not to prouide first against those that threaten vs neerer? is not the first and most waighty consideration of a States man to preuent the inuasion of forraine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? and can there be any other course for them, then by our leauing matter of -discontentment amongst our selues. Against outward inuasions na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath cared; we are enuironed by the sea, and so knit together both by religion, language, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whatsoeuer els can take away difference; as vnlesse we breed disagreeing affections, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble. Neither can we nourish these vnlesse we will contradict Heauen it selfe. Behold how we are ioyned, God, Nature, &amp; Time, haue brought vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and so miraculously if we obserue the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of time, as me thinketh the very words after the consummation of a marriage, shall not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly vsed, <hi>Those whome God hath ioyned together, let no man seperate.</hi> Vnto whose iudgement now,
<pb facs="tcp:9169:13"/>
will not these obiections seeme light, if wayed with this consideration. Lawes and pollicie can fight and ouercome inwarde inconueniences, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Statist, is aboue any of these discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, especially in Monarchies, where ciuill matters are easily redressed by reason of the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of the Prince, and that the people are not strong enough to fauour their owne imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions if they come in question. But against out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inuasions invited by inward diuisions, there is no cure but preuention, for being once on foote, wisdome may see the fault, but armes must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. To assure you this is no idle warning, let vs both examine the states of our neighbours, their dispositions, their former actions, and then what is likely to leaue matter of discontentment and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion amongst vs. First for <hi>France</hi> were it one man, former fauours might warrant vs, but kingdomes can dispence with ingratitude, therefore wee must forget their distresse, and looke for the common disposition of their prosperitie, which hath euer leueld at the keeping vs downe.</p>
            <p>To this end haue they alwaies held correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they haue vsed for their onely refuge, to escape the <hi>English</hi> preparations. So that if we shal close this past their entrance; we haue taken away their first and safest defence. For now all questions must bee decided within their owne
<pb facs="tcp:9169:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
entrailes, where how so euer they speed, they must be loosers; for though the euents of armes bee doubtfull, yet the deciding place is certaine of losse. Now for <hi>Spaine</hi> vnto whose ambitions wee haue euer beene an impediment, both in our aides to <hi>France,</hi> and the Lowe Countries, though we feele not the gratitude of these, yet must wee prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the mislike of the other. For by most natures reuenge is preferred before recompence, as the more profitable qualitie: therefore must wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide not onely against their ambitions, but mislikes, which double excitation nothing can pacifie but our owne strengths. But it may be the iealosies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> will cleere these dangers; let vs not borrow a defence out of their humors, when we may haue one of our owne, nor can wee trust to it, since hopes and feares doe equally quench contentions, so that if they haue no other impediment but themselues they will (question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) respit their owne mislikes, vntill they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken order with vs. In the meane time we search not enough the Spanish pollicy, who beginneth his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts thorough diuisions and factions, which if he espie, hee prosecuteth dangerously, for by his strength in <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> he searcheth all kindes of dispositions, which if not sound, he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at his deuotion. To make perticulars sound, wee must begin with the generall; when we haue laide
<pb facs="tcp:9169:14"/>
our foundation strong, and past the shaking of our enimies, we take away the prouocations both of the Temptor &amp; Tempted against their religion, let our religion be opposed, in respect of whose strength and reputation we ought to be more then moued, since our vnitie in bodies to our already vnited mindes, will make the reputation of our religion so strong, as they that put on the aduerse, for feare and in pollicie, shall neither shame nor feare to vse their owne consciences.</p>
            <p>Shall wee see now out of what matter our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can worke dissention, there is neither ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor discontentment amongst our great men, nor burthens vpon the people, lawes haue their due course, and purge the vaines of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, from vnnaturall stoppings and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It can then be no other, then in the disposing of our new body, from which we may take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the happiest Empire that euer was. <hi>Plato</hi> to illustrate the strength of friendship bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth so much of Poetrie as to tell a tale that the body of man was first rounde, and whilest hee enioyed that forme was doubly furnished of all the Organes and abilityes of man, after, abusing his strength the Gods diuided him and left him but the halfe of that hee was; but yet with a power (as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other halfe which is a perfect freind, not differing in resemblance) he might againe enioy his
<pb facs="tcp:9169:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first strength and happines. England hath found her other halfe, shee is now doubly furnished with the strength of a Kingdome, she hath foure armes, foure leggs, two harts (made one) two powers, and double forces.</p>
            <p>What can make vs now so vnnaturall, as to doubt of our restored strength? or by what rule will sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition be tryed? If lawes and ordinances bee called and rightly called the soule of the common-wealth, they must not be begotten by ourappetite: for then they can neither be diuine in their operation nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in their continuance; if we confesse it, and appeale to Iudgment, Iudgment trieth all things of this nature by the consent of these three vnuariable rules, namely Conscience, Reason and Example, as those that giue lawes their true essences. For consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reconcileth our humane lawes to our diuine, in so much as all lawes that take not them for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, cannot be honest, and so not durable. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shapeth them against all assaultes which cannot be without making them profitable to all.</p>
            <p>Lastly Example assisteth the weaknes of Reason with the sight of former successes, in so much as the strength of humaine reason, is but to deuise and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without triall ariue any nearer the end then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. Then to examine it by conscience: Is there not a necessity of mutuall helpe imposed vpon man? and haue we freed our selues of infinite troubles and
<pb facs="tcp:9169:15"/>
is there not a duty belonging to the meanes? Doth a Nation not differing in any part from our selues, full of strength, able men, of so important a scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, offer her selfe with open armes to embrace vs, and can we thinke of another entertainment besides a louing and euen embracement? If the offences or violences of Kingdomes, alloweth vs, first to ouercome, then to subiect and tye them with thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doth loue, freenesse, amity, brotherlike regard require the like vsage? either we were wronge before, are now, or confound merit and iniuries. In a word, were there no other motiue but our Prince, who would not be ashamed to refuse such a <hi>Medium.</hi> since his bloud is of both nations his minde so iust to all nations, and that his vertues haue already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed all obiections: what conscience is there that hasteneth not to this combination, not onely for a quiet as compelled, but for ioy as the due of so noble and glorious a performance.</p>
            <p>Now let vs see the triall of reason, this Ilande is happily come within the circle of one Diadem, not by conquest, nor by weaknes, nor for protection, but are drowne together by the vertue of an vnited blood, and made one mans Kingdome by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py coniunction of the royall blood of both nations. And is that blood growne one, and shall not the Kingdomes growe one? It is reasons office, not onely to bringe the will and the desire together, but
<pb facs="tcp:9169:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the way to examine the will, from what right he desires, how iustly, and to what end. By this meanes all parts haue satisfaction or ells the reason disclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the employment. We shall neuer get reason then to goe of this errand, for wee haue no right to the holding it by a diuided title, nor is there iustice in couering an vnequality in a title, nor hath the end, any other soundnes then the deuise of some sicke affection. For if there were some great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in our powers, power might sway it, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would make the weaker yeild to necessity: if the Prince were either by bloud or affection of one side, the other were to light, but hauing neither strength nor right to a superiority, how can it belong vnto vs? Now if this be apparant, were it in our power to bynde them to vs, by some vndername, how standeth it with the pollicy of a state to leaue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Idle men, for since our industry hath euer an eye vpon our owne good wee must either interest them in the gaines, or wee must expect cold endeauours. For nature hath giuen vs abilityes for our vse and preseruation, which though our reason perswadeth vs to vse for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, yet neuer for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good without including our owne perticular. But it may be it will be answered, let their industries be spent vpon their owne soyle, and so shall ours and wee will craue nothing from them. Who seeth not in this answere either a willfull or ignorant folly?
<pb facs="tcp:9169:16"/>
that forgetting their neernes, the daunger of their mislikes, the gappe for seditions and plotts to get entrance, we reckon them as a people that concerne vs not. No, no, they must haue a hande in our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, our peace is theirs, our florishing theirs, our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of all kindes theirs, in so much as if they be not thus farre interessed in these, and their loues so fastned to vs, as to ouercome all temptations, wee must expect none of these, so shall they or we, if we preuent not all enticements be wooed; since forraine forces are too weake to craze our strong constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without euill Iarres. Lastly if wee looke for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents and examples to strengthen our resolutions, neuer were two Kingdomes inuited by so stronge and forcible meanes to become one, and reiected it. Contrariwise, Spaine and France were neuer abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchies vntill the first of seauen Kingdomes became one, and Normandy and Brittaine were annexed to the crowne of France; which before were vnder other lordes. The deuiding a Kingdome into petty principalities prepareth it to bee swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a more vnited power. So standeth Italy at this day, that liueth not by her owne strength, but by the Iealosies of her neighbours: yet was shee once Mistresse of the world, and so would be againe (saith one of their authors) were she re-united and vnder one scepter. But why seeke I forrain examples when wee haue one of our owne so neare vs? Wales

is Englished, a country whose riches did not woe vs, nor her power, nor the fertility of the soyle; but the discommodities that we might receiue by them whilest they were held as Aliens, beeing matter to feed discontented or ambitious plottes, this was the furthest and onely aduantage we expected, which since it lay within the power of our incorporating to cure, and that nature had performed halfe the worke, with the alliance of countreys so neerly knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon one continent, wee performed. Successe hath followed, a warrant for the like occasion, but this is more like vs then that, a greater prouocation, wee differ not in language (a signe that God euer meant to haue vs one Kingdome;) and for the other conueninences of our match, as power, wealth, larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of territories, reputation of a Kingdome, ability in men, there is no comparison. That the world is possessed by many lords, and that the great empires that grew in her minority, crushed themselues with their owne weight, cannot in one reason be better comprehended (mee thinketh) then that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of scituation, clymate and disposition, could not giue power, to the imperiall country, to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize her conquests, they could not make them themselues. For it is lawes and customes and euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in capicity of offices and dignities, that can make countries loue one another truely, for so they doe as it were beget one another, and become flesh
<pb facs="tcp:9169:17"/>
of flesh, and bone of bone. For want of this it hath beene in the power of priuate men, to shake an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that could not haue moued a Kingdome, and for want of this, haue Empires beene enforced to hould subiected countries by garrisons, and by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties waies, so disagreeing from nature, as their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath depended meerly vpon fortune, and an externall reputation, which neuer indureth a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper without a downefall, nor is euer sicke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destruction. For recouerable diseases are onely in naturall bodyes, which these being opposite to, must depend onely vpon force. In the meane time, how much the expence of treasures, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall doubts wee haue of such countries exceedeth the aduantage, we may easily discerne, if we behold but Spaine, whose many dispersed Kingdomes haue beene such a burthen to them, and haue drawne them, into so many inconueniences, as his West Indies, and great encrease of possessions lately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that crowne, haue not bin able to defend him from the extreamest wants, insomuch as his designes haue oftner stood still for want of mony and men, then many smaller Kingdomes. Had it beene now thinke you in his power to haue made them all Spanish and within the limits of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, vpon the condition to haue called all Spaine, and but one nation, would hee not haue thought it an excellent exchange? Doubt it not since hee had
<pb facs="tcp:9169:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at once beene deliuered of those charges and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that make his possessions a paine, and weaknes rather then a strength, being like a monster of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hauing a body without bloud inough, hath his limmes withered and feeble being a great bulke, drowned in his owne proportion. All forced go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerments must bee momentary in so much as they leaue out the will and desire of man, which onely can beget continuance. For an instance behold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her-selfe, who driueth at none of her endes ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically, but emorapping her driftes in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall desires of her creatures, hath her purposes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not as hers, but as their owne. So must the aduised Polititian proceed, if he intendeth to giue either a goodly or substantiall forme to his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship; for though man can inforce other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beyond their willes, yet the will of man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reason to direct it which hath a freedome and eminencie in her nature, must therfore be wrought by perswasions, not enforcements, the onely means to bring her to obedience, and to yeelde to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of others. I haue gone thus farre beyond my purpose (louing countrimen) to free you of all suspitions, insomuch as the soule of man, is no sooner cured of any great infirmitie, but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine certaine dregges behinde of doubts and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions, which I hope these fewe considerations will cleere, not as they are mine, but as they are
<pb facs="tcp:9169:18"/>
truthes, though at this time, (vnto an aduersary) I cannot complaine of my weakenesse, for being the champion of right I doubt not of the successe of <hi>Dauid.</hi>

            <p>You haue now then the sight of this great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which approacheth you so full of infinite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesses, so pure and vncommixt with the common fortunes of the worlde, as you may laye by all thoughts, but such as are apt to prepare you fit to receiue so gratious an assurance of Gods fauour, and of gratitude though not answerable, yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to your powers. In the meane time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the goodly time before you, so cleere and calme as there is not so much as matter for cloudes or stormes left to breed on, (the originall of the happinesse of a common-wealth) for then onely are the inward motions of gouernment made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when there ariseth neither feares nor dangers from abroad, since those times are often so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they are not onely forced to make vse of the diseases of the time and people, but also to praise them, the forerunner of the downefall of a state. Which you shall easily prooue if you search the ruines of the ancient Empires, where (towards their end) vices went for vertues, and the greatest corruptions were the greatest merits. But our State is of another nature, it cannot growe old and doate, because it had no infancie or youth; wee builded
<pb facs="tcp:9169:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not our foundation out of a little, and increased it after by the sworde, we are no purchasers, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritours, and inheritours of a State, that commeth to vs strong and flourishing, so doe wee want those shiftes and by-courses, which come in with necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which make such states in time suffer shipwracke both by iust and naturall reasons. For hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by oppression, it standeth with Iustice that they loose so: and it is infallible, that people gotten vp by indirect meanes, though the present gaine mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them insensible of it, yet it leaueth in them the example of the corruption; and being like creatures bred out of putrifaction, they liue no longer then there remaineth such matter to feed on, but are after ouerthrowne by some aduerse power, or els turning head vpon themselues, are the authors of their own destruction. But you freed of all these, shall haue a happy leasure to view ouer your owne inwarde parts of the Common-wealth, and being hindered by no new doubts, may search, medicine and heale, all olde griefes, which not alone the time permits, but the Prince warrants, aleach chosen by God to make a new time setled in an instant, such as the power of Iustice and an vpright distribution, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther testimonie of Gods gratious fauour vnto vs. For beeing strangers though not by birthe, yet by personall knowledge, and the commerce of stran gers, warranting almost a partiality to our countrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:9169:19"/>
it is onely the worke of such a King, to alter nature by the force of wisdome. So hath his iust proceedings wrought vpon vs, that neither side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to charge him with leaning more to one side then another, neither side hath cause to mistrust him, another doore at which Partialitie often ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Will you know now what we haue escaped? the being begotten by a diseased father, for this time being the father of the succeeding, had it constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beene corrupted by partiality, the after-ages would for euer haue felt it, which would haue beene so much the more dangerous, because as in naturall bodies, hereditarie diseases are aboue the skill of the Phisitian, so would these of the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But ours that is to be directed by a Prince so infinitely indued by the graces both of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, we may assuredly expect actions answerable to such a concurrance of vertues. To that height of felicitie are you then arriued, as not onely you shall enioy your country without feares, your estates without hourely impositions, and your liues without warres and hazards, but as if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed these for their contraries, your countrey shall yeeld you peace, and by peace infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, your estates shall encrease daily, and you shall not buy your owne industries of strange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and taxes: and warres that had wonte to diuorce you from your parents and wiues, and by
<pb facs="tcp:9169:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presses violently pull you from your owne quiet courses, to sacrifice you to the distempered and troubled age, to quench the fire of forraine ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that threatned vs, shall no more haue any such power ouer you. But your time and determinations shall bee your owne, and your hopes shall not bee frighted with feares. Prepare then mindes fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy so many happinesses, and mindes fit to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by so sincere and iust a Prince, whose very entrance amongst vs hath had that vertue, as to driue away all threatning calamities that hung ouer our heades. Let it not bee forgotten since the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of passed perills is sweet, and not onely sweet but profitable, for it inuiteth vs to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And since wee cannot better testify our thankefullnes to God, then in the offering our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient hartes to the meanes he chose for the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this his wonderfull and gratious fauour vnto vs; let vs begin our contentments from him, who like the Sunne hath dispersed and consumed our doubts, and like the Sunne draweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from beneath, but to yeeld it downe againe with more vertue then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it.</p>
