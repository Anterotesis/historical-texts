            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>S. LUKE VI. 46.</bibl>
               <q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do
not the things which I say?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese few Words contain in them a
smart and serious <hi>Expostulation</hi> of our
Blessed Saviour, with such who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
great Kindness to him in their Words,
but shew'd no Regard to his Commands. They
owned him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and depended
upon him for their Happiness, and were willing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100692:3"/>
enough to be known to be his Disciples and
Followers, but yet his Doctrine made little
Impression on their Minds, and scarce any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the Course of their Lives. They
loved to be where Christ was, to hear his
Doctrine, to see his Miracles, to observe his
Conversation, to admire what he did and said;
but herein lay the whole of their Religion;
for although they <hi>named the name of Christ,</hi> and
it may be rejoyced and glory'd in it, yet <hi>they
did not depart from iniquity.</hi> Now, considering
the Circumstances of that time, this seems to
have been an unaccountable kind of Hypocrisie.
For their calling Christ <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> spoiled their
Interest in this World; and <hi>not doing what he
said,</hi> debarr'd, them from the hopes of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by him in another. For, if they own'd him
to be their <hi>Lord,</hi> they were bound to believe
him in what he declared; and there is nothing
he doth more expresly warn men of than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to be saved by him without obeying his
Commands.<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Not every one that saith unto me
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but he that doth the Will of my Father which
is in Heaven.</hi> Which is shorter expressed, but
to the same purpose here by <hi>S. Luke; And why
call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100692:3"/>
I say?</hi> As though he had said to them,
<hi rend="margQuotes">It is in vain to think to please and flatter me
with your Words, when your Actions are
disagreeable to them. To call me <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi>
is to own my <hi>Authority</hi> in commanding you;
but to do this, and yet wilfully to disobey
me, is to shew your Hypocrisie and Folly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which <hi>Expostulation</hi> of Christ, was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to that time, no more than his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were; but it hath always the same
Force, where Persons are guilty of the same
Folly. For, although now none can plead for
themselves, as they did,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 26.</note> 
               <hi>We have eaten and drank
in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets;</hi>
yet we may build as presumptuous hopes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Privileges of another kind, which may
be as ineffectual to our Salvation, as these were
when Christ said to those very Persons,<note place="margin">v. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Depart
from me all ye workers of iniquity.</hi> We all bear
the Name of Christ, and own his Doctrine, and
partake of his Sacraments; and in one of them
profess <hi>to eat and drink in his Presence,</hi> and at his
Table, and renew our solemn Baptismal Vow
and Covenant with him as our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and so we pray to him and profess to
depend upon him for our Salvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100692:4"/>
we are as deeply concerned in the Scope and
Design of these Words, as ever the <hi>Iews</hi> were
to whom our Saviour spake them.</p>
            <p>But that I may the better Apply them to
the Consciences of all those who hear me this
Day, and to make my Discourse more Usefull
and Practical, I shall single out some of the
most Remarkable Instances of those Duties,
which Christ hath enjoyned to his Disciples of
all Ages and Nations; and then shew how just
and reasonable it is that all who call Christ
<hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> should <hi>do what he saith</hi> about them;
and yet that the Generality of those who do
so, do very little Mind or Regard them.</p>
            <p>The main part of those Duties which Christ
requires from all his Disciples may be reduced
to these three Heads:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Such as relate to the <hi>Government of our
Passions.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. To the <hi>Government of our Speech.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. To the <hi>Government of our Actions;</hi> so, as
that we lead a <hi>Sober, Righteous and Godly
Life.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. As to the <hi>Government of our Passions.</hi> And
that may be considered three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As to the things which are apt to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi>
us.</item>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100692:4"/>
               <item>2. As to the things which are apt to
<hi>Tempt</hi> us.</item>
               <item>3. As to the things which <hi>Concern</hi> us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our Condition in this World.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1) As to the things which are apt to <hi>Provoke</hi>
us. Such is the frame of human Nature, that
we are very tender and sensible not only of
any real Hurt or Injury which may be done
to our Bodies or Estates, but of any thing we
apprehend may do so, or that touches upon
our Reputation. And where the Injury is real,
yet that which often touches most to the quick,
is the <hi>Contempt</hi> which is expressed in it. For,
if the same thing be done by one, we are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
did it not out of any Unkindness or
Ill-will, the matter is easily passed over, and
makes no breach or difference between them.
But, if it be intended for an Affront, although
it be never so little, then the brisker mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are, and the higher Opinion they have of
themselves, so much deeper Impression is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made in the Mind; and that inflames the Heart
and puts the Blood and Spirits into a quicker
Motion in order to the Returning the Affront
on him that gave it. But there is a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
difference in Mens Tempers to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
some are very quick and hasty, others
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100692:5"/>
are slower in the beginning, but more violent
afterwards; the Passions in the former, are like
a Flash of Gun-powder, which begins sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
makes a great Noise and is soon over; but
the other are like a burning Fever, which is
lower at first, but rises by degrees, till the
whole body be in a Flame. The one is more
troublesome, but the other more dangerous;
the Care of the one must be in the Beginning;
of the other in the Continuance of Passion,
lest it turn into Hatred, Malice and Revenge.
But, what through the Natural Heat of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in some, the Jealousie and Suspicion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the crossing each others Designs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
the misconstruction of Words and
Actions, the Carelesness of some and the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
and Peevishness of others, Mankind
are apt to lead very uneasie Lives with respect
to one another; and must do so unless they
look after the Government of themselves as to
real or imaginary Provocations.</p>
            <p>There are two Things I shall therefore speak
to,</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) That it is Reasonable that a Restraint
should be laid on Mens violent Passions.</item>
               <item>(2) That Christ hath laid no unreasonable
Restraint upon them.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100692:5"/>
            <p>(1) That it is Reasonable that a Restraint
should be laid on Mens violent Passions. And
that on a twofold Account.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) With Respect to the common Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of human Life.</item>
               <item>(2) To the particular Tranquillity of our
own Minds.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1) To the common Tranquillity of human
Life. The great Comfort and Pleasure of it
depends on the mutual benefit Men have from
Society with one another. This cannot be
enjoy'd without particular Persons abridging
themselves of some natural Rights for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Benefit. If we could suppose no such
thing as Government or Society among men,
we must suppose nothing but Disorder and
Confusion; every one being his own Judge
and Executioner too in case of any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Wrong or Injury done to him. Which
condition of Life having all imaginable Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
attending it, by perpetual Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and Mistrusts of one anothers Powers,
there was a Necessity that they must come to
some common Terms of Agreement with each
other; so as to fix their Rights and to establish
a just Measure of Proceeding in case of Wrong.
For every Mans Revenging his own Injury ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100692:6"/>
to his own Judgment, was one of those
great Inconveniencies, which was to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by Society, Laws and Government. And
Mankinds entering into Society for this End,
doth suppose it possible for them to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their violent Passions; and to submit their
private Injuries to the equal Arbitration of
Laws; or else they are made to no purpose,
unless it be to punish men for what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid. For many of those Crimes which
all the Laws of Mankind do punish, as wilfull
Murder, may be committed through the force
of a violent Passion; and if that be irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then the Laws which punish it are not
founded on Reason and Justice. But if such
Laws are very Just and Reasonable, as no doubt
they are, then all Mankind are agreed that
Mens violent Passions may and ought to be
Restrained in some Cases. The only Dispute
then remaining is, whether it may not be as
fitting to restrain our Passions in such Cases,
which the Law takes no notice of. For, there
is a Superiour Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are to be Governed; and the Publick
Laws do not forbid or punish Offences because
they are unreasonable, but because they are
dangerous and hurtfull to human Society.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100692:6"/>
And if it be allow'd to be fitting and necessary
for men to keep their Passions within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Laws, why not within the Conduct of
Reason? Especially, when a great deal of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
may happen, and disturbance of the Peace
and Quiet of human Society, by the Violence
of Passions, which may be out of the Reach of
human Laws. And every Man is bound by
virtue of his being in Society, to preserve the
Tranquillity of it as much as he can.</p>
            <p>(2) The Tranquillity of our own Minds
depends upon it. And certainly, that is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reasonable Motive for the Government of
our Passions, since those are the Occasions of
all the Storms and Tempests within our breasts.
For the Government of Reason is calm, even
and serene, full of Peace and all the Blessings
which follow it; but the Government of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is tyrannical and boisterous, uncertain and
troublesome; never free from doing Mischief
to it self or others. The greatest Pleasure of
Passion is Revenge; and yet that is so unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
so full of anxiety and fear of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of it, that he who can subdue this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Passion hath more real Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in his mind, than he who seeks to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
it most. For, if he be disappointed, then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100692:7"/>
he must be uneasie by failing of his end; if he
be not, then he is tormented with the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of what may follow it. So that there
is nothing which conduces more to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Blessing of Life, the Tranquillity of our
Minds, than the Government of our Passions
doth.</p>
            <p>(2) Let us now see, whether our Saviour
hath laid any Unreasonable Restraint upon our
Passions.</p>
            <p>There are Three things he particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in order to the Government of them.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Meekness.</hi> (2) <hi>Patience.</hi> (3) <hi>Love of
Enemies.</hi> And I hope to make it appear,
that there is nothing unreasonable in any of
these.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Meekness.</hi> Which is such a Gentleness
of Temper, as makes a Man not easie to be
provoked. There is a great deal of difference
between <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Stupidity;</hi> the one ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
from a natural Dullness and Insensibility;
the other from a fixed, calm and composed
Temper of Mind; and is founded on two,
which are both wise things, especially when
they go together; and those are, <hi>Consideration</hi>
and <hi>Resolution.</hi> For, nothing tends to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
the heat and violence of Passion so much,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100692:7"/>
as <hi>Consideration</hi> doth, and <hi>Resolution</hi> makes it
effectual. If it were nothing but the time it
gives, that is of great force for letting out the
inward Fermentation, which will spend it self
in great Measure, if Vent be given to it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if it be kept in and suffer'd to work upon
it self, it turns from a hasty Passion to Malice
and Revenge. But <hi>Consideration</hi> is of greater
Use, as it suggests Arguments from Reason to
quell and allay the sudden heat of Passions; as,
That, it Exposes the Weakness of our Minds,
in not being able to keep under that which
they ought to Govern and have Power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
That, it is a great Folly to disorder
our selves, at the Pleasure of our Enemies; or,
at such Accidents, which we can neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
nor remove; That, the wisest thing we
can do, is not to betray our Folly to others, if we
cannot wholly suppress it in our selves; That,
we weaken the Reins of the Government of
our Selves, by not holding them with a stricter
hand; and make our Passions more seditious
and turbulent by letting them alone; That,
the more we try to command our selves the
easier we shall do it; That our most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Passions will submit, if they find we
are in Earnest; That, it is the Way to make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100692:8"/>
that a real Injury by being disturbed, which
would lose is Force by being neglected; That,
while we are true to our selves, we are out of
the reach of our Enemies, and then we are most
under their Power, when we are least under
our own; That, the great Work of Religion
lies within us; and that we are in a very ill
Condition if neither Reason nor Religion can
keep us in order. By such <hi>Considerations</hi> as
these, men are brought to a more calm and
composed Temper, which is that <hi>Meekness</hi>
which our Saviour requires. And to this he
seems to Appropriate the Happiness of this Life.
<hi>Blessed are the Meek for they shall inherit the
Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 5.</note> What doth our Blessed Saviour mean
by <hi>Inheriting the Earth?</hi> Is there any thing
like <hi>Blessedness</hi> to be expected in this Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and Sinfull World? Not Absolutely;
but Comparatively there may; and if there
be any thing like it to be had here, the <hi>Meek</hi>
may put in for the largest share of it. For
they have more Friends and fewer Enemies
than the rest of the World; they enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with more quietness and satisfaction, and
are less disturbed at the Noise and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passions of the rest of Mankind. O happy
Temper! To be calm and easie and in good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100692:8"/>
humour, in the midst of Disorders and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
To enjoy the Peace and Serenity of
the Regions above, in the midst of the Storms
and Tempests, here below; To raise the Mind
above the Power of Detraction; and thereby
to suffer the Venom of Malicious Tongues to
scatter and disperse it self in the open Air, if it
doth not return to the Breasts of those from
whom it came. S. <hi>Iames</hi> might therefore well
call it the <hi>Meekness of Wisdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 13.</note> not only because
Wisdom directs it, but that it consists very
much in the Exercise of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Patience.</hi> For let Persons be endued with
the <hi>Spirit of Meekness,</hi> yet the World is so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and hard to be pleased, so captious and
ill-natured, so ready to apprehend an Injury
and to Revenge it, that there is great need of
<hi>Patience,</hi> not only in <hi>bearing</hi> the Troubles of
Life, but in <hi>forbearing</hi> to return <hi>evil for evil.</hi>
And this is that which our Saviour particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requires of his Disciples. He strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
all <hi>Causeless Anger,</hi> all <hi>Contumelious</hi> and
<hi>Reproachfull Words;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 22.</note> and when Injuries are done
us, he commands us <hi>that we resist not evil;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 39.</note> 
               <hi>but
if one smite us on the right Cheek, to turn to him
the other also.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 40.</note> 
               <hi>And if any man will sue thee at
the Law and take away thy coat, let him have thy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100692:9"/>
cloak also.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 41.</note> 
               <hi>And whosoever will compel thee to go
a mile, go with him twain.</hi> Now here lies a
real Difficulty; for this seems to go beyond
the bounds of human Patience: To pass by
Affronts without taking notice of them; not
to Resent the Injuries of those whom no Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can oblige, seems to be a great degree of
Vertue; and it is so; but to bind hand and
foot when we receive them, to invite them to
do more, and to offer our selves to double
the proportion, seems wholly unaccountable
to Reason, and inconsistent with the Wisdom
of <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Account of the meaning of these
Commands is this; Our Saviour takes it for
granted, that all considerable matters of Right
and Wrong were determin'd by Laws; as the
most equal Measures between Parties; and
these he meddled not with; For, saith he, to
one that desired him to interpose in such a
Matter;<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 14</note> 
               <hi>Who made me a Iudge or a Divider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you?</hi> Therefore he doth not abridge his
Followers from making use of these Laws and
Courts of Judicature, which are established for
matters of common Justice and Equity; But
all the Laws in the World cannot alter the
Temper of some mens minds, who are peevish
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100692:9"/>
and quarrelsome, who are provoked on any
slight Occasion, and it may be are provoked
if you gave them none. Like the Roman Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,<note place="margin">De Irâ, l. 3. c. 8.</note>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> mentions, who was angry with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that came near him; and when a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
sought to humour him in every thing, he
was at last angry with him, because he did
not provoke him. There are some Tempers
so easily provoked, and yet so hard to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
as if their Original Sin did not lie in
<hi>Concupiscence</hi> but in <hi>Ill-nature.</hi> And yet, even
that is a kind of <hi>Concupiscence;</hi> for the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
defined Anger by <hi>Libido;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tusc. 3. 9.</note> and said it was a <hi>Lust
of Revenge;</hi> and so far, seem'd more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than that of <hi>Intemperance;</hi> because this
aims only at Pleasure, in things which are apt
to produce it (however mean and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
but the other is an extravagant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Pleasure, which arises from anothers
Pain; And differs from the other, as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of evil Spirits do from those of Brutes.</p>
            <p>But if we happen to converse among such who
take Pleasure in doing us Injuries upon every
slight Occasion, by some Personal Affronts, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious
Suits, or unjust Exactions in ordinary
Cases; what are we to do? May we not Right
our selves by Retaliating the Injury upon them?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100692:10"/>
Since the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did allow of <hi>Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in case of real Injuries,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 24.</note> 
               <hi>an Eye for an Eye,
a Tooth for a Tooth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 24. 20.</note> and so by an Equitable
Construction of the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 19. 21.</note> it may extend to
Personal Affronts. Thus the <hi>Iews</hi> indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it; but if our <hi>Saviour</hi> had allow'd
their Interpretation, he would never have said,
<hi>But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil.</hi> There
was a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Revenge</hi> in them, so as they
would pass by no kind of Injuries, although
they were such, which the Law had made no
Provision for; and this our Saviour Condemns.
But here comes a hard Case to be resolved;
not so in it self, but the Custom of the World
hath made it so; for when a mistaken Notion
of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> come in Competition,
it is not an easie thing to forego <hi>Honour</hi> for
<hi>Conscience</hi> sake. The Case is, concerning <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
Words</hi> and <hi>Personal Affronts,</hi> which are
given to Men of Honour. Is it unlawfull for
them to Right themselves according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Customs among them, when the Law
takes no notice of such Injuries, and so seems
to leave it to them? This is the Case; and I
have put it as fair as the thing will bear. I
might say in general that our <hi>Saviour</hi> makes
no distinction of Mens Honour and Quality
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100692:10"/>
in his Commands; and that for all that I can
see, such must be saved on the same Terms
with others; That <hi>Honour</hi> is but an imaginary
thing when it stands in Competition with the
Rule of <hi>Conscience;</hi> and that no Custom is to
be observed against <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> But
here lies the insuperable Difficulty; how the
Exposing one anothers Lives for the sake of
<hi>Reproachfull Words</hi> or <hi>Personal Affronts,</hi> can be
Reconciled to this Command of Christ? For
my part, I cannot see how it is possible to do
it; since in this Case, there is a studied and
premeditated Design of Revenge in the Case
of such Injuries which are here mention'd;
and that of the highest Nature, and beyond
any Proportion between the Offence and the
Punishment, which all men out of Passion,
think, in common Justice ought to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
I know some Casuists in the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> allow it to be lawfull to take away the
Lives of any who give them <hi>Contumelious
Words;</hi> but these have been condemned as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
loose <hi>Casuists;</hi> And they have found out a
subtle way of <hi>directing the Intention,</hi> whereby
to keep from breaking the Laws of Christ; but
this is too subtle to be reconciled with the
Plainness of his Laws; and they all deny it to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100692:11"/>
be lawfull by way of Revenge. Others say
much better, that although <hi>Nature</hi> may
seem to give an Injured Person a Right to
vindicate himself by the best Means he can;<note place="margin">Gr. de I. B. &amp; P. l. 2. 1. 10.</note>
yet that Right is so restrained and limited by
Christ's Commands in this case, that it is by
no means lawfull for <hi>Christians</hi> to use it; and
to pretend to do it for a Reparation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<hi>à ratione &amp; pietate valde alienam videtur,
is repugnant both to Reason and Religion;</hi> saith
one, who very well understood the Rules of
both.</p>
            <p>But all the pretended <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away by <hi>Laws,</hi> and where those declare it
to be <hi>Wilfull Murder</hi> to take away the Life of
another on such Accounts as these, there is no
colour left for natural Right, which supposes
no determination by Laws.</p>
            <p>I confess it requires a more than ordinary
Degree of <hi>Christian Fortitude</hi> as well as <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
to be able to despise such a prevailing Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.
But if Men hope to be saved by Christ,
they must observe his Commands; and if they
once declare, that they are Resolved to do so
in this particular, (if they do the same in all
others) it will be then thought to be Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and not Cowardice for them to decline
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100692:11"/>
a Challenge; and that upon good Grounds
they contemn such a Custom, which no Good
man could ever Approve, nor any Wise man
Defend.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Love of Enemies.</hi> This seems to be harder
yet. Is it not enough to bear them; but must
we love them too? Yes, Christ hath strictly
required it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I say unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 27, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> and
again in this very Chapter, <hi>But love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
If he had bid Men love their Friends
and take heed of their Enemies, there are some
Ages of the World, wherein this had been no
impertinent Advice. But how can those be
supposed to love their Enemies, who hardly
love any thing but themselves? Self-Opinion,
Self-Will, Self-Interest prevail over the far-greatest
Part of Mankind; I wish I could not
say, even among those who call Christ <hi>Lord,
Lord.</hi> But Self-Love as natural as it is, must
be artificially disguised; for, if it appears too
openly, it meets with so much Self-Love in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that it will not be easily born. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the most crafty Lovers of themselves, if
they design to have the Love of others,
must conceal their inward Passion. For, he
that appears to set up himself, is certain to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100692:12"/>
make the rest of Mankind his Enemies; for,
even those who would do the same, will be the
most displeased with those who do it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the most certain way to Honour and
universal Esteem, is to mind the Good of others
more than our own; to be Just and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Kind to all; and to oblige as many as
we can, without Partiality or Prejudice. And
this, I say, is that <hi>Love of Enemies</hi> which our
Saviour requires, which doth not suppose the
same kind of Affection to them which we have
to our Friends, for that is grounded on mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Love and Good-will to each other;
which, if we suppose in Enemies, we suppose a
Contradiction; for that is to suppose them
not to be Enemies, but Friends. What then
is it which our Saviour means? It is certainly
an Universal Charity, or a Readiness of Mind
<hi>to do Good</hi> to all, although they have Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
provoked, or Injured us. And so Christ
himself explains it,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 27. 33. 35.</note> by doing Good to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
praying for them and relieving them in
their Necessities; and he proposes the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the World for our imitation; and
that of God himself, <hi>who maketh his Sun to rise
on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the
just and on the unjust.</hi> But none can suppose that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100692:12"/>
the righteous and holy God, can have the same
Love or Kindness for the Evil, which he hath
for the Good, or for the Unjust, which he hath
for the Just. So that this Precept, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
misunderstood, seems to be irreconcilable
to human Nature, contains in it, nothing but
what all Mankind approve in others, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
as they are to practise it themselves.</p>
            <p>And now, it is time to make a stand, and to
look about us, for, I have gone through our
Saviour's Commands with Respect to the
things which are apt to <hi>provoke</hi> us. And where
are those <hi>Christians</hi> to be found, who do what
Christ hath said herein, who do yet every day
call him <hi>Lord, Lord?</hi> If Peevishness and Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
perpetual Uneasiness and Discontent;
If Rancour and Bitterness, Strife and Envying,
Faction and Animosity; If Impatience of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
Injuries, and the making of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
instead of <hi>loving them,</hi> were the Marks
of good Christians, we should find Number
enough; even among those who pretend to
Reformation. We profess to thank God for
a late great Deliverance from the hands of
our <hi>Enemies,</hi> I mean as to our <hi>Religion;</hi> (and
truely there appears more and more Reason
for it, since it is so much more evident that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100692:13"/>
the Design was no less than a total Subversion
of our Religion.)</p>
            <p>But what a sad Requital is this, for so great
Mercies, to break out into Factions and <hi>Parties,</hi>
instead of pursuing the common Interest of
our Religion? Instead of laying aside Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
about Religion, to increase them; nay to
make Religion it self not only the Subject of
their Quarrels, but of their Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?
What can be said or hoped for, as to
such a froward, unthankfull, Atheistical Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Men? Thanks be to God, there are
not wanting some Extraordinary Examples of
true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> among us; and of
<hi>Meekness, Patience</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Charity,</hi> and
truely there needs a great deal, to bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the daring and insolent <hi>Profaneness</hi> and
<hi>Irreligion</hi> of others. When I once see a true
Spirit of Reformation prevail among us, not
meerly as to Doctrines, but as to Mens Lives
and Tempers; when I see them more zealous
for God and Religion, than for the Interest of
particular Parties; when I see them really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Peace and Unity, and not making a
Pretence of it to serve private Ends, I may then
hope for a lasting Settlement of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among us. But till then—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100692:13"/>
(2) I proceed to the second Head of our
Saviour's Commands, and that is as to such
things which <hi>Tempt</hi> us. S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Every
man is tempted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>when he is drawn aside of his
own Lust and inticed. Lust</hi> is the ungoverned
Desire of Sensual Pleasure. Now, as to this,
Christ hath laid so strict a Command, as seems
very hard for human Nature to observe. For
he not only forbids the Act of <hi>Adultery,</hi> but
the Tendencies to it; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Impurity</hi> of the
inward <hi>Desires,</hi> and of <hi>Looks</hi> and <hi>Glances,</hi> and
makes these to be <hi>Adultery in the Heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 28.</note> What
is that? For <hi>Adultery</hi> is an outward, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Act, and hath <hi>Injustice</hi> as well as <hi>Vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in it. But <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Looks,</hi> are sudden
and transient things, which may leave, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Effect behind them. However, our
Saviour, to shew how much God abhorrs <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,</hi>
(who sees into the Secret Thoughts
and Intentions of the Heart,) declares that
the unmortified Desires and inward Lusts are
very displeasing to God; And therefore that
those who hope to see God,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 8.</note> must be <hi>Pure in
heart.</hi> Which as it implies a sincere Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Suppress all inward Motions which
are contrary to it, is both a Reasonable and
Necessary Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100692:14"/>
But the hardest part of Christ's Commands
in this matter, is that which requires us <hi>to
pluck out right eyes and to cut off right hands:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 29. 30.</note>
Must the blind and the lame only go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
But he speaks of such sinfull Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in us, which seem as delightfull and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us as to the Pleasures of Life, as <hi>a right
Eye</hi> or <hi>a right Hand;</hi> yet we must part with
them, if we ever hope to get to Heaven.
Not, by any one single Act like <hi>the cutting off
a Hand,</hi> or <hi>plucking out an Eye,</hi> but by a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
constant and sincere Endeavour to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
and Subdue them. And if this be thought
hard, the Consideration of future Happiness
and Misery ought to Reconcile us to it; and
surely it is Reasonable, we should part with
something which is pleasant to us here, for
the sake of an infinitely greater Pleasure in
another World; especially since this is only a
Sensual Pleasure, which cannot be pursued
without Disturbance of the Mind, and can
be enjoy'd but for a little time; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is no less than Eternal Felicity of Soul
and Body together.</p>
            <p>(3) As to the things which <hi>Concern</hi> us, as
to our Condition in this World. There is
no Precept of Christ which seems more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100692:14"/>
with the Wisdom of this World,
than this doth. For, as that lies in taking
great Care for the future; so our Saviour on
the contrary seems to allow none at all
<hi>Therefore I say unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Take no thought for your
Life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 22.</note> 
               <hi>what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
nor yet, for your Body, what ye shall put on.</hi>
What doth our Saviour mean by this? Would
he have all Christians live like the <hi>young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 12. 24.</note> meerly upon Providence?<note place="margin">Job 38. 41.</note>
Or,<note place="margin">Psal. 147. 9.</note> as the
<hi>Lillies</hi> of the Field, which grow and flourish
and yet neither Toil nor Spin? But Man is
an Intelligent Creature, and apt to forecast
and contrive things for his future advantage,
and God seems to have left things very much
to his own Care and Providence; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
speaking, Mens Condition in this World
is according to it. What then? Doth our
Saviour indulge Men in a Careless, Easie, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Life? Or, require that his Disciple's
thoughts ought to be wholly taken up with
matters of Religion?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> Not, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew his
meaning; for he saith, <hi>Those who provide not
for their own, have denied the Faith and are
worse than Infidels.</hi> But this only seems to
make the Difficulty greater. Therefore to
clear it, we must attend to our Saviour's
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100692:15"/>
Scope and Design; which was, to perswade
his Disciples <hi>to lay up their Treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to seek the Kingdom of God and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the first place;</hi> and then represents
this World and another as two opposite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
so that <hi>one cannot serve two Masters;</hi>
which implies a Contradiction to each other.
So that what follows must be understood in
such a Sense, as is inconsistent with the main
Duty, of looking after Heaven as our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and therefore ought not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a Prudent, Necessary Care, but of
an Anxious, Solicitous, Distrustfull Care,
which implies that we place our Happiness
too much here. And therefore S. <hi>Luke</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
these Commands to the Parable of the
Rich Man,<note place="margin">Luke. 12. 18, 19.</note> whose heart was in his Barns and
Store-houses, and took great Care to lay in
Provision enough for a sensual and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life: But to shew the unspeakable Folly
of such vain Contrivances, it was said to him,
<hi>This night shall thy Soul be required of thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 20.</note> 
               <hi>and
then whose shall these things be which thou hast
provided?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. I come now to our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
with Respect to the <hi>Government of our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100692:15"/>
Speech.</hi> And he seems to be very severe as to
this,<note place="margin">Matt. 12. 36.</note> when he saith, <hi>That every Idle word that
men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
at the Day of Iudgment.</hi> What a heavy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
then, are those to make, whose time is
so much taken up with idle and impertinent
talk; and who can hardly forbear it, when
they should be most serious? Is it unlawfull
then to speak any more than is just necessary
to express our Minds? May we not imploy
our Speech sometimes for our innocent Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Entertainment if we keep within the
bounds of Prudence and Religion? I do not
see that our Saviour forbids it. For the <hi>idle
Words</hi> he speaks of there, are profane, false,
abusive, malicious Reproaches of Religion and
the means to confirm it; as appears by his
bringing it just after the mention of the <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 31.</note> So that all such
Abuses of Speech which entrench on Piety
and Good Manners, or Truth and Sincerity,
are certainly forbidden by him. But there is
one particular Vice of Conversation,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 34, 37.</note> which he
hath with most force of Argument forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dden;
and yet (which is a great shame to any
that would be called Christians) none more
common among some who would pretend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100692:16"/>
to understand the Methods of Conversation
and the best Modes of Speaking; and that is
<hi>the profane Custom of Swearing.</hi> I take it for
granted, that all are <hi>Christians</hi> among us, till
they disown it themselves; and however Men
may Act, they are not willing to Renounce
all hopes of Salvation by Christ. I beseech
them then to consider, what a Contempt of
his Authority is implied in this, too fashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sort of Profaneness? The other Duties I
have mention'd, have a great Difficulty in
them, as to our Tempers and Inclinations;
but nothing of that Nature can be so much
as pretended as to this. For no Man could
ever say, that he had a <hi>Swearing Constitution,</hi>
or that it was an <hi>Infirmity</hi> of his <hi>Nature.</hi>
There is nothing in it but the Tyranny of a
very bad Custom; which every Prudent Man,
as well as Good Christian, will see Cause to
break. But what a Reproach is it, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Profession of Christianity among us for so
plain, so easie a Command of Christ to be
broken so commonly, so unconcernedly, so
impertinently, as is every day done; and yet
they call Christ <hi>Lord, Lord?</hi> In all Ages,
there were some pretended Christians, who did
not sincerely obey the Commands of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100692:16"/>
but their Hypocrisie was of a finer
and more Artificial make; this is gross and
rude, without the Common Respect which is
due to the Religion we all profess to be that,
or hope to be saved by. Some say, a Custom
in it self is no Sin, because it is no Act; but
certainly a Customary breach of a plain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is so much greater a Sin, as it implies a
greater Contempt of him that made it; and
when Custom hath taken away the Sense of a
Fault, it is so much more aggravated by it.
It is really a matter to be wonder'd at, that
among Persons professing a better sort of
Breeding, as well as <hi>Christianity;</hi> a Vitious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
so Untempting in it self, so Unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Decency of Conversation, so Affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Divine Majesty, so directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Commands of Christ, should
get so deep a rooting in ordinary Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it seems almost impossible to be
Reformed. But till Men do think of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off such a Practise as this, I despair of
ever seeing them Reform other things which
have a deeper Root in their natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and have greater Advantages as to this
World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100692:17"/>
III. The Commands of Christ extend to
the whole Course of our Actions; so, as that
we lead <hi>a sober, righteous and godly Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to <hi>Sobriety. Take heed to your selves,</hi>
saith Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 24</note> 
               <hi>lest at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</hi> These
are somewhat hard words for that which our
Age hath learnt to express in much softer
terms of <hi>Eating and Drinking well.</hi> Luxury
seems a thing quite forgotten to be a Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those who are most guilty of it; and
Intemperance thought so uncertain a thing, as
though it were impossible to tell when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are guilty of it. 'Tis true, that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
may vary as to the Degrees and Limits
of it; and we do not pretend to define it by
Grains and Scruples. But still, there ought
to be <hi>a Governing our Appetites according to
Reason,</hi> and that is Temperance. But what is
<hi>Reason</hi> in this Case? Some send us to the
Brutes to find out what Reason is; and they
tell us, it lies in a plain simple Diet, such as
the Beasts use, without provoking or raising
the Appetite. But I know not where God
hath forbidden the Use of Art, as to our Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100692:17"/>
and Drinking; and if this were so, we
must practise Temperance only in the Use of
Water and Acorns. If meer <hi>Satisfaction of
Nature</hi> were the exact Rule of Temperance,
then eating or drinking any thing beyond it
were a Sin; which would fill the Minds of
those who are afraid to sin, with infinite Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
and make all Feasting unlawfull. Yet
our Saviour was present at one in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee;</hi>
and did a Miracle relating to it. But
we need not run into Niceties in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
For, <hi>Intemperance</hi> is either an over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Nature, so as to make it to sink or
totter under the load; or it is a wanton hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring
and pleasing the Appetit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, not, for
the Service of Nature, but for the Pleasure
of Eating and Drinking; Or, it is as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls it,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> making <hi>a God of their belly,</hi> by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
their Time, their Study, their Estates
in order to the filling and pleasing of it.
Any of these ways, it is no Difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what <hi>Intemperance</hi> is; I wish it were
as easie to avoid it.</p>
            <p>2. As to <hi>Righteousness.</hi> Our Saviour hath
given one Admirable Rule; which all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
agree to be of excellent Use in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100692:18"/>
and Transactions of Men with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<hi>v. 31. And as ye would that men should
do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</hi> Which
is an Universal Rule of Justice and Equity, if
it be understood of what we would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to do to us according to Reason, and not
according to the Partial Affection we are apt
to have to our selves. For this Rule is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the second great Commandment,
as our Saviour calls it,<note place="margin">Matt. 22. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As to <hi>Godliness.</hi> He lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that upon the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,
with all thy Heart and with all thy Soul and
with all thy Strength.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 22. 37.</note> We need not to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
but where-ever there is such a Love of
God, as is here required, there will be true
Godliness in all the parts of it. And where
this is wanting, all external Shews of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
want the true Life and Spirit of it. For
it is the Love of God which makes all our
weak and imperfect Services to be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him; and without it all our Prayers
and our Fastings, and all other Appearances of
Devotion, are empty and insipid Formalities.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100692:18"/>
Not, but that the Acts themselves are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable;
but, they are like a Body without
a Soul, dull and heavy; or like the leaves of
a Tree in Autumn, which make a great noise
in the Wind, but are dry, sapless and soon fall
to the Ground. But where the Love of God
prevails, it keeps up the Life and Order and
Vigour of Devotion; and preserves it from
being tainted by hypocrisie, or choaked by
the love of this World, or decaying from want
of Constancy and Resolution.</p>
            <p>Thus I have set before you some of the
most remarkable Duties of Christianity; not
such as depend on the Opinions and Fancies
of Men; but such as our Blessed Saviour,
the great Law-giver of his Church, hath made
the necessary Conditions of our Salvation by
him.</p>
            <p>And what now can we say for our Selves?
We do call Christ <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> or else we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our Baptismal Vow, and all hopes of
Salvation by him. But can we say that <hi>we love
God,</hi> when we love what he hates, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin?
Can we say, <hi>we love him with all our Heart and
Soul,</hi> when our Hearts are so much divided
between him and the Vanities of this World?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100692:19"/>
Can we say, <hi>we love him with all our Might,</hi>
when our Love to God is apt to grow cold
and remiss upon any apprehension of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Can we say, that we <hi>love our Neighbour
as our Selves,</hi> when we despise and scorn him,
or over-reach and defraud him, or oppress
and ruin him? If it go not so far, are we as
tender of his Reputation as of our own; as
unwilling to see him injured, as ready to help
him in his Necessities, as we should desire it
from others, if we were in the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?
If strict Sobriety and Temperance
be the Duties of Christians, where are those
Vertues to be generally found? I do not
speak of particular Persons; but I am afraid,
there is hardly such a thing left as a <hi>Sober Party</hi>
among us. What profane, customary Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is every-where to be met with? What
Complaints are daily made of the Abounding
of all sorts of Wickedness, even to an open
Scorn and Contempt, not barely of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
but of any kind of <hi>Religion?</hi> For, many
who have long denied the <hi>Power,</hi> seem to be
grown weary of the very <hi>Form of Godliness;</hi>
unless it serves some particular End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
So that, if we look abroad in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100692:19"/>
World, we find little Regard shew'd to the
Precepts of Christ; and yet those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
these things call Christ <hi>Lord, Lord.</hi> What
is the meaning of all this gross Hypocrisie?
Nothing would have been thought more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
or Ridiculous, than for one who used no
kind of Abstinence, to be thought a <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean;</hi>
or one that indulged his Passions a <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick;</hi>
or one who eats Flesh and drinks Wine
a <hi>Brachman,</hi> or <hi>Banian.</hi> It is really, as much for
any one to break the known and particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Christ, and yet desire to be thought a
<hi>Christian.</hi> For, a loose, profane and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christian, is a Contradiction in Morality;
It is to be a Christian against Christ, to call
him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet to defie his Laws and
Authority. A Star without Light, a Guide
without Eyes, a Man without Reason, a Sun
with nothing but Spots, are not more absurd
Suppositions, than a Christian without any
Grace, or Vertue.</p>
            <p>But let us say what we will, there are and
will be such, who will own Christ and call
him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet will not part with
their sins for him. There were Multitudes of
such formerly who would lay down their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100692:20"/>
Lives for the Ground he trod on, and yet
would not mortifie one Sin for his sake. The
Reason is still the same which our Saviour
mentions, they hope that calling him <hi>Lord,
Lord,</hi> will make amends for all; and yet it is
not possible that fairer warning should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any, than he hath given in this Case,
that let them pretend what they will, he will
say to them at the great Day, <hi>Depart from me
all ye workers of Iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 25.</note> O dreadfull Sentence!
Not,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 27.</note> to be mention'd without Horrour, nor
to be thought upon without Astonishment.
How miserable, for ever miserable, must their
condition be, whom Christ at that day shall
bid to <hi>Depart</hi> from him! <hi rend="margQuotes">What is this,
some will be apt to say, but to put all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
into utter Despair? For, who is there
that can say, that he hath done all that
Christ hath said?</hi> Truely, we have a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ground for deep Humility and serious
Repentance, and timely Reformation. But
there is a great difference between <hi>the Failing
of our Duty</hi> and <hi>the Works of Iniquity;</hi> between
the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of those who sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to do his Will, and the <hi>Presumptuous Sins</hi>
of those who despise it; between <hi>Sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100692:20"/>
and heartily repented of;</hi> and <hi>Sins habitually
practised and continued in, without any Marks of
Amendment.</hi> Such must go out of this World
in a State of Sin, and therefore can expect
nothing but that dreadfull Sentence, which I
tremble at the very thoughts of Repeating.
But there are others, who in the sincerity of
their hearts have endeavour'd to do his Will;
and whose Sincerity will be so far accepted by
him, that he will say to them at that Day,
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 34.</note> 
               <hi>inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prepared for you from the Foundation of the
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which God of his infinite Mercy bring
us through the Mediation of Christ Jesus our
Lord.</p>
