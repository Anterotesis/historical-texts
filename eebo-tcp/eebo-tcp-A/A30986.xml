            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>It was in use in the persons of the Apostles themselves, as in that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> in the first of the <hi>Acts</hi>; In the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sathan, as most of the Antient Fathers expound that Censure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And generally in all the Word of God there is no one Text that Inhibits Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, more than Lay-men, to use this kind of <hi>Judicature.</hi> For that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>to be no striker,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. is no more to be appropriated unto a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop from the rest of Christian men, than that, <hi>not given to Wine</hi> or <hi>Roaring</hi> which immediately precedes the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Island</hi> it was in use before the <hi>Romans</hi> entered the same, when the <hi>Druyds Si caedes factae, poenas constituunt,</hi> gave all Sentences in Causes of Blood. <hi>Caes. de bello Gallico lib.</hi> 6. see Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Epinomis Cap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Nor is it like the <hi>Romans</hi> should forbid it in Church-men, whose Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Colledge, after the entertaining of the 12 Tables, medled in all matters of this kind <hi>Strabo Geograph. lib.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And it is not like, that the Christian Religion excluded Bishops in this Island from Secular Judicatures, considering that King <hi>Lucius</hi> is directed by the advice of his Council, to take out his Laws for the reigling of this Kingdom, <hi>Ex utraque Pagina,</hi> that is, out of the Old and New Testament, which could not be done in that Age, without the help of his Bishops. See Sir <hi>Hen. Spelmans</hi> Councils, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. <hi>ad Annum Domini</hi> 185. And how the great Prelates amongst the Antient <hi>Britains</hi> were wholly imployed in these kind of Secular Agitations, you may see by the Ecclesiastical Laws of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57523:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> set forth by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Councils, <hi>pag.</hi> 408. <hi>ad Annum Domini.</hi> 940.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And a little before this <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> lived King <hi>Aethelstan.</hi> In the 2 <hi>Cap.</hi> of whose Ecclesiastical Laws we have it peremptorily set down, <hi>hinc debent Episcopi cum seculi Judicibus interesse judiciis</hi>; and particularly in all Judgments of the Ordals, which no man that understandeth the word, can make any doubt to have been extended to the mutilation of Humane mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Councils, <hi>pag.</hi> 405. <hi>ad Annum Domini,</hi> 928.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that the Bishops joyned alwayes with the Secular Lords in all these Judiciary Laws, and Acts, under the whole Reign of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> within this Island, we may see by those <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Laws (or rather Capitularies, which amongst the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> do signifie a mixture of Laws, made by the Prince, the Bishops, and the Barons, to reigle both Church and Common-wealth) set forth by Mr. <hi>Lambert, Anno</hi> 1568. see particularly the 9th <hi>Chap.</hi> of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws, <hi>de his qui ad judicium ferri vel aquae judicati sunt per Justitiam Regis.</hi> It is in Mr. <hi>Lamberts</hi> Laws, <hi>fol.</hi> 128.</p>
            <p>And thus it continued in this Kingdom long after the Conquest, to wit in <hi>Henry Beauclarks</hi> time, after whose Reign it began first of all to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle limited and restrained. For at <hi>Clarindon, Anno Dom.</hi> 1164. the 8th of the Calends of <hi>February,</hi> in the 11th year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. a general Record is agreed upon, by that Kings special Command, of all the Customs and Liberties of this Kingdom, ever sithence <hi>Henry</hi> the first, that Kings Grand-Father, as you may see in <hi>Matthew Paris, pag.</hi> 96. of the first Edition, where amongst other Customs agreed upon, this is one.</p>
            <p>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and all other Persons of this Kingdom which hold of the King <hi>in Capite,</hi> are to enjoy their Possessions of the King as a Baronie, and by reason thereof are to answer before the Judges and Officers of the King, and to observe, and perform all the Kings Customs. And just as the rest of the Barons, ought (for it was a duty the King then required from them, as the King now by his Summons doth from us) to be present in the Judgments of the Kings Courts, together with the rest of the Barons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til such time as they shall there proceed, to the mangling of members or Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>And here in the last words is a diversity of reading. For <hi>Matthew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> a young Monk, that lived long after, reads this Custom thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem membrorum vel ad mortem.</hi> Which may be wrested to the first agitation of any Charge tending that way. But <hi>Quadrilogus</hi> (a Book written in that very Age) and the Copy of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Clarindon</hi> which <hi>Becket</hi> sent to <hi>Rome</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extant at this day in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican</hi> Library, and out of the which, <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals <hi>ad Annum</hi> 1164, transcribes it, reads the Custom thus; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sque perveniatur in Judicio ad diminutionem membrorum, &amp;c.</hi> which leaves the Bishops to sit there, until the Judgement come to be pronounced, amounting to Death, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation of members.</p>
            <p>And as this was agreed to be the Custom, so was it the Practise also after the 11th year, to wit in the 15th year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. At what time the Lay-Peers are so far from requiring the Bishops to withdraw, that they endeavour to force them alone, to hear and determine a matter of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Person of <hi>Becket. Stephanides</hi> is my Author for this, who was a Chaplain and follower of that Arch-Bishop. The Barons say (saith that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57523:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Author) you Bishops ought to pronounce Sentence upon your selves we are Layicks, you are Church-men, as this fellow is, being his fellow Priests and fellow Bishops. To whom some one of the Bishops replyed, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs rather to you my Lords, than to us; for this is no Ecclesiastical, but a Secular Judicature. We sit not here as Bishops, but as Barons. <hi>Nos Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones &amp; vos Barones hic pares sumus,</hi> We Barons and you Barons, are all Peers in this place. And in vain it is, that you should labour to find any difference at all in our Order or Calling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see this M. S. cited by Mr. <hi>Seldens.</hi> Titles of honour, the 2d Edition, <hi>pag.</hi> 705. And thus the Custom continued until the 21 year of the same King <hi>Henry</hi> 2, at what time that Provincial Synod was kept at <hi>Westminster</hi> by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and some few of his Suffragans, which <hi>Roger Haveden</hi> mentions in his History, <hi>pag.</hi> 543. And (it seems) <hi>Gervasius Dorobernensis</hi> which is a M. S. I have not seen. The quoting of this Monk in the Margen of that Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Priviledges which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> by Command had made for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per House of Parliament, is the only ground of stirring up this question against the Bishops, at this present intended by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> for a Priviledge for Bishops, not for a Priviledge for the Lay-Peers, to be pressed against Bishops. The Canon runs thus.</p>
            <p>It is not Lawful for such as are Constituted in Holy Orders, <hi>Indicium Sanguinis agitare,</hi> to put in Execution Judgments of Blood; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we forbid, that they shall either in their own Persons, Execute any such mutilation of Members, or Sentence them to be so acted by others. And if any such Person, shall do any such thing, he shall be deprived of the Office and Place of his Order and Function. We do likewise forbid under the peril of Excommunication, that no Priest be a Secular Sherif or Provost.</p>
            <p>Now this is no Canon made in <hi>England,</hi> much less Confirmed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or assented unto by all the Bishops of the Province of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> or by any one of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> but Transcribed (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Hovedens</hi> Margen) out of a Council of <hi>Toledo</hi>; which in the time That Council is supposed to be held (to wit the year of our Lord 660) was the least Kingdom in <hi>Spain,</hi> and not so big as <hi>York-shire,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improper to reigle all the World, and especially this remote Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Besides, that as this poor Monk sets it down, it doth Inhibit Church-men from being Hang-men, rather than from being Judges, or at the most, from being Judges to Condemn men, to be thus mutilated and mangled in their Members. An ordinary punishment of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who then lived in <hi>Spain</hi>; but never heard of here with us, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2d. And therefore not fitly pressed to drive Bishops from sitting as Peers in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was not to be Sentenced to any mutilation of Members. True it is, that in the Council it self, being the 11th Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and the 6th Canon, they are forbidden, <hi>quod morte plectendum est, Sententiâ propriâ judicare,</hi> to Sentence in any Cause, that is to be punished by Death.

Canon, 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is said, that the Kings do oftentimes commit to Priests and Bishops their Judicature, <hi>contra quoslibet Majestatis obnoxios,</hi> against all Traytors, howbeit from that time forward they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected not to obey their King in this particular, unless they have him bound by Oath to Pardon the party, in Case they shall find Reason to mediate for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57523:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him. And thus the Canon Law went in <hi>Spain,</hi> but nowhere else in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, in that Age.</p>
            <p>But these Bishops at <hi>Westminster</hi> travailed not so far as <hi>Toledo,</hi> to fetch in this Canon into their Synod, but took it out of <hi>Gratian,</hi> then in vogue: for he lived in the time of <hi>Henry Beauclark,</hi> Grand-Father to this <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who in the 2d part of his Decrees <hi>Cap. Clericis,</hi> saith thus, <hi>Clericis in Sacris ordinibus constitutis, ex Concilio Toletano, judicium sanguinis agitare non licet.</hi> And so this Canon was fetch'd from <hi>Spain,</hi> into these other parts of Europe, five hundred years after the first making thereof upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th, otherwise called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, having so many deadly quarrels against <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> to make his party good and strong, laid the first ground (which his Successors in their Canons closely pursued) to draw the Bishops, and other great Prelates of <hi>Germany, France, England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> from their Lay-Soveraignes, and Lay-Lords, to depend whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, and so by Colour and Pretence of Ecclesiastical Immunities, withdrew them from the Services of their Princes, in War, and Peace, and particularly from Exercising all places of Judicature in the Civil Court of Princes: To the which Offices they were by their breeding and Education more enabled, than the Martial Lay-Lords of that rough Age, and by their Fiefes and Baronies, which they held from Kings and Emperors, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bound and Obliged. And therefore shall you find, that whereas the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of this Island before the Conquest, did still joyn with the Kings and Elder-men &amp; Lay-Lords, in the making and executing of all Laws whatsoever, touching deprivation of Life, or mutilation of Members; yet soon after, when the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Prelates, <hi>Lanfranc, Anselm, Becket</hi> and the rest, began to Trade with <hi>Rome,</hi> and as <hi>Legati nati,</hi> to Wed the Laws and Canons cryed up in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to plant them here in <hi>England,</hi> they withdrew by little and little the <hi>English</hi> Prelates from those imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by, and dependances upon, the Kings of <hi>England</hi>: And under the Colour of Exemptions, and Church Immunities, erected in this Land an Ecclesiastical Estate and Monarchie, depending wholly upon the Pope; inhibiting them to exercise Secular Imployments, or to sit with the rest of the Peers, in Judicatures of Life and Member, otherwise than as they list themselves. And hence (principally) did arise those great heats, between our <hi>Rufus</hi> and <hi>Anselm,</hi> which <hi>Edmerus</hi> speaks of, and those Antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of this Kingdom which <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d pressed upon <hi>Becket,</hi> in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Clarindon,</hi> that the Prelates ought to be present in the Kings Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> a notable <hi>Boutefeu</hi> of those times in the Church of God, did tolerate though not approve of, as he apostyles that Article with his own hand, to be shewed to this day in the M. S. extant in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library. And although I shall not deny, but the Popes did pretend Scripture for this Inhibition (as they did for all things else) and allude unto that place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. which they backed with one of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apostles (as they call them) the 7th in Number; yet is it clear their main Authority is fetch'd from this obscure Synod of <hi>Toledo</hi>; where 18 Bishops only were convened under <hi>Bamba</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> who of a Plow-man was made a King, and of a King a cloistred Monk, as you may see in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Rodericus Santius, par.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. This is all the goodly ground, that either <hi>Gratian</hi> in his Decrees, or <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3d in the Decretals,

or <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> in his History, alledge against the Ecclesiastical Peers, and their sitting as Judges in Causes of Blood; to wit this famous <hi>Gothish</hi> Council of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first that openly planted this Canon here in <hi>England,</hi> was <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> a Cardinal, the Popes Creature (as his Holyness was pleased to stile him in his Bull) and thrust upon the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by a Papal Provision, where he continued in Rebellion against his Soveraign, as long as King <hi>John</hi> lived. This Arch-Bishop under Colour of Ecclesiastical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity (as this Canon is Marshalled by <hi>Lindwood</hi>) at <hi>Osney</hi> neer <hi>Oxford,</hi> did Ordain, <hi>Ne quis Clericus beneficiatus, vel in sacris ordinibus constitutus,</hi> that no Clergy-man having a Benefice or otherwise in Holy Orders, should presume to be present in that place, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi judicium sanguinis tractatur, vel exerceatur.</hi> And this is the first Canon Broached in this Kingdom, to this Effect: That of <hi>Othobon</hi> being subsequent in time, and a meer Forraign or Legatine Constitution. See it at large in <hi>Lyndwoods Constitu. lib.</hi> 3. at the end of the Book.</p>
            <p>And by Vertue of a branch of this very Constitution, the now Arch-Bishop 2 years sithence, Fined the Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> in the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because he had given way (in time of Pestilence only) that a Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (or Judgment of Blood) might be kept in a Sacred place, which was likewise Inhibited in this Canon. But this admits of a Multitude of Answers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Quod haec Dictio, Clericus, ex vi verbi, non comprehendit Episcopum.</hi> This word Clerk in the Canon Law, reacheth not to a Bishop or a Peer of the Realm, saith <hi>Lyndwood</hi> in his third Book, <hi>cap. de Locatis &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Irregularity incurred by Judicature in Causes of Blood, is only <hi>Jure positivo,</hi> and therefore dispensable by the Pope, saith <hi>Covarruvias in Clem. Si furiosus. Par.</hi> 2. §. 5. <hi>no</hi> 1. And here in <hi>England</hi> it is Dispenced with in Bishops by the King, who in his Writs or Summons to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Commands the Lords Spiritual, without any exception of Causes of Blood, to joyn in all Matters and Consultations whatsoever, with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Peers of the Kingdom, these Summons being unto them a sufficient Dispensation so to do.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Othobon</hi> himself, Inhibiting other Clerks to use these Secular Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hath a <hi>Salvo</hi> to preserve the Priviledges of our Lord the King, whereby he may use any of their Services, in that kind; when he shall see Cause; in the Title called <hi>Ne Clerici jurisdictionem saecularem exerceant.</hi> A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lyndwood</hi> in his Gloss upon that Text doth instance, in the Clerks of the Chancery, and others. Nor are these Writs of the Bishops Dispensations only, but Mandates also and Bishops have been Fined at the Kings-Bench, and elsewhere, for Absenting themselves from Counsels in Parliament (as now they are required to do) without the Kings special leave and Licence first Obtained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When they are forbidden <hi>Interesse</hi> to be present, the meaning is, not (in the very Canons themselves) that they should go out of the Room, but only that they should not be present, to add Authority, Help, or Advice, to any Sentence Pronounced against a particular individual Person, in a Cause of Blood, or mutilation of Members. If he be present <hi>Authorizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, consilium, opem, vel operam dando,</hi> then he Contracts an Irregularity, and not otherwise saith our <hi>Lyndwood</hi> out of <hi>Innocentius.</hi> And the Canon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57523:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reacheth no further, than to him that shall Pronounce Sentence of Death, or mutilation upon a particular Person.

            <p n="4">4. These Canons are not in Force in <hi>England</hi> to bind the Subjects of this Kingdom, for several reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they are against his Majesties Prerogative, as you may see it clearly in the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Writ of <hi>Summons</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abolished by the Statute of 25<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> It is his Majesties Prerogative declared at <hi>Claredon,</hi> that all such Ecclesiastical Peers, as hold of him by Barony, should Assist in the Kings Judicatures, until the very actual pronouncing of a Sentence of Blood. And this holdeth all along from <hi>Henry</hi> the first, down to the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitguift</hi> as a Commissioner upon the Life of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, not to be named without Horror; and as the first keeper and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer, of <hi>Robert,</hi> the most Noble Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> after that Commotion in <hi>London.</hi> And to say, that this Canon is Confirmed by Common Law in this Kingdom, is a very Tale; there being nothing in all the Common Law that tends that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It hath been Voted in the House of Commons this very Sessions of Parliament, that no Canons sithence the Conquest, either Introduced from <hi>Rome,</hi> by Legatine Power, or made in our Synods, never had, in any Age, nor yet have at this Instant, any Power to bind the Subjects of this Realm, unless they be Confirmed by Act of Parliament. Now these Canons which Inhibit the presence of Church-men, in Causes that concern Life, and Member, were never Confirmed by any, but seem to be Impeached by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and sundry Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The whole House of Peers have this very Session despised, and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this Canon Law, which some of the young Lords cry up again, in the same Session, and in the very same Cause, to take away the Votes of the Bishops, in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> For by the same Canon-Law, that forbids Clergy-men to Sentence, they of that Coat are more strictly Inhibited, to give Testimony in Causes of Blood. <hi>Nec etiam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test esse Testis, vel Tabellio, in Causa Sanguinis,</hi> saith my <hi>Lyndwood, fol.</hi> 146. <hi>pag.</hi> 2. For no man co-operates more to a Sentence of Death, than the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon whose attestation the Sentence is principally Founded, saith <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez,</hi> in his <hi>Practica Criminalis, Cap.</hi> 98. <hi>Dist.</hi> 21. And yet have these Lords admitted as Witnesses, produced by the Commons against the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Armache,</hi> together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London</hi>; the which Lords now Command all Bishops to withdraw, in the Agitation of the self-same Cause. Bishops it seems may be Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to kill outright; but may not sit in the Discussion of the Cause, to help (in Case of Innocency) a distressed Noble man, whereas the very <hi>Gothish</hi> Bishops (who first invented this exclusion of Prelates from such Judicatures) allow them to Vote, as long as there is any hope left of clearing the party, or gaining of Pardon, <hi>Concil.

                  </gap>,</hi> and Judge <hi>Doderidge</hi> (which two last were well vers'd in the Canon Law) delivered positively, that all Irregularities intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Canons upon Ecclesiastical Persons concerning matters of Blood, were taken away by the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And were repugnant to the Statute of 25 of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. as restraining the Kings most just Prerogative, to imploy his own Subjects in such functions, and Offices, as his Predecessors had done; and to allow them those Priviledges and Recreations, as by the Laws and Customs of this Realm they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoyed: Notwithstanding the Decree, <hi>de Clerico venatore,</hi> or the Constitution, <hi>Ne Clerici saecularem jurisdictionem exerceant,</hi> or any other in that kind.</p>
            <p>The only Objection, which appears upon any Learning or Record, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Church-mens Voting in this Kingdom in Causes of Blood, are two, or three Protestations entred by the Bishops amongst the Records of the upper House of Parliament, and some few passages in the Law-Books rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereunto. The Protestation the Lords now principally stood upon, is that of <hi>William Courtney</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of Priviledges, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Collected for the Lords of the upper House. In the Margen whereof, that passage out of <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> whereof we spake before, about Clergy-mens agitation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Blood, is unluckily inserted, and for want of due Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point, and some suspition of partial carriage in the Bishops in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> hath been eagerly pressed upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, by some of the Lords, in such an unusual, and unaccustomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that if the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (who offered to speak unto this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) had not voluntarily withdrawn himself, he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rest of the Bishops had been (without hearing) Voted out of the House, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of a Splinter of that Cause, of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> which came not neer any matter of Blood. An Act never done before in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House, and now Executed suddenly, without the least Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the merit of the Cause. The only words insisted upon in this Protestation in question, are these: Because in this present Parliament certain matters are agitated, whereat it is not Lawful for us, according to the Prescript of Holy Canons to be present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by, and by after they say, these matters are such, in the which <hi>nec possumus, nec debemus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse,</hi> we neither can nor may be present.</p>
            <p>This is the Protestation most stood upon; for that of Arch-Bishop <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel,</hi> 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. (at what time the Bishops going forth, left their Prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies notwithstanding with the Lay-Lords, and consequently continued pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Judicature, in the eye and Construction of the Law) it is not so full, and ample as this of <hi>Courtney's.</hi> And therefore I must apply my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to this Protestation principally, which are diverse and fit to be weighed and understood.</p>
            <p>First, I do observe, that Bishops never Protested or withdrew, in Cases of Blood, but under the unsteddy Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second only. Never before, never after the time, of that unfortunate King, from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57523:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conquest to this present Parliament, for ought appeareth in Record or History. And that one Swallow should make us such a Spring, and one Omission should create a Law or Custome, against so many Actions of the <hi>English</hi> Prelates, under so many Kings before, so many Kings and Queens after that young Prince, seems unto me a strange Doctrine. Especially when I consider that by the Rules of the Civil and Canon Law, a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station dies with the Death of him that makes it; and is Regularly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, and disannulled, <hi>Per contrarium actum subsequentem protestationem,</hi> by any one subsequent Act, varying from the tenour of the said Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station. <hi>Reg. juris. Jo. Baptist. Nicolai. par.</hi> 2. Now that you may know, how the Prelates carryed themselves in this Point, and actually voted in Causes of Treason, and sometimes to Blood, before <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I refer me to what I cited before out of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (and he out of <hi>Stephanides</hi>) concerning <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> Condemned by his Peers Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical and Temporal, about 15 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>: Arch-Bishop <hi>Stratford</hi> acquitted of high Treason in Parliament, by four Prelates, four Earls, and four Barons, under <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d. Antiquitates Britanniae, pag.</hi> 223. 4 <hi>Edward</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Roger de Mortimer, Berisford, Travers,</hi> and others, adjudged Traytors by the Earls, Barons and Peers, 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>Thomas de Berkley</hi> was acquitted of Treason, <hi>in pleno Parliamento,</hi> &amp;c. And especially I refer me to that Roll of 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50: Which avers that Judgments and Ordinances, in the time of that Kings Progenitors, had been avoided by the absence of the Clergy; which makes the Commons thereto pray, that the Prelates would make a Procurator, by whom they might in all Judgments of Blood, be at the least legally, if they durst not be bodily present in such Judgments. And then for the practice sithence the Reign of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the first of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> the Commons thank the Lords Spiritual and Temporal for their good and rightful Judgment in freeing the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> from Treason. 3 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> the Commons pray a Confirmation of the Judgment, given upon the Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. 5 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> Sir <hi>John Oldcastle</hi> is Attainted of Treason and Heresie, by the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal. 28 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Treason, before the Lords Spiritual and Temporal; 31 <hi>Henry</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devon</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so down to the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> Case, wherein 22<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Maij. 1626. ten Bishops are joyned, with ten Earls, and ten Barons, in the disquisition and agitation of that supposed Treason. I leave it therefore to the Judgment of any indifferent man, whether these Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations made all under one Kings Reign, and dying with the Parties that made them, can void a Right and Custom, grounded by a continual Practice to the contrary, in all other Tryals that have been sithence the Conquest, to this present Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is fitting we know, the Nature of a Protestation, which some peradventure may mistake, <hi>Protestatio est animi nostri declaratio, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris acquirendi, vel conservandi, vel damnum depellendi causa facta,</hi> saith <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius, Calvin,</hi> and all the Civilians. No Protestation is made by any man (in his Wits) to destroy his own Right (and much less another mans) but to acquire or preserve some Right, or to avoid and put off some Wrong, that was like to happen to the party or Parties that make the Protestation. As here in <hi>Courtneys</hi> Protestation, the Prelates in the first place, conceive a Right and Power they had, voluntarily to absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57523:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whilst some matters were treated of, at that time in that House of Lords; which by the Canon Law (the breach whereof the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> did in those times vindicate with far more severity, than they did the transgressions of the Laws of God) they were not permitted to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at; and all this, not for want of Right to be there in all Causes, but for honesty, and preservation of their Estates, as it is in the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In the second place they did preserve their former Right as Peers, which they still had, (though voluntarily absenting of themselves) <hi>More solito interessendi, considerandi, tractandi, ordinandi &amp; definiendi,</hi> all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, Acted and Executed in that Parliament.</p>
            <p>And in the Last place, they protest, against any loss of Right, of being or Voting in Parliament, that could befal them, for this voluntary absent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves at this time.</p>
            <p>And where, in this Protestation, is there one word to prejudice their Successors, or to authorize any Peer, to Command his fellow Peer, called thither by more Antient prescription of time, and by the same Writs of Summons, that himself is, to withdraw and go out from this Common Council of the Kingdom?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we do not certainly know, what these matters were, whereat Arch-Bishop <hi>Courtney</hi> conceived the Prelates neither could, nor ought to be present. These matters are left in loose, and general words in that Protestation. Some conceive indeed, it was at the Condemnation of <hi>Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silian, Brambre,</hi> the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi> and others. See <hi>Antiquit. Brit. pag.</hi> 286. But the notes of Priviledges belonging to the Lords (collected by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) do with more reason a great deal, assign this going forth of the Prelates, to be occasioned, by certain Appeals of Treason, advanced in that Parliament, by the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> against <hi>Alexander</hi> Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>York</hi>; whom the Popish Canons of those times (as you know) exempted, as a Sacred Person, from the cognisance of King or Parliament; and therefore the rest of the Bishops as the squares went then, neither could, nor ought to be present, and parties, to break upon the Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Immunities, and Priviledges of that great Prelate. But the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> is not the Arch-Bishop, but the President of <hi>York</hi>; and to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any such Exemptions, and Immunities from the cognisance of the King or Parliament, amounts at this time to little less than Treason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore is th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Protestation very unseasonably urged, to thrust out any Protestant Prelate from Voting in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a Protestation in the Civil or Canon Law (for the Law of this Land knoweth it not) is but a Testation or Witnessing before-hand of a mans own mind or Opinion, whereby we that Protest, provide to save, and preserve our own Right for the time to come. It concludes no man besides our selves, no Stranger to this Act, no Heir, no Successor; but (if it be admitted) sticks, as inherent in the Singular, and individual Person, until either the Party dies, or the Protestation be withdrawn, and revoked. And therefore what is a Protestation made by <hi>William Courtney,</hi> to <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Laud</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> to bind <hi>Thomas Morton</hi>? And what one Rule in the Common Law of the Land, in the journal Book, or in the Records of the Town, can be produced to exclude the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual from sitting and Voting in Causes of Blood? They were sometimes (by the great favour of the King, the Lords, and the Commons, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57523:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
permitted to absent themselves; never, before this time, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lay-Lords, to forbear their Votes, in any Cause whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that was agitated in Parliament. So our Law-Books say, that the Prelates by the Canon Law may make a Procurator in Parliament when a Peer is to be Tryed, which is enough to shew their Right thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10 <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th, fol.</hi> 6. <hi>B. placit.</hi> 17. And that, it is only the Canon-Law, that inhibits them to Vote in Sanguinary Causes. <hi>Stamford</hi> pleas of the Crown, <hi>fol.</hi> 59. The Canon Law, saith <hi>Stamford,</hi> in a distinct and separated Notion; and therefore not grown in his Age, to any such U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance or Custom, as made it Common Law, or the Law of this Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> But the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (and Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> before him) did alwayes forbear to Vote in Causes of Blood, and did voluntarily retire out of the House when this Cause of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> came to any serious Agitation. Neither putting this withdrawing of the Prelates to any Vote, nor offering to enter any Protestation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> That Bishop had no opportunity to enter Protestations, which you shall never find to have been offered by the Prelates, but in Plein Parliaments, when the three Bodies are together. And his voluntary withdrawing of himself, he may live to Repent him of, if he shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be questioned for the same, at the Kings-Bench or elsewhere. He was called thither by his Writ (which he did not so easily Obtain) to sit, and not to withdraw himself from Parliament, when he pleased. Besides his extraordinary Obligations to the Lords, at this time whom he could not offend without great suspicion of high Ingratitude. He is the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that ever was fetched out of the Tower, and brought to sit in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament by the Black-Rod. And therefore we are not so much to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Prelates Opinions, or Actions in this kind; as the reasons he gave for the same, which (as I have heard them Rehearsed) are, to speak modestly of them, no Demonstrations. His first and main Reason, was that of the Record and Statute of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> That it is the Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of that Calling, not to intermeddle in matters of Blood. The <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Honesteté,</hi> signifies decency and Comliness; as though it were a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly and loathsome matter to be a Judge, or to do Right upon a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, to Death or loss of Members. But this is an Imaginary decency, never known in Nature or Scripture, (as I said before) but begotten by Ignorance in the dark Fog and Mists of Popery. Such an Honesty of the Clergy it was, to have a Shaven Crown, to depend upon their Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, to Plead Exemptions, and to refuse to Answer for Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in the Kings Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these Particulars were esteemed in those dayes, the <hi>Honesteté</hi> of the Clergy; and such an Honesty it was in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>England</hi> in the loose Reign of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> to absent themselves when they listed, from this Assembly of the Estate, contrary to the Kings Commands in the Writs of Summons, and to the duties of their places, as Peers of Parliament. Howbeit they shewed more Courtesie (or more Wit at the least) than our present Prelates; for they never offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire themselves in those dayes, before their Protestation was benignly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and suffered to be entred upon the Parliament Roll, by the King, and the Lords, and the House of Commons. The Second Reason of this Prelate, is of the same Nature, and built upon a <hi>Medium</hi> of Sands which is soon undermined and washed away. That although he doubted not of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57523:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Legality or Comliness, of an Ecclesiastical Peer of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to Vote in a Judgment of Blood (as they do continually in the passing of all Appeals and Attainders in Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet because it is not the practice of Prelates in other parts of the Christian World so to do; he thought it better to avoid Scandal and the talk of other Nations: That there being in the High Courts of Parliament and Star-Chamber, Judges enough besides the Prelates, they might without any prejudice to King or Countrey, forbear Voting in these Judicatures. Somewhat the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all our Bishops in <hi>England</hi> are Divines, and Preachers of the Gospel, and consequently of mercy rather than of Judgment: Who never touch upon the sharpness of the Law, unless it be to prepare mens hearts to receive the Comfort of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But this Prelate cannot but know, that these Canons that Oppose the Kings Prerogative, are taken away in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> by the Statute of 25 <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> which they are not elsewhere. And this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (if he have not forgot it) was taught all this in the Case of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity pursued against Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbots,</hi> when this Bishop fearing the Censure of the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> refused to be Consecrated by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots</hi>; unless he the said <hi>Abbots</hi> would procure himself absolved from that Irregularity, which he had Contracted, in killing a man by Chance-medly, which he was enforced at the last to do, this other Prelate (being then in his rising and warm Blood, and liking better of many good Benefices, than of one mean Bishoprick) refusing stiffly to be made Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> upon any other Condition.</p>

            <head>THE Bishop of Lincoln's ARGUMENTS, That Bishops ought not to Vote in Parliament, With the Answers thereunto.</head>
            <p>Arg. I. <hi>BEcause it is a very great hindrance to the Exercise of their Ministerial Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. It is not so much hindrance, as their convene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in General Councils, Synods, Convocations, Assemblies, Classes, and the like in all the Churches Reformed or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is <hi>propter majus bonum Ecclesiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apostles unnecessarily put themselves to more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, to work for their livelyhood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>Arg. II. <hi>Because they do vow and undertake at their Ordination, when they enter into Holy Orders, that they will give themselves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that Vocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. This Vow and undertaking in Ministers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is quite mistaken; the words are in the Bishops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, not in the Ministers Answer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bishop hopes they will give themselves wholly to that, and not to any other Trade or Vocation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wholly, in a Moral, and not in a Mathematical sense that will admit of no Latitude.</p>
            <p>Arg. III. <hi>Because Councils and Canons in several Ages do forbid them to meddle in Secular Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. Councils and Canons against Bishops Votes in Parliament were never in use in this Kingdom, and therefore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57523:10"/>
they are abolished by the Statute of 25 <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. So are they by the same Statute, because the Lords have declared, That the Bishops Vote here by the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this Realm; And all Canons that Cross with these are there abolished.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So are they by the same Statute, as thwarting the Kings Prerogative, to call Bishops by Summons to Vote in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So are they by the Vote in the House of Commons, 21 <hi>Maij.</hi> 1641, Because they are not Confirmed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Argument was deserted by Mr. <hi>Perpoint,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to be but an <hi>Argumentum ad hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. IIII. <hi>Because the twenty four Bishops have a dependancy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arch-Bishops, and because of their Oath of Canonical obedience to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. They have no dependancy upon the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but in points of Appeal and Visitation only, and owe them no Obedience but in these two points; None at all in Parliament, where they are <hi>Pares,</hi> they are equals, and as <hi>Bracton</hi> tels us, <hi>Par in Parem non habet imperium.</hi> What hath Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience to do with a Vote in Parliament, declared in this Bill to be no Ecclesiastical but a Secular Affair?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Argument reacheth not the two Arch-Bishops, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the Rubrick from this Oath, and therefore is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the passing of this Bill.</p>
            <p>Arg. V. <hi>Because they are but for their Lives, and therefore are not fit to have Legislative Power over the Honours, Inheritances, Persons and Liberties of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Bishops are not for their Lives only, but for their Successors also, in their Land and Honour: As the Earls and Barons also are for their Successors in their Lands and Honours, and holding their Lands in Fee-Simple, may with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Vote in the Honour, Inheritance, Persons and Liberties of others, as others may and do in theirs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many Peers have been Created for their Lives only, and the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> for the Life of his Father, who yet Voted in this House.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Knights Citizens and Burgesses are chosen for one Parliament only, and yet use their Legislative Power, nor will their being Elected difference their Case; for the Lords use that Power in a greater eminency, who are not Elected.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57523:10"/>4. A Burgess that hath a free-hold but for term of Life only, may Vote and assent to a Law in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No such exception ever heard of in the Diets of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the <hi>Corteses</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the three Estates in <hi>France,</hi> where the Prelates Vote in all these points with the Nobility and the Commons.</p>
            <p>Arg. VI. <hi>Because of Bishops dependancy and expectancy of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations to places of greater profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Argument supposeth all Kings and all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be very faulty, if they take the time of their Votes in Parliament from these dependancies and expectancies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may be said of all the Kings great Officers, of all the Noble Members of both Houses, who may be conceived as well as Bishops to have their Expectancies, and consequently to be deprived by this Reason of Voting in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Argument reacheth not at the two Arch-Bishops, and so falls short of the Votes which are to be taken away by this Bill.</p>
            <p>Arg. VII. <hi>That several Bishops have of late much encroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Consciences and properties of the Subjects, and they and their Successors will be much encouraged still to encroach, and the Subjects will be much discouraged from Complaining against such encroachments, if</hi> 26 <hi>of that Order be to be Judges upon these Complaints. The same Reason extends to their Legislative Power in any Bill, to pass for the regulation of their Power, upon any emergent inconveniency by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Argument fights not against Bishops Votes in Parliament, but against their Votes in Convocation, where (if any where) they have encroached upon the Consciences and Properties of the Subject. Nor yet at the Votes of such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops there as are not guilty of this Offence. Nor need the Subject to be discouraged in Complaining against the like Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, though 26 of that Order continue Judges; for they shall not Vote as Judges in their own Cause, when they are Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charged: And if they should Vote, what were that to the purpose, when the Lay-Peers are still four to one? The Bishops (Assisted with a double Number of Mitred Abbots and Priors) could not hinder the Laws made against the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Alien Cardinals and Prelates, the Provisors, the Suiters to the Popes Consistory under <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d, Rich.</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> 4<hi>th,</hi> Much more may those emergent exhorbitances of the Ecclesiastical
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57523:11"/>
Jurisdiction be soon curbed and redressed in this inequality of Votes between the Temporal and Spiritual Lords. So as this Argument doth not so much hurt the Votes, as it quails the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Bishops, who may justly fear, by this and by the next Argument, that the taking away of their Votes is but a kind of forerunner to the abolishing of their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Arg. VIII. <hi>Because the whole Number of them is interessed to maintain the Jurisdiction of Bishops, which hath been found so grievous to the three Kingdoms, that</hi> Scotland <hi>hath utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it, and Multitudes in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>have Petitioned against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Argument is not against the Vote of Bishops, but against Episcopacy it self, which must be removed because <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done so, and some in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> would have it so, and yet peradventure ten times as great a Number as these desire the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There will be found Peers enough in the Upper-House, to reform any thing that is amiss in the Ecclesiastical Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, although the twenty six Prelates should be so wicked as to oppose it; as there were found Peers enough in that Noble House to curb the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Revenues of the Cardinals under <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> to meet with the Provisors under <hi>Ric.</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> to put all the Clergy into a <hi>Praemunire</hi> under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8, and to Reform the Religion 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> notwithstanding the Opposition of all the Bishops.</p>
            <p>Arg. IX. <hi>Because the Bishops being Lords of Parliament, it set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth too great a distance betwe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> them and the rest of their Brethren in the Ministry which occasioneth pride in them, discontent in others, and disquiet in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is an Argument from Moral Philosophy which affords no Demonstrations. All are not proud that vote in Parliament, nor discontented that are not so imployed. This Argument fights only against their title of being Lords, which is not the Question at this time.</p>
