            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> partly becauſe they ſaw <hi>Samuel</hi> their Iudge to be olde and feeble, and partly, becauſe they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſonnes of <hi>Samuel, Ioel</hi> and <hi>Abiah,</hi> though ruling in the place and ſtead of their Father; yet not walking in the wayes and ſteps of their Father, as diſpayring to haue

               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 11.12</note> 
               <hi>Samuel</hi> when he had vſed many meanes, and many forcible argumentes to diſſwade them from this their malcontented and diſpayring minde, and ſeeing euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no perſwaſions could take any place in their wilfull hartes, doth now at the laſt, call vpon the Lord in the time of Wheate-harueſt, for a ſodaine and miraculous thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſtorme of raine, that thereby, as it were by an other voyce of God, the people might be further certified, both how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly they had offended, and how for their offence the Lorde was highly diſpleaſed with them. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly that <hi>Samuel</hi> had no ſooner called vnto the Lord for that thunder and raine, but that preſently his requeſt was heard, and that in terrible manner, in the ſight and hearing of the whole people, they were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: and being wonderfully ſtriken with ſodaine feare, <hi>They deſire <hi>Samuel</hi> to pray to the Lord for them, that they die not,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12871:5"/>
adding theſe wordes (which now I haue read) as a reaſon of their petition, and a confesſion of their deſart: <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we haue ſinned, beſides all our other ſinnes, in aſking vs a King.</hi> What this offence was which the Prophet doth ſeeke ſo many wayes to lay open vnto them, it ſhall the better appeare if we conſider theſe two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall obſeruations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the mightie prouidence, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe of God extended towardes that people, ſo many yeeres together, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the tyme of the gouernment of the Iudges. And ſecondly how ſmall &amp; weake the occaſions were for the which they deſire to ſhake off that bleſſed gouernment: as alſo on the other ſide, what great and waighty cauſes they had to haue bin contented with that eſtate wherein God had ſo long and ſo miraculouſly protected them.</p>
            <p>How long the people had liued, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, defended, and gouerned by Iudges, <hi>S.

The firſt was vnder Dukes, as in the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſua.</hi> The ſecond was by Iudges, which differed from <hi>Ioſua,</hi> for he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a gouernour in the time of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, when <hi>Sehon</hi> the King of the <hi>Amorits</hi> and <hi>Ogge</hi> the King of <hi>Baſan</hi> were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and vanquiſhed: but the Iudges were firſt inaugurated and inueſted into their callinges in ſome great diſtreſſes, by the affecting of ſome notable deliuerance. Neither were they like the <hi>Dictators,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced amongſt the Heathen; for they were choſen by the voyces of men, but theſe by the voyce of God him ſelfe. They were choſen out of men of greateſt accompt, and beſt furniſhed for the vndergoing of ſuch a charge: but theſe were rayſed vp miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly out of the inferiour ſort, and loweſt degrees of people, and inabled extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb facs="tcp:12871:6"/>
by the gyftes and preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, as it is ſayd in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Iudges: <hi>The Lord rayſed vp Iudges,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 2.16.18.</note> 
               <hi>which deliuered them out of the handes of their oppreſſours: And when the Lord did raiſe vp any Iudges, the Lord</hi> (as it is ſayd there) <hi>was with that Iudge, and did deliuer the people out of the handes of the enemies all the dayes of that Iudges life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were alſo many differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Kinges which folowed. In the Kinges, ſucceſſion of blood tooke place: in the Iudges it tooke no place. The Kings, had a greater authoritie in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and commaunding then the Iudges would chalenge.

The Kinges did ſome of them ſaue
<pb facs="tcp:12871:7"/>
the people from inuaſions, and ſome not: but the Iudges did euer deliuer them from the hands of their oppreſſours: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue the Hebrewe name <hi>Moſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud 3 9.</note> Sauiours, giuen vnto them, as in the thirde Chapter of the <hi>Iudges</hi> it is ſayd of <hi>Othoniel,</hi> that <hi>the Lord did ſtirre vp a Sauiour vnto the children of Iſrael.</hi> And in the ninth of <hi>Nehemias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehe 9.27.</note> where there is mention made of the former mercies of God during the time of the Iudges: it is added, <hi>that God of his mercie gaue his people Sauiours, who ſaued them out of the handes of their aduerſaries.</hi> Some do adde hereunto, that the Iudges more then any other, were the moſt euident types and figures of that deliuerance which we haue by Chriſt, from the tyrranie of ſinne, death, and Sathan.</p>

               <note place="margin">Pro 21.1.</note> it is the part of vs that are inferiors, to pray to God to renew and guyde their hartes with his principal ſpirit: but in the meane time, in no caſe, either to take vp or moue againſt them, or once in hart to wiſh for the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtate.
