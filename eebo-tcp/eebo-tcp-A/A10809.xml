            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Two dayes trauailed hee throughout thoſe deſarts of <hi>Greece,</hi> onely accompanied with his Page, and a Currier which was his guide. The thirde day hee had ſight of a mightie conuoy of Cammils, being at leaſt ſixe thouſand, with their Marchants, which came from <hi>India,</hi> bound into <hi>Egypt.</hi> To thoſe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Marchants he ſent, requiring them of vittailes to relieue his ſtore: his wine and oyle, by a caſuall happe being loſt, and no place of refuge néere to relicue it by a farre way: which the Marchants verie kindly graunted, furniſhing his wants of what he required, and they could ſpare.

               <p>The Marchants, repoſing themſelues of this noble cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, were driuen to a <hi>non plus,</hi> what to aunſwer, but as men amazed, ſtoode gazing one the other in the face, whoſe timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the knight perceiuing, dreading no colours, mounting himſelfe with his ſtaffe charged in the reſt, ſingled himſelfe, and putting forwarde, required thoſe gallants to ſay what their buſineſſe was. The <hi>Tartares</hi> perceiuing him to bee a knight at Armes, and they ſouldiours, anſwered.</p>
               <p>Sir, what thou art we know not, but by thy ſeeming, if wée be not deceiued, thou art a man of Armes, whom we come not in any ſort to moleſt. But for theſe baſe fugitiues, which haue wronged our King of his cuſtomes, due to be payde of all men paſſing his Countrey, we come to be ſatiſfied, which we will haue, or leeſe our deareſt liues in gaining thereof: therefore gentle ſir, as we haue declared the truth of our comming, take no part with them, if thou loueſt thine owne welfare. The knight which heard their reaſonable anſweres, could not take any thing ſpoken in ill part, vntill he had examined the truth of the marchants, and whether there was any ſuch cuſtome due to their king as they required, which on there great oathes they denied, vowing vnto them by all ſolemne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations they could vſe, that there were none belonging to the King, but outlawes, and ſuch as liued on the ſpoyles of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailers, neither was there euer any cuſtome required of anie prince in their time, ſome of them hauing vſed that paſſage ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares before.</p>
               <p>The good knight which was loath to wrong either part, could not tell what to anſwer, conſidering the guiſe of men, which is to make the beſt of their owne matters, called the chéefeſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, for in them he had moſt truſt, and examining ſtrictlie each particular, of their abode, their cauſe of trauaile, and their place whither they were bounde, ſwore them to the truth of all
<pb facs="tcp:2066:9"/>
what they had ſpoken, which donehe returned againe vnto the armed outlawes, which attended his anſwer, ſaying.</p>
               <p>Falſe villaines, and deceitfull wretches, how dare you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbers and diſturbers of peaceable trauailers, ſo much to abuſe the reuerent name of your king, who is altogither vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your trecheries, as to make his authoritie a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your bloodie mindes, and ſpoyling the goodes of honeſt men, that you haue abuſed both him and vs, you ſhall all well know. Therefore if your buſineſſe be no other then I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize it is, depart, or you ſhall know, to your great ſorrow, and hearts griefe, that you haue met with him which will not bee dared with your high lookes.</p>
               <p>The Tartares hearing him ſpeake ſo like himſelfe, and with ſuch reſolution, could well haue forborne to deale with him, or his companie, yet ſetting their reſt vpon the courage of their companie, which were all well appoynted, and better moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, defied the knight, who taking all aduantages, ſeeing their reſolution ſuch, encouraging the Marchants, who were all fearefull of looſing what they had, began moſt honourably to aſſaile them whoſe power was as brauely reſiſted a long time: in this conflict was moſt honourable deedes of Armes by the noble knight done, who euer cheared his companies, which were all likely to runne away.

as he beſt could for his owne ſafetie, which the noble knight perceyuing, ſo hotlye purſued, that many Tartares ſoules hee ſent to death: Others without armes, legges, and other limmes, lay weltering in theyr owne bloud, that it was lamentable to ſée, ſuch a Maſſacre amongeſt men, if they had beene ſuch, as in men liuing in Princes obedience they ſhould bée.</p>
               <p>Theſe Peſſants thus flying, and the noble <hi>Edwarde</hi> wearied with purſute of them, night béeing at hande, ſo as it was not to bee diſcerned a friend from a foe, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe vnto his companyes Tentes, in a Valley di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt from them a good Myle, hée was there at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares ſet vppon by one of their leaders, which had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him in the battaile, who gathering together an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth of his ſtraggling Conſorts, knowing him to bée gone that way, encountered him, who béeing wearie of the toyle taking ſo lately, had like to haue put him to the foyle, béeing ſo at the aduauntage aſſayled.

Of whome béeing cleared, breathing himſelfe, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome ayre, hee might eſpie before him running vp the Hill, a Gallant mounted on a Milke white Courſer, which the knight imagined ſhoulde bee the commaunder of thoſe companies which laſt aſſayled him, with whom deſirous to acquaint himſelfe: hee gaue ſpnrres to his horſe, and ſo earneſtly followed this Companion, who little thought of his comming, that ouer-taking him before hee was looked for, hee areſted him ſo ſoundlie with his blade of authoritie, as he made him forſake his Horſe, to taſte the ſwéeteneſſe of the

earth, which done he diſmounted himſelfe, ſaying: Abide you gallant, and accept a ſtraungers courteſie. I promiſe thée falſe fellon as thou art thou diſhonoureſt thy Maiſter, which made thée a receiuer of cuſtome, to run away when payment is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: wherefore ſéeing there is no more truſt in thée, héere in your kings name, I diſcharge thée of this office. And ſo at one blow taking his head with his Curtelax from his bodie, left his ſoule to him that had moſt right.</p>
               <p>This latter taſke accompliſhed, breathing himſelfe a while, hee mounted his Horſe, and pacing eaſily towardes the Tents, which by the fires light hée had ſight of, hée was mette with diuerſe of his companie of the Marchants, who béeing men of more valewe then manie of the reſt, had put themſelues in ſearch of this woorthie Knight, paſſing all the way, thorowe ſo manie heapes of deade men, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous wounded bodyes, that they admired his worthineſſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plawding his valour, and ſtill prayſing him, giuing him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, aboue all men at Armes, whatſoeuer they had either heard of or ſéene.</p>

But beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyed of the Knight, who ſtoode ſtill on his guarde, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of anie more ſuch vnexpected cuſtomers, making readie for the fight.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard gentils, how the Ladie <hi>Vallia</hi> with thoſe Merchants, was in the vnfrequent Iland, left without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuſtenaunce or reléefe, other then ſuch wilde rootes, hearbes, and fruites, as naturally had their beeing in that barraine ſoyle, through which vnuſuall diet, and a conceited feare of more inſuing daungers, the Lady fell ſicke of an extreame malladie, for whoſe recouerie no helpe could auaile: yet did thoſe religious Hermits and Fryers the beſt they could. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others of the companie, to amende theyr diet, employed theyr labours to fiſh, and to making of ginnes, to take foule and ſuch beaſts as was there to be had, onely
<pb facs="tcp:2066:11"/>
for her content, but in vaine do they ſéeke to mittigate her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, or recouer her health, ſuch was her gréefe for her Lords abſence, and feare of more harſh purſuit of the enemies.</p>
               <p>In this perplexed eſtate continued this good Lady, paſt all hope of recouerie, giuen quite ouer to death by all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, who ceaſed not their prayers for her good health. But as in all extremes the fauour of our God is moſt ſhewne, ſo beholde in this, <hi>Vallia</hi> lying on her hard cabine, ſlumbring as in a dreame, there appeared vnto her thoughts a beautifull Perſonage, ſo glorious in his attyre, as ſhe beholding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſéemed to lacke her ſenſes.

               <p>This ſaid, clapping his wings, as to her ſéemed, hée left the caue, and departed, wherewith <hi>Vallia,</hi> as one awaked from a trance, ſéeming as one of her wits to be bereft, cried mainely out for helpe, whoſe ſodaine motions cauſed them all to feare her death was at hand: yet comforted they her all they might with ſuch ſpéech &amp; words of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly pleaſures as in ſuch times is conuenient to be vſed, ſo long continuing their talke, that in the end graſping her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the neck of her truſty <hi>Alinda:</hi> ſhe raiſed her ſelfe in her bed, and fetching a déep ſigh, ſaid.

This ſaid, bidding them good night, ſhée fell into a moſt ſwéete ſléepe, in which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the morning was farre ſpent. Before which time the company which vſually went about their vndertaken la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for getting their victuals, from the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines deſcried a ſmall ſayle at ſea, which they viewed, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly waiting by a compaſſe they had, which way ſhée bare: but ſo long gazed they, that the gale blowing hie, and fitting their cauſe, which were bounde thither for water, hauing ſpent their ſtore at ſea, through ſuch continuall foule wether which they indured, in ſuch manner, that they durſt ceaſe no land for feare of daunger. They deſcried their hull, which ſéene, well was hée that might make moſt haſte with the firſt tydings, thinking the time long vntill they came to the caue, where béeing néere ſpéechleſſe with the haſt they made, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine feare poſſeſſed all the companie, ſpecially <hi>Alinda,</hi> whoſe heart was at her héele vntill ſhee heard them deliuer the cauſe of their ſpéedie comming, which knowne, God was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in generall.

Therefore if God haue ordained you for our good, and that as Chriſtians you pittie our diſtreſſes, helpe this Lady with vs her friendes, to any place inhabited by Chriſtians, your payment ſhall be large, and your charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble déede rewarded both of God and men.</p>
               <p>The Boatſwayne being a man as full of pitte as courage, hearing this lamentable diſcourſe, and ſéeing the weake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Lady, was moued with remorſe of their good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing his beſt furtherance for their comforts: ſo ſhipping one hogſhead of water for the companie, haſtneth aboord, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him the Fryer and two Marchants, whoſe words wrought ſuch effect with the maſter and the reſt, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was paſte for their paſſage, and the maſter comming a ſhoare, brought with him for the Ladies releefe, ſuch

The Ladies Letters ſigned, which imported her meſſage from the Knight of the holy Croſſe, and the meſſenger appointed, there was no detracting of time, but with all ſpéed that Horſe could make, he applied his buſineſſe, vntil he came vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> where comming before the Emperour, he deliuered his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were very welcome, taking great pleaſure in the comming of the Lady into thoſe confines, being Lady and wife vnto the Knight which of all men liuing he holde in moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>

This Baſhaw being of a proud and inſolent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, expected great reuerence, which of the common company was giuen him. But our Cauylier ſcorning ſuch baſe faſhions, could not ſtoupe in ſuch maner, wherefore the Baſhawe began in vile ſpéech to taunt him, which he better vnderſtanding then the reſt, though he had not his language ſo perfit, in Italian anſwered his ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereat great excepttions were taken, yet by reaſon of his ſafeconduit, he durſt no quarrell or make ſtay of him, but amongſt the reſt, without fauour, had vittailes and a guide: and ſo mounting his horſe departed, leauing the company to the common guard of the ſouldiers, as is the cuſtome.</p>
               <p>The Baſhawe whom ſpite had moued to choller againſt the Knight, vnderſtanding he left the ordinary paſſage, enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cry quittance with him, by trechery, or as he beſt might, to fulfill his diuelliſh minde: And that night armed a hundreth of his beſt Ianniſaries, whom he hyred to ſlay him, appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them the way to follow the Knight, whom they very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, in ſuch maner haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With this leſſon the naked rogue left them. And ouertaking the Knight, fell in ieſting with his guide, with whom he vſed ſuch pleaſaunt behauiour, that it greatly deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Knight, who made much of him, and willed him to ſtay by the Fountaine where he pitched his Tent, imparting with him ſuch vittailes as he had: when the Knight had well refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed himſelfe, and had ſéene his Horſe well meated with barley which he brought for him, giuing ſtraight charge to the Moore his guide, to maintaine the Fyer which vſually they kept, for defence of the Lyons and wilde beaſts kéeping the deſarts, he tooke him to reſt.</p>
               <p>The Moore hauing now opportunitie to worke his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, taking him from the Tent, beganne ſo to worke with him, that with ſhowes of kindneſſe being his countrey-man, loue of the ſouldiers where he liued, and hope of great reward, he wonne him to effect whatſoeuer he deſired: which done, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the opportunitie offered, he aduentured firſt to enter the Tent, and by ſeuerall péeces tooke the Armour, his ſhield being vnder his head he durſt not touch, and his ſword with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming lace faſtened to his arme, being well as he thought with this, they tooke each of them a Horſe, and leauing both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight and his Page to walke on foote, left them thus in their ſounde ſléepe.</p>
               <p>The trayterous villaines hauing ſped of their buſineſſe, ceaſeth not poaſting from Fyer to Fyer, vntil they had giuen notiſe to all the ſouldiers what they had done, who gathering themſelues togither, ſet on to find the Tent whither they were conducted by the guide and the other ſlaue, his companion in this practiſe. But he that in many perilles had deliuered our braue and endaunted Knight, preſerueth him ſtill for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries honour, as you ſhall note.</p>
               <p>For the villaines gone, and heauy ſlumber oppreſſing him, he fell into a ſound fléep, in which he dreamed, and in his dream

               <p>This chaunce happening, he could not imagine what to do, nor where to ſéeke thoſe miſcreants which ſo had robbed him, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Attentiuely liſtned the Knight, to note if he could here any voyce, and bnſily bethought him what was beſt to doo in this extreme, beléeuing verily that he was betrayed yet making no ſemblant thereof, cauſed the Page to bring from out his tent a caſe of Piſtolles with his powder and ſhotte, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Page carryed, with thoſe he charged the boye, if occaſion ſerued, to doo his beſt ſeruice, and to giue him that helpe he could, which faithfully he promiſed to accompliſh.</p>
               <p>Scarſly had they determined what to doo, but they might diſcry the two Moores gallopping on their horſes, which by their white Algoſines they perfitly did knowe, leading the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which cloſely followed them, making all the haſte they could.</p>
               <p>This fight made him verily beléeue that thoſe villaines had betrayed him, and that thoſe Horſemen were they which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to worke him miſchiefe, for whome hée purpoſeth to prouide, ſéeking his beſt aduauntage to continue the fighte, ſheltering himſelfe cloſe to a ſhrubbed Oliue Trée, which grewe thereby, diſtaunt from his Tent a furlong or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, by which they muſt néedes paſſe that came to ſéeke him.</p>

The Moores approaching, making readie to take them firſt, which were the Authours of this ſtratageme, the Page with a Piſtolle killed the one, and the other whiche was his guide, with his Curtilex hée vnhorſed, dooing him no other harme. But perceiuing who hée was, thought to ſaue him aliue, to bee a guide for him, if hée eſcaped out of thoſe Mountaines, ſo binding him hande and foote, hée put a gagge in his mouth, and caſt him from him: which done, making readie to entertaine the reſt, hée ſpéedeth to his choſen Trée: where long hée had not ſtayed, but the others gallopping came as ſwiftly as they could, where finding the two Horſſes without men, made them ſtande, but to their coſt, for his Piſtolles being prouided, by them the foremoſt two loſt their liues. Which done, hée armed himſelfe to defence, euer annoying them as hée ſawe his moſt aduauntage, whileſt the Page with his Piſtolles did his part, paying ſurely all thoſe that hée made offer to hitte. A hardie broyle and daungerous fight endured this Noble Engliſh Knight, which for all their great multitudes was not diſmayed at all, but in the middeſt of his diſtreſſe, to the encouragement of his poore Page, cryed ſtill <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> Saint <hi>George</hi> for England, neuer making any ſhewe of diſcouragement, albeit his woundes were many, which bled moſte greeuouſly, yet ſtoode hée, to the great euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of them all, brauely and ioyfully encouraging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with hope of theyr ſhamefull downe-falles. In which ayded by him whome hée zealouſly ſerued, hée brought to confuſion, ſometimes aſſayling, ſometimes defending, as hée beſt could finde opportunitie, and greateſt aduauntage, euer ſpéeding one or other, ſo that hée neuer ſtrooke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine.</p>
               <p>Continuing his dole with ſuch a kinde of deuotion, that the better part of their Army béeing ſlaine, and the moſte of the reſt lying grouelling for life, amongſt them, he eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the verye principalleſt hauing on his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

who being none of the beſt men, ſéeing the others haue ſuch ill ſucceſſe, was flying as faſt as he could, but the Knight percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, got him to horſe, and ſo earneſtly followed him, that to his great coſt he ouertooke him, in ill time, as he might well witneſſe: for with ſuch authoritie he arreſted this run-away, that he had no leiſure to aſke at whoſe ſute, but being an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pawned his life for ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <p>This companion hauing his paſport to the great diuell, ſigned and ſealed by the hand of a noble Engliſh Knight, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, and poaſting backe amongſt the reſt, payde them more then he owed, by many a Turkes life.</p>
               <p>By this time the day gaue him faire light, ſo that he might well ſée his worke, wherfore ſuch as could make ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſéeing the ill ſucceſſe their fellowes had, ſtood not on any more poynts of manhood then was fit they ſhould, but without taking leaue, made what haſte they could for their ſafetie.</p>
               <p>The noble <hi>Edward</hi> ſéeing his companions gone, and none left able to make any reſiſtance, went to ſuruay them, which were all goodly fellowes, and well appointed after their faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, amongſt which, he found one Spanyard, who was newly taken in Turky, and turnde Turke: this fellowe had ſome knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight, and was abiding in <hi>Gebraltare,</hi> when by the Turkes he was betrayed to the Gouernour.

So long rid he in this manner, that in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, about the going downe of the Sunne, hee might diſcrie a troupe of Camilles laden, guarded with thrée or foure naked mountenaries, to theſe the knight ſpedde him in all the haſte, making ſuch way, that hée ſoone ouertooke them, whome encountring, hée ſayde. Tell me villaines of whence yee are, yea, and where had yée theſe Camilles with thoſe marchandize in your kéeping. The villaine mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hearing the knight vſe theſe ſpéeches, vttered with a hoarſe voyce and a looke threatning death, trembling as though they were readie to receiue their iudgement and preſent execution of life, kiſſing firſt the grounde, and after his féete, beſought him to take compaſſion of them, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what ſort they hadde the Camilles, which they hadde taken from others which hadde them in charge, belonging to thoſe Theeues which hadde ſpoyled the Lady of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

The knight vnderſtanding by theyr talke that they could giue him notice of the ſpoyled bodyes, queſtioned them further, commaunding them on paine of theyr liues, to tell him where the Chriſtians were, that were lately maiſters of thoſe Camilles, in dooing which theyr liues ſhould goo vntouched, or otherwiſe they ſhould there finiſh their daies.</p>
               <p>The villaines which would more willingly haue béene further off, when they ſawe their liues was to bee ſaued for a matter of ſuch ſmall importaunce with them, ſayde. The ſunne hath not yet two times declined his power, ſince certaine Chriſtians trauailing theſe mountaines, were encountred by robbers, that haue their continuall béeing not farre off, who ſlaying the people, left theſe Camilles and goods in poſſeſſion of their ſlaues to conduct them to theyr caue, which wee haue ſlaine, and humbly beſéech thée of pardon.</p>

               <p>The villaines which ſawe howe booteleſſe it was to perſwade, yéelded theyr conſentes, and haſtned with ſo good ſpeede, that they ſhortly arriued at the place, where they founde the mangled carcaſes of the flaine Chriſtians, welte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their gore.</p>

The Gouernour hearing this comfort, well noating the manlike countenance and corage of the Knight, bending himſelfe vnto him, rendered many heartie thankes for thoſe kinde fauoures, and embracing the Knight as his weake arms would giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After theyr horſes were vſed as they ought, he commaunded the ſlaue to be bounde, taking order with his companie that one ſhould watch whilſt the other ſlept, and to take diligent care of their welfares, that they were not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at vnawares.</p>
               <p>This charge the carefull attendaunts faythfully kept and performed, the day appearing, they looſed the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine from his bondes, ordering the horſes and each thing

For which, courſing like men poſſeſt with a furie in purſuite of the Ladie, the knight hath gained his deſires, who requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Peaſant (quoth the knight) it is not thy ſpéech of their valour that can daunt me, or cauſe me to turne my backe, vpon thoſe diueliſh companions. But as I am a Knight, and a true Engliſh man, or euer haue hope to beholde my natiue Country, were they a thouſand to my ſelfe alone, armed as I am, in the name of my God, and hope of my rightful cauſe, I would aſſaile them. And ſo arming himſelfe, chearing his Page, and his aſſociates, hee mounted his horſe, couching his ſtaffe in his reſt, he put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to meete the companie of robbing théeues, who was no ſooner eſpied of them, but without word ſpeaking moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly they all aſſailed him, who were all ſo well reſiſted, and ſo eagerly encountred of the Knight, as they had ſmall cauſe to boaſt them of their gaines. Euerie blow, with blow, redoubled this noble Brytaine on the robbers, doing ſuch feates of honor and chiualrie, that it amazed them to ſee: but more terrified they were, that muſt of force abide his furie, who ſparing not his ſtrength, laide on them with ſuch courage, crying Saint <hi>George,</hi> that after many ſharpe alarums on either

The Captaine of which route, with foure others his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, being men of valour, and reſolution, ſéeing the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of their companie, ſought to reuenge their bloods with their greateſt power. And encloſing him on each ſide, layde about them in ſuch manner, that the Knight was by them greatlie endaungered. In this aſſault was his horſe ſlaine, when fighting a foote, eſpying his beſt aduauntage, he gored their horſes as they came, and gaue them that their mothers neuer prouided for them: yet in deſpite of what hee coulde doo, as the mightieſt manie times bee forced to yéelde, fighting on the grounde, and in the greateſt daunger of life. The Page which ſingled himſelfe from the broyle, wherein hée left the Eaſterling, beſtirred him, whereby hee had leaue to breathe, and being ſomewhat refreſhed, reaching violently one of the robbers by the legge, pulled him perforce from his horſe, mounting himſelfe thereon, and daſhing out his maiſters braines with his héeles.</p>
               <p>The Knight nowe againe mounted, ſo beſtirred him, in that the moſt braueſt of them that liued, coulde well haue affoorded to béene further off, but they which are bounde muſt obey. The game was nowe vied, and they muſt néedes ſée it. So long vied and reuied was it by the Knight, that not one was left to count the ſtake.</p>
               <p>The broyle ended, and euerie act in this maſſacre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Knight beholding thoſe brauing hell-houndes, weltering in their blood, firſt thanking God for his fauour, in ſtrengthening him in that diſtreſſe, reſting himſelfe after his wearie trauaile, hee diſarmed himſelfe, refreſhing his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodie for a time: which done, he haſteneth him vnto the place where they Gouernour and his Ladie remained, whom in the companie of his beloued wife was comforted, where with great ioy he was welcomed, to all his folowers, who with the Ladie, ceaſed not to pray for his good ſucceſſe.</p>

               <p>The Millaine Duke raging with furie, at this vnexpected anſwere: vowed by no ſimple oathes to reuenge him on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, whom he threatned with great afflictions, if hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed: And haſting to ſée the euent of his determinations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatcheth his Ambaſſage to <hi>Florence,</hi> the proweſſe of <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Telone,</hi> and other his fréendes, for theyr ayd in this exployt, willing them to be readie by a day prefixed, at ſome port of his, to them beſt beſéeming good, and moſt eaſie for their conuay. With theſe letters, the meſſengers being gon, great was the preparation made in his owne territories, of men, victualls and munition, whereof there wanted none, ſuch as the Countrey yéeldeth. Such was the haſt and care of thoſe vnto whom the charge of thoſe affaires were committed, that in ſhort time, althings were prouidedin ſuch good order as could be beſired, their onely ſtay was, for their expected power,

which accordingly was puruaide, ſome marching by lande, others with theyr prouiſion by Sea, ſo that in ſhort time they are all well met, at <hi>Millaine,</hi> where they made no long ſtaye, but euery man receiuing his charge.</p>
               <p>The companies appointed for the land, marched forwards in thrée battailes, the foremoſt of which, was led by the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the vauward by the gouernour of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and the Rereward, by the Duke of <hi>Millaine,</hi> who hadde vnder his conduct, all the horſemen, with the carriage and prouiſion.

A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I am, deſirous to ſée the manner of warre: and if thou vouchſafe it, the price of my ſeruice ſhall be imployed for thee.</p>
               <p>The Duke which noted her beautifull face, her kinde ſpéech, and affable countenance, held her for nloeſſe then ſhee ſéemed. And without vſing any circumſtances, gaue her entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: appointing her a place néere his owne perſon: which kindneſſe ſhe verie gratefull accepted, returning many thankes for his honourable acceptance.</p>
               <p>Not long had our yong warriour remained in the campe, whom in her attire we name <hi>Philipo,</hi> but a ſcallie was made by the Citizens, whoſe vittailes waring ſcant, woulde gladlie ſéeke all poſſible meanes to be quit of their enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2066:52"/>
The larum in the campe giuen, all armed and in aray, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipo</hi> was not laſt, but mounted, in very comely and braue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner demeaned hir ſelfe, ventering ſo farre in purſute of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the gates, that ſhée was with her guide taken priſoner, which the Millaine Duke ſeeing, commending the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his new entertained ſouldiour, ſought to reſcue hir. But his ayde came too late. No ſooner was the Ladie within the Citie, but carrying the ſhew of a Cauelere, ſhe had good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, and well intreated. That night the Gouernour with his commaunders being pleaſantly delighted at ſupper, and euerie man recounting what ſeruice they had ſéene and done that day, the captaine whoſe priſoner ſhe was, acquainted the Gouernour what a prize he had that day gotten, leauing nothing vnremembered that might honour her, whome he made reckoning would purchaſe him ſtore of crownes.</p>
               <p>The Gouernour on this report of the Captaine, was verie deſirous to ſée this priſoner, yet for that night made little recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, in the morning early, his mind deuiſing of his nights reſolution, accompanied with his beſt friendes, tooke his occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to walke by the houſe of ſigniour <hi>Vincencio,</hi> where ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, with whom he queſtioned of ſundrie occaſions. After ſome friuilous ſpéech, he enquired for the priſoner, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought before him, whome he ſaluted verie kindly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to ſay of what countrey he was, and what name and parentage. Sir quoth <hi>Philipo,</hi> for ſo lette her be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, what you are I know not, neither deſire I to know, but haue heard that lawes of armes allow not euerie man to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, eſpecially a gentleman. Therefore pardon me, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gouernour or his ſpeciall authoritie, I will not acquaint any with my eſtate, and ſo good ſir quoth ſhe reſt ſatiſfied. Syr quoth the gouernour, your peremptorie ſpéech ſheweth ſome great mind, which I pray God proue ſo happie for your hoſtes ſake. If then I can entreate the gouernour to come or ſend for you, wil you vouchſafe to acquaint him with what I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? True ſir (quoth <hi>Philipo)</hi> you conſtrue my minde right, for which I am beholding vnto you. You are verie pleaſant gentle,

Sir anſwered <hi>Philipo,</hi> the honourable gentleman yet I neuer ſaw, but in regard of his vertues and honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, I both loue and honour him.</p>
               <p>Thankes (quoth the Gouernour) for your good opinion and report of him which you hold an enemy, but happily may proue otherwiſe, for which, if any haue any thing to ſay, either in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or otherwiſe, ſpeake as a friend, I am the man, vnworthie though I be of ſo honourable a place, wherefore if thou haue ought to ſpeake, ſay boldly thy minde, for by the honour of that ſeate which I do now poſſeſſe, I will fréely heare thée, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don whatſoeuer.</p>

                  <hi>Philipo</hi> which ſaw how harſhly ſhe had demeaned her ſelfe, with a bluſhing countenance which might wel haue bewrayed what ſhe was, humbly beſought him of pardon for her vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling offence proteſting by the honour of a ſouldiour, ſhe had no knowledge of him, which the honourable gouernour beléeuing and forgiuing, ſhe ſayde. Noble minded Gouernour, hearing of the wrongs offered you and your people, I craued pardon and leaue of my ſoueraigne the Emperour, to be partaker of your ſeruice, as well to right your iniurie offered you, as for the loue and dutie I owe this countrey where I had my béeing firſt, and iourneying hither, intending what I ſay, was ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed by the Ambaſſadours of the Millaine Duke, who taking me at aduantage, there was ſmall reſiſtance, but yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me their priſoner, had entertainement of the Duke, who vſed mee moſt kindly, yet not content with his fauour, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemie fo your ſtate, and heire of my late deceaſed Lorde Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> in the laſt ſeruice I willingly aduenſured my ſelfe in that manner to come vnto you, and in ſigne of my loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and faith, though I be young and a ſtraunger, whoſe credite yet is not requiſite you ſhould truſt too farre in a time ſo daungerous, yet as I am a Gentleman (which title with my life I will for euer maintaine) bee ruled by mée,

               <p>The Gouernour liſtning to her long diſcourſe, noted her modeſt countenance and courage in deliuering the ſame, yet holding it wiſedome to haue better knowledge of any man, whom he ſhould truſt in a cauſe of ſuch importance, thanked him for his proffer, crauing reſpit for his reſolution therein. And ſo after ſome other courteous ſpéeches, giuing his word to his hoſt for his libertie, hee inuited him to his lodging, where hee was feaſted with great welcome, the gouernour delighting much in his companie and pleaſaunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which in their ſecret diſcourſes, was for matters of ſtate, touching the weale of her people, though the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours leaſt ſuſpect was of her, whoſe right hee gouerned.

               <p>The Captaines ſéeing the Dukes ſignet, gaue him the word, which obtained, about his other buſineſſe he goeth, effecting all things as he wiſhed. The Duke being faſt, thruſting out his torche at the Tent dore, as though the Duke intended to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the <hi>Ferrara</hi> Duke, which lay not farre off, he fained ſpéeche with the guarde, vntill he thought the Gouernors eſpyalls had ſéene the ſigne: When making no longer ſtay, with a Holbart on his neck, taking his way towards the Citie, he paſt with the word without any moleſting. The Gouernor which had hope in his champion, ſlept not his time, but with his horſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other a foote, attended the comming of <hi>Philippo,</hi> to direct them, which made all poſſible haſte, and in good time to all their comforts, met the Gouernour: Vnto whom he briefly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what was done, beſéeching him to let his footemen paſſe, by ſmall companies, to a place by him aſſigned, whither he would conduct them, and at the allarome giuen, to make haſt with his horſemen to their reſchew.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard gentiles of the recouerie of the gouernour of the Rodes, by the noble knight of the Croſſe, who gathering ſtrength and ſome eaſe of his wounds, by the knight his good recure, arriued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Citie, where they made their ſtay, doing ſuch religious ceremonies, as to vowed trauailers appertaineth: where their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was great for the knights loue, whoſe honour they wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for the ſeruice done, in defence of the holy Citie. After the gouernour was well recouered, and all things to their content finiſhed, the knight deſirous to ſée his Ladie whom hee neuer heard off ſince their parting, cauſing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to be ready to depart, and their attendants to puruay them of victuals, for prouiſion paſſing the mountaines: which done, taking theyr leaue of the high prieſts, and the chéefe of all the citie, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them on theyr way, they trauailed without any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vntill they came to the Cittie of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where they ſtayed to refreſh themſelues. In this Citie, there was reſident certaine Spaniſh marchants, who enuying the good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the knight, and the loue was made him by the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy there, moued with reuenge of his counte generall, ſlaine by the Knight of the Croſſe, after their returne from the wars, ſéeking many wayes to intrappe him, and finding no cauſe or meane to accuſe him of any ill, whereby to procure his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee conſorted with his Ianeſaries, who were appointed
<pb facs="tcp:2066:60"/>
to wait on him by ſome pollicie to do him to death, promiſing great rewardes for his paines. Thy fact being committed, theſe hell-hounds whom no conſcience mooued to remorſe, in hope of gaine, vndertooke the action. And vnder ſhewe of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and zeale to him that was a knight at Armes, intruded themſelues into his companie, admitting him to many ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, the better to worke their willes on him, ſéeking opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to ſlay him, taking their occaſion to quarrell for pledging a carrous: which the Knight refuſing, a ſturre began betwéene them, where he receiued many iniuries, and ſome woundes, before hee offered any offence: when the multitude growing about him, and he vnarmed, winding his Mantle about his arme, he reft from one of the Turks his ſemitarie, with which he made ſuch way, that they helde themſelues moſt happieſt, that were fartheſt off.</p>
               <p>The rumour of which broyle, was noyſed thorow the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that thither they came from al parts, to take parts, and to be beholders of the fight. In which, after many déepe wounds gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and many of the vngouerned Ianeſaries ſent to hell, when he could make no more reſiſtance, compelled by the heat of the place, and wearineſſe of the fight, he yéelded himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the handes of the <hi>Iwae,</hi> chiefe Iudge of the Citie, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him to bee his warrant from all men, that no daunger ſhould betide him: on which promiſe he deliuerd his weapon. The Spaniſh Marchant, whom they called <hi>Guido,</hi> ſtanding on his houſe top to beholde this tumult, hoped well that the Knight had bin ſlaine, but it proued contrarie, at which he ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greatly, but more gréeued to pay his promiſed ſummes, which for his life hee durſt not denie, fearing the Ianeſaries ſhould haue ſlaine himſelfe. Which ſeconde gréefe, cauſed the traiterous Spaniard to ſéeke his further trouble, vrging theſe Ieneſaries, to lay vnto the Knights charge, matters of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the ſtate of the Cittie, thereby to cut him off by lawe, which hee, nor the beſt Cauileres of his Countrey, durſt out looke in the face, in anie ſort to attempt ought againſt him of force.</p>

Theſe Ianeſaries ſuborned by large gifts, wrought others to take part with them, who were néere the Viceroy, and the Gawr, which vppon their reports ſummoned the Knight to their iudgement hall, from the priſon where hee lay chayned, vnto whome matter of great vntruth was obiected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate, which hee ſtoutlie denied. But thoſe Curres, which had ſolde his life for money, ſtorming that hee had fauour to ſpeake, offered to ſweare by theyr holie <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caron,</hi> that he with the reſt of his confederates, viewing the Citie in theyr ſecrete walkes, had taken notice of theyr forces, inquyring by circumſtaunces, of ſuch as they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied wich, what numbers of men they had, and howe with vittailes they were relieued. Theſe accuſations ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently vttered agaynſt him, the Viceroy coulde not but examine: and finding him guiltie of the ſame by theyr falſe iudgement, ſentence of death ſhoulde with all ſeueritie paſſe agaynſt him.</p>
               <p>The Knight ſéeing his cauſe daungerous, putting his hope on him that neuer left him comfortleſſe, with a bolde vndaunted ſpirite, and as one that feared not their threates, knowing death was the woorſt, thus ſayd. Reuerend fathers, Iudges of mens cauſes, you haue here by your lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned an innocent man to death, for no cauſe iuſtly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but falſely and vntrulie by enuie, and of your owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, wrought agaynſt me.

Their intended purpoſes that way failing, ſtanding on mine one ſafetie and defence, they haue here falſely accuſed mee of matter neuer thought on by me. But ſay (patrones of iuſtice and honour) that I ſhould haue viewed your forces, what may one naked man do, where are thouſands of braue and gallant ſouldiours?

               <p>The Ianeſaries, who leaſt looked for this fauor to be ſhewed a Chriſtian, mooued ſome other of their friends to vrge againſt him the ſlaughter of thoſe ſouldiers by him murthered, &amp; iuſtice to procéed for breaking the peace in their citie, being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall fort of the land, againſt the law of Armes: which the knight thus anſwered.

The Spaniard which had all that hée exſpected, hauing his life and poſſeſſion of him whom he hated decay, humbly thanking the Baſhaw for their fauour, thought the priſe was high which he was for his pretended treaſons was inioyned to paye, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a counterfeit ioy on his gréeued heart, he departed to his lodging, where, by his owne ſtore, and his Countrey mens ayde, he furniſhed the ſame: which he preſently paide, and had the Priſoner deliuered, whom he moſt kindly intreated, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and ioying with him, ſo long as he remained with him, how vile ſoeuer he intended hee ſhoulde bee vſed at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In which time, came the ſhip, as I haue alreadie tolde you, ſtayed of purpoſe for his deliuerance, to carrie him from thence.

               <p>The Gouernour regarding his honour, but more his oath, when he had ſetled all things in good ſort, he paide his owne Souldiours, and richly rewarded his forraine fréendes, with the ſpoyle of his enemies, to euery mans good content, hauing puruaied a rich and moſt ſumptuous trayne to accompanie him: taking good order for the ſtate and welfare of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, attended with the chéefeſt Lords and gentles of the countrey, he left the Cittie and by eaſie iournies, paſſed on the way to <hi>Rome</hi> beguiling the wearineſſe of theyr iourney with ſundry paſtimes and ſports, vntill they came by long and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent trauaile to drawe towards the Cittie, when by theyr meſſengers, they aduertiſed the Emperour of theyr comming: vnto whome they all were moſt heartilye welcome, as was manifeſt by the fauourable and kinde entertainment of theyr tydings bringer: Whome the Emperour moſt honourablye feaſted, dooing him all the honour that coulde bee deuiſed. With this newes, the Emperour could not bee quiet vntill
<pb facs="tcp:2066:65"/>
hee hadde aduertiſed the Princeſſe <hi>Vallia</hi> with the ſame: Who knowing better then the Emperour, the onely cauſe of theyr comming, ſetled a ſhewe of much gladneſſe at the hearing thereof: then queſtioning the occaſions that brought them thither, wherewith the Emperour was nothing acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

The next morning by riſing of the Sunne, they were horſed to méete thoſe noble ſtraungers on the way, which accordinglye was done in the moſt gallaunteſt order that euer coulde be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed.</p>
               <p>This done, ſending theyr curreres before to giue notice of theyr neare approching, they left the Cittie, ryding neere, vntill the ſonne had brought the mid day to an ende. At which time, the firſt intelligencer gaue worde, they had diſcryed them within tenne miles: and ſo as on their iourney they drewe neere, they were euer aduertiſed, as time bringeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moſt moment to ende, ſo theſe ſtates had ende of theyr deſires, time and trauails bringeth both companies, in viewe one of the other, to their great delights: at which enter-viewe a pleaſure it was to beholde the youthfull troupe of nobles and gentles, how gallantly they demeane themſelues, dooing many braue and commendable feates on their horſes, on both ſides deſeruing ſuch praiſe as was admirable. In this ſort dooing theyr kinde courteſies they paſſe by eyther companye, vntill the gouernour méete the Emperour: When pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating himſelfe on his knee, hee drewe neere the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour offering to kiſſe his ſtyrrope: which in no wiſe the moſt courteous Emperour woulde ſuffer, but taking him with great loue and honour from the grounde, bid him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <head>Howe the Maſter of the ſhippe, by the commandement of Guydo their Marchant, chained and impriſoned the knight, and what chanced him.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lſo it hath beene in the former hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of the knights departure to the ſea, where they had not long béene, and they from the ſhore ſcantly looſing ſight of the ſhippe, but the maſter which had his leſſon before, calling vppe his companie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, willed them to follow him into the cabine, and there to chaine the knight, which hee ſayde hee muſt doo for his and their ſecuritie. The companie, whoſe loue the knights courteſie had de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally gained, hearing this intended euill againſt him, who wiſhed them all well, beganne to perſwade the maſter from this intent, which would not heare them, but proſecuted his will, although to his great coſt, as it after happened, for the maiſter whome no perſwaſions might enduce from his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, hauing the chaine in his hand, entred the cabine, with him other officers of the ſhippe, and without ſaying any word vnto him, violently layde handes vppon him.</p>
               <p>The knight wondering to ſée this vnexpected wrong offered him, who ſuſpected no ſuch matter, and not knowing their pretence, force perforce graſped with the Maiſter, and wringing his chaine out of his hands, gaue him ſo ſore a blow on the head, as his braine was therewith beſprinckled, and hee lay gaping for that which hee neuer more obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The boate-ſwayne and ſome others of the cheefe, who who were acquainted with the treaſon, ſeeing theyr Maiſter ſlaine, aſſaulted the knight, entending with great tyranny
<pb facs="tcp:2066:67"/>
to reuenge his death, and to make him faſt as they hadde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: but too eaſie a reckoning made they, for he was more of account then millions of the ſlaues, as with theyr limbes they were compelled to witneſſe, for when the knight who tooke them all for friendes, ſawe their intents of euill, and could imagine no cauſe, defending himſelfe, hee ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bare him, that to the diuell hee ſent them all to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him.</p>
               <p>When hée had made way in the cabine, and cleared him ſelfe of thoſe that there aſſailed him, taking one of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, hee ruſhed violently out vppon the reſt, who fledde like ſhéepe from a dogge: ſuch was the power of an Engliſhman in multitudes of Spaniards.</p>
               <p>By this time the Page and the knight of the Roades who by trecherie was clapped vppe in a cabine, hadde made way for themſelues, and with ſuch weapons as they coulde gette, was come vnto him, who noting the timorouſneſſe of the baſe villaines, ſayde. Vnfaithfull Spaniards, more bruit then beaſts, more cruell to Chriſtianitie then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt: what wrong haue I offered you, that thus you goo about to bereaue mee of life, whome I loued ſo dearely: But ſéeing you baſe gromes (quoth hee) thus haue without cauſe mooued my patience, I will not leaue one mothers ſonne of you all aliue, to declare your hapleſte tragedyes, vnleſſe you acknowledge your guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and timely recount vnto mee the originall of this miſchiefe, which doo, and ſaue your liues, or otherwiſe prepare your ſelues to follow thoſe traytours that lie before you.</p>
               <p>The poore Marriners which were as ſorie for the wrong which was offered as himſelfe, greeued, humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at his feete, beſought him of pardon, and not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the blame of theyr Maiſters crime vnto them, for quoth they, wée are his hirelings, vnacquainted with anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended euill againſt you whom we all honor and was glad of,
<pb facs="tcp:2066:68"/>
if our maſter had any ſuch charge by the Marchants, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had any motion of his owne frée will to offende you, that is altogether vnknowne. To ſhew our innocencie herein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ſonne that lately commanded vs, him before your eies will we with all crueltie intreate, thereby to find the occaſion if we can. And then taking the boy they ſtripped him, and tying him to the breech of a péece, with cords, whipped him, to make him confeſſe what the cauſe was of the wrong offered by his father to the knight. But for any crueltie they could ſhewe, he would not confeſſe neither his fathers intent in the action, or where the Marchants letters were beſtowed, wherewith the knight was ſatiſfied, and commanded them to reſt ſatiſfied: but they which were well vſed to the boyes ſubtiltie, threatned him with death, without hee confeſſed what they had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which obſtinately he euer refuſed, vntill a bold and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe villaine, which in deſpight of the boy, more then of truſt to the knight, heating oyle boyloing hot, bedropped his naked ſkinne therewith, which torment the poore boy no longer able to endure, kneeling, cryed out for mercie to the knight, and hée would not onely deliuer the letters, but his armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſo that his life might be ſaued. At which words, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight commanded them to ceaſe their crueltie, promiſing on his word of honour, that no man ſhould doo him wrong, but hee would protect him, ſo that he performed what he had promiſed, and thereon ceaſing their puniſhment at the knights com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, they expected now to be ſatiſfied from him, what ſhould cleare them from all iealous doubts, wherein the knight helde them, for his harſh and bad entertainement, which made them haſten the boy to his buſineſſe, vrging him to that taſke which he was verie loth to be drawne vnto, but perforce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled vnto it, he cauſed the knight to defende the holde of the ſhip, where incloſed in a huge drifat, he found his armor &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his abiliments, and furniture for his bodies defence, in which a packet of letters was incloſed, directed to an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, neare alyed to the Spaniard ſlaine long before, and maſter to this <hi>Guydo,</hi> his laſt hatefull enemie. The ſight of al
<pb facs="tcp:2066:68"/>
which ſo mooued the Knight to pleaſure, that forgetting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions, or minding his Packet, he ioyed onely in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing his armes, cauſing the boy to be fréed from his bondes, and with good ſtore of crownes rewarded him.</p>
               <p>Now Gentles is to bee remembred, the carefull loue of the Knights Page, who ſéeing his maiſters ſmall regard of thoſe Letters, cloſely conueyed them into his Pocket, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting any man with them, longing to knowe the contents, yet loath to make theyr ſecretes knowen to anie man.</p>
               <p>In this Laborinth of diſcontent reſted the Page two dayes, and more, being verie deſirous to knowe the effect of thoſe lines. At laſt fit oportunitie béeing offered by one of the companie, who in the watch ſingling the Page, which was euer wakefull for his Knights welfare, he beſought the Page of fauour in commending an earneſt ſuite hee had to his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which himſelfe durſt not vtter. To which the Page wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly agréed, on ſuch conditions as hée bound him vnto. One of the Articles of which was, that hée ſhould faythfullie reade, and interprete vnto him truely, either in Italian or French, which the boy beſt vnderſtoode, the true effect of thoſe Letters: And hauing read them faithfullie, with great ſecrecie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale them without reuealing the leaſt worde, ſillable, or letter therein contained.</p>
               <p>This done, and his ſolemne oath for performaunce made by all holy rites that Spaniards vſe to ſweare, hée brake the ſeales, and read the contents of the chiefeſt, touching our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the knights occaſion of further trouble.</p>

Many waies by their own fauourers and followers, they diligently enquired of their champion <hi>Philippo,</hi> as well to thanke him for his ſeruice, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for their good, and fréeing them from their enemies, as to grace him with the Emperour, by their good reports of his deſerts, which albeit they had often acquainted the Emperour
<pb facs="tcp:2066:71"/>
with all, yet was not that ſufficient recompence as they thought, for a man of ſuch worth, and his deſert, This ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the knight cauſed many doubts to ariſe among them, for that hee had ioyned them on their honours to make theyr apperance before his Emperiall maieſtie, and he abſent, whom they with ſuch louing deſire wiſhed to ſee. But if they grew perplexed thereat, iudge the Emperours diſcontent, who meaſuring all honourable actions, eſpecially the forward aduenturing ſouldiour, was more mooued at his ſilence and concealing himſelfe then the reſt, and the more for that his ſeruice in a time of ſuch daunger and hazard of the whole ſeignorie, hadde for his friends benefit and good of the whole Dukedome, béene ſo employed, that amongſt his cogitations and thoughts of diſcontent, ioyed in hearing the honourable aduentures of the knight, ſo largely recounted.</p>

               <p>Theſe things ordered &amp; all other néedful matters befitting the time and the place. The princeſſe which were before appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee principall beholders of theſe paſtimes, could not deuiſe with what cunning deuiſe to bring her deſires to
<pb facs="tcp:2066:73"/>
effect, for which ſhe grew ſo melancholike, that her neareſt attendants durſt not come neare her, fearing to offende her. Theſe paſſions <hi>Alinda</hi> well noted, and ſought many wayes in her ſubtile ſhifting head, to diſburthen her Lady of thoſe great greeſes: ſo long deuiſing, that ſhée thought no way ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as to cauſe her cunningly to counterfeit ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of her bodie, and hereon reſoluing, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Princeſſe therewith, ſhee preſently ſent worde by the Princeſſe Squire to the Emperour, of the ill diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Princeſſe, whome ſhee willed further to ſay as occaſions were offered and queſtions demaunded, of the manner of her agonie, to tell him, that about the middeſt of the night, all being in their dead ſléep, ſodainely the princeſſe ſtarted out of her bedde, running about the chamber like one lumatike, crying nothing but on her Lorde, <hi>Edward, Edward,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> bitterly crying and exclaiming her Lord <hi>Edward</hi> was ſlaine, that ſhe would come to auenge her on thoſe miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that had murthered him.</p>
               <p>With this meſſage the gentleman being parted, haſteneth to the Court, and came ſo earlie, as none of the priuie cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were ſtirring, yet made ſuch meanes as hee beſt coulde to deliuer his meſſage, which no ſooner the Emperour heard, with the manner and ſtraunge efficacie of her maladie, but nearely touched with the vnhappie hearing thereof, hée called for his apparrell, and ſending for his learnedeſt phiſitians, hée queſtioned of the occaſion of the princeſſe gréefe and vnaccuſtoined agonyes, wherewith they were all aſtonied, yet taking aduiſe amongſt themſelues, diuerſly cenſuring the occaſion, they deliuered theyr opinions thus, that the princeſſe often meditating on her Lorde in his abſence by ſome fearefull dreame, might bee in her ſléepe combred, and doubted not after ſome quiet reſt, but ſhee ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her health againe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Alinda</hi> which hadde endured more ſhowers and greater thunder cracks then the princeſſe could now rattle, quietly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted her extremitie of ſpéech, but no ſooner gan the winde to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerblow, and the heate of her rage allayed: but <hi>Alynda</hi> which held her credite great, and carefully héeding her Ladies good, ſubmitting her ſelfe to the princeſſe, ſhe beſought her to regard all their goods, who had done this for her Ladiſhips good, and to colour all which, and well effect her deſires, faine ſome long ſléep, that if the Emperor ſhuld ſend to ſée her, they which ſhuld come might haue no ſpéech with her. To this counſel of her old ſureſby the princeſſe liſtned, &amp; promiſed to performe what ſhe directed. Scantly had they queſtioned of effecting what they wiſhed, but one knocking eaſily at the chamber doore, brought word that the Emperor with his phiſitians were come to viſit the princeſſe: to whom <hi>Alinda</hi> returned this anſwere with out aduiſement, that ſhe was lately fallen aſléepe, and beſought his highneſſe to pardon her a while, and forbeare to comber her, whom they all hoped would be well amended by her reſt.
