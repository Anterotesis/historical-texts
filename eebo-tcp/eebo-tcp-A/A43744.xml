            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I had the Honour to preſent this COMEDY to your Lordſhips peruſall I deſigned it as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, or rather as my firſt Fruits in the Dramatic way for the many Favours your Lordſhip had conferr'd upon me. But now it is forced to beg your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the malice and ſevere uſage it receiv'd from ſome of my Ill natured Freinds, who with a Juſtice peculiar to themſelves, paſſed ſentence upon it unſeen or heard and at the repreſentation made it their buſineſs to perſecute it with a barbarous variety of Noiſe and Tumult, that many of the well meaning Spectatours (for I am ſure it had very few Hearers) muſt conclude it a very Criminall performance. As I ſhould never have been vaine enough to have valued my ſelf upon the opinion of ſuch weake Judges, ſo I am not much mortified at my falling under their Indignation. But tho' I can eaſily forgive ſuch an ungenerous way of proceedure in relation to my ſelf, who never expected to ſubſiſt by the Stage; Yet it is a precedent of dangerous conſequence, and may happen to fall very ſeverely upon thoſe Gentlemen whoſe ill fortune or Genius ſhall lead them to attempt this ſort of writing. An unrighteous Faction may be formed againſt the Jaſteſt, and moſt regular Compoſition; and no man is ſafe if theſe Gentlemen (whom we muſt allow good Criticks in dreſſing) ſhall aſſume to vent their ill grounded Fury, and ſpet their venome upon every Authour that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb facs="tcp:102359:4"/>
to divert them. At the ſame time 'tis my comfort that better Plays have met with the like fate from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking imcompetent Judges: And without vanity ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of a meaner Caracter have found a reception they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver merited.</p>
            <p>'Tis this Reflexion has ſomewhat releiv'd me under the late miſcarryage of my Play and is a ſenſible ſatisfaction to me that your Lordſhip (who is acknowledg'd by all Parties for the moſt correct and Judicious writer, the trueſt Judge, and the moſt diſintereſted Partron; to be the delight, the ornament, and ſupport of our Age) has been pleaſed to peruſe and approve it. Your ſingle Suffrage weighs more with me, and the thinking part of mankind, then the repeated acclamations of a numerous aſſembly.</p>
            <p>My LORD, Should I vainly preſume to diſcribe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inherent and particular Grace, that ſhines in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of your Lordſhips Virtue: or enumerate thoſe rare qualifications that have rendred your Lordſhip ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſteemed, belov'd and admir'd, both at home and abroad; I ſhould looſe my ſelf in the Rapture and Contemplation. But your Lordſhip has already receiv'd incenſe from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyer hands but from none that has a profounder honour for your Lordſhip, then</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Play had the misfortune to come very unluckily on the Stage, where it found very few Freinds: Their prejudice had decree'd it ſhould ſuffer under their Indignation, and before it was off the Stocks, had predeſtin'd it to Damnation. Their kindneſs being greater for the preceding Play, reſolved they would ſee no ſin in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite <hi>Jacob,</hi> but expoſe their unfortunate <hi>Eſau</hi> to Reprobation, without the leaſt hopes of a Bleſſing. The Theatre was by Faction transformed into a Bear-Garden, hiſſing, mimicking, ridiculing, and Cat-calling; the Actours could not ſupport themſelves againſt ſo ſtrong a Currant. And if any came with a deſigne to be diverted, they were diſtracted with the variety of Noyſes, and continual uproars; they could neither hear, nor Judge of the matter: Had any of the Ancient Romans reviv'd to have been witneſs to this Interlude, this medly <hi>of Noiſes</hi>; they would certainly conclude the Moon was labouring under ſome diſmal Eclypſe, and the Pagans of the Pit were endeavouring to recover her out of her Trance with this horrid din. The diſtracted Players were ſtunn'd with their clamours, and though they had often ſtood the ſhock of Thunder and Lightning on the Stage, yet now they found themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in this real Tempeſt: They fancyed the Scene had been Tranſlated into <hi>Sicily</hi> and the Earth had gaped to ſwallow theſe Grumbletonians, like the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old. Some dark Sons of uncertain Fathers, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diverted themſelves with their melodious Cat-calls, theſe Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> vanquiſhed the Stage, back'd with the untuneable brayings of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe that joyned in this diſmal conſort: In this diſtraction we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Audience were wholly ſtrangers to the Plot and conduct of the Play. And therefore it will be reaſonable they ſhould now read for their money what in the Action they could neither Hear nor Underſtand.</p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant a juſt Cauſe may ſuffer under the prejudice of an <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Jury,</hi> or an unjuſt Judge may ſtop his Ears againſt the voice of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and harden his heart to the ſevereſt Judgment; or that an incenſed <hi>Mob</hi> may be wrought up to break thro' all Laws, and commit the higheſt outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Barbarities. But after the fury of their military Execution is over they may relent of their rigour, and have ſome reſerve of compaſſion for the unfortunate Martyr, that ſuffered their indignities with all conſtancy and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Had our unlucky Authour been worthy to have known they were abſolutly bent to damn his Play, unſight unſeen, his caution would have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn him from the Thunder of their diſpleaſure. But now we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by the ſurpriſing ſucceſs of the Baudy Batchelour, that the niceſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:102359:5"/>
may be brought (by good mannagment) to ſtand the fire of a ſmutty Jeſt, and never flintch for the matter. They are the ſenſible Judges that family duties can not proceed without the creature comfort: Nor Nature be well inſtructed without the help of a feskue. Theſe Camelion Ladies cannot like the Spaniſh Jennets conceive by the ayr, or grow big with ſuch a Timpany.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tanquam conjugibus ſuis Mariti,</l>
               <l>Non poſſunt ſine Mentula placere.</l>
               <l>What Sot can thinke to pleaſe a Beauty,</l>
               <l>That wants wherewith to do his duty.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But I muſt beg the Ladies pardon that I introduce a Forreign Tongue, that can make uſe of their Mothers to a better advantage, but in a Preface it is neceſſary to ſprinkle a little Latin, to ſhew our Breeding. The Authours are now convinc'd the Batchelour has touch'd upon the true ſtring, to pleaſe and tickle: They are now grown more generous then to deny their ſentiments and Inclinations, and ſcorn any ſuch baſhfull pretence, but openly avow and countenance that Poet, that ſeaſons his Scenes with ſalt and good humour, to pleaſe the hant-gouſts of their fancies: and make their Eares glow with licentious Farce, which they are reſolv'd to ſtand by and juſtify: What though the Plots are old, and ſtale, they are ſo prettily jumbled and blended together they can never fail of being well receiv'd. Tho ſome nicer La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are of an opinion, that an impure Idea, that is obſcene in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (though never ſo cleanly wrapt up) can no way be made paſſable: But theſe are ſqueamiſh pallats that ſtrain at a gnat in publick, and after make no bones of a Camel on occaſion.

The Actours cut out what they pleaſed to ſhorten their parts according to their own humours, and I muſt ſtand by and ſee it mutilated and diſmembred before my Face: When it appear'd on the Stage, it was but an imperfect Rehearſall, for ſome could never repeat their parts, and therefore impoſſible they could Act them: Some were perfect and could have done it right, if others had been able to have play'd their parts up to them.

That I may have the Stirrop ready to mount into the Saddle of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I believe I have advanc'd to the full of the Eſtate:—The Auctions in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company run very high at preſent, and I am reſolv'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my ſtock there, and place it upon <hi>Terra firma</hi>: on a fat Mortgage? or a Purchaſe—Let my Daughter know I would have her receive Sir <hi>Noiſy</hi>'s Addreſſe for Marriage, he has a great Eſtate in Land and Money? and refers the Settlement to me. Who will take care to hamper him, and ſecure her Fortune; on this Marriage: That it ſhall not fall into Huckſtirs hands, and be Extravagantly ſpent and Squander'd, She ought to look on this Match as a great Bleſſing, and not grow perverſs and Humerſome like her Brother. I am to meet Sir <hi>Noiſy</hi> at my Councils Chamber, when 'tis dark—go home.</p>

You have taught me Sir, that Love and Friendſhip ought to be choſen; and not Compell'd, and to Marry without Love, is to bind a living Body with a Dead: When ever I deſign that knot, I will be ſolely Govern'd by your Judgment.</p>

They were not Contracted, by any fault or Encouragement of mine: Heaven has bleſt you Sir with helps, my youth could ne'r pretend to: and yet I weather'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes utmoſt malice. I went a raw School-Boy to <hi>Oxford.</hi> And but a freſhman when the War begun: I Left the Studious for an Active life: and finding none prefer'd at Court, but for ſome by Intereſt, or Downright money, I was condemn'd to take the Luckier ſide. From thence roſe Gradually to be a Collonel. Finding an Heireſs fitting for my purpoſe, I marryed her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering either Wit or Beauty. An Eſtate was the only thing had the Witchcraft to inchant and fix my happineſs. Then ſecur'd by the act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, I bid adeiw to all Military Imployments: my Wife, dying Early I have above Ten Years remain'd a Widdower, unwilling to overcharge my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with a ſecond Brood: But having in you met a Diſappointment in my Deſigns, I reſolve henceforward to pleaſe my ſelf, and chooſe a partner in my Bed and Fortune.</p>

He replyed he had been ſo often banter'd with Letters and Mask's that he was reſolv'd never to ſtir one foot on ſuch ſleeveles errands except my Face would perſwade him. For he hated an old acquaintance worſe then durty Linnen, a dunn, or a Bill of Exchange without money to anſwer it. I diſcover'd my Face and found grace to ingage him to meet at the time and Place. Well madam, are you not under ſome concern to meet this dangerous man of War, that has been fluſh'd with ſo many Victories? He has made many a poor heart ſigh, or the world fowly belyes him.

Yet ſtill you remain in an obſtinate perverſe humour: I am aſham'd to ſee what cold advances you make to the old Gentlemans Complements and Careſſes: well, if you will not Buckle, and apply your

Ah! thoſe charming deu eux they are moſt luſciouſly ingageing. And why may not I like a lucky Bowler Strike out my young Miſtreſs and lodge in her place; or at leaſt in the way of preferment. She has ſo glutted and pall'd his appetite with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated fulſome kindneſs, while wiſdom ſhould keep them hungry to prize loves Banquet, all honey moons ſoon cloy with the repeated treat, Chapon boulie, (as the French Proverb ſays) is not always welcome.

He is forthwith to marry a rich Merchants Daughter worth Threeſcore thouſand pounds; I ſaw the young Girle, ſhe is now about Seventeen: But bred up with ſo much fooliſh Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Innocence, ſhe curtſy'd to the footman carry'd the writings. Her Aunt told her he was a Servant, ſhe bluſh'd and reply'd, ſhe took him for ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon by his Lac'd Coat, I was aſham'd to ſee ſo much Beauty ſo ſtrangely bred.</p>

So Subtle Sir <hi>Worldly</hi> marrys his Son without a Penny expence, and it is poſſible the old <hi>Fox</hi> will cheat him of his ready money into the Bargain. But I muſt in and wait for his comming.

I have already had two interveiws with your Brother <hi>Fox</hi> in mask unknown, and by Chance: entertain'd him with all Raillery and freedom. The ſame day he din'd with my Brother and me, I chang'd the Copy of my countenance and receiv'd him with all gravety, he not gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing I was the Jolly Lady in the Mask: He told me at my next meeting in the Mask, my face had ſtrangely ſhaken his Conſtancy, and preſt me to diſcover mine by way of Antidote: But I inſiſted I expected a firmer proof of his Conſtancy and obedience, ere I oblig'd him ſo far: and if he ſlighted my Converſation he was at liberty to purſue his Conqueſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Country Rivall: He ſubmitted and vow'd fidelity, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him into Favour: If I find him a man of ſtrict honour and Juſtice, It will ſooner take with me then the ſparkling fancys of an airy Wit. And if he has ingag'd his Inclinations to the Lady in the Mask when he diſcovers me to be the ſame, it will prove a double Conqueſt: I will not doubt you can be unfaithfull to me for the ſake of a Brother when one of the ſame Relation has already vow'd himſelf your Servant. And if I had diſcover'd any unworthy Quality in him I would acquaint you with it, to avoid his pretenſions.</p>

                  <p>I beg your pardon I have trayn'd you hither, where I expect to meet a Lady whoſe Wit has much ingag'd me. She brings a Freind or Servant with her, but keeps her face and Character ſtill in the dark, and I would beg when you ſee me accoſt her, you draw the other Mask aſide, and pump out what you can to cleere my doubts of her Condition. I at this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiw will fix the Matter or break of further Correſpondence, and bring you as a witneſs. Had not I been ingag'd in this blind Buſineſs, I had paid homage to your Siſters Eyes, whoſe Beauty and reſerv'dneſs charm'd me ſtrangly for whom I own a moſt profound reſpect, and cannot make a tender of my Service, while this Intrigue depends.</p>
