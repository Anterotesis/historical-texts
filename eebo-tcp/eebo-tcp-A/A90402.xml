         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was my intention, ſome diſtance
of time ſince, to have publiſhed
ſomewhat concerning the then
preſent ſtate of Affairs; wherein
I ſhould have expreſſed ill-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
none, but only have uttered that deep
affection that then was in me, towards the ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and healing the diſtempers of ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as are made more miſerable by their own
diſcontents, then they could be by any thing elſe
that can in probability befall them in this ſtate
of things, wherein it is hard to determine what
is truly beſt and moſt profitable, though moſt
men are very ready to determine, and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
in determining, according to their own
deſires and apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>It was then my deſign to have caſt ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon theſe flames, that they might not burn
<pb facs="tcp:115390:3"/>
ſo intenſely within to the diſturbance of mens
own ſpirits there, nor yet be ſo liable to break
forth to the diſquieting and endangering of the
publique intereſt.</p>
            <p>There are one ſort of men whom I ſhould
more eſpecially have applied my ſelf unto, who
are wonderous eager after making the Nation
happy; whoſe ſpirits can be no ways ſatisfied
till they ſee the attainment of that Univerſal
Freedom, and the flowing forth of that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
ſpeedy impartial Juſtice, which is eaſie to be
deſired, but hard to be met with.</p>
            <p>In pity towards theſe (whom I had cauſe
enough to pity, I my ſelf lying with them under
the ſame deſire, though not expecting to meet
with it in that way wherein it was purſued;) I
ſay, in pity towards theſe, I was ready to iſſue
forth to adminiſter to them more eſpecially
what I conceived might be in any kind reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and after ſuch reaſonings as ſhould have
fallen within my ſhallow compaſſe, at laſt I
ſhould have ventured to have propoſed three
Directions to ſuch as ſhould be made willing
to conſider of them, which when embraced,
would not quite have taken them off from, but
<pb facs="tcp:115390:3"/>
only have ſomewhat allayed the vehemency of
their Spirits in this their proſecution of publike
good, which in tenderneſs to them and others I
could not but deſire.</p>
            <p>Theſe Directions being ſo few, and of a more
general nature then to be reſtrained unto them,
or any one ſort only, I ſhall here make mention
of, being ſetled in my Spirit to wave the reſt of
the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt of them is to this effect:</p>
            <p>Be content to paſſe through your pilgrimage
without the full enjoyment of that Freedom ye
have deſired and preſſed ſo hard after. There
is a power above, whoſe Will may croſſe yours
in this, which may as well find fault with your
untowardneſſe to be governed, as with the
Self-Seeking of ſuch as have been Governors.</p>
            <p>I might perhaps have ſaid, if I had not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it would have reliſhed too harſhly, Be
content to be Slaves. It is a brave thing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to oppoſe the yoke, but a braver from
Judgment to ſubmit unto it. It is in many caſes
better for particular perſons, yea for Societies,
to bear, then avoyd the yoke. It coſt the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
dear that they would by no means be
<pb facs="tcp:115390:4"/>
brought to put their necks under Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars
girdle. Canſt thou ſay that a preſent
Oppreſſion is not determined concerning thee
by him who hath power to diſpoſe of all
things? If thou canſt not, take heed of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violent
reſiſting. If thou laboureſt for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with all thy might, and a greater power
oppoſe, what wilt thou gain by the conteſt?
I have often repented of ſhunning, of avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but never of meeting and cloſing with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
It is the ſtiffneſſe of the neck, and unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
of the Spirit that chiefly makes all our
yokes ſo harſh.</p>
            <p>2. Groan, pant after, and in a juſt way purſue
the attainment of perfect Freedom. Lie not
down as a Slave, with a baſe abject Spirit,
counting ſlavery beſt, but with a ſweet Spirit
ſubmit to it for neceſſities ſake, and withall let
a Senſe appear of your prizing and deſiring of
Liberty: And what way of attaining it is made
out to you plainly and evidently juſtifiable, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
not to fall in with; yet not in ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and irrational manner, as to make your
more noble parts far worſe ſlaves to bruitiſh
paſſions within, to avoyd a more inferior ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb facs="tcp:115390:4"/>
of the outward and more ignoble part.</p>
            <p>3. Haſten your deſires and expectations aright:
Look not for it from thence where ye cannot
hope to find it, but thence from whence alone
it can come: Look not for it from man, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
cannot grow there, it never grew there:
Man has not a Soil fertile enough for ſuch
trees to flouriſh in; Man has not a Root deep
enough to bear ſuch Fruit. Beſides, man ſeems
now to be blown upon, and all his excellency
withers; adore him no longer. Is not the
glory of all ſorts of men fallen? Why do ye
ſo often remove your eyes from one ſort of men
to another? Oh looſen them from all, and faſten
them no more on any, if ye would not be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> that deep wiſe man, who knew
things in their cauſes, tels you what the place of
Judgment and Righteouſneſſe under the Sun is,
even a place where unrighteouſneſſe and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ſtill to be found, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 16. If ye look for
a place of pure Judgment and Righteouſneſſe
under the Sun, ye will be deceived. For this is
the ſtate that ever was and ever will be under
the Sun; There will be Oppreſſions exerciſed
<pb facs="tcp:115390:5"/>
even there, and the oppreſſed ones may weep,
but they are like to have no effectual Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
for the power that ſhould comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, is ſtill on the oppreſſors ſide, as that
ſame comprehenſive man ſpeaks in that ſame
Book, Chap. 4. 1. Therefore look not there for
it any longer, ſince Wiſdom hath ſaid, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
too hath always ſhewn, that it is not,
it will not, it cannot be found there. But if ye
know and can think of a Fountain of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
a Power that can iſſue out pure and
perfect Salvation, look thither; and when
that Fountain ſhall be opened, ye may chance
to meet with it; but till then, your hunger
and thirſt is not like to be ſatisfied, however
your hopes to meet with it in this or that party,
this or that intereſt, may flatter you.</p>
            <p>Now whether theſe may be uſeful to any or
no, lies not in me to reſolve; this is all I have
to ſay concerning them, that I found them in
my own Spirit, and I found my Spirit much
compoſed by them, (in reference to the ſeveral
toſſings and tumblings that have been,) they
lying at the bottom there, from whence I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into publique view, not knowing
<pb facs="tcp:115390:5"/>
but they may drop and diſtil into ſome other
Spirit, to bring it alſo to ſome kind of reſt in
this reſpect, in the middeſt of ſuch future ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
as are very incident and frequent after
diſſettlement.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the ſtate of ſpiritual
things was preſented to my view, and I beheld
the people of God in their ſeveral ſtations; ſome
ſcattered this way, ſome that way; ſome ſetled
this way, ſome that way; ſome bewailing
themſelves under their Scatterings, others bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in their Setlings; ſome ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and others glorying, in what they imagine
they have found; ſome complaining of the
breaches, growing greater and more Spiritual,
others crying out as faſt, that their Antidotes,
plaiſters and arts of healing, which would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
help all, were not embraced. I found my
Spirit likewiſe drawn out to ſpeak a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this ſtate of things, as I felt the ſence
of them then upon me, and as I found it moſt
ready and convenient to communicate that
ſence; which though I had intended to wave
alſo, yet finding the ſtate of things calling for
ſome ſuch kind of language to invite to a more
<pb facs="tcp:115390:6"/>
then ordinary conſideration of them, I find
my ſelf willing to let it go forth as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his hand, who knoweth how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
it, to effect what he pleaſeth by it.</p>
            <p>This is the account I thought fit to give by
way of Preface, to lead to the Diſcourſe it ſelf,
which now follows.</p>

                  <head>A FEW
VVords to Chriſtians,
About the late and preſent Poſture of
Spirituall Affaires
Among Them.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not onely the Civil part of this <hi>Nation</hi>
that lay under Miſery and Oppreſſion before
this great Commotion, but Religion alſo, and
the Religious party, had a deep ſhare in it, being
moſt of all troden under foot. That preſent form
of <hi>Government,</hi> which then was in force, ſtruck
at the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of that, which it was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a wall unto. Nor did onely the ſweetneſs of <hi>Liberty</hi> and
<hi>Propriety</hi> put men, that were ſenſible thereof, upon ſtriving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and poſſeſs them; But the preciouſneſs of Freedom to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
tender Conſcience, which had been ſo long yoked and
burthened, did much inſtigate Chriſtians to aſſay the recovery and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115390:7"/>
re-enjoyment of it. And the reſult hath been much alike to both;
both have been buried in the duſt of Contention and Confuſion.
The Contention hath grown ſo hot, that men have almoſt forgot
what they contended for in both, which at firſt was not a power to
oppreſs and captive others, but to attain <hi>Liberty</hi> for themſelves
and others.</p>
                  <p>It is to you, O Chriſtians, that I intend a few Words, (to which
I haſten,) and that concerning your choyceſt Jewel, <hi>Religion.</hi> In
what ſtate is it? In what ſtate hath it been? Hath it thriven, or
decayed? Is it alive, or dead? Whom do ye embrace in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
your true Love, or a ſtranger? What, is your Religion of
the right coyn? hath it the ſtamp of your King, or is it counterfeit?
Truly there are ſo many different pretenders ſtand up to lay claim to
him, who belongs but to one, (his own Spouſe, as he is but one, his
Light one, his Will one, his Way one, in the midſt of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and contrariety) that he had need have infallible certainty,
who ſatisfieth his ſpirit with his intereſt in him.</p>
                  <p>But I would ſpeak but little to you; I will therefore come to
thoſe few Queſtions I have to propoſe to your conſideration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſtate of <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> in reference to the many
changes it hath under-gone, and the preſent condition wherein it
ſtands. The firſt whereof may be this:</p>
                  <p>1. Whether Religion hath not received a wound in the inward
part of it, ſince this Conteſtation about outward things, and the
outward part of Religion? Whether the life and power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which was always ſcanty enough among the beſt) be not now
much abated, and runneth not ſo low, that it is hardly, if at all, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable?
It hath been the complaint of divers, both <hi>Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Independents,</hi> and therefore may well deſerve the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of each ſort. O Chriſtians! Be not ſo buſie about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part, about the dreſs of Religion, as not to enquire into the
ſtate of the inward part, whether that flouriſh, or languiſh and
decay.</p>
                  <p>2. If it do appear to you, That Religion hath received a blow
within, a wound at heart; let me ask you, in the ſecond place,
Whether it doth not nearly concern you, to bethink your ſelves
how it may be cured in time, before it bleed to death? Thou art
buſied, O Chriſtian, about garments of Religion, for thy ſelf and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115390:7"/>
others to wear; look within man, thy heart faints, thy life is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring:
Thy faith is even dead; thou canſt not truſt God, but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to thine own wiſdom to contrive for thy ſelf, and to thine own
power to effect thy counſels. Thy love, what is become of it?
O what a ſtrange thing is love among Chriſtians? <hi>Patience, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Meekneſs of ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> where do they grow? What is
there of theſe left within, in the heart, when there is ſuch a general
complaint, that they are not to be found in the lives of Profeſſors?</p>
                  <p>3. Let me ask thee, in the third place, Whether the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, or voluntary ſubmiſſion to, any outward Form of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> of what kinde ſoever, can heal this
breach within? Will <hi>Preſbytery</hi> do it? Why doth it not do it in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where it hath ſcope and power enough? Will <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
or <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> do it? How come ſo many then to loſe the
lives of their ſpirits in ſuch Relations? The Form doth ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
much to the Power, but the Power is very commonly eaten
out by the Form. I know men that are engaged much to any way,
are highly conceited of it, thinking it would effect ſtrange things,
if it were but generally owned and embraced; and are ready to
impute all miſcarriages and bad effects to the want thereof: but
this is but a favorable and ſelf-iſh judgment; I propoſe this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to thee to conſider and ponder of, till thou art enabled to paſs
a righteous judgment upon it; and then perhaps thou wilt be as
ready to condemn thine own form and way of Adminiſtration in
this behalf, as thou art to condemn ſuch other ways as thou now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt.</p>
                  <p>4. Let me ask thee yet again, Whence this cure is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and can alone be had? From whence did any true Life and
Power flow at firſt, and whither is it now retired? Who is it
that hath wounded? Can he heal? Can any elſe but he heal?
Who is it that hath ſhaken the foundations of mens ſpirits, and
battered down the fabricks of their Religion about their ears;
yea, even of ſuch as have built with hewen ſtone? Truly,
Miſerable is that man, whoſe life is almoſt waſted, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waſting, and yet he ſtill running to that for Recovery, which
deſtroyeth him. It is one fair ſtep towards Redemption, to know
from whence to hope for it, and to have the eye taken off from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:115390:8"/>
5. And laſtly, Let me put this one thing more to thee; What
Diſpenſation thinkeſt thou are we under at preſent? Whether have
we attained that <hi>Light,</hi> that <hi>Life,</hi> that <hi>Power,</hi> by which we are
to walk, and under which we may comfortably ſit down? Or are
we to expect and wait for a reducement to that ſtate wherein the
Primitive Chriſtians were, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> was poured out upon
them, and they led thereby into Church-communion? Or are we
to expect any other ſtate promiſed in the Scripture, and (as ſome
ſay) experienced by themſelves, which this is to give way unto?</p>
                  <p>This is a very weighty queſtion, and very needful, eſpecially in
theſe ſhaking times, wherein men had need be much enquiring, and
not over forward to ſettle, when a Power above them ſtands ſo
ready to ſhake, and hath ſo ſorely ſhaken, that which was very
likely to have ſtood.</p>
                  <p>To further ſuch a little, as are deſirous to bend their thoughts
hereunto, by opening a way for a more full and exquiſite ſearch,
I ſhall communicate ſome of the workings of my minde formerly
concerning theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>As touching the firſt, <hi>Whether we have attained to ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
as we may walk on comfortably in?</hi> The workings of
my minde have been very various and doubtful concerning this;
one while inclining to the one part, another while to the other:
Sometimes apprehending the ſubſtance both of inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worſhip and Converſation, ſo clearly revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ſo teſtified within, in the ſpirits of Chriſtians; and ſo
much life and power alſo communicated from above, as might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well ſuffice to lead them on very ſweetly and comfortably in this
vale of Tears to their Reſting place. Otherwhiles again apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from light ſence, and evident experience, ſo much deadneſs, ſo
much darkneſs, ſuch a vail over the heart, and over the Scriptures;
ſuch uncertainty in things that were received, ſuch a want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
within to buckle with power without, that there appeared no
poſſibility of rubbing on like Chriſtians after this rate; which hath
made me often wonder, whether we were under the Law, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel; there was ſo much work, ſo little ſtrength; ſo
large promiſes without, ſo little of what they ſpake within. So
that though I had many advantages, both from the earneſtneſs of the
deſire in my own ſpirit, and from the conſiderations that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115390:8"/>
to me; as alſo from my own experience, and enquiry
among ſuch as pretended both light and experience in the point in
hand; yet ſtill there was ſomewhat of concernment to keep me
back from a poſitive determination, even when I was neareſt unto
reſolving.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, <hi>Whether we are to expect a Reſtoration of the
the Primitive State, or no?</hi> My mind wrought much after the
ſame manner. Sometimes it ſeemed very likely to me that it ſhould
be reſtored: Sometimes again the weakneſs both of the Ordinances
and Adminiſtrations of it, and their ſudden death, made it ſeem
to me fitter to paſs away, and give place to that which is more
durable.</p>
                  <p>There were three things eminent in that Diſpenſation, <hi>Gifts, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations,</hi>
and <hi>Graces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had ſeveral ſorts of gifts; gifts of healing, of ſpeaking with
tongues, of working miracles: Again, they had gifts of prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of ſinging, of revelation, of interpretation, &amp;c. Then they had
Adminiſtrations, they had proper ways of adminiſtring every gift,
which were appointed to them, and whereinto they were led, by the
ſame Spirit which beſtowed the gift. Some gifts were beſtowed
in reference to perſons without, for conviction and converſion;
and other gifts in reference to perſons within, for mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
exhortation and comfort; the ſame Spirit leading them to the
uſe of theſe in ſome meaſure, who imparted the gift unto them.
Then laſtly, they had Graces, ſtrong, powerful graces were poured
out unto them, graces that were truly ſpiritual, not acquired by their
induſtry, but breathed by the Spirit of Life; ſuch as Faith, Love,
Patience, Humility, Meekneſs, &amp;c. and there is a vaſt difference
between theſe when they are dropped out of Heaven, and thoſe
that are extracted out of the Earth, though they may bear the ſame
name, and carry the ſame reſemblance. The common fires of the
Jews, and the fire on the Altar, were not the ſame, how little
difference ſoever might ſeem between them to common judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But what became of this glory? How ſoon did this Sun ſet!
What Chriſt foretold concerning the material Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
proved true alſo of this Spiritual, this Apoſtolick building, there
was not one ſtone left upon another that was not thrown down.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115390:9"/>
Who would have thought ſo glorious a fabrick ſhould ſo ſoon have
been laid flat! That the Churches, ſo well founded and ſetled by
the Apoſtles, and not barely by them, but by the Spirit of God
in them, ſhould ſo ſoon come to ruine! And ſince it hath thus paſſed
away, muſt we not be forced to confeſs, that there was ſome flaw,
ſome defect in it, or elſe it could not ſo ſoon have decayed and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed?</p>
                  <p>And truly methinks there ſeemeth to lie as juſt an Indictment (in
kind, though not in degree) againſt this Diſpenſation, as did againſt
the Diſpenſation under the Law, for weakneſs, for unprofitableneſs,
for inability, to make the comers thereunto perfect. What a poor
ſtate were the Churches in, even in the Apoſtles times? How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be ſhaken in doctrine? How carnal and defective in practiſe?
They had the Spirit poured out upon them, and yet wanted both
outward light, and inward life and power. They had abundance of
gifts, but knew not how to uſe them towards the edification of the
body, but employed them to the building up of that which was to
be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>And it was not only a weak ſtate while it was enjoyed, but was
alſo continually languiſhing, and ſoon expired: And all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
that have been to rear up this fabrick again ſince, either in the
internal or external part, have had the like ſucceſs with thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
that have been uſed to re-build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſince
its deſolation; before the building can come to any maturity or
perfection, it is ſtill blown down.</p>
                  <p>Such a continued, experimented diſcovery of the frailty of it,
ſeemeth to me to foretel its death, not its reſurrection; its caſting
away, not its reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third Branch, <hi>Whether we are to expect any other
ſtate, which ſome from experience (as they ſay) can and do teſtifie
concerning, whereunto this, and all former Dispenſations are to
give way?</hi> Wherein two particulars would be diſtinctly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
The thing it ſelf, whether ſuch a thing is to be or no? and the
teſtimony which we hear, or at leaſt may hear, given out by perſons
concerning it, which is of a very high kind, they ſay, they have taſted,
they have felt it in their own experience, and commend it unto us
as a thing they know already is in part, and ſuddenly ſhall be more
fully ſeen and enjoyed. I intend to ſpeak ſomewhat to both theſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115390:9"/>
and that very freely, (for I hope the time is coming wherein my
heart and thoughts concerning all things ſhall be opened) and firſt
concerning the experience of theſe perſons, which though it come
afterward in order of nature, yet I ſhall begin with it, to lay it out
of the way; and then I ſhall come more fairly and directly to the
thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As touching the experience of thoſe perſons who thus ſpeak; though
they have made a noiſe in the world, &amp; drawn the eyes of many upon
them, and the hearts of many after them; yet there lieth ſo juſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
againſt their perſons and practiſes, as cannot but damp their
teſtimony, and eat out that ſtrength which otherwiſe it might carry
with it. There is a greater ground of rebuke and reproach lies upon
them, then hath uſually attended the people of God, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and that too juſtly, layn open to reproach. The weakneſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Adminiſtration, the frailty of the perſons under it, the great
boaſts that have ſtill been made by ſome of them, of their intereſt in
God, nearneſs to God, power from God, and yet the low ebb that
moſt commonly they are found in, hath ſtill given too much occaſion
to wiſe fleſh to deſpiſe ſuch a weak and mixed appearance of the
Spirit of God in them: yet this is not their worſt, but their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtate; you ſhall ſometimes have them buffeted by Satan,
overmaſtered by corruption, forſaken by God, giving up all their
hopes, <hi>(My ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Lam. 3.) all their light darkened, all their life extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to appearance; and this is ſuch a ſtumbling block as it is hard to
leap over.</p>
                  <p>But none ever lay ſo open to reproach as theſe: Perſons wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with delight in that which the eyes of Sence and Reaſon (if
the eye of <hi>Religion</hi> were quite put out) cannot but call unclean,
filthy, wicked: boaſting that they are all, and all is theirs, and yet
poſſeſſing nothing; not knowing where to attain neceſſaries for
the body: ſpeaking greater words then ever were ſpoken, but with
leſs demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power, then God was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
wont to give out to them whom he called to ſpeak after a far
lower rate. How can any mans ſtomack forbear nauſeating ſuch
kind of perſons? I muſt profeſs there is nothing I have met with
more contrary to my temper, and anſwerably more diſtaſteful to
me, who have been always ſtrongly bent towards, and in proſecution
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115390:10"/>
of exact purity, both within and without, to the utmoſt extent and
degree. My temper hath likewiſe enclined me much to modeſty,
ſobriety, ſilence; I have ſtill deſired to be much, to enjoy much,
but not to make any great ſound of what I was made or enjoyed;
and I think few can teſtifie any great boaſts they heard from me of
that <hi>Light,</hi> that <hi>Life,</hi> that <hi>Power,</hi> that <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> which once I
taſted of, nay for a ſeaſon poſſeſſed, but ſtill kept back the diſcovery
of it, further then the drawing of it forth into action (wherein I
was not overforward neither) did occaſion it. To be, but not to
appear, was very delightful to me; but to make a glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
beyond ſubſtance, to ſpeak great words beyond what I felt
or enjoyed, was in no wiſe pleaſing unto me, or paſſable with me.
And if I deal ingenuouſly, I muſt confeſs, I never found my ſpirit
riſe with greater deteſtation againſt any thing, then this which I am
now ſpeaking of. It was irkſom to me formerly to hear men talk
of the Spirit of God, of being aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, when it
was too too clear that their own parts &amp; abilities were the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engine
in all their performances: but this was far more diſtaſteful
to me, and that which I could in no wiſe brook, until I was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
battered, and ſhewn my inſufficiency to judg any thing.</p>
                  <p>Since which time, I have learned by much experience, that the clay is
not its own, but the Potters; nor hath it liberty to chuſe its own form,
but muſt be caſt into what form the Potter pleaſeth, and into what
ſeveral forms he pleaſeth: One while it ſhall be a veſſel of honour,
by and by a veſſel of diſhonour; anon a veſſel of honour again,
then a veſſel of diſhonour again, of greater diſhonour then before;
and afterwards perhaps a veſſel of greater honour then before. The
ſame peece of earth one while lyeth common with the reſt of the
world, by and by is ſeparated for a garden or vineyard to the Lord,
encloſed with his fence, ſurrounded with his wall, for him to poſſeſs
and pleaſe himſelf with; anon the fence, the wall, is broken down,
and it laid open, and made common again: and thus it is toſſed
and tumbled into ſeveral ſorts of various conditions as often as the
owner of it pleaſes; and what ſhall be the iſſue of all, who knows
but he who is all? <hi>There are many devices in the heart of man</hi>
to exalt himſelf, and throw down others, (every one thinks it will
go well with him, and is ready to prophecy Woes to others,) <hi>but
the Counſel of the Lord it ſhall ſtand.</hi> Others ſhall meet with that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115390:10"/>
bleſſedneſs he promiſeth to himſelf, and he ſhall meet with thoſe
Woes he denounceth againſt others.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a grievous ſlave, the deſpicableſt peece of earth
throughout the whole Creation, then is <hi>Iſrael</hi> picked out, choſen
for a veſſel of glory: When <hi>Iſrael</hi> lifts up it ſelf above the reſt of the
world, looks upon the reſt as Heathen, as Dogs, (it was their uſual
phraſe to term the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by,) they were the choſen people, the
reſt caſt off; they the holy people, the reſt prophane, wicked, <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Gentiles:</hi> Now muſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> be turned back, and be put
in mind of his own original, which was the ſame with theirs, <hi>(his
father was an Amorite, and his mother an Hittite,)</hi> and he muſt
change places with them, a parcel of the Heathen muſt become the
choyce ſeparated people, and theſe muſt be caſt by. Having taſted
ſomewhat of this in my own ſpirit, having been hurled by might
and power into ſeveral forms and ſhapes, and ſuch too as I have
been ſtrongly fortified againſt, and have ſtrongly oppoſed, it hath
made me ſomewhat ſhy of finding fault with any peece of clay, in
what guiſe ſoever I find it.</p>
                  <p>And I cannot but adviſe all, who have reſpect to their own eaſe
and ſafety, to take heed how they judg theſe perſons. This is no
ordinary caſe; and though Sence or Reaſon, much more <hi>Religion,</hi>
may preſume upon the ſeeming clearneſs of the ground, and ſo
grow bold in pronouncing ſentence againſt them; yet it is the
light of the day can alone declare things of this nature, and till the
time of judgment be come, that light may be withheld. The nature
and end of the various paſſages between God and his people, are
many times then moſt hid, when they ſeem moſt manifeſt: There
is commonly deepeſt love in the bittereſt cup, and the pureſt glory
is frequently vailed over with the darkeſt covering. Fleſh hath
been always bold in judging, it may now be met with; there may
now be a trap laid to catch and enſnare it to its own confuſion and
deſtruction. This occaſion is ſo palpable, that it will be very hard
for Fleſh to avoyd, being drawn out to judg and condemn; and
yet its being drawn forth may be but an entrance into its own
judgment.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſee how apt man is, according to his own ſtate in
<hi>Religion,</hi> and according to his own apprehenſion of things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to give out his verdict. This is becauſe the foundation was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115390:11"/>
not well laid, will ſome ſay. This is the effect of their leaving <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
and <hi>Duties,</hi> will others ſay. This is the fruit of their pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Myſteries and Secrets, may a third ſort conclude. But how
knoweſt thou, O vain man, that it ariſeth from any of theſe? or
who gave thee liberty to vent thine own Imagination concerning
ſo intricate a paſſage as thine eyes never met with before? I can tell
thee of another cauſe different from any of theſe, whence it may
proceed for ought thou knoweſt.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>wine</hi> prepared for all to drink of, to empty them of all
their glory, which the people of God muſt begin with. God will
have no glory ſtand in his way: Religion is the higheſt glory, ſtands
moſt in his way, therefore that muſt firſt down. Nature is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and doth glorifie God in its kinde, but yet it ſtands in the
way of Religion, which is an higher glory; Therefore the firſt
thing Religion does, where it comes in power, is, to break Nature,
to daſh the glory of Nature. Religion is more glorious, and does
more glorifie God; but withall, being more glorious, it ſtands
more in the way of a greater glory, then the glory of Nature does;
and therefore the preſent controverſie is more ſharp againſt it, then
againſt Nature.</p>
                  <p>There is a time to ſet up, and a time to pull down; a time to
raiſe, and a time to level: And that which is truly excellent and
glorious in its kinde and degree, muſt vail and dye, when the ſeaſon
of the diſcovery of a greater glory draws nigh. And the people of
God ſpeak very lamentably of it, as a thing they did not look for,
as a thing they thought to have avoyded, but were forced unto
by a Power which could not be reſiſted; <hi>Thou haſt made us to
drink the wine of aſtoniſhment.</hi> There is a wine of Gods mingling
that will aſtoniſh, a wine made by his art and skill purpoſely to
aſtoniſh, which can without fail effect it; a wine that will quickly
lay the Creature dead drunk, and ſtrip him as naked (if not more)
of all the knowledg of God, yea, of all ſpiritual excellencies, as a
man drunk after the common natural way is of the knowledg of
natural things, and of natural excellencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a Conſumption determined to paſs through the whole
earth,</hi> upon every earthly perſon, and every earthly thing in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
truly ſpiritual. Every earthly thing muſt be conſumed. Not
onely earthly relations, earthly converſe, earthly imaginations,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115390:11"/>
earthly endowments, cuſtoms, with the whole faſhion of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
world: but likewiſe earthly Religion, earthly Ordinances,
earthly duties, earthly graces, earthly knowledg of God, earthly
deſires after God, earthly enjoyments of God, earthly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, earthly praiſing of God, earthly hopes, evidences,
aſſurances of everlaſting life and bleſſedneſs; all that is earthly muſt
be conſumed every where. And that which you call ſpiritual, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
in this dark eclipſed-Moon-light, God may call earthly in his
clear Sun-light; and whatſoever he calls earthly, muſt under-go
this Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the glory thereof as the flower of the field:
the graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the
Lord bloweth upon it.</hi> There is a blaſting breath of the Lord gone
forth, and going forth, which ſhall make every thing that is fleſhly,
that is not pure ſpirit, to dye, and give up the ghoſt. There is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ſtorm and tempeſt to come forth <hi>(Iſai.</hi> 28. 2.) to batter down
all the beauty and glory of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of dear <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of <hi>Ephraim</hi>
the pleaſant Childe.</p>
                  <p>Now hence it may proceed, Theſe perſons may have been made
to drink this wine. This judgment, which is to go over all, may be
begun in them. The Spirit of the Lord, which will blow upon and
make the glorious beauty of all to fade, may have already blown
upon them, and have ſo blown upon t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em, that there may no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of that life and ſweetneſs, whereof their ſpirits were
once full, be left ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Therefore look about you; <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed, leſt
he fall.</hi> Conſider what ye will do when ye come to drink of this
cup; how ye will keep off aſtoniſhment, and preſerve in you the
knowledg of ſpiritual things, when ye are made to drink <hi>the wine
of aſtoniſhment;</hi> how ye will do to retain the beauty and glory of
your Religion, when the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it. Alaſs
Sirs! If theſe things be done to the green tree, what will become
of the dry? If perſons, in whom there was ſuch an eminent power,
purity and life of Religion (as there was known to be in many of
theſe) be thus dealt with, be thus ſtripped, have the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo ſtruck at in them; what will become of perſons who have
very little better then a Form, whether of <hi>Preſbytery, Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
Anabaptiſm,</hi> or any other kinde? how will theſe ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

the tempeſt? how quickly will the unquenchable fire devour
ſuch ſtubble? If the Oaks of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

                  <p>But I will inſiſt no longer on this, which is (to the point in hand)

of ſubſtance indeed, and of very great weight, which is this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>There ſeemeth to me to be a larger pouring out of the Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and to be expected in the latter days, then hath as yet been
diſpenced; larger both for extent and vertue: it is to be poured out
more generally upon the people of God, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit
upon all fleſh;</hi> and more effectually upon thoſe on whom it is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>and your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy, &amp;c.</hi> This
ſecond pouring forth of the Spirit is to be fuller of vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of the knowledg of things, and the way of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it. There was a great deal of knowledg given out then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of what had been before, and after a far clearer and more
powerful manner: but yet it was ſtill weak, dark, imperfect, and
given out by weak fleſhly inſtruments, <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> and in a
weak fleſhly manner, <hi>through much infirmity of the fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaks: And it was received in but weakly too; ſo that ignorance
did ſtill prevail, and men were very carnal and dark under thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
and receptions of Light, and had need to be taught
over and over again the very elements and firſt principles of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at the ſecond pouring out of the Spirit, there ſhall be no
need of any ſuch givings out of Light, <hi>Ye ſhall not teach every man
his neighbor, ſaying, Know the Lord:</hi> Knowledg ſhall then be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
among the people of God, <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the
leaſt to the greateſt: The knowledg of the Lord ſhall cover the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115390:12"/>
Earth, as waters cover the Sea.</hi> Now there is a gaſping after
more Light, more diſcoveries of God; but then every veſſel ſhall
be filled, and filled from the Fountain. The waters ſhall be no more
ſullied by the pipes that convey it, but pure Light ſhall ſpring from
within.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of the remembrance of things. It was a work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the Spirit, upon his firſt pouring forth, to bring things
to their remembrance. The things that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſpoken, what
they had known or heard, that was uſeful for them, the <hi>Spirit</hi> was
to put them in minde of, when they ſhould need it, either for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
or comfort.</p>
                  <p>But at the ſecond pouring out of the Spirit, the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>bring all things to our remembrance</hi> much more fully: all
the things of God, all the things in God, all the things done by
<hi>God.</hi> Then we ſhall indeed <hi>remember the things of old,</hi> before
this late Earth was formed; when there was nothing but <hi>the Light
of God, the Life of God, the Power of God,</hi> circling within its
own <hi>pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In reſpect of power over ſpirituall enemies and evils. They
had power over theſe in a great meaſure. They could in ſome
ſence play with ſin, laugh in their ſpirits at the condemnation
of it, at the reigning power of it: <hi>There is therefore now no
condemnation to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>if ſin abound, grace
abounds much more;</hi> and again, <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over
us, for we are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> here is fine
ſporting with ſin. But for all that, it was but ſad ſport ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
ſin gave them now and then ſuch gripes, as made them
roar out, <hi>Oh wretched man!</hi> and, <hi>Who ſhall deliver!</hi> Yea, the
body of ſin ſtuck ſo cloſe, as troubled the beſt of them all their
dayes, ſo that they could not throughly <hi>do the things that they
would,</hi> nor throughly avoyd the things they would not do, but
were often forced, by the power of ſinne, to do what they
hated.</p>
                  <p>So for the world: They were delivered from <hi>this preſent
evill world;</hi> but ſo as they were ſtill troubled with it, and faine
much to be preſſed, <hi>not to love the world, nor the things of the
world, not to faſhion themſelves to the world, &amp;c.</hi> They were
half out, and half in; got out from the world, and yet the world
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115390:13"/>
ſtuck cloſe to them; drawn upwards by the Spirit, and yet ſtill
held downwards by the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And for the Devill; his head was a little cruſhed, but he was
not quite trodden under foot. They were not ignorant of his
devices, they knew his wiles well, and yet for all that they were
not free from being entangled by him. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his meſſenger. He went up and down the very Churches
<hi>like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he might devoure;</hi> neither was
he content with particular ſouls, but he never left till he had
ſwallowed up all the Churches.</p>
                  <p>But at the ſecond pouring out of the Spirit, ſpirituall enemies
and ſpirituall evils ſhall be pure ſport. <hi>Nothing ſhall hurt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
in all Gods holy mountain:</hi> Then <hi>the ſucking child ſhall play
on the hole of the Aſpe, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on
the Cockatrice den.</hi> The ſting of ſin ſhall be ſo taken out, that
it ſhall be as harmleſs as any other thing. Such <hi>Light,</hi> ſuch <hi>Life,</hi>
ſuch <hi>Puritie,</hi> ſhall then be diſpenſed, as ſhall transform the very
nature of things. Darkneſs ſhall become Light; Death, Life;
Impurity, Purity, unto them. They ſhall be ſo fully, ſo truely
pure, as all things ſhall be pure to them; ſo fully living, as all
things ſhall be life to them; and full of that light, which maketh
every thing light about it. Sin, and Devil, and Hell, have no evill
Originally in themſelves, but only by a ſharp Law are made
terrible to weak fleſh, but are very pleaſant to the might and
ſtrength of perfect Spirit.</p>
                  <p>4. In reſpect of wiſdome to uſe things. They had not wiſdom
proportionable to make uſe of the things beſtowed on them.
They knew not how to manage their gifts and graces (as appears
in the 12. chap. of the 1 Epiſt. to the Church of <hi>Corinth)</hi> to the
beſt advantage, but <hi>their</hi> very <hi>table became a ſnare to them.</hi>
Their food, though it was weak, yet it was too ſtrong for their
ſtomacks. The wine of the Spirit was too heady for their weak
braines, ſo that it turned them out of the way. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf,
though more then an ordinary man, yet not able to bear more
then ordinary Revelations.</p>
                  <p>But at the ſecond powring out of the Spirit, he ſhall become
a perfect guide. There ſhall be wanting neither light to ſee the
right, nor life to fall in with it to the full. The way of holineſs,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115390:13"/>
true holineſs (not a ſhadowie, not a repreſentative, but true
holineſs) ſhall be ſo plain, that <hi>waifaring men,</hi> that never went
that way before, <hi>though fools,</hi> who have no skill in it, who know
not how to ask a wiſe queſtion about it, <hi>ſhall not erre therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is my intereſt, herein lies my heart, this is all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hope that is left me, (or rather that is a little revived in me)
after the bitter death and loſſe of all. And if this alſo faile me,
or be over-much prolonged, I know not which way to turn,
having nothing further to expect, but to lye down in miſerie.
I have ſeen an end of all the perfection I have hitherto been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with; and if I had it again, yet it would be too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to yield my Spirit content, which through much extremity
hath been forced from its hold, to ſeek out and pant after, a
firmer, a deeper, a larger foundation.</p>
                  <p>And now what ſhall I ſay to you, my dear ones? had I <hi>a word
in Seaſon,</hi> oh with what delight ſhould I give it forth unto
you I and yet why ſhould I poor ignorant wretch be
ſpeaking, when he who knows how to ſpeak, ſees it good to
be ſilent? Had I not better fall a weeping over you? but what
value have my tears above my words? yet let me weep or ſpeak,
or both, at worſt it can be but like what we dayly meet with;
loſt labour, vanitie. And I could almoſt fall into a patheticall
perſwading of you (if I were ſure it might be prevalent and
profitable) to weep with me; yea, and yet ſomewhat further,
even to leave this ſame eager proſecuting the Formes and Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of things (which paſſe away, which periſh in the very
uſe, which did not contain life and ſubſtance in them, even
whileſt it paſſed through them) to withdraw your Spirits from
doting on your preſent enjoyments (if they be preſent) and to
conſider what is abſent, what is worth the enjoying, and to
mourn after it; To forſake <hi>the houſe of Feasting</hi> in theſe poor,
low, dark, ſhallow things, and to enter into <hi>the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
after deep, after excellent things, after that life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which will alone be in requeſt for food and ſatisfaction
of Souls, when theſe ſhall vaniſh, and their emptineſs and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
appear unto, and be acknowledged by all.</p>
                  <p>There is ground of mourning in a double reſpect: both in
reſpect of what is loſt, and in reſpect of what was promiſed
to be enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115390:14"/>
Firſt, In reſpect of what is loſt, and that in a double reſpect alſo:
In reſpect of what you your ſelves have loſt, and likewiſe in reſpect
of what the ſtate of Chriſtianity hath loſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider what ye your ſelves have loſt, and mourn over that.
What Sweetneſs, Meekneſs, Patience, Humility, Faith, Love, &amp;c.
did appear in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a while ago? What Life and Vigour in
Prayer? What inward ſearching of heart, and outward ſtrictneſs
of converſation? Oh where is this! Is it not gone? Nay, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be recovered? Be provoked to jealouſie, O ye profeſſors
of this age, hold forth the truth of things, or give up the name alſo:
if ye have loſt the Subſtance, pleaſe not your ſelves with the Title,
but throw it away alſo, rather then it ſhould hinder you from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
after the Subſtance again.</p>
                  <p>Conſider likewiſe, what the ſtate of Chriſtianity hath loſt:
what it once poſſeſſed, whereof the ſhadow is not now to be
found.</p>
                  <p>What preſence of God dwelling in them. God <hi>dining, ſupping,
walking</hi> up and down with them, and they with him. We know
God by outward apprehenſions, ſucked in from the letter of the
Scriptures: They knew God from the ſight of him, from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings
and out-goings in their own ſpirits. They, by a ſpiritual eye
received from God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt his Son, ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in God the Father and in Jeſus Chriſt: They ſaw God the
Father and Jeſus Chriſt in them. They were <hi>come to Mount Sion,
to the City of the living God, &amp;c. They ſaw, they taſted, they
handled, the Word of Life.</hi> They had golden Candleſticks, and
Chriſt walking in the midſt of them.</p>
                  <p>What Power of the Spirit of God going forth in them. They
could pray in the Spirit, act in the Spirit, live in the Spirit. They
knew how to move towards God in his own Spirit. <hi>Out of their
belly did</hi> indeed <hi>flow rivers of living Water,</hi> which did continually
run back, and carry them back into the Sea of Life.</p>
                  <p>What Liberty of Spirit, true Liberty, wherein they knew
how to uſe every thing, and be in bondage to nothing: Such Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wherein the Spirit might take its full ſcope to meet and enjoy
God every where, in every thing; and the fleſh have no advantage
thereby to feed it ſelf any where, in any thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115390:14"/>
This was once the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that which they were in
a way to attain, that which ſome did attain, yea that which was
generally attained in ſome degree. But where is it now? Who
comes near it? Indeed a ſtrong Imagination may fancy, that it hath
attained ſome kind of reſemblance of it; but do but compare it
with the reality of this ſtate, how ſoon will it appear but an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
but a fancy? and is not this a juſt occaſion of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>Again, There is ground of mourning, in reſpect of what was
promiſed. More was promiſed then they enjoyed. A more full
preſence of God, a more abundant power of the Spirit, a more
perfect liberty in the Spirit. <hi>He that beleeveth, out of his belly
ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. I will dwell with them, and
I will walk in them, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my
ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> Though they had the
enjoyment of this in reſpect of us, yet this was but a promiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of what was to be enjoyed. Promiſes are very large of plenty,
fulneſs of bread, but the children of the promiſes are very ſcanty,
almoſt famiſhed for want of it. How full are the Scriptures of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to the laſt days! We ſay, theſe are the laſt days, and ſurely
we meet with (in part) the miſery that is ſpoken of, as belonging to
the laſt times; but the happineſs, the ſweet enjoyment of God,
the plentiful pourings forth of the Spirit, which are ſo abundantly
promiſed to thoſe times, ſeem more remote from us in view, then
they have been from preceding ages.</p>
                  <p>If ever there was a time for tears without, and grief of ſpirit
within, this ſeems the ſeaſon: when after ſuch an expectation of
Light and Glory, of Settlement and Eſtabliſhment in the things of
God, ſuch thick darkneſs, ſuch univerſal ſhame, ſuch dreadful Shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings,
have ſo apparently overtaken us, and are ſo likely dayly
more and more to overtake us. Not only our Superſtruction, but
our very Foundation is ſhaken; and when we have ſtriven and
tryed to the utmoſt to ſettle again, we may be forced at length to
confeſs, that there is no ſetling any more upon it, but we muſt come
to a deeper bottom, or ſink for ever.</p>

                     <p>MY dear Heart, mine own Soul; what ſhall I call thee? I can

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115390:15"/>
not of my corruptions, (which I hoped had been burning up, and
waſting away,) but of the vigor and life of my ſpirit? Not one
branch of knowledg, not one ſweet motion of my ſpirit, but hath
been confounded, condemned, taken from me, and made odious to
me. Very ſhy have I been of new Notions, till extremity made
me deſirous to entertain any thing that might in any reſpect miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
my torment, and then fain would I beleeve any thing, imagine
any thing, be any thing, for eaſe ſake. And yet to this day am I ſtill
held off from every thing. I can neither receive any thing that is
new, nor return to any thing that is old: but every thing is darkneſs,
death, emptineſs, vanity, a lye. Thus they ſtill appear to me, and
yet my ſpirit preſently judgeth me for ſo thinking and judging,
while I know them not, nor what they may be. I am rent from
all things, but have nothing to turn to. My hopes, comforts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
are all daſhed, but nothing new brought in their ſtead.
I am like a wilde Bull in a net, entangled with miſery and torment,

there is no principle left in me for any man, or means, to work
upon.</p>
                     <p>I will tell thee one ſtrange thing. After I had been long worried,
and had had all my Religion violently rent from me, peece by peece,
and had long mourned over the dead carcaſs; Having at length
forgot the ſweetneſs of it, I was drawn to a willingneſs to part
with it. Hereupon for a ſeaſon I enjoyed a kinde of fools Paradiſe,
yet not without intermixtures of anguiſh; but I was quickly
weary of it, and turned out of it too. At the ſame time alſo I felt
my Reaſon ſomewhat revive, which made me a little entertain this
conjecture: That the blows which did light ſo heavy on it were
for Religions ſake, which it was ſtill offering to be ſerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
while it remained; which when it had once quitted, it much
eſcaped the dint of thoſe ſtrokes which followed it ſo inceſſantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And I finde ſtill ſomewhat more of it in me, then when you
were here; yet have very little comfort or ſweetneſs in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, having this imagination at ſome times ſomewhat ſtrong
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115390:16"/>
in me, That I muſt be ſtripped of the Man, as well as of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;

                     <p>I am weary of all things, of Religion, Reaſon, Senſe, and all
the objects that theſe have to converſe about: but yet there
is ſomewhat in ſtead of theſe that I would fain finde within, and

The Counſel of GOD.</head>
                  <p>ABout the ſame time (when thoſe former
thoughts, mentioned in the Preface,
were freſh in me) or not long after,
There was a Scripture preſented to my view,
which flew into my face, and checked my ſpirit
for ſome things, which I thought I had humbly
and conſcienciouſly done. Perhaps it may
ſpeak ſomewhat to ſome others alſo, where it
may finde enterance; upon which Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it is here annexed.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture was this which follows.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>JOB 38. 2.</bibl>
                     <p>Who is this that darkeneth Counſel by
words without knowledg?</p>

                  <p>THis is Gods enterance into his Expoſtulation with <hi>Job. Job</hi>
was an upright-hearted-man, did truly <hi>fear God, and eſchew
evil,</hi> as God himſelf teſtifieth of him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. By temptation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115390:18"/>
and affliction he becomes the moſt miſerable of men. There is
great diſpute between <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends concerning the Counſel
of God in this thing. His Friends ſay, it was becauſe of ſin: For
his <hi>wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> ſaith one; for his <hi>hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi>
ſaith another. <hi>Job</hi> bears himſelf very high above them all,
laughs at them, denies utterly that it was either for one ſin or other,
and is ſo confident, that he offers to plead with God himſelf about
the matter.</p>
                  <p>In his diſpute, this is the great thing he drives at: That God
ſtands not upon ſin in his dealings with men, but <hi>perfect and wicked
he conſumeth;</hi> falls upon either ſort as he pleaſeth. (God caſts the
beſt into his furnace of fire, as well as the worſt; and when he
caſts them in, he melts the whole veſſel, he melts all that is in them;
as well the ſilver and the gold, as the tin and the droſs: and both
ſuffer loſs in the fire, onely with this difference: The one loſeth its
ſubſtance, the other its ſhape; the droſs, the tin, is burn'd up in
the fire, is quite conſumed by it; the ſilver and gold loſe onely
their ſhape. In plain terms, Fleſhly graces, fleſhly priviledges,
fleſhly hopes, fleſhly joys, fleſhly peace, fleſhly knowledg of
God, fleſhly life in God, which did not flow purely from his
Spirit, but was ſtrained by the wit and induſtry of man out of the
Scriptures, when it is once caſt into the fire, ſhall never come out
alive, but periſh there: But that which was truly ſpiritual, which
did indeed flow from God, which had the true life and power of
God in it, ſhall riſe again in the ſame ſubſtance, though not
in the ſame image.) Thus <hi>Job</hi> lifts up himſelf in this high
peece of knowledg (wherein he went far beyond the reach of his
Friends) till God here comes to take him to do; <hi>Who is this that
darkeneth Counſel by words without knowledg?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Counſel</hi> is the intent of a perſon concerning things, what he
drives at in the things he does. The Counſel of God is not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf, but what is intended by him in the action. What he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
in the Creation, in making ſuch and ſuch kinde of things;
what he intends in the Government of the World, in ordering
things in this or that manner; in the ſeaſons of the year, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rain, in withholding rain, &amp;c. in the ſeaſons of Ages, in lifting
up, in throwing down, this or that: So in the Government
of the Church, in afflicting ſome, in exalting others, &amp;c. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115390:18"/>
aim, the intent of God, in any particular tranſaction, that is his
Counſel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To darken Counſel</hi> is to cover, to hide, this meaning of God;
to make it more intricate and difficult to be underſtood. Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals,
opens, diſcovers things; Darkneſs vails, hides things from
ſight. To enlighten is to make manifeſt, to expoſe to view; to
darken is to make obſcure, to hide from view.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By words without knowledg.</hi> Knowledg is the perſons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of a thing, a perſons acquaintance with a thing, a perſons
inſight into a thing, whereby he is enabled to diſcover it to another,
which he that hath not knowledg cannot do. A man cannot make
that known, which he himſelf doth not know. When a man ſpeaks
concerning a thing to open it, he pretends to bring light, to bring
words of knowledg round about it, to make it manifeſt to him
that is ignorant of it; but if his words have not light in them, if
they do not reach the nature of the thing, then they are words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledg, darkening words.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe here. He takes up his Friends ſharply for
darkening Counſel, for <hi>words without knowledg,</hi> and pretends to
rectifie them, to open that Counſel which they had hid and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to bring light about that which they had darkened; and ſo he
ſeems to do, till God comes to take him up alſo, and tells him, that
he alſo darkens Counſel by his ſhallow expreſſions of it, and blames
him for it, as taking too much upon him; <hi>Who is this that darkens
Counſel by words without knowledg?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words ſeem to give forth theſe two things of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>1. The cleareſt holding forth of the Counſels of God, without
the Light of God, is but a darkening of them. Mans light, mans
underſtanding, and from thence revealing the things of God, though
it may appear as a very eminent and glorious diſcovery of thoſe
things, yet it is but a vailing, but a clouding of them. Man is very
ignorant of God, when he ſeems deep and high in the knowledg of
him; and does but darken him, when he ſtrives to make him mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
The light of man is but darkneſs before God, and the caſting
abroad of this light is but ſcattering darkneſs about God, which
though it cannot darken <hi>God</hi> in himſelf, yet it may, and doth, darken
him to thoſe to whom it ſeems to reveal him, though they perceive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115390:19"/>
it not, but think they have attained ſome ſight of God by it. And
Man would hardly beleeve, if he were told, that he ſhall not come
this way to know God, but muſt be plunged in darkneſs to have
this light buryed, before the true light break in upon him: and
yet it may be ſo, though Man with his eye, and in his day, cannot
diſcern it.</p>
                  <p>2. It is an act of preſumption (a thing that does little beſeem
man) to hold forth the Counſels of God without the Light of God.
Man goes beyond his ſphere, when he will take upon him, by his
ſhallow apprehenſion, to meaſure the things of God, and ſo to
give them out as the things of God. <hi>Who is this?</hi> that takes ſo
much upon him, that will be opening the Counſels of God, and yet
hath not knowledg?</p>
                  <p>I may ſpeak ſomewhat concerning both theſe.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The cleareſt holding forth of the Counſels of God, without the
Light of God, is but a darkening of them. Job</hi> here a man eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualified with knowledg, neither was he one whoſe knowledg
God was likely to blaſt for any jugling in his ſpirit, but of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
heart too; a man that ſpake as right of God, as it was almoſt
poſſible for a man to do; yea, God in part doth juſtifie him, <hi>Chap.</hi>
42. 7. yet <hi>Job,</hi> in thinking to open the Counſels of God, darkens
them. In compariſon of what his Friends ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken
right, it was light compared with their darkneſs; but bring it to
the touchſtone, ſet it by Truth, by pure light, then it alſo is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>There is none knows the minde of God but himſelf. <hi>What man
knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in
him? even ſo the things of God none knoweth, but the Spirit of
God, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11. You may ſee a man doing many things, but you
know not his minde, his intent therein: ſo he that hath a true, a
ſpiritual eye to ſee ſome motions and actions of God, yet may miſs
of his meaning in them, unleſs his <hi>Spirit</hi> reveal it to him: and he
that knoweth it not, how can he ſpeak it forth? his words muſt
needs be without knowledg.</p>
                  <p>There is no gathering the minde of God from any of his words
or works, but by his own Light. All the ſight Man has of things,
without the Light of God, doth not reach the minde of God.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115390:19"/>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> was as entire, ingenuous, ſearching a man as well could be, and
had, no doubt, that which we call the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of
God, and did attain much: yet his knowledg was not the opening,
but the darkening of God, the hiding of his Counſel.</p>
                  <p>The ſight we have of things is both a ſhallow ſight, and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſight.</p>
                  <p>It is a dark, ſhallow, imperfect ſight, both in reſpect of the things
we ſee, and in reſpect of their reference one to another.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the things we ſee. We ſee but part of things,
but the leaſt part, the outſide, the ſhape of a creature: we ſee not
the nature, the inward properties, much leſs the internal Subſtance
of things. So we ſee the outſide, the rationality of a Scripture,
but not the inward life and ſpirit of it. We are come to <hi>the
Mount that may be touched</hi> by our Senſe, Reaſon and Experience,
but the ſpiritual Glory and Majeſty of God is not diſcovered from
that Mount, nor to that eye that looks there for it.</p>
                  <p>And for the reference of things one to another: who ſees
how one creature, one action of providence refers to another.
There is no man ſees Gods Works <hi>from the beginning to the
end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then that little ſight we have of theſe is uncertain, liable
to deceit. We ſee things as they <hi>are not,</hi> not as <hi>they are:</hi> The
true Being is hid, and the appearance of things (being ſo various
and myſtical) eaſily cozens a weak eye. We cannot judg of
things that are vailed, by the vail that lies upon them; and yet
this is all the ſight we have: And what man, from ſuch a dark
ſight of things, can give a clear account of things, or of Gods
Counſel, of his meaning in things? Therefore there is no
knowing, or grounded declaring any Counſel of God without
his light.</p>
                  <p>As there is no knowing man, or the things of man, by any
light beneath mans: The ſenſe, the underſtanding of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will not reach it; that kind of knowledg they have of man,
deſerves not the name of knowledg: So there is no knowing
God, or the things of God, by any light beneath his. The light
muſt be of the ſame kind with the thing it diſcovers, or it cannot
diſcover it. The light of the creature can never diſcern the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
but it muſt be the light of the Creator let into the creature,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115390:20"/>
which diſcovers the Creator to the creature.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is a kind of knowledg in the creature anſwerable
to the ſtate and being of the creature; but this kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
is darkneſs, is ignorance, to the true and ſpiritual kind: and
an over-high conceit of the excellency of this knowledg, is one
of the greateſt blocks to true ſpiritual knowledg. The ſenſible
uſe of this eye makes men inſenſible of the want of the true eye:
becauſe they find they do ſee, they take it for granted they have
an eye; and ſo they have, both an eye and a ſight, but not a right
eye, not a right ſight: yea, though it be a right eye to them, it
were better it were plucked out and caſt away, then poſſeſſed by
them.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt there is a God; Nature, the Scripture, teacheth
thee ſo: thou canſt reaſon ſo from his works, from the things
that are made, which evidence to thee his <hi>eternal Power and
Godhead:</hi> thou knoweſt he muſt needs be <hi>wiſe, holy, righteous,
powerful, &amp;c.</hi> Well, in what light doſt thou ſee this? Doth
thy Reaſon tell thee ſo? I do not blame thee for hearkening to
the voyce of thy Reaſon, nor do I deny this to be knowledg in
its kind, it is knowledg in the earthly, in the natural man; but
for all that, it is ignorance, it is darkneſs, compare it with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
light: Thou mayſt be a very Atheiſt in the eye of God, and
as ignorant of God, in reſpect of the true kind of knowledg, as
the bruit creatures are, notwithſtanding all this.</p>
                  <p>So thou knoweſt, that thou art a ſinner; that there is Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt for thoſe that beleeve; that Faith is the gift of
God; that thoſe who receive this gift, and Chriſt by it, muſt
walk in new obedience.</p>
                  <p>But tell me, O poor Soul, cannot the natural underſtanding
drink in all theſe things? Is it not almoſt neceſſary, that a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
touched with the ſenſe of eternal miſery, ſhould pant after
Redemption, ſhould hearken out for it, ſhould with readineſs
embrace it, and fight with all reluctances in it ſelf againſt it?
If beleeving be the way, I will preſently beleeve; or if I cannot
beleeve, I will pray for faith; if my ſelf be my greateſt enemy, I
will deny, I will hate my ſelf, and by the ſtrength of Chriſt I will
walk in all the ways of new obedience. How naturally doth
the poor frighted creature take this courſe! and how vigorous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115390:20"/>
will nature be, when it is put forth to the utmoſt, for the utmoſt
degree of ſelf-preſervation and happineſs! And yet what man
almoſt that finds theſe anything lively and vigorous in himſelf,
but takes it for granted, that they are ſpiritual! No man can
attain theſe things but by the Spirit of God; no man can know
Chriſt, or acknowledg him to be the Lord, but by the
Spirit; no man can beleeve, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to whom it is given. I have,
by the goodneſs of God, been led into theſe things: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is by the Spirit; and theſe in me muſt needs be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                  <p>Ah poor man I why doſt thou cozen thy ſelf? How comeſt
thou to be ſo ſubtle a Sophiſter? Doſt thou not know it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thine own Soul? The ſame things may be ſeen with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
eyes, naturally with the natural eye, ſpiritually with the
ſpiritual eye. The queſtion is, with what eye thou ſeeſt theſe
things. Thou wilt prove it is the ſpiritual eye, becauſe thou
ſeeſt them. It is true, if thou couldſt prove thy ſight to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
then thou mighteſt conclude thine eye to be ſpiritual: but
there is a very clear kind of ſeeing with the natural eye, as well
as with the ſpiritual eye, which ſelf-love, joyned to a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have it of the beſt kinde, will eaſily perſwade the poor
creature to reſolve it to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Ah Chriſtians, Chriſtians, how long will ye <hi>lay out your money
for that which is not bread!</hi> How long will ye feed on the husky
knowledg of things which cannot ſatisfie! Ye may pleaſe your
ſelves in the night, in a dream, thinking ye make brave meals; but
when ye awake in the day, ye will find your bellies empty; and
then, oh what lamentation will there be over husky Knowledg,
husky Interpretations of Scripture, husky Graces, husky Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
husky Hopes, &amp;c. things that yeelded great pleaſure in a
dream, in a fancy; but vaniſh when reality, when truth comes
to be diſcovered. Thus much for the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>As touching the ſecond, which is this:</p>
                  <p>It is an act of preſumption to hold forth the Counſels of God
without the Light of God. Who is this, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold ſtep or degree of preſumption in it.
One in reſpect of God; another in reſpect of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and a third in reſpect of the ſtate of the perſon who doth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115390:21"/>
this: all which together aggravate this preſumption, and raiſe
it very high.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of God; his Height, his Eminence, maketh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tranſaction towards him preſumptuous, unleſs it be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly
managed. The greatneſs of perſons maketh thoſe
tranſactions preſumptuous towards them, which would not be
ſo towards others. God is very high, very great, and that makes
it a very high preſumption to intermeddle with things belonging
to him without his warrant.</p>
                  <p>Man, though he were created lord of all, yet the creatures are
more Gods then his; and if God had not ſealed a Warrant to
him, it had been boldneſs in him to have touched the leaſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Now he hath given no man liberty to open his Counſels
without his Light; he giveth no man liberty to deface his Image,
to hold forth his own carnal apprehenſions for the ſpiritual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of Gods Truth. God hath ſet ranges about every ſpiritual
thing, as he did about Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that none may break in to
gaze without his Commiſſion; none but whom he leads muſt
enter into his Counſels; it muſt needs be therefore great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for any perſon to venture to declare his meaning before he
hath received his light.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of the things themſelves, in reſpect of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
they are great, myſterious, and ſecret. It is preſumption
to meddle with any thing that belongs to a great perſon without
his leave; but to meddle with his weighty affairs, with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
is an aggravation of the preſumption. The Counſels of God
are ſecret things: the Actions of God are ſomewhat open and
manifeſt, but what he intends in his Actions is deeply hid. That
the Tower of <hi>Siloam,</hi> by the providence and Will of God, fell
upon ſuch and ſuch, ſeemeth ſomewhat eaſie to be diſcerned:
but thence to conclude, that God did thereby intend to ſignifie,
that theſe were ſinners in a ſpecial degree above the reſt, was a
preſumption Chriſt warned them to beware of. The Counſels
of God they are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the depths of God,</hi> he is <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Counſel;</hi> his Counſel is ſuch, that men and Angels cannot
but wonder at it, when it is revealed; but there is no certain
gueſſing at it without his revealing it, and it is no ſmall peece of
boldneſs to venture ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115390:21"/>
3. In reſpect of the ſtate of the perſons, which is a low ſtate far
beneath God, and a broken ſtate, far beneath it ſelf. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſtate in its puritie is far ſhort of Spiritualitie. <hi>Adam</hi> the
earthly man had an earthly image, an earthly knowledge, but
not a ſpirituall: and <hi>the naturall man cannot diſcern the
things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells
of God are far above the reach of our nature, yea above the
reach of any ſpirit but his own. His riddle is ſo deep that Chriſt
himſelf could never have found it out, but that he had his heyfer
to plough with, into his own bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome. The Angels they peep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things as they are revealed, but they cannot diſcern them till
they be revealed. How bold then is man, poor weak man, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
man, that will be piercing into theſe things, and
holding them forth as the light of God, without the light
of God. This raiſeth the preſumption very high.</p>
                  <p>What man almoſt in any trade, if a perſon that hath no skill
ſhall come and paſſe his judgement upon his workmanſhip, but
looks upon it with diſdain, accounting that perſon preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though far above him in degree? and yet man hath the
ſame principle with man, to receive the things of man into:
How diſdainfully then think you will God take it, that poor
ſhallow man, poor broken man, ſilly weak-eye'd man, that is ſo
many regions below God, ſo far beneath that principle wherein
God lives and acts (who lives in light and acts from light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approachable)
ſhould be opening Gods Counſells by his ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
brain, ſhould be meaſuring the light of Gods infinite Spirit,
by the darkneſs (or, if you will, by the light) of his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
So much for the ſecond likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now from both we may take notice of theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>1. It may blame us for our forwardneſs in opening Gods
Counſell in things. Every man almoſt can tell what God means
in every thing: this, God intends in this; this, in that: Is ſuch
a man afflicted ſo or ſo? oh, I thought he would be met with;
it was for ſuch or ſuch a thing. There is hardly an action
of providence, but every man will be ready to interpret; few
Scriptures but bold man will be ready to ſhew Gods meaning
in them, and that very confidently if he have but a little bent
his thoughts that way.</p>
                  <p>2. It may ſhew us what the wiſeſt undertakings in this kind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115390:22"/>
are; what our wiſe openings of Scriptures and Counſells of
God, without the light of God are: if any man can truely and
groundedly ſay, n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t I but the Spirit of God in me, opens this
or that Scripture, thus and thus unto me; that is another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I have nothing to ſay againſt that, but I ſpeak concerning
our own opening, though by our moſt ingenuous and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſearch, by the faireſt debating things i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> our own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
yea, of our wiſe opening, when we ſeem to give out the
full intent, the very life and heart of a Scripture, and fence it
about with ſtrong Argumen's, making that interpretation ſafe
from all reaſonings of all contrary judgements whatſoever,
what is this? but a peece of folly, of madneſs; a ſetting up the
wiſdome of man, an idolizing the pleaſant conceptions of mans
working brain; but a darkening of God: So God ſaid of <hi>Job</hi> and
ſo <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth his to be, chap. 42. ver. 3. <hi>Who is he that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Conncel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I
underſtood not, things too wonderful for me which I knew not:</hi>
Ah what a fool have I been, ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi> to ſpeak I knew not
what, to utter that out, which I my ſelf did not underſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to hide the wonderfull Couſell of God by my vain words,
and how preſumptuous have I been in doing of it! <hi>Who is he
that hideth Councel, &amp;c.</hi> he brings this reproach cloſe to his
ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>3. It may be a ground of ſilence and waiting for the light. This
effect it likewiſe wrought in <hi>Iob. I will lay my hand upon my
mouth,</hi> I will ſtop all that my mouth would be uttering for the
future, <hi>once have I ſpoken but I will no more, yea twice but I
will proceed no further;</hi> I will never undertake to open the
Councels of God again, after this rate: Now I have ſeen God,
now I have heard God, I perceive what my own knowledge
was, <hi>I</hi> ſee what a dark blind buzzard <hi>I</hi> was in the midſt of my
confidence, concerning mine own cleer eye-ſight. Oh it were
excellent to be brought to this by the ſight of God, as <hi>Iob</hi> was;
but its good alſo to check proud reaſon by its own light; in
which ballance, if things were duly weighed, there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

Oh how lovely, how excellent is this to the reliſh of my

But if the ſtrength of Reaſon by its workings hath purged out
old notions, and brought theſe and other like in their ſtead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the old veſſel, the creaturely imagination or underſtanding; I muſt
profeſs, of all things this is the greateſt abomination to my ſpirit, and
I thirſt exceedingly to ſee the unquenchable fire let looſe upon theſe
notions, and cannot but laugh in my ſpirit to behold what havock
it will make among them, of whom it will be as quick, greedy and
powerful a devourer, as you expect to ſee it of any principles or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that have gone before them. The great Queen, that looks to
ſit <hi>a Lady for ever,</hi> that ſaith and thinketh, <hi>I am, and none elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

and out of her heart, and ſhe alſo muſt come to <hi>ſit as a widow,</hi> and
<hi>know the loſs of children,</hi> yea this miſery ſhall light upon her even
in <hi>perfection,</hi> becauſe of the multitude of her ſorceries and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherewith ſhe bewitched and intangled the poor deſolated
people of God, and whereby ſhe made account to charm off all
ſorrow from her ſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 47. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing more to ſay to you, but this: Ye will one day
confeſs, <hi>That the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in Word, but in
Power.</hi> True Life, true Spirituality, lyeth not in the height of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but in the inward vigor of the Spirit of Life. High notions
are very pleaſing to the fleſh, ſhe loves to get upon the pinacle of
knowledg, and to trample upon all that are in dreſſes beneath her,
though they be the ſame with her: yet is ſhe never the more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the eye of God, but the greater object of his Jealouſie and
Indignation. He cannot endure to ſee the Whore dreſſed like his
Bride: Theſe ornaments muſt off, as well as the former. The Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
Reaſon, Wiſdom, Underſtanding of the creature, thus
clothed, thus adorned, thus fortified, being for all this but fleſh, muſt
feel that it is ſo, by being ſtripped, burnt, conſumed, by that fire,
which will deſtroy all that cannot live in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait for his Law.</hi> There is a Law which <hi>HE</hi>
hath to reveal; a ſweet Law, an inward Law, a Law of true Life,
of true Liberty, whereas fleſhly liberty, in its higheſt ſtrain, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſcope, is but bondage. There is no attaining to the ſight of
this Law by any ſtrivings or ſtruglings of the creature: happy is he
who is led to wait for it. But till the diſcovery of it, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſcern or diſtinguiſh thoſe things, which it alone can teach:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115390:23"/>
and mens fleſhly toſſing and <hi>turning of things upſide down, will be
eſteemed but as the potters clay.</hi> A fleſhly deſtroying, a fleſhly
throwing down, will be of as little value as a fleſhly rearing up;
and fleſh will be no more juſtified in running apace from things, then
it was in running to things. When God <hi>puts his Law into our
hearts, and writes it in our inward parts,</hi> and takes ſuch hold of us
that we cannot <hi>depart from</hi> him, then ſhall we err no more: but if
we had never ſo clear and full diſcoveries, if we were withall left in
the leaſt to our ſelves, we ſhould be ſtill at our old work, <hi>viz.</hi> a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up ſuch a fleſhly fabrick in our ſelves and others, as would ſtand
in the way of Gods Glory, and our own happineſs. Till God takes
upon him to be All, and to do all, not in Word, but in Truth and
Power, all cannot be well.</p>
                  <p>O GOD, What a ſtate are things in! Here is every one tugging
for their Intetereſt, put in for thine too. Do thou gain, and let all
ſit down with loſs, whoſe gain lies not in thine. Take from us all,
what we have ſtollen from thee, for it cannot thrive in our hands,
nor miſcarry in thine. Cozen all creatures, by bringing about a
ſwifter, a fuller, a more univerſal Happineſs, then ever heart could
imagine. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and ſtrong one, which as a tempeſt

                  </q>
                  <p>Behold a drunkenneſs, which is not a matter of ſhame, but a
crown, a beauty, a glorious beauty; yet a Wo follows, which
pitifully bemires this crown, this beauty, this glory.</p>
                  <p>It is not the common ſort of the world that are here ſpoken of,
but <hi>Iſrael, Gods own people;</hi> nor the common ſort of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but
<hi>Ephraim, the pride or glory of Iſrael, Ephraim</hi> the dear Tribe, the
Tribe picked out to be bleſſed, <hi>(In thee ſhall Iſrael bleſs, ſaying,
God make thee as Ephraim:)</hi> Nor yet the common ſort of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>
but the choiceſt, the peculiar ones, who by their worth and
excellency, their ſtrictneſs and exactneſs, were the <hi>crown</hi> of that
pride. This drunkenneſs was a peculiar kind of drunkenneſs, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
only to the people of God, my proper to the devouteſt among
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115390:26"/>
them: it was Religion, Devotion, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> was drunk with,
it was the ſteem of that wine overcame him, overturned his weak
brain, and made him ſtumble and tumble into miſery, while
he thought he was going on ſafely and ſwiftly towards happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>He that will take pains to ſearch, and hath an eye to ſee with,
may perhaps find <hi>Ephraim</hi> drunk with theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>With his religious Performances;</hi> his Sacrifices, his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the revealed Will of God; his faſting, his feaſting, or
thankſgiving, and ſuch other Ordinances of Worſhip. <hi>Ephraim</hi>
expreſſed his drunkenneſs herein, both by his over-valuing them,
and by his over-performing them.</p>
                  <p>He over-valued them, he looked upon them as more excellent
things then they were, forgetting out of what lump they came, as
well as out of what lump he himſelf came. He looked upon them
as more pleaſing to God then there was cauſe for, who little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them at the beſt, but now began to turn much more from them,
finding man ſo taken with them. <hi>My Soul loatheth your ſolemn
Feaſts.</hi> Praiſing God, uſing the creatures in a way of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and honouring the Creator, a ſet and ſolemn lifting up of the
Name of God, what can carry a greater ſhew of excellency in it?
and yet, oh how God turns from it! <hi>My Soul loatheth your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Feaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Ephraim</hi> did over do them too, (as man thinks he can never
exceed in acts of worſhipping God, eſpecially if they be of his own
inſtitution.) <hi>Ephraim</hi> did more of theſe then ever God deſired of
him; did even tire God out with the multitude of his Sacrifices
and Services. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, will the

God had ſo much of theſe, he was fain to cry, Hold. <hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is the multitude of your Sacrifices, &amp;c. your new Moons, &amp;c.
I am weary of them. Who hath required this at your hands?</hi>

                  <p>2. <hi>With his ſpiritual Priviledges;</hi> his nearneſs to God, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God, the Teſtimonies of Gods preſence with him, ſuch as
the <hi>Ark, Temple, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ephraim</hi> did over-value theſe too, thought theſe to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature then they were, of a more excellent laſting nature. Little
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115390:27"/>
thought he that theſe could paſs away, or be of ſo little efficacy, as
many times they were, while they remained.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>With his Security in respect of both.</hi> He thought himſelf
ſeated in bleſſedneſs, and far from miſery. <hi>The overflowing ſcourge</hi>
may over-run the world, but he thinks himſelf ſafe from it: And
as for <hi>Hell and Death,</hi> they may ſeize on others, but he is at <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
with them, he is ſecured from them by his intereſt in God, and
by the promiſes of God to him, which cannot fail.</p>
                  <p>Ah poor <hi>Ephraim!</hi> what wilt thou do, when thou ſhalt meet
with this <hi>Wo?</hi> when thou ſhalt not only find thy glorious beauty
a fading, but the Spirit of the Lord blowing upon it with a ſtrong
<hi>Eaſt wind?</hi> when that Spirit that breathed life into it ſhall not
only withdraw from it, but blow ſharply upon it? when thou
findeſt by ſenſible and undeniable experience that which thou
thoughteſt utterly impoſſible?</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is not <hi>everlaſting</hi> may paſs away: that which thou
calleſt <hi>everlaſting</hi> may not be ſo. The narrowneſs of thy eye may
cauſe thee to take things to be everlaſting, which are far ſhort of it.
Things everlaſting after thy meaſure may be of very ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
after Gods meaſure: Look to thy footing.</p>

                     <p>O God, thou hast caſt us off, thou haſt ſcattered us, thou haſt been
displeaſed, O turn thy ſelf to us again.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt made the earth to tremble, thou haſt broken it: heal
the breaches thereof, for it ſhaketh.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt ſhewed thy people hard things; thou haſt made us to

                  </q>
                  <p>Here is the lamentation of <hi>Ephraim</hi> over his own dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
ſtate, wherein he very pathetically deciphers and bewails his
miſery, and caſts an eye of grief likewiſe upon the ſad diſtaſters that
befall the world at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Verſe ſpeaks mournfully of Gods ſharp dealings with
his people, expreſſing withal their affectionate deſire to have them
changed. <hi>O God, thou haſt caſt us off, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Verſe holds out his ſharp dealings towards the
world, with a deſire of relief towards it likewiſe. <hi>Thou haſt made
the earth to tremble, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115390:27"/>
The third Verſe contains a further aggravation of the ſharpneſs
of Gods dealings towards his people, which it ſets forth both in
general, <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed thy people hard things;</hi> and lays down
a particular inſtance, <hi>Thou haſt made us to drink the wine of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The hard dealings they complain of in the firſt Verſe are three.
<hi>Thou haſt cast us off, thou haſt ſcattered</hi> or <hi>broken us,</hi> and <hi>thou
haſt been diſpleaſed.</hi> Thou haſt caſt us off from thy ſelf, ſcattered and
broken us one from another, and in our own ſpirits; and that which
is worſt of all, thou haſt ſuffered thine heart to be offended againſt
us, <hi>thou haſt been diſpleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt cast us off.</hi> This points at the relation and ſtate,
which God and his people ſtand in one to another, and ſhould of
right be found in: which is a ſtate of union, a ſtate of fellowſhip,
a ſtate of embracement. He the Father, they the children; He the
Husband, they the Spouſe; He the Maſter, they the Servants; He
the King, they his Subjects. They ſhould live in the ſame <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
dwell in the ſame <hi>houſe,</hi> ſit at the ſame <hi>table,</hi> lie in the ſame
<hi>bed,</hi> have the ſame ſhare within, and the ſame lot without in every
thing. Every thing that is theirs muſt become his; every thing
that is his muſt become theirs. All their <hi>beauty,</hi> their <hi>excellency,</hi>
their <hi>glory,</hi> muſt not be to adorn or ſerve themſelves with; but to
adorn him with, to cloath him with, to ſerve him with. <hi>All his
Wiſdom, his Excellency, his Power, his Love, his infinite Riches,
Greatneſs and Majeſty,</hi> muſt not be to pleaſe himſelf, but to fill
them with, to lay out for them, to beſtow upon them, to empty
into them.</p>
                  <p>When God takes a people, he draws them nigh to himſelf, opens
his boſom to them, embraces them, pitches his <hi>Tabernacle</hi> among
them to dwell with them, builds an houſe for them to live together,
erects a bed, prepares a table for them, feeds, cheriſhes them, as the
man doth the wife, the father the child; ſtands in their defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all oppoſition. Sin within, enemies without, nothing muſt
ſpeak a word againſt them: if they do, he takes it as ſpoken againſt
himſelf. <hi>He that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye.</hi>
And ſo 'tis with them, <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached
thee are fallen upon me.</hi> This is the proper ſtate between
them.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115390:28"/>
But now behold, hearken, and you ſhall hear them complaining,
and that to God himſelf, <hi>O God, thou haſt caſt us off.</hi> Thou haſt
thruſt us out of thy preſence, Thou haſt withheld thy ſweetneſs
from us. We are not now one, but ſevered, and at a great diſtance
one from another. We never meet at the ſame bed, at the ſame
board, in the ſame houſe, no not in the ſame Kingdom: but thou
thy ſelf art gone into a far Country, and haſt left us here in a ſtrange
Land.</p>
                  <p>O God, our happineſs lies in thine embraces, in union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with thee. We deſire nothing but to be near God, <hi>to
dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of our lives,</hi> to ſee in the
boſom of the Lord all the motions of our ſpirits: But <hi>O God, thou
hast cast us off,</hi> thou haſt given us a bill of divorce, and ſent us
packing. We can hear no news of thee, no news from thee. Lie we
in never ſo great depths of miſery, and pangs of ſpirit, thou regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
not. We are as a woman forſaken, bearing up and down the
reproach of our widowhood continually, <hi>O GOD, thou haſt caſt
us off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt ſcattered</hi> or <hi>broken us.</hi> There ſhould be a publique
communion among the people of God. They ſhould have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
one with another, as well as with God. They that are ſo
near in one ſpirit, ſhould not be ſuch ſtrangers here in the
fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And there ſhould be alſo a meeting and current of life in every
ones particular ſpirit. <hi>Faith, Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould
meet in the inner man, and go forth from the inner man into their
ſeveral ways of ſpiritual motion. Thus it is when things are
right.</p>
                  <p>But now, <hi>Thou haſt broken us. Thou haſt ſcattered us</hi> up and
down one from another. How are the people of God rent in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
one from another! So ſcattered, that they can have no true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
communion together! And how broken and ſhattered in
their own ſpirits! their life broken, their light broken, their joy
broken, their peace broken, their hope broken, their faith broken;
yea every thing ſo broken, that there is nothing left whole within
neither. Surely ſome feel this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt been diſpleaſed.</hi> All Relations are knit up of Love.
The relation between King and People, father and child, husband
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115390:28"/>
and wife, are knit by ſeveral ways of affections one to another,
wherein their hearts ſtand towards one another, according to the
tye and bond of the Relation. Now in ſeveral caſes their hearts
turn one from another. They do not only act harſhly one towards
another, as it often falls out; but in ſome caſes their hearts turn
one from another.</p>
                  <p>And this points at ſomewhat in God, who hath ſo ordered
things, that though the original tye between him and his Spouſe be
ever the ſame; yet there are certain caſes, yea, he himſelf often caſts
her into ſuch a poſture, wherein his heart turns from her. He can at
the ſame time wonderfully love her, and yet loath her in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
condition. Though he loves her in her perſon, yet he loaths her
in her ſtate of weakneſs and vanity. And though the ſtrength of
his love to her perſon cauſeth him at ſometimes to turn towards
her, and entertain fellowſhip with her; yet the vileneſs of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate ſoon turns his ſtomack, and cauſes him to withdraw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the husband likewiſe is at preſent in ſuch an unlovely
ſtate, ſo dark, ſo hidden, and in that reſpect ſo unlovely; his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
ſo clouded, and he thereby appearing ſo unlike himſelf, that
the Spirit of the Spouſe too turns from her Husband, and ſhe doth
not like ſuch a God as he now appears to be.</p>
                  <p>Now of all things, this is moſt irkſom to each, When they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the heart of either turning from the other. God regards not
all the ſins of his people. Let him but find their love flow forth
fully towards him, their hearts ſtand entirely and only to him-wards,
he has enough. Nor do the people of God much grumble at the
afflictions and miſeries that befall them from God, they know they
have need of theſe things. But when they ſuſpect that they take
offence at one another, that their hearts begin to withdraw, then
they ſtir up one anothers jealouſie. God complains much of his
peoples thus provoking him to jealouſie, and likewiſe ſpeaks of his
provoking them to jealouſie in the ſame manner. And this is that
that lies ſore here at the Spouſes heart, <hi>Thou haſt been diſpleaſed.</hi>
Sure thou haſt taken ſome offence at us; or thou wouldſt never have
dealt thus with us.</p>
                  <p>O turn thy ſelf to us again, <hi>Now the Spouſe ſpeaks to God, as
he doth at another time to her;</hi> Thou haſt played the harlot with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115390:29"/>
many lovers, yet turn again to me, ſaith the Lord. Thou hast caſt
us off, and ſcattered us, and haſt been displeaſed, O turn thy ſelf
to us again, <hi>ſaith the Spouſe; that will help all, all the reſt will
quickly be forgot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church feels her ſickneſs, and knows what will heal her. Her
wound, her miſery, came by Gods turning from her, by his turning
his back upon her; and ſhe knows nothing will heal her, but his
turning again to her, and that ſhe calls to him for. She doth not pray
to have her wounds healed, or to have comforts or enjoyments
from him; but ſhe prays for that which will do all, <hi>O turn thy ſelf
to us again.</hi> All our content lay in thee, All our trouble ariſes from
thy abſence, from thy turning away and departing from us, <hi>O turn
to us again.</hi> She prays for healing for the world in the next Verſe,
<hi>Heal the breaches of it,</hi> that will ſerve their turn: but no healing
but the preſence of thy ſelf will ſerve our turn. If thou intendeſt
any pity, any relief to us, there is no way but this to bring it home
to our hearts, <hi>Turn thy ſelf to us again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing can throughly wound a Soul truly acquainted
with God, but his withdrawing from it: Nor is there any thing
can heal that wound, but his return again. This is all the requeſt
ſuch a Soul knows how to put up from the bottom of his ſpirit, <hi>O
turn thy ſelf to us again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. Thou haſt made the earth to tremble, thou hast broken it:
heal the breaches thereof, for it ſhaketh.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time when God rouls up the Heavens like a Scrole,
he kindles a fire in the bowels of the earth. When he cauſeth the
ſpiritual <hi>Beauty, Glory, Reſt</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of his own dear people to
paſs away, the earth muſt not enjoy theirs long after. When Chriſt
cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> there was
immediately an <hi>Earthquake:</hi> And when the people of Chriſt (who
are of the ſame Body, feel the ſame things, and cannot but expreſs
the ſame ſence) cry out, <hi>O God, thou haſt caſt us off, thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
us,</hi> thou haſt ſhut up the light of thy countenance (which was
ever our life) in the diſpleaſure of thine heart; the earth ſhall feel
ſomewhat to complain of too. When he falls upon all the ſeveral
parcels of his <hi>own holy Land</hi> to lay them flat, he will likewiſe <hi>ariſe
to ſhake terribly the earth:</hi> And he doth here ſo tear and rent it,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115390:29"/>
that he makes it tremble under ſenſe of what it feels, and of what
it further expects.</p>
                  <p>But this is no delight to the poor people of God, They deſire
not to have the earth ſhare with them in miſery. Though the earth
has ever delighted to ſee them rent and torn, has been ſtill perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, even when God has <hi>ſmitten</hi> them, yea moſt when they
have been moſt ſmitten by him; yet they have no pleaſure in the
breaches God makes on the earth, but would fain have them heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and put up a very affectionate requeſt here for it, <hi>Heal the
breaches thereof, for it ſhaketh.</hi> It cannot ſtand long in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
viſit it betimes with health, with Salvation. It ſhakes already,
relieve it, reſcue it, before it ſhake quite in peeces.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed thy people hard things.</hi> Thou haſt
dealt very hardly with thy people: Oh many hard things that we
could mention, many bitter, ſharp paſſages that our ſpirits have been
ſenſible of. We never looked that God ſhould have dealt ſo with
us. Who ever would have told us that God would have dealt ſo
with his people, we ſhould have accounted him an abominable lyar.
We looked indeed for hardſhips in the way, hard graplings with
enemies; but we did not look for ſuch things from him. We
thought he would have ſtood by us, and have helped us; we did
not think that he himſelf would have wounded us deeper then any
elſe could. We did not look for ſuch kind of things from thee, O
God, and we cannot but complain of them as hard uſage, nay in
no wiſe juſtifiable between God and his people, according to the
meaſure that we underſtood his Covenant and Promiſes by.</p>
                  <p>To give a particular inſtance of ſomewhat we have felt, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could expect or fear, <hi>Thou haſt made us to drink the wine of
aſtoniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtoniſhment</hi> is an amazedneſs of ſpirit: When one knows not
what to think, which way to look, nor what to do; then a perſon
is aſtoniſhed. <hi>Spiritual aſtoniſhment</hi> is when the Soul is aſtoniſhed
in and about <hi>ſpiritual things;</hi> when the Soul does not know what
to think of any thing that is ſpiritual. A ſpiritual man knows ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things: He knows the Father of Spirits, and the way of a
Spirits communion with his Father; the way of the Spirit of Lifes
going forth in his own Spirit: He knows <hi>God, Chriſt, Heaven,
Hell, Life, Death, Joy, Peace, &amp;c.</hi> Spiritual aſtoniſhment is the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115390:30"/>
amazement of the Spirit concerning theſe; when the Soul does not
know what to think of any ſpiritual thing, as of God or Chriſt,
Heaven or Hell, &amp;c. wonders whether there be any ſuch things or
no, wonders whether his knowledg (as he accounted it formerly)
of them was not a meer imagination: wonders at every creature
that he ſees, at every thing that he hears, what it is, what it means;
is in a condition that he is amazed how he came into it: finds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
miſery and torment attending him, but cannot tell which
way to ſtir for any relief; can neither tell how to ſtir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet how
to ſtand ſtill; cannot tell how to hope, or how to deſpair; would
fain move ſome way, but cannot; would fain ſtand ſtill ſome
where, but cannot; would fain know, or be quiet under its igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but can find no bottom to faſten either on. This is ſpiritual
aſtoniſhment, true aſtoniſhment, through aſtoniſhment. If the
Spirit could fix any where on any thing, it were not perfectly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
But when it knows nothing, can own nothing, can turn
from nothing, can turn towards nothing, can move no whither, nor
abide any where, it is confounded to purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That which produceth this aſtoniſhment is <hi>wine,</hi> drinking of
<hi>wine;</hi> it is a drunkenneſs with <hi>wine.</hi> A wiſe man can ſearch
through the cauſes of things, and is not eaſily aſtoniſhed: but if he
drink wine hard, it takes away his underſtanding from him. The
ſpiritual man is very wiſe, can ſearch into the cauſes of ſpiritual
things, and is not eaſily confounded at the variety of Gods ways till
he come to drink <hi>wine,</hi> and that ſtrips him of his underſtanding like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
There is a <hi>wine</hi> of aſtoniſhment, a <hi>wine</hi> that does naturally
produce this effect, as it was purpoſely made for this end. A <hi>wine</hi>
there is that God has made and prepared for the creature to drink,
which ſhall drink up all the excellency of the creature; which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
drinks throughly of, will quickly loſe not only all his natural
underſtanding, but all his ſpiritual underſtanding alſo. <hi>Pſal. 75. 8. In
the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of
mixture.</hi> Red wine, wine mixed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea throughly mixed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>full of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
ſure it is very intoxicating: very eaſily may he be brought
into a ſtate of aſtoniſhment who drinks ſuch kind of wine.</p>
                  <p>But how come they to drink this wine? <hi>Thou haſt made us to
drink.</hi> It was not their love to the wine, they had no mind to it,
they turned from it; but <hi>thou haſt made us to drink. He poureth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115390:30"/>
out of the ſame,</hi> Pſal. 75. 8. The dregs the wicked ſhall drink, but,
they muſt drink the top. They muſt begin to the world, they muſt
drink the firſt draught, and be purged of all their earth and filth firſt.
<hi>Judgment must begin at the houſe of God. Jeruſalem</hi> muſt begin
the Round to the reſt of the <hi>Nations.</hi> Though till they come to
taſte of it, they are apt to mock at the mention of it, <hi>(Iſai.</hi> 28. 22.)
thinking their nearneſs to God, and intereſt in God to be ſuch, that
they may laugh at deſtruction, as beholding the evil day far from
them, and they themſelves ſufficiently fenced againſt its overtaking
them: No, it muſt paſs over all. God holds the cup in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and if they will not drink, he will pour it down their throats; <hi>Thou
haſt made us to drink.</hi> Therefore <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſaid to drink it at
the hand of the Lord. <hi>Iſai. 51. 17. Awake, awake, ſtand
up, O Jeruſalem, which haſt drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup
of his fury; thou haſt drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling,

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Lord is pleaſed with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he has a cup of ſweet
wine, a cup of joy and delight to chear and refreſh the Spirits of
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But when the Lord is angry, he has <hi>a cup of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a cup of trembling, a cup of confuſion, of ſleep, of death;</hi> all
which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> taſtes in it, when ſhe drinks of it. And <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>

that holds a potion of phyſick in her hand, and will make her
child take it, though ſore againſt the childs mind. Yea ſome mothers
will make their children drink the very thick of the potion, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the cup: And poor <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt drink the very <hi>dregs</hi>
too, if God will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>O how ſweet is God in building up, how terrible in throwing
down! How pleaſant, how quickening is the cup of his love; how
dreadful, how deſtroying is the cup of his wrath! There is none can
ſo much as imagine the power of his wrath, that have not taſted
the power of his love. If Chriſt and his people had not felt and
known ſo much ſweetneſs in the Love and Life of God, they could
never have found ſo much bitterneſs in the cup of his indignation,
in that cup of death which he prepares to put an end to that kind of
life.</p>
                  <p>The people of God muſt loſe that very life that Chriſt loſt, by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115390:31"/>
that very cup: We muſt all taſte of his <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> O how ſweet
is that life in its ſeaſon, how pleaſant is it to thrive and grow in it!
<hi>Communion</hi> with God, The mutual opening of hearts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
The continual meeting every where in everything in one and
the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> is very raviſhing and tranſporting: But to have
this paſs away, or (if the the life of be too ſtrong ſo to do) to have
it killed by power, by a cup of <hi>deadly poyſon,</hi> is ſo ſharp and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the pangs of diſſolving the body are hardly worthy to be
a ſhadow of it. Yet if any have a deſire before-hand to conceive
what it is, ſuch as have taſted of the ſpiritual pleaſure of this kind of
life, may give ſome gueſs at it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>drink</hi> is the <hi>Wo</hi> God adminiſters to expel the former drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs
by: This <hi>wine,</hi> whoever is throughly made drunk with,

nothing of the greateſt danger, nothing of the greateſt good, but
all good paſſes by them, and every ſnare takes hold of them. Thus

forming them anew. I was not only deſtroying the old form, as men
thought, and they thought; but I was likewiſe introducing a new

                     <p>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
ſhall be unſtopped.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhall the lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the
dumb ſing: for in the Wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and
ſtreams in the Deſart.</p>
                     <p>And the parched ground ſhall become a pool, and the thirſty land
ſprings of water.</p>

field ſhall be counted for a Forreſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. 15. And there will
be great joy and ſinging among the blind, the deaf, the lame, and the
dumb, when they ſhall all be perfectly healed; when the barren
parched ground ſhal abound with that water which it thirſted after,
and grew ſo heartleſs and barren for want of.</p>

                     <p>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will alſo take of the higheſt branch of
the high Cedar, and will ſet it, I will crop off from the top of
his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high
Mountain and eminent.</p>
                     <p>In the Mountain of the height of Iſrael will I plant it: and it
ſhall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly Cedar,
and under it ſhall dwell all fowl of every wing: in the ſhadow
of the branches thereof ſhall they dwell.</p>
                     <p>And all the trees of the field ſhall know that I the Lord have
brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flouriſh: I
the Lord have ſpoken, and have done it.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Then ſaid I, When, when! <hi>O Lord God, how long! Thou haſt
a long time holden thy peace. Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O
Arm of the Lord.</hi> Uncloath thine Arm of fleſh, and cloath it with
ſtrength, if thou meaneſt to do theſe things. Sleep no longer under
the vail of fleſh, but rent it from the top to the bottom, and come
forth in thine own likeneſs; and ſo ſoon as we ſee this in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage,
we will ſing and ſhout, <hi>Hoſanna in the highest:</hi> Bleſſed
