            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceiued, but the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came into the tranſgreſsion he maketh her will ſubiect to the deſire of her husband, encreaſing her ſorrowes and her conceptions. Thus he chaſtiſeth them, but giueth them not ouer, but pronounceth to the woman a ſhort, but a pithy ſentence, <hi>That the ſeede of the woman ſhould breake the head of the Serpent.</hi> That is to ſay, I will cauſe one to be borne of the womans ſeede, which ſhall ſubdue the Deuill, and the Deuill ſhall doe his endeauour to trip vp his heeles by tempting him.</p>
               <p>In this beginneth a controuerſie againſt the Iewes of later times, who hold opinion, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> whome wee vphold to be the mediator between Gods iuſtice, and mans ſinne, ſhall be ſome great Emperor that ſhall deliuer them from bodily oppreſsion: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they cannot deny, but that by the death which God threatneth to <hi>Adam</hi> for his tranſgreſsion, <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> vnderſtandeth a ſpirituall death, that is to wit, the death of the ſoule wounded with ſinne, and forſaken of her life, which is God; and that by the venome of the Serpent, he meaneth ſinne it ſelfe, which ſhall ceaſe, ſaith he, vnder the <hi>Meſsias</hi>: And the <hi>Thargum</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſayth thus expreſly, So long (O Serpent) as the womans children keepe the law, they kill thee: and when they ceaſe to doe ſo, thou ſtingeſt them in the heele, and haſt power to hurt them much. But whereas for their harme, there is a ſure remedie to heale it; for thine there is none: for in the laſt dayes they ſhall cruſh thee all to peeces with their heeles, by means of <hi>Chriſt</hi> their King.</p>
               <p>The particulars wherof <hi>Adam</hi> neglected not to examine.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4087:12"/>
which receiue like comfort of the ſame promiſe. For ſhe rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that this ſeede muſt needs be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who muſt come and take <hi>Adams</hi> nature vppon him, who ſhould bee ſubiect to death, that hee might ouercome him that had power of death. For ſhee knew, and ſo did <hi>Adam,</hi> that if euer man, being but onely man, might work his owne redemption, himſelfe was likelyeſt to haue done it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was the chiefeſt of all the men that euer ſhould be in the world: but <hi>Adam</hi> being the goodlyeſt man, and not able to doe it himſelfe, he knew it muſt needs be God, who muſt appeare in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, and ſuffer death, that hee might riſe againe to ſit at the right hand of his Father to make interceſsion for all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi>: They both, the man and the woman embracing this, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the fauour of God, and <hi>Adam</hi> called his wife <hi>Euah,</hi> that is <hi>Life,</hi> to ſhew that whoſoeuer beleeued as ſhe beleeued, ſhould bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternall life, as it is written. <hi>Rom. 10.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah</hi> were driuen out of Paradiſe, &amp; Cherubins were ſet to keep the way of the tree of life, &amp; they were clothed with skins, as it ſhuld appeare, with skins of beaſts to ſhew their beaſtlines, which God for them had ſlaine to offer for ſacrifice, to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for no doubt, God would not deſtroy beaſts to haue them ſpoyled, ſeeing that <hi>Adam</hi> was not to eat any. And we ſee that <hi>Kaine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered ſacrifices, as being taught from <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe ſacrifices were of two ſorts. <hi>Abel</hi> offred, as appeareth in ſinceritie of Religion: the other for outward ceremonie, voide of true Religion, wherefore to <hi>Abel,</hi> and his offring God had reſpect: but to <hi>Kaine,</hi> and his offring he had no regard. Wherefore <hi>Kaine</hi> being poſſeſſed with the <hi>poyſon</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> enuied <hi>Abel</hi> becauſe his workes were good, and his owne euill, and killed him: and being asked of God, why he had ſlaine his brother? in ſtead of asking pardon of God, he ſayd, that his fault was greater, than that Gods mercie could forgiue it. Againſt whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cryeth vehemently, that by how much leſſe the mercie of God could be inferiour to the fault of <hi>Kaine,</hi> ſeeing that to forgiue is a thing proper to God; and to reuenge and puniſh, is farre eſtranged from his nature: by ſo much more great was the offence of <hi>Kaine</hi> in the words he ſayd, than in the murther he did, ſeeing that by the ſtroke of the ſword, hee tooke away but the life of his brother, but by the blaſphemie of his tongue, hee gaue death to his owne ſoule. To kill his brother, was euill done: but to deſpaire in Gods mercie, was euen a tranſgreſsion of the <hi>Deuill.</hi> For more doe we offend God to eſteeme him without mercie, than in any other ſinne we commit againſt man.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4087:13"/>
For which God curſeth him, giuing him a marke of a guiltie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alwayes, accuſing him of ſinne againſt God, and inhumanitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature: Whereupon he goeth vp and downe wandring as one finding no reſt or peace, like an excommunicate perſon, from the place of true religion into the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Fugitiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Kaine</hi> was the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom he named Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion: (for ſo doth <hi>Kaine</hi> ſignifie) as if he had gained a goodly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But ſeeing what might be the comfort of ſuch poſſeſsion, hee calleth his other ſonne <hi>Abell,</hi> that is, <hi>Vanitie,</hi> to ſhewe that if a man haue neuer ſo large kingdomes or poſſeſsions, or bee neuer ſo noblie borne, as <hi>Kaine</hi> was (except the ſonne of God) it is all but vanitie, and a vexation of mind. It is not now to be vnderſtood, that <hi>Adam</hi> had now no more children but <hi>Kaine</hi> and <hi>Abell:</hi> for doubtleſſe <hi>Adam</hi> had many more, as may appeare by <hi>Kaines</hi> ſtory. For it is ſayd, that <hi>Kaine</hi> departed into the land of <hi>Nod</hi> and knew his wife, who muſt needes be <hi>Adams</hi> daughter, and married before the murther: for we are not to thinke that <hi>Adam</hi> would afterward haue beſtowed his daughter vpon a reprobate. The Holy Ghoſt nameth onely three of <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes, <hi>Kaine, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> to make a proportionable number an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the number of the letters of the words of the holy tongue, or the tongue of <hi>Adam:</hi> for vpon three letters doth euery word in the tongue conſiſt.</p>

For this we ought to know and beleeue ſo aſſuredly, that we might ſhew our ſelues ſetled vpon a ſure foundation, not vpon ſands where ſea and wind may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow vs, but vpon the Rocke <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> That our building may remaine as the mount Sion, and as the heauenly Ieruſalem which is builded foure ſquare, of three foures of precious ſtones; that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we be toſſed with afflictions of this life, we may ſtand firme, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging <hi>Iehouah</hi> to be the one true and euerlaſting God, <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and that his mercy is like to eternall mountains that cannot be remoued, wherewith hee loued vs vnto ſaluation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world.

And as the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> being anſwerable to the fall of the leafe, becauſe by his fall death was brought vpon all: So the death of Chriſt, beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Adams</hi> fall, becauſe it brought life to all, the fitteſt time to reſemble this life in the courſe of nature, was the ſpring: therefore Chriſt dyed at the ſpring, to deliuer vs out of the ſpirituall priſon, when as all thinges ſhewe themſelues to bee deliuered out of this earthly priſon.</p>

               <head>Now for the day of <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</head>
               <p>IT was on fryday, the ſixt day, the day of <hi>Adams</hi> creation at the time of eating. For wee doe not reade that euer <hi>Adam</hi> did eate before he did eate of the forbidden fruit. Therefore when by the ſtorie the time of eating cannot be ſeparated in time, reaſon ſheweth vs to ioyne them in time: for <hi>Satan</hi> was a <hi>Murtherer</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and we muſt bring it from the beginning as neere as can be, not croſsing any Scripture. The ſearching of this matter is not of ſmall importance: for from the true vnderſtanding of the creation we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4087:15"/>
ſee the cleereneſſe of the Redemption, and not marking the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, is the cauſe of much follie: and they that miſſe of the lawes of creation, are ſure to miſſe of the lawes of Redemption. And <hi>Moſes</hi> making mention of many times, hee would not haue omitted the time of the fall, except it had beene done preſently after the creation: thetefore <hi>Adams</hi> fall muſt needes bee layd as neere the beginning as may bee, not croſsing the ſtory. The bare narration ſheweth, that no famous action went betweene the commaundement, and the fall: and the ſhortneſſe of the time doth ſhewe the force of the aduerſarie. Beſides, it is a great ſinne to ſay, that euery man, except Chriſt, could fulfill any one point of the Lawe: for thereby wee darken the glory of Chriſt, and prooue him not to haue performed the whole lawe. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued vntill the Sabbath in his innocencie, no doubt he would haue kept a perfect Sabbath: and if hee had kept a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sabbath, hee had performed ſome part of the Lawe, and thereby beene partaker with Chriſt in the worke of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Againe, if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in the image of God, which is in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, vntill the Sabbath, hee would haue performed the ordinances of the Sabbath, which was to eate of the tree of life which was made for a Sacrament of conſeruation vnto him, and ſhould not haue needed a Redeemer. Hee did not eate of the Tree of Life: for God after his fall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Cherubims to keepe the way of the Tree of Life, leaſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> eating ſhould liue for euer. Whereby it appeareth, that if hee had eaten thereof before, hee had not fallen. Therefore it cannot be that <hi>Adam</hi> continued perfect vnto the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And further it is written, <hi>Pſal. 49. Adam</hi> being in honour continueth not one night, but is like to the beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cedrenus</hi> a Greeke writer ſaith, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell the ſixt day of the firſt weeke.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the woman ſtreight way after her creation before ſhe accompained with <hi>Adam,</hi> became into the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: otherwiſe <hi>Kaine</hi> had beene conceaued without ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophilact</hi> vpon <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, that as man was formed the ſixt day, and did eate of the tree the ſixt howre: ſo Chriſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming man and healing the fall, was faſtened to the tree the ſixt day, and the ſixt howre. And in the ſtorie of the creation in <hi>Geneſis</hi> preſently after the fall, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of the Redemption. And without wee compare the Creation with the Redemption, wee miſſe of all. For <hi>Adam</hi> to bee compared with Chriſt, is the ſumme
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4087:15"/>
of all. And wherefore ſhould all the actions of the Redemption bee accompliſhed in ſuch rareneſſe, except to bee aunſwerable both to the fall, and to the time of the fall? Wherefore it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wee ſhould know our thraldome, if wee will receaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by the Redeemer, thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt the Reſtorer was borne of a Virgine. <hi>Why?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by a Virgine deſtruction came to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> compareth <hi>Eue</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> together thus: <hi>Eue</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Virgine, hearing the wordes of the SERPENT, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing them, brought foorth DEATH. The Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wordes of the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and beleeuing them, brought foorth Life. Againe, why ſhould Chriſt die on the ſixt day, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than on the fifth or fourth? And why was there darkeneſſe vntill the coole of the day, rather than till the Sunne ſetting? but to make the Redemption anſwerable to euery part of the fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God according to the ſecret counſell of his owne will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the earth were laide, would make the Art of ſaluation ſo eaſie, and the harmonie of the Bible ſo tuneable, that no muſicke in the world can bee more pleaſant to the eare, than the meditation of the loue of God towards vs in Chriſt, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the heart of man. Therefore the meditation of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the victorie of Chriſt, ought to bee continually in our mindes.</p>

                  <hi>113. Henoch</hi> is taken vp. being 365. yeres old.</p>
               <p>HIs yeres are anſwerable to the dayes of the ſunne: 65. yeres, a yere for a day. And as the ſunne excelleth all other ſtarres in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo did his life excell all other men then aliue in the world, for vertue. He is alſo ſayd to haue walked with God, to be a preacher of righteouſneſſe, to bee taken vp.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure ſpeciall commendations are of equall glory: and wee may be aſſured by theſe teſtimonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his godlineſſe was very rare. The Grecians ſay, that hee left a booke behind him of his preaching. But thereby (as much as in them lyeth) they call into queſtion the truth of the Scriptures. For firſt, by this opinion they derogate from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſhould not be the firſt writer. Secondly, from the wiſedome of God, which tooke order to lay downe the liues of the fathers in ſo ſhort Arithmatique, and would thereby haue his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wonderfull to thoſe which ſhould come after: which had bene to ſmall purpoſe, if <hi>Henoch</hi> had left a booke of his preaching. But the Grecians thus being anſwered, it followeth that <hi>Henochs</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was againſt the wordes of the wicked, and againſt the contempt of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wicked men ſhewed in not beleeuing the preaching of the flood. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epiſtle, from the circumſtances of the men and manners of the people to whom <hi>Henoch</hi> preached gathered what might be the ſumme of <hi>Henochs</hi> preaching, in this ſort: <hi>Behold, the Lord commeth,</hi> how? as at the giuing of the law, <hi>with thouſands of his Angels, to give iudgement againſt all men, &amp; to rebuke all the vngodly among them of all their wicked deeds which they haue vngodly committed, and of all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4087:22"/>
their cruell ſpeakings which wicked ſinners haue ſpoken againſt him.</hi> Vpon which words the Grecians, not knowing the courſe of the Hebrewes, in their fained ſpeeches ſay, that <hi>Henoch</hi> left a booke of his preaching behind him.</p>
               <p>His taking vp, did ſhew what ſhould be the ſtate of the godly. Hee was taken vp in deſpite of the wicked, and in recompence of his own faith. Hee was taken vp 57. yeeres after <hi>Adams</hi> death, all the fathers then being aliue. And it may be the fathers did ſee him taken vp, as a figure of Chriſts aſcenſion. The wicked might then ſay, where is the appearance of the flood? For <hi>Adam</hi> is dead, and <hi>Henoch</hi> is taken vp, and all things continue as from the beginning. In that God beſtowed ſo ſhort life vpon <hi>Henoch,</hi> it ſheweth that hee would beſtow greater bleſsings of him in another kind.</p>

               <p>WHerein <hi>Noah</hi> made the Arke: for ſo long was he in making it, not becauſe he could not haue made it ſooner (for God could haue commanded it to be made with a word aſwell as he made all the world) but to ſhew the patience and long ſuffering of God in ſparing his iudgements, that they who would not heare the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> might iuſtly be condemned.</p>
               <p>Many things fall out in the Bible, whoſe numbers are anſwerable to this of 120.</p>
               <p>120. Nations paid tribute to bring the Iewes home from captiuity.</p>
               <p>The gouernement of the Perſians was about 120. yeeres.</p>
               <p>120. Seuerall nations, that is, ſome of euery Nation, were at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem after Chriſts reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The Hebrewes deſcant very ſtrangely with the letters of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and the 120. yeeres wherein the Arke was in making, thus: Multiplie <hi>120.</hi> by the letter ה which is 5. then you haue 600. Multiplie 600. which is <hi>Noahs</hi> age at the flood, with the letter י which is <hi>10.</hi> then you haue 6000, The end of the world. This is the conſent of all the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>Here is a doubt to be diſcuſſed, concerning the wordes ſpoken in <hi>Gen. 6.</hi> The occaſion of the doubt ariſeth thus: God ſaith in Gen. 6. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtriue with man: his daies ſhalbe 120. yeares.</hi> In <hi>Ge. 5. Noahs</hi> age is reckoned, and he is then ſaid to be 500. yeares old, and begetteth <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Iapheth.</hi> when his age is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe at the floude, the ſumme is but 600. ſo that if the 6 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be in time after the fift, and in the fift <hi>Noah</hi> is 500. yeares old, and that afterwardes God ſaith, the daies of all fleſh ſhalbee 120. yeares; then <hi>Noah</hi> at the floude muſt be 620. yeares: for put 120. to 500. and you haue 620 but his age at the floude is but 600. Therefore ſome thinke, that either the Chronicle is falſe, or els the <hi>20.</hi> yeares were ſhortned like as it ſhall bee in the ende of the world, leaſt els no fleſh ſhould be ſaued.</p>
               <p>To anſwere this doubt, we muſt obſerue that it is no reaſon in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, that becauſe a matter commeth or is made mention of in a Chapter afterwards that the time therfore of that ſtorie or action fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Chapters or Actions going before: For this is but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of method. For <hi>Moſes</hi> in penning the Scriptures vſeth this order: he layeth down things of like nature together, as Genealogies together, and ſuch like, though they differ in time, becauſe elſe hee ſhould make often repetitions of the ſame things. The obſeruation

of this, cauſed the Hebrewes to ſet downe this rule, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſtory, doth not regard the cricumſtance of firſt and latter. To wit, he doth not ſet downe, that in the firſt place which is firſt in time, &amp; ſo, that which is later in time afterwards: but ſometimes that which is later, in the firſt place, and that which is firſt in time, in the laſt, as the neceſſity of the narration giueth occaſion. This being thus made plaine, the doubt is eaſily diſcuſſed, for neither is <hi>Noah</hi> 620. yeares olde at the floude, neither are the yeares of the floude any thing ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the Chronicle is altogether true. For if wee referre the 120. yeares of the floude 20. yeares before that Chapter, in which it was ſayd, <hi>Noah</hi> was 500. yeares old and begot. <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> then do we make all things agree without croſſing one another. And this of neceſſetie we muſt needs doe: for ſeing God hath layd downe the Generals in proper and plaine termes, we muſt ſo caſt the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that they may make the generall true, and no way alter it. Beſides, we haue a like example, for though all the liues &amp; deaths of the fathers before the floud, are reckoned and ſummed vp together in one chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we muſt not thinke that all their liues are precedent to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters following: for the Chronicle ſheweth that <hi>Lamech</hi> liued fiue yeares before the floud; and <hi>Methuſhelahs</hi> death, and the beginning of the floud are very neere. Euen ſo here, this ſentence of the 120. years is to be counted before the fift chapter, wherein <hi>Noahs</hi> age is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; for the ſhortning of the daies at the end of the world, the holy Ghoſt ſaith it ſhalbe ſo. But for the ſhortning of the daies at the floud, we haue no ſuch warrant in <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therfore we are not to beleiue it.</p>

and with humilitie ſearch it, auoiding curioſitie, they neede not trouble themſelues with the errors of the Fathers. The words of the text, <hi>1.

For a thouſand ſhall fall at their right hand, &amp; ten thouſand at their left hand, but they ſhall not be touched. With their eyes ſhall they ſee the reward of the vngodly: for the Lord is their hope, and he hath ſet his houſe of defence very high. With long life will he ſatisfie them, and through his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe will he ſhew them his ſaluation.</hi> Let euery one therefore ſay, <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſaluation, whom then ſhall I feare? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, whereof then ſhould I be afraid? for in the time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his Tabernacle, and ſet me vp vpon a Rocke of Stone.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4087:27"/>
of Chriſt ſpake in all the Prophets.</hi> His calling was very glorious, being made a preacher to declare ſaluation to all which would beleeue in Chriſt. How he was receiued, it is manifeſt, ſeing he preuailed with a very few: yet the word of God is not in vaine: for ſeeing they refuſed the mercie of God offered in Chriſt, it is certaine <hi>Noah</hi> would preach the iudgements of God the other part of the Goſpell, which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines call excommunication. The Hebrewes, <hi>The Lord commeth.</hi> The Hebrewes, and with them the Greeke Orators do vſe to faine <hi>Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popeia,</hi> which is a conference or communication, when they meane to expreſſe things more at full. So wee may imagine <hi>Tubalkaine</hi> to ſay, Surely <hi>Noah</hi> is an honeſt man, and payeth well for his worke, and hee hath with very great charge kept a great ſort of labourers theſe ſixe-ſcore yeeres. What ſhould he meane by this? Surely, anſwereth <hi>Iubal,</hi> I will tell you ſtrange things. Seuen of my beſt Rammes, and ſeuen of my beſt Ewes ran from my flocke right foorth to the Arke, and there they went in. And another ſtanding by, replieth, I am ſure I can tell (ſaith he) as great a meruaile as this: for comming by a wood, I ſawe a fearefull Lyon, and a fierce Lyoneſſe, and they went as gently by me as two Lambes, not offering to do me any hurt, and came to the Arke, and there were plankes ſet, and they went in. Yea (ſaith another) I ſaw a huge Beare doe the like: and ſo they might ſpeake of the reſt of the beaſts. This might driue them to an amaſedneſſe, but this could not ſaue them. And hereby it is apparant, that it is not in our power to repent when we liſt. For this is not repentance, to be ſory for our ſins: (There is no man ſo wicked but hath done ſo) There muſt alſo be a turning to God, which is neuer, except we be lightned by his ſpirit. The Lord vſeth firſt to offer mercy, which if it be contemned, he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our hearts, that thereby we may be made more fit for his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

For hee writeth, that the Flood began the Seuenteenth day of the Second moneth, and that the waters preuailed One Hundred and Fiftie dayes, and that the next day after One Hundred and Fiftie, was the Seuenteenth day of the Seuenth moneth. Six and Fortie dayes had paſſed before the Floud: for the Seuen and Fortie day (I meane the Seuenteenth day of the Second moneth) the Floud began. Ioyne One Hundred and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Six and Fortie, they make plainely One hundred, Nintie, and Sixe dayes, which diuided by Thirtie, leaue Sixe exact moneths, and the Seuenteene dayes of the Seuenth Moneth, in which <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth that the Arke reſted. Hereby it is moſt euident, that in ancient time they had Thirtie dayes to a Moneth. Moreouer a moderate expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall finde Three hundred, ſixtie and fiue dayes in the yeare of the floud, Thus: The firſt day of the Tenth Moneth, Two hundred, Seuentie and One dayes from the beginning of the yeare, the tops of the Mountaines were diſcouered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

His houſe neuer got any victorie, but for ſome eſpeciall puniſhment to bee ſhewed vpon <hi>Sems</hi> houſe. <hi>Cham</hi> had a curſe in this world, and doubtleſſe in the world to come.</p>
               <p>He had foure Sonnes, the firſt <hi>Cuſh,</hi> of whome came the Ethiopians, or in our tongue, <hi>Burnt faces</hi>: the ſecond <hi>Mitzraijm,</hi> of whome the

Egyptians come, for <hi>Mitzraijm</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Egypt.</hi> The third <hi>Put,</hi> of whome the Lybians and Blackamores come: and the fourth <hi>Canaan,</hi> of whome the Cananites come, in whome the curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, notwithſtanding it falleth out alſo in all his other Sonnes. And as <hi>Canaan</hi> was a ſlaue of ſlaues; ſo are they that are of the like infidelitie: ſo that oftentimes for the horrible impietie of one man, the whole Nation fareth the worſe.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Canaan</hi> had eleuen Sonnes, and himſelfe made the twelfe, and his Countrey was called <hi>Canaan,</hi> which once was Paradiſe. And as Paradiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> reſembled the ſtate of heauen: ſo did the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Iſraelites, and the Iewes; for it was a land abounding with all good things. In Paradiſe was the tree of life: In <hi>Canaan</hi> Chriſt was borne, the true Tree of life. <hi>Adam</hi> neglecting the true ſeruice of God in Paradiſe, was driuen from thence. The Iewes neglecting their Sabbaths, and finally, the knowledge of Chriſt, were likewiſe driuen out of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But, as notwithſtanding <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſaluation in Paradiſe was promiſed to all the world: ſo, notwithſtanding the ſin of the Iewes, Chriſt in <hi>Canaan</hi> wrought the full ſaluation of all the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe eleuen Sonnes of <hi>Canaan</hi> were ſetled in one ſoyle, that is, in <hi>Canaan</hi> (which is about One Hundred and Sixtie miles from North to South, and Sixtie miles from Eeaſt to Weſt. Their names are <hi>Zidon,</hi> who built <hi>Tyrus</hi> the glorie of the world for traffique of Marchandize. <hi>Heth Gebuſi,</hi> who after <hi>Sems</hi> death (as it ſhould appeare) poſſeſſed Ieruſalem: <hi>Amori Girgaſhi,</hi> of whome there were ſome left till Chriſts time, as <hi>Mat. 8.28.

               <p>Hereby we are taught that the world is not the end to which wee were created, but that the glory of God is the end or marke that wee ought to leuell at. For if we conſider Man and the World, in man the ſences, and in the world the ſenſible things. Man as the beholder, the world as the Theatre. Man as the gueſt, in the world the Feaſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all things conuenient for him: wee will preſently ſay, not only that they be made one for another, but alſo that in very deed the world was made for man and not man for the world. And againe, if wee conſider how the world affordeth content of pleaſures to all the ſences, but nothing ſufficient to content the minde, ſhall wee not conclude, that as the pompe of this pilgrimage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee mans end, ſo can it not alſo bee his full contentation? but man by a peculiar priuiledge hath an Vnderſtanding wit, which was giuen vnto him, and Will, which he receiued franke and free: the one to knowe and diſcerne the leuell of his ende, the other, to loue and embrace it. Seeing then the hither ende of all creatures heere beneath is Man, and the furtheſt end of them is God: the neereſt and immediate end of man is to know God in the death merits of his Sonne Chriſt, and them to embrace as the ſoueraigne welfare and comfort of our ſoules, when from this hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of earth our ſoules muſt goe to God that gaue it. And what gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it a man to get all the kingdomes in the world by humane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and want grace to ayme the end of our pilgrimage at heauen? For what elſe is the getting of this world, but a proofe of want and pouertie? And what are honour, vaine titles, and Imperiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but a ſtampe of the diuels nature? Therefore, as the end of the firſt man when he was in his perfect holines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to attaine vnto God, ſo the end of vs, who by regeneration are partakers of that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, muſt tend wholly to the mortifying of our worldly affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accounting of theſe tranſitory momentaries, as though they were not. And to be ſhort, like as the ſoule is the ſhape of man, ſo is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4087:32"/>
of God the true ſhape of mans vnderſtanding: and what deſire we but the things that are? and what can he want, which poſſeſſeth him, in whom all things are? Then let vs ſay, that as it had beene a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie caſe for <hi>Adam</hi> to haue continued ſtill in his firſt eſtate: ſo is it now for vs to returne thither againe: that is, to be ſet againe in Gods fauor, that we may one day ſee his face yet againe. And becauſe this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable bleſſedneſſe cannot be brought to perfection in this life ſo full of miſerie, we muſt ſo diſpoſe our life in this world, not to liue ſtill in the world, but to die in reſpect of theſe dead things, and to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, if we intend to liue the true and euerlaſting life: for our true reſting point, is the turning againe vnto God, from whoſe fauour and fellowſhip we be departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man</hi> is compoſed of bodie and ſoule, the body mortall, the ſoule immortall: now if we ſet mans felicitie in his bodie onely, we doe too great wrong both to the ſoule and to the whole man. For if it conſiſt in the bodie, it periſheth and fadeth with the body: and then what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to the ſoule which ouerliueth, but wretchedneſſe? but wee looke for a felicitie which belongeth to the whole man. In the ſoule ioyned with the body, we haue three abilities, <hi>Life, Sence, Vnderſtanding.</hi> The ſoule giueth life vnto the body: and the perfection of life, is health. If our life then ſerue to no other end, than the outward things of this pilgrimage; what had the firſt man to do with any of them, who was created perfect, enioying the benefit of the whole world? and if theſe things muſt be the end of vs now after our corruption, what is more vnhappy, than man? &amp; what is more vncapable of happines, than man? A body ſubiect to infinite diſeaſes: weake, fraile, fraught with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries within, wrapped in them without, alwayes vncertaine of life, euermore ſure of death, whom a worme, an herbe, a graine of duſt may kill, who if hee looked for no other happineſſe than this, were much better to be a plant, than a man. And what man is he, that feeleth not a law in himſelfe, that goes about to bridle him, which feeleth not a guiltie and accuſing conſcience in the midſt of his pleaſure? or whoſe greateſt delights leaue him not a ſting of repentance behind them? And what happineſſe can that be, whereof we bee aſhamed? Now then, ſeeing that we haue a double life, the one in this world, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another; the one dying, the other immortall: the firſt which is here, tending to the ſecond, as the worſe to the better: our ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king muſt not bee for ſuch an end, or ſuch a felicitie as dieth with vs, but for ſuch a one as maketh vs happie, quickneth vs and refreſheth vs eternally, which ſurely is not to be found in mortall things. Where is this happineſſe then to be found? In wiſedome, in religion, and in knowledge, which are not attained vnto by reaſon, but by faith. For
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4087:33"/>
beliefe mounteth higher than our vnderſtanding. And a certaine Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian proceeded ſo farre, as to ſay, that the root whereby the felicitie to come is contained vnto, is faith, and what is this faith in God, but a belieuing that our eternall happineſſe liueth in him? And what is the belieuing, but a hoping for it? And what is hope, but the deſiring of it? And what is the deſire of it, but the hauing of it? And what is the continuers beliefe of it here, but a bewraying that here we cannot enioy it? And if we haue not faith, what haue wee but ignorance? And if wee haue faith, what haue wee but a deſire and longing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the greater our faith is, the more we deſpiſe the baſe things of this world? And the greater our deſire is, the more we hate our ſelues, and the more earneſtly do we loue God. And to be ſhort, what is bleſſedneſſe afore appointed: but we would ſee it? The way vnto felicitie, but we would enioy it? Looke then what proportion is betweene that which is preſent, and that which is to come; ſuch proportion is there betwixt the hope we haue here, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that good which we hope to attaine vnto. It followeth then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world was made for man, man for the ſoule, the ſoule for the mind, the mind for God: that all our doings can haue no end to reſt vpon here but onely in the life to come, which is the beholding &amp; true knowing of God. For who is he that would depart with any peece of his owne liking in this life, but in hope of better things? And what were it for him to looſe his life, if there were not a life more happie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this? The taking vp of that godly man <hi>Henoch</hi> out of this life, was to no other end, but to ſet him in another life void of all euill. And when we read the turmoiles of <hi>Noah,</hi> the ouerwhartings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the perſecution of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the baniſhment and wayfaring of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of <hi>Ioſeph, Moſes,</hi> and the reſidue of the fathers; they all ſhewe vnto vs, that they ſurely looked for a better life after this, and that there is a iudgement to come. For had they looked for no other comfort after this life, the fleſh would haue perſwaded them to haue held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in quiet here. <hi>Noah</hi> among his friends, <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Diſcharge thy ſelfe (ſaith he) of this body, which thou beareſt about thee: for it is but a cloake of ignorance, a foundation of infection, a place of corruption, a liuing

death, a ſenſible carion, a portable graue, and a houſhold theefe: it flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth thee becauſe it hateth thee, &amp; it hateth thee becauſe it enuieth thee: as long as that liueth, it bereaueth thee of life, and thou haſt not a greater enemy than that. Now to what end were it for him to forſake this light, this dwelling place, &amp; this life, if it were not for a better in an other world? therfore <hi>Chalcidius</hi> ſaith, I go home again into mine own cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, where my better forefathers &amp; kinsfolks be. And a wiſe man of the <hi>Chaldeys</hi> exhorteth men, with ſpeed to returne vnto their heauenly father, &amp; to ſeeke Paradiſe as the peculiar dwelling place of the ſoule. This is confirmed in the Goſpel, when Chriſt promiſeth the theefe that day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe. And of <hi>Epicharin,</hi> we haue this ſaying, If thou beeſt a good man in thy heart, death can doe thee no harme: for thy ſoule ſhall liue happily in heauen. And <hi>Plato</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſoule to returne home to her kinred, and to her firſt originall, that is, ſaith he, to the wiſe and immortall godhead the fountaine of all goodneſſe, as called home from baniſhment into our owne natiue countrey.</p>

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaking of the Lady <hi>Martiares</hi> ſonne being dead, ſaith, he is now euerlaſting and in the beſt ſtate, bereft of this earthly bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage which was none of his, and ſet free to himſelfe: for theſe bones, theſe ſinewes, this coat of skinne, this face, and theſe ſeruiceable hands, are but fetters and priſons of the ſoule. By them the ſoule is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, beaten downe, and chaſed away. It hath not a greater bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell than with that maſſe of fleſh: for feare of being torne in pieces, it laboureth to returne from whence it came, where it hath ready for it an happie and euerlaſting reſt.</p>
               <p>We read of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> that they ſorrowed at the birth of their children, and reioyced at the death of them, becauſe they thought that which we call death, not to be a death, but rather a very happie birth. Therefore <hi>Herodotus</hi> calleth theſe people the neuer dying <hi>Getes,</hi> and the Greekes the neuer dying <hi>Thracians.</hi> For they were of opinion, that at their departure out of this world, they went to <hi>Zamolxis</hi> or <hi>Gabeleize,</hi> that is, to him that gaue them health, ſaluation, or welfare. <hi>Herocles</hi> ſaith, that the wicked would not haue their ſoules to be immortall, to the intent they might not be puniſhed for their faultes, but yet that they preuent the ſentence of their Iudge by condemning themſelues vnto death aforehand.

a man for rare bleſsings to be compared with <hi>Henoch,</hi> and is the ſame in force, that <hi>Henoch</hi> is, although you would thinke them cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and ſo they are in ſignification, but in effect of diuinitie all one. For <hi>Henoch</hi> ſignifieth Dedicated to God, and <hi>Heber</hi> Pilgrime or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and he that is a ſtranger vpon earth, deſpiſing the ſtate of worldly pompe, is a Citizen with God: therefore whoſoeuer will be a true <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> muſt alſo be a true <hi>Heber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we will be holy before God, and acceptable veſſels for the vſe of his Temple, we muſt beare palme boughes in our hands, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the higheſt, and be eſtraunged from the vaine conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this earthly Paradiſe: ſo ſhall our names continue famous through many generations as <hi>Hebers</hi> did, &amp; we ſhall ſpeake the praiſes of God in our owne tongue: for we will not conſent with <hi>Nimrod</hi> to the building of our owne confuſion, whereby we might be ſhaken of from the fauour of God, as he and his adherents were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hebers</hi> glory is further enlarged in that the Hebrew tongue taketh the name from him. The Iewes kept this ſincerely till they went into captiuitie into Babylon: but when they came from thence, they began to ſtammer; for there they learned the tongue of the Babilonians. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie</hi> endeth the old Teſtament and the Hebrew tongue: for though ſchollers write Hebrew, yet vpon the firſt ſight it is apparant to be the writing of man, ſo far it diffreth from the ſtile of the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>There be one thouſand, ſeuen hundreth, fifty and eight roots in the Hebrew tongue. And this is a wonderfull thing, that the bare actions of the creatures ſhould expreſſe Hebrew words: as a horſe running vpon a cauſey, the ſound of his feet is much expreſsing this noyſe, <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat,</hi> which in Hebrew is to run. The noyſe which birdes make by clapping their wings when they flie, is of this ſound, Gnoth, which in Hebrew ſignifieth a fowle. The Grecians cannot find out the rootes of their tongue. The Lord tooke ſuch order in penning of the olde Teſtament, that one skilfull in the Hebrew tongue, will eaſily know if there be a ſentence, or a word put in; nay, if there be but a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſo that they are very vnwiſe that perſwade others, or beleeue themſelues, that the bookes of <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Tobie</hi> are Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For they are not Hebrew, neither were they receiued at any time by the auncient Hebrewes, who were ſo perfect and ready in the text of the olde Teſtament, that they could tell how many times the letter Alpha was vſed in the Bible: ſo that to beleeue theſe bookes to be Scripture, is to croſſe the teſtimonie of the Iewes for their owne ſtory, and if they knew our opinions herein, they would condemne vs for miſsing of Religion.</p>

manifeſt, in that none which liued after him, came to his dayes.

               <p>He had alſo great cauſe of ſorrow and heauineſſe, in that thirteene families of <hi>Iocktains</hi> ſonnes to whom <hi>Heber</hi> was Grandfather, went quite away, and were farre from Ieruſalem, and being out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, were bereaued of ſaluation; So that <hi>Chams</hi> houſe might ſeeme to haue greater bleſsings.

But they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4087:37"/>
marke not, that <hi>Terahs</hi> Sonnes are reckoned, not according to their age, but according to their dignitie, as <hi>Gen. 5.</hi> The Sonnes of <hi>Noah, Sem, Cham, Iaphet</hi> are ſo rehearſed, that in the firſt place there is mention made of <hi>Sem,</hi> who for all that was not the firſt borne, neither could be borne in the Fiue hundreth yeare of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſith two yeares after the flood in which yeare hee begat <hi>Arphachſad,</hi> hee was but an Hundreth yeares old. Now the firſt of this opinion whome I follow, was <hi>Caluine</hi> that moſt famous Doctor of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> who in his Commentaries vpon <hi>Gen. 11.27.</hi> expreſſeth it in plaine words. Him followed <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> who did much in the illuſtrating of time, and <hi>Mangoldus.</hi> This demonſtration is ſet downe, <hi>Act. 7. Abraham</hi> is ſayd to goe out of <hi>Haran</hi> after his Father <hi>Terah</hi> died. Now <hi>Terah</hi> liued Two hundred and fiue yeares. And <hi>Abram</hi> went out of <hi>Haran</hi> in the Seuentie and fiue yeare of his age: which yeeres if you ſubtract from <hi>Terahs</hi> age, there remaines One hundred and thirtie yeares, in which <hi>Abrams</hi> natiuitie falleth. The ſame may be confirmed by <hi>Sarahs</hi> age <hi>Abrams</hi> wife, who is thought to be the Daughter of <hi>Abrams</hi> Brother. <hi>Abram</hi> exceeded her no more but Ten yeeres: wherevpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that hee was borne long after him that was both his brother, and father in law. <hi>Abram</hi> therefore was called, and began his peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Two thouſand, Eightie, and fourth yeare of the world, the verie ſame day that his poſteritie went out of Egypt, namely, the Fifteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> as it is ſayd in <hi>Exod. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ioynct of this firſt time, which containeth the diuine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> endeth in the yeare when the law was giuen, in which the Iſraelites by the goodneſſe of God were brought forth, and deliuered out of Egypt by many and ſtrange miracles. This contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth foure Hundred and Thirtie yeres, which is confirmed by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who expreſly ſayth, <hi>Gal. 3.17.</hi> That the Law began foure Hundred and Thirtie yeares after the confirming of the couenant or teſtament. And concerning the confirmation of which couenant he ſpeaketh, he expreſſeth in that which went before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of that ſame which was made, when being called of God, he went out of <hi>Haran.</hi> For in <hi>verſ. 8.</hi> he cyteth the ſame promiſe, <hi>In thee ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſsed,</hi> which <hi>Gen. 12.</hi> is rehearſed in the narration of his calling, <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> Hetherto alſo it appertaineth, which is written <hi>Exod. 12. Verſ. 40. The peregrination of the children of Iſrael,</hi> (as learnedly and truely tranſlateth that worthy man <hi>Beroaldus) which they dwelt in Egypt, was Foure Hundred and Thirtie yeares:</hi> Which ſurely the Seuentie Interpreters ſo tranſlate, that they account the peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Fathers made in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in this dwelling.</p>
               <p>Neither doth the place of <hi>Gen. 15. Verſ. 13.</hi> concerning the ſeed

of <hi>Abram</hi> to be aflicted foure Hundred yeares, hinder it. For <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> peregrination is to be deriued from his calling, and his ſeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be afflicted when <hi>Iſaack</hi> the Sonne of promiſe borne fiue and twentie yeares after his calling, being a childe peraduenture of fiue yeares old, ſuffered the ſcoffings of <hi>Iſmael</hi> borne of the hand mayd: which ſurely the Apoſtle <hi>Gal. 4.29.</hi> expreſſely nameth perſecution. Adde hereunto the reſt which <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſuffered amonge ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Now that time wherein the Iſraelites abode in Egipt, that it is farre wide of foure Hundred yeeres, is cleerer than the light at noone day, to them which conſider that <hi>Kaath</hi> the Son of <hi>Leui</hi> went downe into Egipt, and liued One Hundred, Thirtie and Three yeares, and that his Son <hi>Amram</hi> liued one hundred, thirtie and ſeuen yeres, <hi>Exod. 6.</hi> and that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Sonne was Eightie yeares old when he went out of Egipt. All which make but Three hundred and Fiftie yeares, and if from theſe, thoſe yeares bee ſubduced, which they liued after their Sonnes were borne, the yeares remayning would be few. But theſe things Doctor <hi>Berwildus,</hi> and others haue learnedly ſet forth. Thoſe notable men, <hi>Bullinger, Phlinſpachius, Scaanger,</hi> and others agree vnto it.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd, that <hi>Terah</hi> being Seuentie yeares old begetteth <hi>Abram, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and <hi>Nachor.</hi> The Iewes ſay, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was the eldeſt: but thereby they bring notable abſurdities: for they agree that <hi>Sara</hi> was <hi>Harans</hi> Daughter; ſhe is but Ten yeres yonger than <hi>Abram,</hi> and then <hi>Abram</hi> being elder than <hi>Haran,</hi> and yet married his daughter but Ten yeares younger than her husband. <hi>Haran</hi> muſt needes beget her at Nine yeares of age, which is impoſsible. Therefore it is certaine, that <hi>Nachor</hi> and <hi>Haran</hi> were elder than <hi>Abram.</hi> For if wee looke to <hi>Gen. 12.</hi> and conſider that <hi>Abram</hi> being Seuentie and fiue yeares old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the promiſe, and to Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Oration, <hi>Act 7.</hi> by which it appeareth that <hi>Terah</hi> was dead before <hi>Abram</hi> had the promiſe, or elſe the promiſe might haue had a reference to <hi>Terah,</hi> as well as to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,</hi> we ſhall by good Arithmeticke, caſt <hi>Terah</hi> at the birth of <hi>Abram</hi> to be One hundred and thirtie yeares old: for take Seuentie and fiue yeres out of two hundred and fiue, which is the time that <hi>Terah</hi> liued, and there remaineth One hundred and thirtie, the age of <hi>Terah</hi> when he begat <hi>Abram.</hi> To enlarge this further.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Abram</hi> had beene the eldeſt, <hi>Sem</hi> would not haue giuen him the bleſsing: for then hee ſhould haue died before <hi>Sem,</hi> and men doe not giue their inheritance to their Sonnes which die in their life, but hee would rather haue kept it for <hi>Iſaack,</hi> with whom he liued Fiftie yeres. This may be made plaine by another of the ſame ſort. <hi>Rebecca</hi> being with child, and they both ſtriuing in her womb, asketh counſell what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4087:38"/>
ſhould become of her. The queſtion is of whom? <hi>Sem</hi> being dead, it is manifeſt, either of <hi>Heber,</hi> or of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thus you may ſee, that without the knowledge of the times, wee could not auoid theſe errors.</p>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was politique: for he had Three hundred and Eighteen ſouldiers of his owne familie, which he himſelfe had inſtructed. And thereby we may gather, that hee vſed recreation, and in curioſitie did not contemne it: for otherwiſe hee could not haue made his men ſo expert Warriours. And ſurely there is nothing diſturbeth Religion, more than curioſitie.</p>
               <p>He was a ſtately man, and couragious, and had authoritie of life and death: elſe hee could not haue kept ſo many in good order. His moderation appeareth alſo, in that hee ſuffered <hi>Sara</hi> to rule at home. He was politique in chooſing the night to ſet on his enemies: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was in the fauour of God hee was ſure hee could not walke in darkeneſſe, and it was the fitteſt time to make his enemies affraid.</p>

And as for the Author to the Hebrewes, ſetting him downe to bee without father, without mother, we muſt conſider in what ſenſe and meaning he ſpeaketh: for ſeeing it is added by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> ſtorie, that he was king of <hi>Salem;</hi> and it is not poſsible for a king to be borne without Father, without Mother; and it was neuer the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the holy Ghoſt, to croſſe the courſe of the creation: therefore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4087:40"/>
we muſt looke for ſome other expoſition, than that which the bare lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe will afford vpon the firſt ſight. This therefore is the Author to the Hebrew meaning: He was now to call to the Iewes minde, one who in their ſtorie was a figure of the Meſsias. Now ſeeing Chriſt the Sauiour of the world, as he was God, had no mother, and as he was man, no father; therefore to make this plaine, that is, to make <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> a figure anſwerable to this truth, he ſo ſpeaketh of him, as if hee were without Father or Mother, becauſe he reſembled the Sonne of God. Now the Author to the Hebrewes might verie ſafely vſe this kind of ſpeaking For <hi>Sem</hi> being borne before the floode, and in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time being a Grandfather of eight degrees, muſt needes be thought to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Souldiers, to bee without father, without mother, who had neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life. So that a Souldier of <hi>Abrahams</hi> campe might aske of one of Canaan, Goodman of Canaan, who is this goodlie old man with a hoarie beard? Hee would anſwere thus; Hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the iuſt King, and his towne is named the quiet Towne. For when all the other Kings his neighbours are at variance, he onely liueth in peace. And when <hi>Elam</hi> ouercame fiue Kings, no man offered him any violence. We haue in euery village a ſeuerall God: but he ſacrificeth to the God (as he ſaith) that made vs, and them. And marke what I ſhall tell you: When he offereth an Oxe or a Ramme to his God, which (he ſaith) made the heauens and the earth, fire commeth from heauen to conſume it: and he ſeemeth to be ſo ſtrong, that none of vs ſhall liue to ſee his dayes. In this reſpect therefore the Author to the Hebrewes affirmeth that he was without father, without mother, who hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning of dayes, nor end of life. For in proper ſence it cannot be true.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Iſaack,</hi> in reſpect of the commaundement of God, that he ſhould be offered vp, and the obedience of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering him, was dead, and was reſtored to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if he had beene riſen from the dead. He was offered on mount Moriah, a part of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Sion, called afterwards Ieruſalem. Of this Chriſt ſpeaketh: <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, that thou ſawest thoſe things that concerne the peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes</hi>; therefore thou art <hi>Iebus,</hi> that is troden downe. God altereth the name of Moriah, to Ieruſalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would haue kept in memorie <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, &amp; <hi>Sems</hi> religion, and therefore giueth it a name comprehending both: for in reſpect of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he calleth it <hi>Iire. Abraham</hi> giuing it the name <hi>Iehouah Iire,</hi> that is, in the mount will the Lord be ſeene. In reſpect of <hi>Sem</hi> he keepeth the name of <hi>Salem</hi> ſtill, and ſo it is called <hi>Iire Salem, the Sight of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this ſtorie the Iewes might haue knowne the death of Chriſt, ſeeing Chriſt compareth them together, and yet by putting Chriſt to death, haue ſaued the world, though not heaped condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on their owne heads. For as it was prophecied, that one man muſt die for all the people: ſo they might haue thus reaſoned, We know this is the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and that he muſt die for the ſinnes of the people, <hi>Iſaack</hi> beeing a figure, and this time wherein hee nowe is on the earth, agreeing with <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeuens. Therefore, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> offered vp <hi>Iſaack,</hi> ſo let the high ſacrificer according to the lawe put him to death. But then, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, if they had knowne this, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glorie. But as the windowes of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple bee narrow without, and wide within: ſo Chriſt ſpeaketh of parables, that they are therefore ſpoken, that in hearing they ſhould not heare, and in ſeeing they ſhould not ſee, leaſt they ſhould repent and bee ſaued. The Authour to the Hebrewes ſayth, <hi>By faith</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>offered vppe Iſaack; and hee that receiued the promiſe, offered his onelie begotten ſonne: to whome it was ſaide, In Iſaack ſhall thy Seede bee called: for thee conſidered that God was able to raiſe him vppe euen from the dead, from whence hee receiued him alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſorte.</hi> Chriſt in the Goſpell affirmeth, That <hi>Abraham ſawe my dayes,</hi> that is, in <hi>Iſaack, and reioyced.</hi> God ſpeaketh from heauen to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this ſorte; <hi>By my ſelfe haue</hi> I <hi>ſworne, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſte not ſpared
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4087:43"/>
thine onely ſonne, therefore will I ſurely bleſſe thee.</hi> In <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus: <hi>What ſhall we ſay then to theſe things? If God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs? who ſpared not his owne ſonne, but gaue him to death for vs, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi>

<hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> borne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.</head>
               <p>The firſt matter in this ſtorie to bee conſidered, is, how the two twinnes in <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> wombe, are called two nations. <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of God, ſaith, <hi>I haue loued</hi> Iacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau: So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Romanes, <hi>Cap. 9. Ere they were borne, it was ſayd, The elder ſhall ſerue the younger, as it is written,</hi> Eſau <hi>haue I hated, and</hi> Iacob <hi>haue I loued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ESaus</hi> deſcription is thus layd downe in the Scriptures. Firſt, that he was hayrie, that hee was of great courage, and at his birth <hi>Iacob</hi> holdeth him by the heele; God thereby ſhewing at their birth, what ſhould be the courſe of their liues afterwards. <hi>Homer</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention, that <hi>Vliſſes</hi> ouerthrew <hi>Aiax</hi> by ſtriking him on the leg, The Greeke tranſlators handle it ſo, and call him, <hi>Thermiſtes,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Heeler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Hunter, liuing like the Ruffians and Royſters of our time. He ſelleth his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage: for <hi>Iacob</hi> would not giue it vnto him, except <hi>Eſau</hi> would firſt ſweare to ſell him his birth right. Saith <hi>Eſau,</hi> I am contented: for it will bee ſo long ere it will be enioyed, that I, and my ſonnes Sonne ſhalbe dead firſt. So with an oath he ſold <hi>Iacob</hi> his birth-right; therefore hee was called <hi>Edom, Redde pottage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt <hi>Iſaacks</hi> men knew this to bee a rare bleſsing: and ſeeing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4087:44"/>
he had deſpiſed it, they muſt needs, whenſoeuer they called him <hi>Edom,</hi> keepe his wickedneſſe in memorie: for by this ſale he deſpiſed <hi>Noah, Sem, Heber,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his victories, in the faith of which bleſsing, <hi>Abraham</hi> ouercame ſo gloriouſly. This is the firſt combate by the which <hi>Iacob</hi> a <hi>Heeler</hi> ſupplanteth <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole poſteritie of <hi>Eſau</hi> bare the name of this infidelitie: hee thought it a long time to the performance of a promiſe to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed almoſt Foure hundred yeares after: ayming, like a prophane worldling, at the outward inheritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not reſpecting the bleſsing of the ſpirituall <hi>Salem.</hi> He was the eldeſt, and extreame wicked: notwithſtanding he was the Sonne of a righteous Father, to ſhew that the ſincereſt nature of the godlyeſt men is extream wicked. Hee was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> as <hi>Kaine</hi> to <hi>Abel,</hi> and as <hi>Iſmael</hi> to <hi>Iſaack.</hi> And as in his owne perſon, he perſecuted and ſought the death of his Brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo his poſteritie were continuall enemies to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amelech</hi> of <hi>Eſau</hi> lay in waight for the children of Iſrael, when they came out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to deſtroy them: but God commaunded them to put out his name from vnder heauen. Wicked <hi>Haman</hi> would at once haue deſtroyed all the Iewes, but he and his ten Sonnes were hanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haman</hi> was of <hi>Agag</hi> the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> of <hi>Eſau.</hi> In him is performed a prophecie in <hi>Numb. 24.</hi> Ameleck <hi>is the beginning of Nations, but his later end ſhall periſh vtterly. Herod</hi> of <hi>Edome</hi> likewiſe ſeeketh to put Chriſt the true Iſrael, to death: wherein you may ſee the malice of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> to continue euen till Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated of God before he was borne: therefore whatſoeuer he did, it turned ſtill into a curſe vnto him; hee prepareth veniſon for his Father, and the whiles loſeth the bleſsing of eternall life: he would pleaſe his father by marrying into <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtocke, and maryeth <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> daughter; he wept for the bleſsing, but found no place of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though he ſought the bleſsing with teares. In like ſort is the repentance of euerie wicked man, when he is touched with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ſinne, he will then acknowledge his ſinne, and with teares ſhew forth for his tranſgreſsions, but through the hardnes of his hart which cannot repent, he returneth like to <hi>Eſau</hi> to his vomite againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IAcobs</hi> Storie will appeare the better by declaring <hi>Eſaus,</hi> euen as contraries are ſet together, that thereby euerie one may ſhewe the cleerer.</p>
               <p>His name ſignifieth a <hi>Suplani</hi> or <hi>Heeler,</hi> and all his life ſheweth him to be contrarie to <hi>Eſau</hi>: The one an image of all impietie; the other a mirrour of all godlyneſſe: the one a perſecutor, the other perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4087:44"/>
the one a deſpiſer of grace, the other an embracer of vertue.</p>
               <p>You haue from the creation to <hi>Iacob</hi> two and Twentie Fathers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Two and Twentie Letters in the Hebrew tongue. So <hi>Epiphaneus in Ankorato</hi> handleth them.</p>
               <p>Thus, by compariſons God maketh his dealings eaſie to bee kept in memorie. <hi>Iacob,</hi> though the Two and Twentie from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet the third Seuenth of thoſe which were borne after <hi>Adams</hi> creation.</p>
               <p>Now the Chronicle is ended for particular liues: for after <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Scripture containes whole Stories of whole States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> is the Tenth from <hi>Adam: Abraham</hi> the Tenth from <hi>Noah: Iacob</hi> the Twelfe: ſo you haue the two and Twentie. The Hebrewes admire the patience of God, that Tenne whole ages God gaue them time to repent, and yet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth, that the Lord looked about, and ſaw that there was none good vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>The Seuentie Interpreters tranſlating the old Teſtament into Greek, thruſt in one <hi>Kenan,</hi> whoſe name is not in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> If the reaſon be demaunded why they did ſo, this may be anſwered: The Seuenty Interpreters knew, that a great deale of wiſedom was contained in the compariſon between the Two and Twentie Letters of the Hebrew tongue, and the Two and Twentie Fathers. Now becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied the Egyptians, and were loath they ſhould gaine any wiſedome by them, of purpoſe they adde <hi>Kenan,</hi> to diſturbe this proportion, and ſo they make <hi>Iacob</hi> the Three and Twentieth. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſetting downe the Genealogie of Chriſt, alleageth <hi>Kenan</hi> following the Genealogie, penned by the Seuentie Interpreters. For Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was to take it as he found it, and hee knewe that all the Iewes were well acquainted with the reaſon why <hi>Kenan</hi> was added. Therefore there could no danger growe in his time, though <hi>Kenan</hi> were kept ſtill in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie. <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlating the new Teſtament, leaueth him out; for the which the Ieſuits accuſe him. Now <hi>Beza,</hi> to the end ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men ſhuld not ſtagger by finding him in <hi>Luke</hi> which is not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> leaueth him out: and this may <hi>Beza</hi> doe well inough: for any one may know, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> neuer meant, that <hi>Arphachſad</hi> begat <hi>Kenan,</hi> ſeeing that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>being, as men ſuppoſed, the Sonne of Arphachſad,</hi> to wit, of thoſe men that knew not the meaning of the Tranſlators. Beſides, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Grecian, and being acquainted with the Greeke tranſlation, yet concludeth the Fathers vnder the number of Two and Twentie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> is called The beloued of the Lord, before he was borne: In which he is anſwerable to <hi>Dauid,</hi> whoſe name ſignifieth <hi>Beloued.</hi> And to our Sauiour Chriſt, of whome it was ſayd, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:4087:45"/>And further, we are to note in this ſtorie, how <hi>Eſau</hi> by haſt, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtay for the promiſe till the time appointed, felt the heauie iudgement of God. Wee haue the like example of this haſt, and the like puniſhment in <hi>Saul. Samuel</hi> annointed <hi>Saul</hi> King, and willed him to go before him to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> &amp; to ſtay there for him 7 daies till he came. <hi>Saul</hi> tarieth 7 daies, according to the time appointed, but <hi>Samuel</hi> came not, therefore the people were ſcattered. <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeing the peoples mindes ſeuered, that he might vnite them againe, offered a burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Then came <hi>Samuel</hi> &amp; rebuked him, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thy kingdom ſhal not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, the lord hath ſought him a man after his own heart.</hi> Thus you haue the like example, both for Storie, and prophecie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ISaack</hi> is blinde, <hi>Sem, Heber,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> being dead, onely <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> aliue to enioy the bleſsing after <hi>Iſaacks</hi> death. Now, if we examine the ſequele, we ſhall ſee, that if <hi>Iſaack</hi> had not been blinde, he would for his part haue brought deſtruction vpon the whole earth: for hee would haue bleſſed <hi>Eſau,</hi> who vpon any occaſion would haue ſould it, and beſides, being verie wicked in deſpiſing it, would haue brought the heauy wrath of God vpon his poſterity for diſobedience. Therefore his blindneſſe was a great bleſsing, euen as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euerie thing turneth to the beſt to the children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaack</hi> willeth <hi>Eſau</hi> to goe and kill him ſome veniſon, that his ſoule may bleſſe him before he die. So the Prophets vſe to deſire meate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prophecie, that being refreſhed they may be the fuller of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and cheerefulneſſe. The Hebrewes diſpute from this place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſaack</hi> was growne into pouertie. Some thinke hee was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the famine which fell in Canaan, &amp; becauſe the Philiſtines kept not couenant with him, for which cauſe <hi>Sampſon</hi> afterwards taketh occaſion to plague them, and that iuſtly. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is of this opinion. <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſhe heareth this Commandement of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and knowing that ſpeedineſſe in diſpatching, is oftentimes a great cauſe of aduantage, willeth <hi>Iacob</hi> to goe and fetch a Kid, that thereof ſhe might make plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant meat for <hi>Iſaack. Iacob</hi> is affraid, ſhe comforteth him: for ſhe had her warrant from God, that the elder ſhould ſerue the yonger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee boldly aduentureth. He commeth to <hi>Iſaack,</hi> who ſuppoſeth him to bee <hi>Iacob</hi> by his voyce, but feeling the roughneſſe of his handes and necke, is perſwaded that it is <hi>Eſau,</hi> and bleſſeth him. When hee was bleſſed, in commeth <hi>Eſau</hi> with his veniſon, and prayeth his Father to bleſſe him. <hi>Iſaack</hi> was now aſtonied to thinke of this ſubtiltie. His ſpirite muſt needs be full of feare, to thinke how hee whom he would haue bleſſed, the Lord would not chooſe. <hi>Iſaack</hi> therefore ſeeing the euent, acknowledgeth the election of God in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:4087:45"/>
and concludeth that he ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Now here is a queſtion to be handled. When <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, I <hi>am thy Sonne</hi> Eſau. And <hi>Iſaac</hi> anſwereth, <hi>It is</hi> Iacobs <hi>voice.</hi> Whether <hi>Iacob</hi> doth lye or no. This anſwere of <hi>Iacobs,</hi> if we expound in the beſt ſence, is no lye: for then it is no more but a kind of ſcoffing, called <hi>Ironia.</hi> So God ſpeaketh in <hi>Gen. 3. Behold, the man is become as one of vs, to know good and euill.</hi> So Chriſt in the Goſpell commeth to his Diſciples, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them a ſleepe ſaith, <hi>Sleepe henceforth.</hi> Wee may anſwere it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus: <hi>Iacob</hi> in reſpect of the purpoſe of God, which choſe him for the bleſſed, might verie well bee called the onely Sonne. Beſides, in regard of ciuill right, now hee was his eldeſt Sonne, ſeeing hee had bought the birth-right of <hi>Eſau</hi>: Whether it were a lye or no, we will leaue it to God: and wee cannot altogether condemne this anſwere, ſeeing God approoueth it by giuing <hi>Iacob</hi> the bleſsing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, When men are dead, wee cannot aske them what they meant. Therefore we muſt expound their ſpeeches, and their actions to the beſt meaning. And further, words are not alwayes to be taken in proper kinde of ſpeaking. For <hi>Abram</hi> defendeth himſelfe, that <hi>Sara</hi> was his Siſter, to wit, the Daughter of his Father, but not the daughter of his mother: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſweareth by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> if you take the words as they lye in proper ſence, he ſinned greatly, and was euen for his oath, the worſt of all <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sonnes. But <hi>Salmo Iirki</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth him thus: by the life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> you are Spies, that is, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> life is a wormes life, which in account is no life: euen ſo are ye no Spies in truth, though you may ſeem ſo to be. So likewiſe <hi>Huſhai</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth <hi>Abſalom</hi>; for when <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaw <hi>Huſhai, Dauids</hi> Counſellor, he asketh him, <hi>Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend? Why wenteſt thou not with thy friend,</hi> meaning <hi>Dauid. Huſhai</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Nay, but whom the Lord and this people, and all the men of Iſrael choſe, his will</hi> I <hi>be, and with him will I dwell.</hi> This ſentence hath a double meaning, either that he meant to ſerue <hi>Abſalom,</hi> or King <hi>Dauid.</hi> Therefore when thinges are ſpoken doubtfully, we muſt marke how men may in wit expound them.</p>

                  <hi>Ramban,</hi> an old Hebrew, maketh another compariſon in the euents, thus: <hi>Iacob</hi> himſelfe was vſed well in Egypt, but his poſteritie was plagued by the Kings which liued after him in Egypt.</p>
               <p>In Babylon thoſe that went into captiuitie were plagued, as <hi>Sidrack, Miſhak, Abednego:</hi> but their poſteritie found reliefe in <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> conquering the Babylonians.</p>
               <p>Now it is neceſſary to ſpeake of the place where <hi>Iacob</hi> died.</p>
               <p>This place was Egypt, <hi>Chams</hi> countrey, long agoe accurſed. Where it is ſpoken in the Prophets, that in Egypt men ſpake with the tongue of Canaan, the meaning of it is thus much:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4087:50"/>
That when Chriſt ſhall come to preach, his teaching ſhall be of ſuch power, that it ſhall conuert in all countreyes (aſwell Egypt as Grecia, Barbaria, and all other the countreys of the Gentiles which knew not God) ſoules vnto God, which being conuerted, ſhall ſpeake the tongue of Canaan, that is, their tongues ſhall prayſe God for the redemption by Chriſt, which is the tongue of Canaan. This continueth yet true: for there is no countrey nor nation, where God hath not had, or hath thoſe which vnfainedly beleeue the Goſpel. Yet if it be obiected, that the tongue of Canaan was Hebrew, how then ſhall a ſimple plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnderſtand it? This obiection is thus taken away. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for a ſimple ploughman or trades man to be a skilfull Hebre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: for he may be ſaued without the knowledge of the tongue, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Bible tranſlated, he may learne the religion of Canaan, and that learning will teach him the tongue of Canaan. If they replie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Papiſts ſay the tranſlations be corrupted, and therefore it is neceſſarie he ſhould be cunning in the originall: For anſwere to this replie made from the Papiſts argument, if any doubt of the truth of the tranſlations, he may reſort to learned preachers, which can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reſolue him. And for the Papiſts, if the controuerſie be betweene them and vs, the originall muſt determine it.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes were of <hi>Cham.</hi> It is not meant his twelue ſonnes, for they were borne before he came into Egypt: but that place of Scripture hath ſpeciall reference to the two ſonnes of <hi>Ioſeph, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who are reckoned to be <hi>Iacobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For <hi>Ioſeph</hi> marring an Egyptian by whom he had them, they by the mothers ſide are of <hi>Cham,</hi> and ſo <hi>Iacobs</hi> children in this ſenſe are of <hi>Cham.</hi>

                  <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Leui.</hi> Their wrath was fierce: yet becauſe <hi>Leui</hi> afterwardes repented, and ſhewed tender affection to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and was zealous in deſtroying Idolatrers, therefore he had a bleſsing in <hi>Moſes</hi> will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simeon</hi> neuer ſhewed any tender affection to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and therefore when his brethren come into Egypt, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> accuſeth them for Spies, he keepeth <hi>Simeon</hi> in priſon till they come downe againe, as a kinde of puniſhment for his former malice. His ſinne againſt the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites was exceeding great: and ſeeing he neuer ſhewed any ſigne of repentance, hee was iuſtly cut off from the hope of a bleſsing. By this wee may learne to reiect the authoritie of the booke of <hi>Iudith</hi>: Firſt, becauſe ſhe ſayd to be of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon.</hi> If wee marke this well, wee ſhall ſee how this booke cannot be ſcripture. For wee muſt note, that it is no ſmall glorie to haue the ſpirite of God penne a booke of ones actions. If there be but a ſentence ſpoken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of any in the ſcripture, it is a great weight of glorie. Now if wee looke to <hi>Iacobs</hi> will, and ſee that he hath a curſe, and not a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and in the courſe of Scripture afterward no mention of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that <hi>Simeon</hi> and his Tribe ſhewed, nor any zeale of religion expreſſed; how can this ſtand with <hi>Iacobs</hi> prophecie? nay, it cleane croſſeth it, and maketh it fruſtrate. For ſeeing <hi>Iacob</hi> as a Prophet, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all his Sonnes what ſhould befall them in the laſt dayes, to euerie one and his tribe; ſo long as the Kingdome of the Iewes, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie ſtood; and in his will maketh no mention of the booke of <hi>Iudith</hi>: We muſt by admitting this booke, accuſe the ſpirite of God of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Beſides, it is a Storie: and yet the time thereof doth not fall out within the compaſſe of any time, neither before the captiuitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after, and therefore to be deſpiſed. And for my opinion I make as much account of <hi>Ouids</hi> Metamorphoſis, as of <hi>Iudith</hi>: for <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, that in fables there is a truth reuealed ſecretly.

            <head>
               <hi>Satan</hi> compaſſeth all the earth, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEfore wee come to examine <hi>Iobs</hi> cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there may bee by the way, a queſtion diſcuſſed concerning ſucceſsion: that is to ſay, Whether ſucceſsion of Biſhops, be a neceſſarie marke of the Church? And we ſhall, if we mark the Stories of the Scripture, find that is none: for in <hi>Iobs</hi> time, where there was a viſible Sacrificer, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Religion of God in outward policie? Satan hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranne the whole earth, telleth God, that hee could finde none iuſt,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4087:53"/>
or that feared God. So that thereby wee may gather, that there were verie fewe, whome the world by eye-ſight acknowledged godly.</p>
            <p>And to make this more plaine; wee are to obſerue, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, Whether the godly in their owne hearts doe knowe who ſerue God: but, Whether there bee continually ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance thereof, that it may appeare to eye-ſight. Since Chriſt wee haue not the like time to this, wherein Satan can bragge, he ouer-runneth the whole earth. For in <hi>Iobs</hi> time <hi>Iacob</hi> is dead: the Religion which <hi>Iobs</hi> friends hold, is condemned by God. <hi>Elihu</hi> is verie young, and <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe condemned of his friends: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee may verie well conclude, That it is no ſound Diuinitie to affirme, that it is no true Church, except the policie thereof be ſo viſible, as it may be knowne by eye-ſight.</p>
            <p>In the Reuleation, foure Angels ſtand on the foure Corners of the earth, holding the foure Windes of the Earth, that they ſhould not blowe neither on the earth, neither on the Sea, neither on any greene Tree. By this likewiſe wee may gather, that the godly were verie fewe, and ſcarce knowne: For the office of theſe foure Angels was, to ſtay the graces of Gods Spirite from blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vppon, and refreſhing the ſoules of thoſe which dwelt on the earth.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall ſee this cleerer, if wee obſerue the particular fallings through the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Enoſh</hi> his time, Religion decayed in the houſe of God: for the which, the flood came and drowned the world, After the flood, for their wickedneſſe which they manifeſted in building the Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> they haue their tongues confounded, and all their families ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Iobs</hi> time, none of the children of Iſrael forſook the Idols of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time of the Iudges, you ſhall finde a great many of fallings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and therefore God gaue them into the hands of diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Roboams</hi> time, the ten Tribes fell away.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Antiochus</hi> time, Religion was ſo corrupted, that the Leuites would be Kings, and thereby became Saduces, maintaining an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That after this life the bodie was no more, and concerning the ſoule, it was no more to be eſteemed, than the ſoule of a beaſt, or any other creature.</p>
            <p>In Chriſts time, all the Iewes were back-ſliders, except ſome few, perhaps about ſeuen Thouſand which might hold religion ſincerely, anſwerable to <hi>Elias</hi> time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:4087:54"/>After Chriſt, in <hi>Vrbanus</hi> time, all the Chriſtians fell away, and then came vp the power and authoritie of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> for whom he made lawes. So that if wee conſider theſe things well, we ſhall finde, that the godly haue alwaies been ſo fewe, and the outward policie of true Religion ſo darkened, that it could hardly bee diſcerned. This queſtion being thus diſcuſſed, wee are to conſider the time when <hi>Iob</hi> was afflicted. And if we examine things duly, we ſhall find this time to be before <hi>Moſes.</hi> There bee ſlouthfull fellowes that ſay, the time cannot bee prooued when <hi>Iobs</hi> Storie fell out, As though, if any one ſhould write Epiſtles or Orations, a good Scholler could not eaſily from the matter find out the time wherein hee ſhould liue. In the Three and Twentie Orations made by <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends, there is mention made of the Creation, of the Flood, of <hi>Babell,</hi> and the Seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Families of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and his deſtruction, but nothing of the comming from <hi>Egypt:</hi> which being ſo famous a deliuerance, they would not haue omitted. For the Prophets continually rehearſe it, and doe as it were make large Commentaries thereon.</p>
            <p>Further, it muſt bee at ſuch a time wherein Satan had the conqueſt ouer the whole world: for ſo Satan ſayth, he had run ouer the whole world, and found none that feared God, and departed from euil: which affirmation cannot bee true, but onely when Iſrael was in <hi>Egypt</hi>: for then all the world but they, worſhipped ſtrange Gods, and of them <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſayth, <hi>None of the Children of Iſrael forſooke their Idols of Egypt.</hi> Therefore this muſt needes bee a maruailous Victorie which Satan had gotten. Beſides, <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe ſayth, <hi>O that God would anſwere, and trie mee.</hi> This had beene a fooliſh ſpeech, if it had beene after <hi>Moſes:</hi> for then his integritie ſhould haue beene determined by <hi>Moſes</hi> lawes. When the tongues are diuided, you haue <hi>Abraham</hi> called, and made a rare man. So when in <hi>Egypt</hi> all Religion was corrupted, you haue <hi>Moſes</hi> borne, thereby to ſhew, that when Satan thinketh hee beareth moſt ſway, the Lord in mercie will raiſe vp one to ouerthrowe his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The temptations of <hi>Iob</hi> muſt needes bee about the birth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the lawe was made of killing the young Children, Satan poſſeſsing the hearts of the wicked, that all their care and ſtudie was bent to the ouerthrowe of the Church, and when <hi>Aaron</hi> was borne but three yeares afore, there was peace: for wee doe not read that they were faine to hide him.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:4087:54"/>THe place where hee dwelt, was Eaſtward. The Sabeans on the one ſide, the Caldeans on the other, and <hi>Canaan</hi> on the other, and he as it were in the middeſt. This Country is called <hi>Huts.</hi> God hath in his prouidence dealt ſo ſurely, that the verie heathen (if they bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) will make plaine the euent of Gods promiſes. <hi>Nimrod</hi> hee goeth about to ouerthrow <hi>Sems</hi> bleſsing, and builds him a Tower, but God giueth it an ouerthrow. Afterwards <hi>Nachors</hi> Twelue Sonnes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne the land of <hi>Chuſh. Iſmaels</hi> Twelue Sonnes they doe the like. <hi>Eſau</hi> hath eleuen Dukes, and Eight Kinges, and eleuen Dukes againe, and that afore there was any King in Iſrael, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh, and they conquer <hi>Chuſh,</hi> and his Land. In Egypt, <hi>Chuſh</hi> his poſteritie imagine by the multitude and ſtrength of their Chariots and Horſemen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge themſelues of the Children of Iſrael: but the Lord ouer-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them in the red Sea. When the Children of Iſrael are in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, they of <hi>Canaan</hi> and their borders deale deſpightfully with them, and will graunt them no paſſage, thinking therby to ſtarue them in the wilderneſſe: But the Lord by Ieſus their Captaine deſtroyeth them all, euen to <hi>Canaan</hi> the youngeſt, according to the curſe of <hi>Noah, And let</hi> Canaan <hi>bee his ſeruant.</hi> When the Iewes are carried away captiue to Babylon, there <hi>Chuſh</hi> his poſteritie haue a great ſtroke, and ſeeme to ouerthrow <hi>Sems</hi> bleſsing. But God rayſed vp <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> to ouerthrow the Babylonians, and therby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the Iewes, and prouideth for the building of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how God is ſtill true in his promiſes, <hi>Curſed be</hi> Canaan <hi>a ſeruant of ſeruants ſhall he be. Iob,</hi> he goeth to <hi>Sems</hi> houſe for his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions, thereby ſhewing his religion, which would not enioy earthly poſſeſsions amongeſt thoſe whome God had curſed. And wee may ſee in this, the law of nature obſerued, that euerie one is to reſort to his eldeſt brothers houſe.</p>

               <p>THe queſtion is not concerning <hi>Adams</hi> fall, or the goodneſſe and pureneſſe of workes: they doubt not of the Reſurrection, nor of the Trinitie, nor of any other points of faith: but it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Question of Practiſe.</hi> (that is to ſay) Whether a man which aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in wealth, and being brought to pouertie, can be in fauour of God? and whether God do ſo gouern the world, that thoſe whom he loueth, he will ſuffer to ſee affliction. <hi>Iob</hi> is declared to be merueilous great, his bleſsings multiplied in his ſonnes, in his daughters, in Sheepe, Oxen, Aſſes, and Cammels. He himſelfe could not bee old: perhaps at this time ſixtie yeeres: for they ſay they had then liuing el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then his father, and after his temptation he liued 140. yeeres, and we muſt take heed we make him not to outliue <hi>Iſaack.</hi> Now all his wealth is taken from him: himſelfe in great miſerie remembreth <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtorie going with his ſtaffe and his ſcrip ouer Iordan, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof comforteth himſelfe, and confeſſeth, <hi>Chap. 1. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither, the Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh away, bleſsed therefore be his name.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>1. Tim. cap. 6.</hi> Tels him, <hi>that godlineſſe is great riches, if a man be content with that he hath: for we brought nothing into the world, and it is certaine we can carrie nothing out.</hi> And the children of Iſrael euery yere when they came to offer, after the Prieſts had taken the basket of firſt fruits, and ſet it before the Altar of the Lord, were wont to ſay, <hi>Deu. 26. A Syrian was my father,</hi> to wit, <hi>Iacob, who went ouer Iordan with his ſtaffe, and his bagge, and after he returned into Canaan, and being readie to periſh, went downe into Egypt, and ſoiourned there with a ſmall company, and grew there vnto a nation great, mightie, and full of people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This confeſsion was not miraculous in <hi>Iob.</hi> For the heathen could ſay thus much as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe in their Epigrams; that naked they came out of the earth, and naked they ſhall goe thither. Sathan touched his bodie, and left him him nothing free but the fleſh of his teeth, and his tongue, that with his tongue he might by deſperation blaſpheme God. <hi>Suidas</hi> thinketh his torments endured ſeuen yeeres, by matters mentioned in his orations which likelihood could not fall out ſooner, as that euery one mocked him and fleed from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then it was a great while after that his kinſ-men heard of his temptation, yet they could come, being Dukes and great men, and dwelling farre. When
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4087:56"/>
they come, they tarry ſeuen dayes without ſpeaking any word: ſo great was his griefe vpon him, that all this while it droue them into an amazedneſſe. Then they begun to diſpute with him.</p>
               <p>Their diſputations are true, and voide of oathes: they make mention of the Sabbath, the inueigh againſt adulterie, and other ſinnes of the ſecond table: they confute iuſtification by workes; they pray not to Saints departed, for <hi>Iobs</hi> recouerie. By their orations wee may eaſily learne to confute theſe fond opinions which Popery holdeth. His friends may ſeeme to ſtacker concerning his ſaluation, by reaſon of his rauing and ſpeaking ſo doubtfully of the truth: for the which God condemneth him after, and asketh, <hi>Iob 38. Who is he that obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth knowledge with many words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliphas</hi> therefore beginneth thus: <hi>Chap. 4. Wilt thou be grieued if one aſſay to commune with thee? but who can hold himſelfe from ſpeaking? Thou thy ſelfe haſt taught many, and haſt ſtrengthened the weary hands: Thou haſt had great hope, patience, and confidence.</hi> And yet I can tell thee, thy caſe is very ill, and if thou doſt not repent, thou wilt not be ſaued. For <hi>who euer periſhed being an innocent? Indeed the roaring of the Lyon and the voyce of the Lyoneſse, and the teeth of the Lyons whelpes, are broken.</hi> You may ſee this euident by our victories againſt <hi>Chams</hi> houſe, though <hi>Nimrod</hi> ſeemed to rule like a Lyon. The Kori we haue likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. But concerning <hi>Sems</hi> houſe, <hi>Nachor, Iſmael, Keturah,</hi> do not they floriſh? What part of them is conſumed? So you ſee the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on periſh for lacke of prey, and the Lyons whelpes ſcattered: but where was the vpright euer deſtroyed? And if you thinke this new doctrine, I pray you enquire of the former ages, and prepare thy ſelfe to ſearch after their fathers, for wee are but as yeſterday, and are ignorant. You ſhall ſee that the floode ouer-tooke the vngodlie. And ſo we are to thinke of them which liued wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie afterward. But yet God will not caſt away an vpright man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their will he take the wicked by the hand. And how can you be in the fauour of God? the Saints doe not pitch their tents about you: for then the Sabeans and Caldeans had not ſpoyled your goods. The Angels do not waite on you: for then the wind had not ouerthrowne your houſe. Heere is none that careth for you: therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee vpright. But if you will ſeeke God, this is the way: confeſſe your ſinnes and repent: <hi>For a thing was brought vnto me ſecretly, and in the thoughts of the viſions of the night feare came vpon me, and there stoode one and I knew not his face, but I heard a voice which ſaid, Shall man bee more iust than God? or ſhall a man bee more pure than his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Hee found no ſtedfastneſſe in his Angels: how much more in them which dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, which ſhall be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4087:56"/>
deſtroyed before the mother? And concerning affliction, it is not out of the duſt, neither doth it ſpring out of the earth. But man is borne vnto trauell, as the ſparkes flie vpward.</hi> To conclude: <hi>Bleſsed is the man whom God correcteth, therefore refuſe not thou the chaſtiſement of the Almightie: for hee maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp: and if thou wilt embrace this, this good will come of it. Thou ſhalt laugh at deſtruction; the ſtones of the field ſhall be in league with thee; and the beaſts of the field, and peace ſhall bee in thy Tabernacle: and thy ſeede ſhalbe great, and thy poſteritie as the graſse of the earth: and thou ſhalt goe to thy graue in a good full age, as a Kicke of corne commeth into the barne in due ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iob,</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>Chap. 6. Oh that my griefe were well weighed, and my miſeries laid together! they would bee heauier than the ſand of the ſea: therefore my words are ſwallowed vp.</hi> And for my friends, this I ſay. <hi>He that is in miſerie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: But you, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, haue deceiued me as the riuers in the ſouth, which in the winter are blackiſh with yce, and when it is hote, dried vp. They that goe to Tema and Sheba waiteth for them, but they were confounded, ſo yee are like to them. You haue ſeene my fearefull plague and are afraid. Thus haue men forgotten the feare of the Almightie. Ye pretend counſell and comfort, but this is to haue me forget God. For if I be wicked, why labour I thus in vaine, yet if I waſh my ſelfe with ſnow water, and purge my hands most cleane, mine owne clothes ſhall make me filthie. I know I haue ſinned, and haue done wickedlie: but yet my faith aſsureth me, that God cannot be mine enemie, as you affirme: why then ſhould he afflict me? and for my ſtrength, is it of ſtones? or my fleſh of braſse? Now whereas you ſay, that God puniſheth the wicked, and tyrants come to destruction; who knoweth not this? For I know as much as you know, neither am I inferiour to you; yet this is not alwayes true that you ſay: for we ſee the wicked eſtabliſhed, their houſes are peaceable, and the rod of God is not vpon them. They ſend forth their children like ſheepe, and their ſons daunce, they take the Tabret and Harpe, and ſodenlie they goe downe to the graue: for they are as ſtubble before the wind, and deſtruction commeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. But yet this you must alſo know, that he deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</hi> Heere perfect is not meant a life void of ſinne in the ſight of God, but for outward actions void of hypocriſie. <hi>Concerning the wiſedome of God, that it is vnſearchable, I confeſſe that likewiſe, aſwell as you. For the ſiluer hath his vaine, and the gold his place, yron is taken out of the duſt, and braſſe out of the stone: hee ſetteth a bond for darkeneſse, and the ſhadow of death. Out of the ſame earth commeth Bread, and vnder it is brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone found, the ſtones thereof Saphir, and the dust gold. There is a path that the fowle knoweth not, neither the crowes eyes hath ſeene, the Lyons haue not walked in it. But yet where is wiſedome? and where is the place of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? For which gold ſhall not be giuen of Ophir, nor the Onix, nor Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4087:57"/>
God vnderſtandeth the way therof: for he weigheth the winds and the water by meaſure. When hee made a decree for the raine, and a way for the lightning of the thunders, then did he ſee it, and vnto man he ſaid, The feare of the Lord is wiſedome, and to depart from euill is vnderſtanding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to giue rules to God ſeeing all haue like euent together. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my life, I was an eye to the blind; feete to the lame; a father vnto the poore; and when I knew not the cauſe, I ſought it out diligently. I did neuer eat my morſels alone, the fatherleſse haue euer eaten with me. I haue not ſeene any periſh for want of clothing; the loynes of him haue bleſsed mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was warmed with the fleece of my ſheepe. I haue euer bene ſo carefull, that I would not offend the leaſt childe: my countenance hath beene ſo ſober, that I haue made a couenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I behold a maid? But yet, Oh that I were as in times paſt, as in the dayes of my youth, when my children were round about me, when vnto me men gaue care, and waited and held their tongue at my counſell, when my words dropped vpon them as the latter raine. If I laughed on them, they beleeued it not: my countenance hath euer beene ſo graue, for my iudgement it was not changeable as the moone, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I flatter my ſelfe in ſecret. For my religion, I euer held this ſure, that my</hi> Redeemer <hi>liueth, and that he ſhall ſtand the laſt man vpon the earth. But I pray you marke how the caſe is altered; They that are yonger than I, mocke me, whoſe fathers I haue refuſed to ſet with the dogs of my flocke, yet now I am their ſong, and their talke: my owne ſeruants flie from me, and my wife vſeth reproch. To conclude, this is the ſumme: Oh that man might talke with God, &amp; make anſwere to his Creator. Philo</hi> a Iew ſaith, that <hi>Dina Iacobs</hi> daughter was <hi>Iobs</hi> wife: he neuer meant ſo, but it is their manner in teaching their children, that where there be women mentioned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, they ſay they were married to ſuch whoſe wiues the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentioneth not, that ſo their children might the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. <hi>Zophar</hi> &amp; <hi>Bildads</hi> Orations were the ſame with <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and they condemned <hi>Iob</hi> in the ſame manner. And heere we muſt obſerue in the diſcourſe of ciuile actions laid downe by <hi>Iob,</hi> that either he liued ſo, or that men ſhould liue ſo. And <hi>Moſes</hi> lawes afterward for policie are but an expreſsing of theſe.</p>

               <p>You ſaid <hi>Iob</hi> in the 13. chapter, <hi>Oh that a man might diſpute with God. Behold, I am vnto thee in Gods ſtead, and am formed of clay: and behold, my terror ſhall not feare thee. You haue ſaid, I am cleane without ſinne: he hath found occaſions againſt me, &amp; hath put my feete in the ſtocks. But I will tell you, O</hi> Iob, <hi>ſtriue not against him: for he is greater than man: he ſpeaketh once or twice; as,</hi> THE SEEDE OF THE WOMAN, SHALL BRVSE THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT: <hi>and bleſſed be the God of</hi> Sem: <hi>&amp; openeth their eares euen by corrections. If then there be a meſsenger, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter one of a thouſand, to ſhew man that his righteouſneſſe conſiſteth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the fauour of God, that he may ſay, I haue ſinned, I haue peruerted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, I haue ſuckt vp folly like water, and where I know not, teach thou me, O Lord; then ſhall he haue a reconciliation, and then ſhall his righteouſnes be restored vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then God replieth</hi> out of the whirlewind, and asketh, <hi>Where is hee that obſcureth knowledge with many words?</hi> For <hi>Iob</hi> ſhould haue ſhewed the purpoſe of God in deſtroying the vpright and wicked together, and not ſpoken doubtfully of it. And God ſheweth him from the ſtory of the Creation, and the excellencie of the Creatures, his vnſpeakable wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Iob</hi> anſwereth, <hi>I am vild, I will lay my hand vpon my mouth; I know thou canſt doe all things: and I haue ſpoken things I vnderſtand not: therefore I abhorre my ſelfe, and will repent in dust and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Lord accepteth <hi>Iobs</hi> faith and repentance. And as high Sacrificer, he ſacrificeth for his three friends. And God bleſſeth him more now, than at the firſt. Where it is tranſlated that <hi>Iobs</hi> wife ſhould ſay, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> it cannot be ſo: But the meaning is, Bleſſe God and die, flowting him as if ſhe ſhould ſay, See to what your pureneſſe and preciſeneſſe is come to, euen to bleſſe God and die. Had it not beene better for you to haue liued, and enioyed proſperity, as others? This patience of <hi>Iobs,</hi> is repeated in the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames, chap. 5.</hi> In the Epiſtle to the Romanes, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth, that the Gentiles were cut off, that the Iew might come in; and now the Iewes, that the Gentiles, and concludeth out of <hi>Iob,</hi> who gaue to God firſt, that he might be recompenſed?

               <p>The Hebrewes commend <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes for not giuing names after the manner of the Egyptians, while they were in Egypt. The reaſon of this may be rendred, Becauſe that in Egypt they were ill vſed, and therefore hated the Egyptians. In Babylon they were well vſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Perſians, and therefore they haue many Perſian names, and there did learne ſo the tongue of Babel, that they began to forget their owne. The vſe of this is very great againſt the Turke, for to prooue from whence he firſt came, and thereby to perſwade him to embrace the religion of his firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>The hatred towards <hi>Chams</hi> houſe, appeareth in <hi>Sheſan</hi> that married one of <hi>Iuda.</hi> The ſtory whereof hath beene mentioned before in the ſtorie of <hi>Iſmael</hi> the Egyptian.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning Moſes education,</hi> God ſo prouideth, that hee is brought vp for the ſonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter. He is inſtructed in all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Egyptians, which was the Mathematicks, and other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane arts. The ouerflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> compelled them to be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Aſtronomie. His Arithmeticke and Geometrie is apparant in the Tabernacle, and things therein appointed: For though God gaue him inſtructions, yet it could not be that hee ſhould performe them without taking great delight in the proportions themſelues, which could not bee without great skill in the arte. In the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke the Iewes reckon fortie two peeces, ſixe ſeuens, ſo you haue in this proportion the remembrance of the Creation, and of the Sabbath, and of thoſe holy men who were ſpeciall Seuens. <hi>Baſile</hi> in his Treatiſe vppon the Creation affirmeth, that there was one, to wit, <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſeuenth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> vppon whom after a ſort the Iewes ſhould depend. God giueth likewiſe to the heathen the knowledge of theſe things, that thereby looking to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may admire his eternall wiſedome, and worſhip him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4087:59"/>
as Creator. And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe ſo layeth them downe, that a heathen by his skill in theſe arts may vnderſtand the reaſon of them. The ſumme of all is, <hi>God ſaueth the world by Christ,</hi> and vſeth all humane knowledge; as a ſeruant to teach the Redemption by Chriſt. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the acts, that all his doctrine was nothing but <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets; and theirs nothing but Chriſt. In that ſence likewiſe, the Greeke tongue perteineth to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> knew that hee ſhould bee a deliuerer, and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Egyptian miſvſing an Iſraelite, hee killeth him. Afterwards hee ſeeth two Hebrewes ſtriuing together, and hee commeth to them, and telleth them, they are brethren, why then ſhould they bee at variance? They vpbraide him with the ſlaughter of the Egyptian. Hee thought, they would haue knowne him their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer. But hearing that this was knowne, hee fleeth into the land of Madian. Of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the Epiſtle to Hebrewes <hi>cap. 11. By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>refuſed to bee called the ſonne of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with his brethren, than to enioy the pleaſures of ſinne, which last but for a ſeaſon.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> at fortie yeeres old ſheweth himſelfe a true Chriſtian. Hee marrieth <hi>Zephora: Marie,</hi> ſhee deſpiſeth her, becauſe ſhee was of <hi>Chuſh:</hi> but indeed ſhe was of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah</hi>: for <hi>Madian</hi> one of her ſonnes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runneth <hi>Chuſh,</hi> and ſo inioyeth the bleſsing by being of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Cham</hi> ſhould be a ſeruant of ſeruants to <hi>Sems</hi> poſteritie.

of Zoan: How he led them in the day with a cloud, and all the night through with a pillar of fire. Hee claue the hard Rockes in the wilderneſse, and gaue them drinke thereof: hee brought waters out of the Stonie Rocke, ſo that it guſhed out like the Riuers. But they prouoked the most higheſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tempted God in their harts, ſaying, Shall God prepare a table in the wilderneſſe? He ſmote the ſtonie Rocke indeed, and the ſtreames flowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but can he giue bread alſo, or prouide fleſh for his people? wherewith the Lord was wroth, ſo hee rained downe Manna from heauen. So man did eate Angels food, for hee ſent them meat ynough. At their deſire, he brought quailes, and hee filled them with the bread of heauen, hee rayned fleſh vppon them as thicke as duſt, and feathered fowles as the ſands of the ſea, he let it fall amonge their tents, euen round about their habitation: ſo they did eat and were filled, for hee gaue them their owne deſire, they were not diſappointed of their luſt: but while the meat was in their mouths, the heauie wrath of God came vppon them, and ſlue the wealthieſt of them, and ſmote downe the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men that were in Iſrael. But for all this, they ſinned yet more. Againe,</hi> pſal. 106. <hi>They angred</hi> Moſes <hi>in their Tents, and</hi> Aaron <hi>the Saint of the Lord. So the earth ſwallowed vp</hi> Dathan, <hi>and couered the congregation of</hi> Abiram, <hi>and the fire was kindled in their companie, the flame burnt vp the vngodly. They made a Calfe in Horeb, and worſhipped the moulten Image. Thus they turned the glorie of God into the ſimilitude of a Calfe that eateth hay. So he ſayd, he would haue destroyed them, had not Moſes his choſen ſtand before him in the gappe, to turne away his wrathfull indignation; yea, they thought ſcorne of that pleaſant Land, and gaue no credence to his words, but murmured in their Tents, they ioyned themſelues with Baal Peor, and eat the offerings of the dead. Thus ſtill they prouoked God vnto anger with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and the plague was great amonge them. But Phinees ſtoode vp and prayed, and the plague ceaſed, and that was counted to him for righteouſneſse throughout all poſterities for euer. They angred him alſo at the waters of ſtrife,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Neuertheleſse, he thought vpon his couenant, and pitied them according to the multitude of his mercies, as appeareth, 2.</hi> Eſdr. 9, <hi>Thou cameſt downe vpon Sinay, and ſpakeſt to them from heauen, and gaueſt them right iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, true Lawes, good Commandements and Statutes, and declaredſt vnto them thy holy Sabbath, and commaundedſt them Precepts, Ordinances, and Lawes by the hand of Moſes thy ſeruant, and gaueſt them bread from heauen when they were hungry, and broughteſt forth water out of the Rocke for them when they were thirſtie, and promiſedſt them, that they ſhould goe in and take and poſseſſe the Land: but they were proude, and became obſtinate and heady: but God forgaue them, and was gracious and mercifull, patient, and of great goodneſse, and forſook them not, although they made a moulten Calfe, and ſaid,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4087:61"/>
Theſe are our Gods that brought vs out of the Land of Egipt, and did ſpeake blaſphemouſly, yet hee forſooke them not in the wilderneſſe according to his great mercie. Fortie yeares long made he prouiſion for them in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that they lacked nothing, their clothes waxed not old, and their feete ſwelled not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Fortie yeares of their being in the wilderneſſe, many things are to be vnderſtood. God choſe theſe Forty, that all the world might knowe of the Redemption by Chriſt. It ſtandeth of Foure Tens.</p>
            <p>This time is made more famous by the Storie, wherein a ſpeciall thing is to be obſerued: that in all theſe Forty yeres you haue but three yeares ſtorie and a halfe. And thus it is caſt: One yeare is ſpent in the Tabernacle, halfe a yeare after, the Spies are ſent to view the Land. Vpon their Storie God ſweares, that they ſhall not enter into his reſt. From thence you haue no Storie, till the two laſt yeares of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Ob,</hi> and of <hi>Maries</hi> death. This, one would not thinke of, if the bare Storie did not compell him. For compariſon with this three yeares and a halfe, I will ſpeake more hereafter.</p>
            <p>You haue in the wilderneſſe the Lambe, which repreſented Chriſt; and <hi>Manna,</hi> which Chriſt expounds in <hi>Ioh. 6. I am the true bread that came from heauen. Your Fathers did eat Manna, and are dead, hee that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this bread, ſhall liue for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rock, ſignified Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The lifting vp of the Serpent, his death; <hi>Balaam</hi> he prophecieth of Chriſt, <hi>There ſhall come a Starre from</hi> Iacob,<note place="margin">Numb. 24.</note>

            </p>
            <p>THe time was in the Moneth <hi>Abib,</hi> which Moneth containeth part of March, and part of Aprill. The Seuentie Interpreters call it <hi>Tanda,</hi> the Moneth of greene blades: for about this time of the yeare corne beginneth to ſhew it ſelfe aboue the ground. Their yeare before this began in September, anſwerable to the Creation, which prooueth the time of <hi>Adams</hi> creation to bee then. For this Moneth is the ſeuenth Moneth, but now commaunded to bee the firſt.</p>
            <p>The alteration of this old yeare, by commanding the keeping of a new yeare as a remembrance of their deliuerance out of Egypt, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainely the Redemption by Chriſt, whereof this deliuerance out of Egypt was a figure. And this teacheth vs further, that <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawes had not their end only in policy, but that their chiefe ſcope was Chriſt. The paſſeouer likewiſe made this plaine: for they were to chooſe the Lambe the Tenth day of the firſt Moneth; in which Moneth they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4087:62"/>
came out of Egypt, and on the Fourteenth day hee was to bee ſlaine. The Foure dayes reſpite betwixt the chooſing and the killing, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them, that the matter now to be perfourmed was verie weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore they were deepely to conſider it: for now was the action and ſumme of all ſaluation in handling.</p>
            <p>In the ſeuenth Moneth, and the firſt day of the moneth, they had the feaſt of blowing the Trumpets. The tenth day of the ſeuenth Moneth was the feaſt of offering Sacrifices, an holy conuocation to humble them to the Lord. The Fifteenth day the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or Cottages, to keepe in remembrance thereby the dwelling of the children of Iſrael in boothes in the wilderneſſe. The vſe of the Paſſeouer was, to aſſure them, that God would be their defence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after Foure hundred and thirtie yeares, they were brought out of Egypt, and that Chriſt their Paſſeouer was to be offered vp in fulneſſe of time. When Chriſt was crucified, this was perfected and finiſhed: hee was crucified at Eaſter.</p>
            <p>The Iewes thinke, that the world ſhall end at Eaſter: for then they came out of Egypt, and then was their yeare altered. And in the ſong of ſongs this is expreſſed, <hi>Behold, the winter is paſt, the voice of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is heard in the Mountaines, the figge-tree hath brought foorth her young figges, Come, my beloued, ariſe and come away my Loue, my faire one,</hi> Cant. 2. From this place they gather the end of the world. Chriſt in the Goſpell ſeemeth to allude to this in this ſort: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Figge-tree and all trees, when they now ſhoore foorth, yee ſeeing them, know of your owne ſelues, that ſummer is neere; ſo likewiſe when yee ſee theſe thinges come to paſſe, knowe that the Kingdome of God is neere.</hi> Luke 22.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the Bible contrary, or to confute this; And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is yet to come, it may verie well be ſo. Chriſt was anſwerable to theſe figures: for he died at Eaſter: &amp;, though before the Iewes would haue killed him, yet they could not lay handes on him, for his houre was not yet come. Hereby we are now occaſioned to returne to the Paſſeouer.</p>
            <p>The Paſcall was killed on a Fryday. <hi>Codomanus</hi> ſaith, that name ſignifieth a paſsing ouer, becauſe God that night paſsing ouer the Hebrewes, did kill the firſt borne in Egypt.</p>
            <p>This Paſcall was a Kidde, or a Lambe, figuring Chriſt the Lambe of God, which ſhould take away the ſinne of the world. <hi>Iohn 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ought to bee without blemiſh, becauſe that wee are redeemed from our vaine conuerſation giuen from our fathers, not with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things, gold or ſiluer, but with the precious blood of Chriſt the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4087:62"/>
Lambe vnblemiſhed, and vnſpotted, appointed from the beginning of the world, ſhewed in the laſt times. <hi>1. Pet. 1.18.</hi> No bone of the Lambe might bee broken. Becauſe of Chriſt no bone ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and when Chriſt was crucified, the theeues legges were broken, but into Chriſt his ſide a ſpeare was thruſt. <hi>Ioh 19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was eaten in the euening, at that time the promiſe was giuen to <hi>Abraham.</hi> At that time came the Iewes from <hi>Babell:</hi> at that time Chriſt celebrated his laſt Supper.</p>
            <p>It was eaten of the circumciſed onely: becauſe Chriſtians ſhould bee all circumciſed in heart, for they doe eat his fleſh, and drinke his blood.</p>
            <p>The loynes of the bodie ſhould bee girded, becauſe the loynes of our minds ſhould be gyrded, not ſetting our mindes vppon treaſure in <hi>Raamſees,</hi> where wormes corrupt and rage; but ſhould be as men looking for their Lord, when hee ſhall returne from the marriage.</p>
            <p>At that time for Seuen dayes they did eat vnleauened bread, as their mindes ſhould take heed of the ſower leauen of phariſey call doctrine. <hi>Mat. 16.</hi> for a little leauen ſowreth the whole lumpe of dowe. So we muſt <hi>remooue away the old leauen, that wee may become a newe lumpe, as wee are vnleauened.</hi> Therefore let vs keepe the old feaſt not with the old leauen of wickedneſſe and maliciouſneſſe, but with the vnleauened bread of ſinceritie and truth: for Chriſt our paſchall is offered for vs, <hi>1. Cor. 5.7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was to be killed, and his blood ſprinkled, and to bee eaten all ſaue the fat, and the kidneys. Thereby to teach vs, that the naturall man ſauoureth not the things which are of God. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds, <hi>Heb. 9. The blood of Chriſt purge your conſciences from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was eaten with bitter hearbs: to ſhew, that ſuch is the practiſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>The time of this was when the Moone was at the full, and in the Spring of the yeare. This time is the pleaſure of the whole yeare: ſo is Chriſt to thoſe, who haue grace to thinke on him aright.</p>
            <p>The agreement of all theſe, muſt needes make a Turke, a Chriſtian: for it is impoſsible, that either by the wit of man, or by chaunce, theſe things could haue ſo come to paſſe.</p>

            <p>NOw for the popes Tranſubſtantiation: beſides that it is repugnant to ſence, it cannot be ſpoken in Hebrew, and in Greeke onely by fayning and inuenting of new termes. <hi>Reall</hi> is no word, ſeeing it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends many things, as well as a bodie.

            <p>It is ſayd, that this commaundement of embracing Chriſt, is the firſt: for if this were not, the other were to ſmall purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now that the Iewes ſhould not be amazed at ſixe hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Lawes; ſeuen weekes betweene their comming out of Egypt, and the giuing of the Lawe, were allowed them for meditation.

Chriſt ſat with his Apoſtles after the manner of the wild Iriſh, on the ground. From this we may gather, that it is left to the circumſtance of time and place, and which fitteth beſt in diſcretion, the manners and comlineſſe of the Countrey. Therefore the beſt is, that which the common weale alloweth.</p>
            <p>Fiftie dayes after his aſcention, Chriſt ſendeth downe his ſpirit. And thereby maketh the preaching of the Goſpell, equall in maieſtie to the giuing of the Law. Concerning the day, no day is preſcribed, therefore the Church thought good to appoint the firſt Sabbath after the full moone.</p>
            <p>For Eaſter, mention is made of the Lords day in the <hi>20. Actes. 1. Cor. 16. in cap. 1.</hi>

               <p>In this firſt ſentence, you haue the Goſpell taught in theſe wordes, <hi>Thy God.</hi> For by this is vnderſtood the Redemption by Chriſt. For though God in reſpect that he is Creator, is God both of the wicked and the Godlie, yet he neuer calleth himſelfe, The God of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Hitherto is all the Lawe referred. For all the propheſies in Chriſt are <hi>Yea, and Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This entrance to the Law by the Goſpell, is exceeding neceſſarie. For ſeeing, if we behold the infinite maieſtie of God in our weakneſſe, there is no cauſe but of trembling and feare; it pleaſeth God in the face of <hi>Thy God</hi> the Redeemer, to ſhew himſelfe fauourable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, whereby we may approch with boldneſſe. Yet this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the preaching of the Goſpell in the Law, hath beene verie much doubted of, and hath beene thought erronious.</p>

The <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> ſay, that theſe lawes were giuen to man for the ſinne of the ſerpent: that is to ſay, not for vs to accompliſh, for wee cannot attaine thereto, but to ſhew vnto vs how farre the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that venome hath carried vs away from that duetie which God requireth of vs: which end of the lawe is greatly enlightned into vs by the comming of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> in that he teacheth vs that the Lawe is not ſatisfied with an outward and Phariſaicall obedience by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, but by the vncorrupt obedience of the heart, and by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of our diſobedience. And <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets commaunded circumciſion of heart, the offering of prayſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and to abſtaine from vnhallowing the Sabbath day with vnrighteouſneſſe: therefore the ſeruice which God requireth by the Law is ſpirituall, as the reward which wee ought to looke for is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <p>You are alſo to note, that there was ſeuen times ſeuen dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eating of the Lambe, before the giuing of the Law. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may know, that God careth not for ciuilitie without the knowledge of Chriſt: though the contrarie bee taught, that it is ynough, ſo wee bee ciuill in life, though our mindes neuer thinke of the eating of the Lambe. But if wee will liue godlie indeed, all our care muſt bee to eſteeme highlie of thoſe rules which concerne the teaching of the Redemption By Chriſt. For it is no commendation to liue ciuilly, though a ſinne to miſſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. And yet this honeſt behauiour amongſt all men, muſt not be neglected.</p>

               <p>God ſo ſpake, that a childe may vnderſtand it. For <hi>Adam</hi> fell in Paradiſe the ſixt day, and ſacrificed the ſeuenth: which is as much as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh heere. This is the conſent of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</p>

                  <hi>There is a Question.</hi> Whether <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in Egypt, and the Iewes in Babylon did keepe the Sabbath? For any thing that I can finde, they did it not publiquelie.

               <p>The Chaldee paraphraſt expounds it to be for the contempt of the Sabbath. <hi>Iob</hi> in his booke expounds this commaundement of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Father and Mother, by ſhewing how contumeliouſly thoſe did vſe him, whoſe Fathers he would not haue ſet with his dogges.

ſhall we eſcape if wee neglect ſo great ſaluation?</hi> It is eaſie to make triall hereof.

               </p>
               <p>And it was neceſſarie that Ieſus ſhould take vpon him the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo be made inferiour to the Angels by ſuffering death, that ſo hee might bring many Children to glorie, and through death deſtroy him that had the power of death, and by this victorie ouer the Deuill be crowned with glorie and honour, and haue all things put in ſubiection vnder his feet. And by theſe his ſufferings, hee was made like vnto his brethren, that hee might be mercifull, and a faithfull high Prieſt in things concerning God, that hee might make reconciliation for the ſinnes of the people. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a faithfull witneſſe hereof: and they that beleeued him not, but diſobeyed, were plagued in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe. Therefore while it is called to day, harden not your hearts, leaſt hee ſweare, They ſhall not enter into my reſt.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine was further made plaine by <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Annointed of the Lord, whoſe office was to offer for his owne ſins, and the ſinnes of his brethren.

               <p>Wee ſhall ſee this cleare by the Tabernacle: in the which wee are not to ſpeake of the particular Ceremonies, but of thoſe cheefely which as referred to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy was called the Sanctuarie of this world, wherein were the Candleſtickes, Table of ſhew-bread, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Holy of holyeſt did repreſent the ſtate of heauen, in which was the Arke of the Couenant of God. In which Arke there was reſerued as a memorie for all poſterities; a potte of Manna, <hi>Aarons</hi> Rodde that alwayes flouriſhed, and the Tables of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:4087:66"/>The Arke was couered, and the couering thereof was called the mercie-ſeat, which figured Chriſt who is our propiciatorie or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-ſeat to couer our iniquities. Ouer the mercie-ſeat, were the forme of two Angels, hauing relation to the Angels that kept the way to the tree of life: to ſhew, that none were worthie to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Holy of holieſt, but <hi>Aaron</hi> the annointed of the Lord, who likewiſe figured Chriſt both in name and office. For <hi>Aaron</hi> ſignifieth Chriſt, which in English is, <hi>Annointed:</hi> and in office, by entring once for all into the Holy of holieſt. For it was the office of the high Sacrificer, once euery yeere to enter into this Holy of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with blood. Of this <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſalme 40. When hee commeth into the world, hee ſaith, Sacrifice and burnt offering thou wouldest not haue, but a bodie haſt thou ordained. In the beginning of thy booke it is written, that I ſhould doe thy will O God. Then ſaid I, loe I come.</hi> Thus you ſee how the Redemption by Chriſt was taught by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two reſemblances of heauen and earth, are a glaſſe for vs to behold Gods glory in. The heauens, are the heauens of God; and the earth, a beeing for man.</p>
               <p>In which, there be Creatures cleane and vncleane: the cleane, to repreſent the godlie: the vncleane, the wicked of conuerſation. And this rule was generall from the creation, and figured in Paradiſe by the tree of Life, and the tree of knowledge of good and euill. And as trees, and all other Creatures differ one from another: ſo doe the manners of men. And God made Beaſts, Fiſh, and Fowle, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the affections of mens mindes, and gaue libertie to Beaſt, Fiſh, and Fowle, to eate vp one another: but to man he gaue a iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, and taught them a ciuile life by eating of cleane Beaſts, and forbiddeth groſſe behauiours in forbidding to eate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Beaſts, as Hogs, and Dogges, and Conies, and Hare, and Daw, and ſuch like: to ſhew, that wee ſhould not bee like Hogs to wallowe in the mire of our vncleane conuerſation; nor like to the Dogge, to returne to our former impieties; but bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with repentance, which is newneſſe of life: nor like to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whoſe nature is to vndermine, but to deale faithfully with our neighbours: that ſo our conuerſation may appeare before men, as wee may glorifie our Father which is in heauen: nor like the Dawe or Crowe, which peereth with his eyes, for wee ought not to bee curious in looking to other mens faults, but ſtriue to mend our owne, as our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth. 7. Thou that ſpieſt a moat in thy brothers eye, firſt pull out the beame out of thine owne</hi>; and ſo of all the reſt of vncleane Beaſts,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4087:66"/>
Fiſhes, and Fowles, ſomething in life is taught to be eſchewed, which to handle particularly were too long. For the lawfulneſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe of eating them now, there is no doubt: for they were onely appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawe, to diſtinguiſh the Iew and the Gentile: but Chriſt hauing broken downe the wall of ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee are nowe freelie to vſe any; onely the equitie of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the ſame lawe remaineth ſtill. For the Lawe of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
               <p>The cleane were ſuch as chewed the cud, and parted the hoofe, as Oxe, Sheepe, Goat, and Hart, and ſuch like: to teach vs, that wee ought alwaies to bee meditating of the wormanſhip of heauen and earth, and the Redemption by the ſonne of God: painefull in our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as Oxen; meek, as ſheep; hardie as Goats vnder the croſſe of Chriſt; and ſwift to good, and ſlow to euill; that our bodies might be a cleane Tabernacle, holy and vndefiled, fit for the Holy of holieſt to enter into. So ſhould wee be clothed with <hi>Aarons</hi> white garment of perfect iuſtice, and in our boſome reteine the precious Iewell of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mim,</hi> that is, Light of the knowledge of Chriſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of vertue, to embrace the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that the Law, and all the ceremonies thereof, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and all appurtenances thereof, <hi>Aarons</hi> office and his attire, are all to be applied to the Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wee are further to obſerue in the ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> on the mountaine ſawe the ſumme of all ſaluation. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this, is of ſpeciall conſequence in diuinitie. For if <hi>Moſes</hi> left out any point of Religion, then his doctrine is a maimed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and not ſufficient to eternall life. There be ſome teachers now a dayes like to the Church of Laodicea; who though ſhee was poore, yet thought and eſteemed her ſelfe rich: Euen ſo theſe men, for knowledge in expounding of Scriptures, when as they ſeuer the new Teſtament from the old, and doe not make the one a light vnto the other. For this is the onely difference betweene <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the newe Teſtament, That the newe Teſtament is an expoſition or comment vpon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth this plainely. <hi>2. Pet. 1.19. Wee haue the ſure worde of the Prophets, to the which giue heede as vnto Light ſhining in darkeneſſe till the day appeareth, and that the morning starre ſhineth in your hearts.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth this Doctrine, when hee giueth his hearers a commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Iohn 5.</hi> That they ſhould <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> to wit, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, becauſe they teſtifie of me, ſayth Chriſt, <hi>and in them you hope to haue eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Acts <hi>Chap. 26.</hi> layeth downe a rule how to try the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4087:67"/>
truth of his doctrine. For, ſaith he, <hi>I taught nothing but Moſes and the Prophets, that Christ ſhould die, and riſing from the dead, ſhould giue life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</hi> The truth of this rule will be manifeſted by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in this ſort. The Pope forbiddeth meats, where is this in <hi>Moſes?</hi> Indeed the ceremonie of <hi>Moſes</hi> made a diſtinction betweene Iew and Gentile, in reſpect of election: which diſtinction was to continue but a time: but now in Chriſt Ieſus, neither is circumciſion nor vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion any thing, and therefore all the Creatures of God are good, ſo they be receiued with thankeſgiuing. Therefore by this rule the Pope is a falſe Prophet, teaching a doctrine not in <hi>Moſes.</hi> This therefore is a ſound rule to trie all doctrines. Where are they taught in <hi>Moſes?</hi> So likewiſe if any Sciſme be bred, or breedeth in the Church, we ſhall by this rule be able to eſtabliſh our conſciences, if we examine it by <hi>Moſes</hi> doctrine. Now, ſeeing the new Teſtament referres it ſelfe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> wee ſhall neuer be able truelie and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expound it, but by being skilfull and readie in <hi>Moſes.</hi> Wee ſee <hi>Mathew</hi> makes mention of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and proues Chriſt to come of him. The vſe of this will bee of no force to vs, except wee ſearch <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtorie, and ſee there what glorious things are ſpoken of him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe proouing iuſtification to bee by faith without the workes of the Lawe, bringeth for an ineuitable argument, the manner how <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified. This argument will hardlie bee made plaine and certaine vnto vs, except we ſearch <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> actions. The ſame Apoſtle <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the excellencie and certaintie of faith, vſeth no other proofe, then a rehearſall of the actions and liues of particular men, <hi>Who by faith ſubdued kingdomes, ſtopped the mouthes of Lyons, quenched the furie of fire, deſpiſed the glory of this life, and beleeued in the ſon of God, &amp;c.</hi> By theſe reaſons it is euident that the new Teſtament is then made plaine, when it is referred to the old. Now, though the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhewes that he is come, and ſo the prophecie being fulfilled, there may ſeeme to be ſmall vſe of the old: yet we know that it is not ynough for vs to embrace a truth, but this one thing is further requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, an Abilitie to proue the truth againſt all gaineſayers, that ſo wee may be able to render a reaſon of that hope that is in vs. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a ſure ground, that in <hi>Moſes</hi> is the ſumme of all ſaluation. If you demaund by what words in <hi>Moſes</hi> it may be gathered, that hee ſawe the Reuelation: I anſwere, it is prophecied in <hi>Balaams</hi> prophecie, <hi>Num. 24. That Kittim ſhall afflict</hi> Heber, <hi>but he ſhall periſhin in the end.</hi> So there, vnder the terme of <hi>Kittim,</hi> the Italians afflicting the Church of God vnto the end of the world, are ſignified: So by this wee ſee the generalitie of this rule, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the ſumme of ſaluation: for he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4087:67"/>
ſaw the fall and reſtoring of <hi>Adam,</hi> the deſtruction of the world by the flood, how the families fell away in flowting <hi>Sem,</hi> and their curſe by their ſcattering, and the calling of the heathen. <hi>I will prouoke you by a fooliſh Nation, and by thoſe who are not my people.</hi> This ſentence out of <hi>Deut. 13.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cyteth <hi>Rom. 10.</hi> to prooue that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles likewiſe were elected, and ſhould bee called in the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Iewes, <hi>Moſes</hi> was had in ſuch reuerence, that they haue caſt all his ſentences into numbers; for whereas wee vſe figures, they vſe the Hebrew letters: and ſo exactly, that if any letter or vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell be either added or left out, they can preſently tell. Withall they are ſo perfect, that they will tell where their Prophets tooke from <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this obſeruation <hi>Sanctus Pagninus</hi> giueth a rule, that the truth of the Scriptures will neuer appeare in her right cleereneſſe, neither by the Latine tranſlation, nor by the expoſition of the Fathers: for the Latine it is not agreeable with the Hebrew. For the Fathers, becauſe the moſt of them are verie ignorant in the ſtorie, therfore many things they expound by allegories, which ſhould by ſtorie and euent be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted ſo to haue come to paſſe. As, where <hi>Iacob</hi> prophecying of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Gen. 49.</hi> deſcribeth the pleaſantneſſe and fertilitie of the ſoyle by theſe circumſtances, <hi>Hee ſhall waſh his garments in wine, and his mantle in the blood of grapes:</hi> The Fathers make an Allegorie of this, and apply it to the paſsion of Chriſt, but of what force is this expoſition againſt the Turke?</p>

               <head>Now followeth to be handled, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the Wilderneſſe.</head>
               <p>THere were two and fortie Standings in the Wilderneſſe. Wee muſt obſerue, that it is not lawfull to frame Allegories out of our own braine: for it is ynough for vs to embrace thoſe, which the ſcripture hath laide downe.</p>
               <p>We muſt further note, that the plaine expounding of a ſtorie, is no allegorie. And when we ſhall finde things diuers times repeated, we muſt know that it is done to this end, that we might the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our owne eſtate, and therefore they are directions vnto vs. This is prooued by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, where hee calleth theſe Standings in the Wilderneſſe, a ſtampe of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This may ſerue for an introduction into the treatiſe following. The text noteth, that where the cloude ſtood ſtill, there they pitched

their Tents. In the mention of theſe Standings in <hi>Numbers,</hi> there be ſome places rehearſed which are not repeated in the former deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, in <hi>Exodus.</hi> We may not gather from hence any contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but we muſt learne that thoſe places which are not repeated again, are ſome little Townes or Villages hard by, as well knowne as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as it were the verie ſame, and then it is free to vſe the one or the other.</p>
               <p>The Standings are Two and Fortie, for compariſon with theſe, you haue Two and Fortie bowles, knobs, and flowers in the Candleſticke of the Tabernacle.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that the numbers in the Scripture containe rare and excellent matters, euen the rudeſt of them. This opinion of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in this number of Two and Fortie will prooue true. For this Two and Fortie conſiſteth of ſixe Seuens, which number of Sixe, and of Seuen, keepeth in memorie the Creation. By this the Nations are compelled to admire the wiſedome of God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for they could not thinke that it came by chaunce, that there ſhould bee iuſt Two and Fortie Standings in the Wilderneſſe, and no more. <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth of God, <hi>O thou that doeſt order all my ſteps</hi>!

               <p>THe firſt Station was <hi>Rameſis,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Wormes.</hi> This is handled where we are admoniſhed not to lay vp our treaſure in this life, where wormes and ruſt conſume, but in heauen where theſe things annoy vs not.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This fauourable dealing of the Lord, <hi>Eſay</hi> applyeth vniuerſally to the Church, ſaying, <hi>The Lord will make vpon euery dwelling houſe of Mount Sion,</hi> that is, vpon all the aſſemblies of it, <hi>A Cloud for the day time; and a ſmoke, and brightneſſe, and a flame of fire for the night. Eſ. 44. Ap. 10. Chriſt,</hi> the mightie Angell, hath his feet in a pillar of fire.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>By faith they paſsed through the red Sea, as by drie land, which when the Egiptians aſſayed, they were drowned.</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>Our Fathers were all vnder the cloud, and all paſſed through the Red Sea, and were all baptiſed vnto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Sea.</hi> 1.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Marah,</hi> Which ſignifieth <hi>Bitterneſse.</hi> There they could find no waters to drinke, for the waters were bitter, therefore the place was called <hi>Marah,</hi> and they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Let vs not murmure, as ſome of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> 1.

               <p>The next is <hi>Elim, Grace.</hi> Where were Twelue Fountaines of waters, and Seuentie Palme trees. Thus we ſee that none can come to <hi>Elim, Grace,</hi> but firſt they muſt abide po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and goe through hard and bitter contentions and afflictions of this life. And yet then we are not in reſt: for the next Station we come to, is <hi>Sin,</hi> Thorny. There the people murmure againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> for meat. In the euening God fedde them with Quailes, and they came to the place of <hi>Sepulches,</hi> &amp; leaneneſſe entred into their ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the morning they were fed with Manna, to know that <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely,

but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Deut. 8. <hi>They did all eat of the ſame ſpirituall meat.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.</p>
               <p>This Manna was to be gathered as euerie man had need of it. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were reſerued till morning, it brought foorth wormes. <hi>Exod. 16.20.</hi> This, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth to the vſe of wealth. <hi>2. Cor. 8. Let it be of equality at this time, that your aboundance fulfill their want, that their aboundance may reach to your want, that there may bee an equalitie, as it is written, He that gathered much, had not ouer-much, and hee that gathered little, had not ouer-little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of theſe ſtandings is this, that the ſoyle being good and bad, ſheweth vs the manners of the men which liue on the earth, and with whome wee liue, at whoſe hands we muſt looke for badde dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more than for good. This Chriſt taught in the Goſpell, when hee willed, that thoſe who would embrace him, ſhould take vp his Croſſe and follow him. After they come to <hi>Rephidim,</hi> where was no water for the people to drinke, the people murmure againſt <hi>Moſes:</hi> the place is called <hi>Tentation,</hi> according to that of <hi>Dauid. Pſal. 95. Hebr. 3. To day if you will heare my voice, harden not your hearts, as is the prouocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderneſſe. &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> erecteth an Altar, and calleth it <hi>Iehouah, my Banner.</hi> Chriſt by death ouercame him that had the power of death, and wee haue an Altar, <hi>Ieſus Christ the righteous, Heb. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they come to <hi>Horeb,</hi> which had the ſoyle verie drie. But <hi>Sina,</hi> on the toppe a hole where the winde made a fearefull noyſe. But <hi>Sion</hi> was a pleaſant and fruitfull ſoyle, full of ſprings, to waſh away the blood of the beaſts that there were ſlaine. The Land of <hi>Chuſh</hi> alwaies in ſeruitude. So we, if wee looke onely to haue our liues ſauour of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie our ſoules not lightned with the knowledge by Chriſt, we ſhall bee continually in ſeruitude. And as theſe places come ſhort of the glorie of Ieruſalem: ſo the Iewes not thinking on Chriſt, haue their cogitations wandring, not finding reſt in their ſoules. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth theſe two Mountaines in this ſort, <hi>Galat. 4. By the which things, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is meant</hi>: ſaith he, <hi>for theſe two hils are two Teſtaments, the one Agar of Mount Sinay, which gendreth vnto bondage, being a Mountaine in Arabia, and it anſwereth to Ieruſalem which now is, and ſhee is in bondage with her children: but Ieruſalem which is aboue is free, the mother of vs all.</hi> The Perſians wonder at the ſtatelineſſe of Ieruſalem, being in glorie One Thouſand yeares. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth this time to Chriſt, the time of a childe vnder a Tutor. The Sonne is, <hi>Rom. 15. Whatſoeuer is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4087:69"/>
is written for our learning, that wee through patience might haue hope.</hi> Now ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Theſe things are our examples, to the end wee ſhould not luſt after euill things, as ſome of them luſted, and fell in one day three and twentie Thouſand.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.</p>
               <p>In this place <hi>Sinay,</hi> where the Lawe was giuen, many things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The Law was giuen, that ſinne might be knowne to abound.</p>

               <p>There is one Mediator of God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus, the Mediator of the new Teſtament. <hi>Heb. 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was giuen on the Lords day, in the morning, the Lord ariſing and ſhining from <hi>Pharan,</hi> with Thouſands of his Angels, with thunder, lightnings, and earth-quake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> erecteth an Altar on Twelue pillars, and hauing made a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, doth read the Booke of the couenant, and taking the blood of Oxen and Buls, with water, purple wooll, and <hi>Iſope,</hi> doth ſprinkle the Booke, ſaying, <hi>This is the blood of the Couenant which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for you.</hi> This is handled in the 9. to the Hebrewes: <hi>If the blood of Oxen and Bulles doth ſanctifie to cleaneneſſe of the fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Christ cleanſe our conſcience from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing Lord?</hi>

               <p>The people turne the glorie of God into the ſimilitude of a Calfe that eateth hay. <hi>Exod. 32.6.</hi>

               <p>Be not Idolatrers, as ſome of them were, as it is written, <hi>The people ſat downe to eat and drinke, and roſe vp to play.</hi> 1. Cor. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> breaketh the two Tables which hee receiued from God, written with the finger of God.</p>
               <p>The Leuites kill three thouſand of Iſrael that had committed Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. They regarded not Father, mother, brethren, or ſiſters.

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> goeth vp againe to the Mountaine with two Tables prepared of himſelfe, continueth Fortie dayes faſting, writeth the words of the former tables in theſe. This <hi>Paul</hi> handleth, 2. Cor. 3. <hi>Yee are the Epistle of Chriſt miniſtred of vs, written not with inkes, but with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, not in Tables of ſtone, but in the Tables of hearts of fleſh.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond yeare after their comming from Egypt, the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is erected, out of which the Lord ſpeaketh in a more manifeſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort, than at any time before he had done, to ſhew himſelfe in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſort mercifull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:4087:70"/>Chriſt his humane nature is the Tabernacle. <hi>The word became fleſh, and had his Tabernacle amonge vs,</hi> Ioh. 1. <hi>In him all fulneſſe dwelled bodily.</hi> Col.4. <hi>By grace all Christians are a Tabernacle.</hi> Eſ. 10. Ap. 21.</p>
               <p>A cloude ouer-ſhadowed the Tabernacle. To the Virgine <hi>Marie Gabriel</hi> ſaith, Luk. 1. <hi>The power of the highest ſhall ouer-ſhadow thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> could not enter into the tabernacle of teſtimonie, becauſe the cloude abode therevpon, and the glorie of the Lord filled the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.

               <p>After this the children of Iſrael come to <hi>Kadesbarnes.</hi> Then there are Spies ſent out to view the Land: they are Fortie daies in viewing it. They bring word, and tell ſtrange things of the goodnes and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Land, but they diſcourage the people, and feare them: for they told them of huge and great Giants the Sonnes of <hi>Anak Ioſua</hi> he anſwereth them, Let vs goe vp and poſſeſſe the Land. For if God ſhall be mercifull vnto vs, he will giue vs the Land flowing with milke and honie. Vpon this God ſweares, that they ſhall not enter into his reſt. They were for this Forty yeres in the Wildernes, Forty daies in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land. S. <hi>Paul</hi> repeateth this in the <hi>Acts 13. God ſuffered their manners in the Wilderneſſe</hi>; they wandred, to puniſh the hardneſſe of their hearts for not beleeuing. They went vp and downe, that all the world might woonder at this dealing of God, and thereby learne to feare him: for euerie ſinne fitteth the prouidence of God, and ſerues for his glorie. By this all the world might learne diuinitie. For it is ſayd of them that their ſound was heard to the end of the world. So that a man of England meeting with one that had beene about thoſe parts, might enquire, When doe thoſe people leaue their wandring? They were brought out of Egypt ſtrangely: for the ſea parted, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to goe through, and was a wall to them, but drowned the Egyptians which followed after.</p>

               <p>IT hath his name from <hi>Iobal,</hi> a Horne, becauſe in the beginning of the Feaſt, trumpets of Rammes hornes were to bee blowne, and thereby the yeare was proclaimed. It was the Fiftieth yeare after the ſetling the people in the Land, as <hi>Leuit. 25. You ſhall reckon to you ſeuen Seuens of yeares, and the Fiftieth ſhall be a yeare of Iubilee, &amp;c.</hi> And it was to be kept ſolemnely vntill the death of Chriſt. The cauſe of keeping it was, to put them in minde of the great victories which God had giuen them ouer their enemies in the Land of Canaan: ſo that by this ceremonie likewiſe, the Redemption by the conqueſt of Chriſt ouer our ſpirituall enemie, which the yeare of Iubilee ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was alſo proclaymed. For if they conſidered the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning this Land, and their deliuerance out of Egypt being in bondage, and how they were placed in the Land by Ieſus their Captaine; the death of Chriſt, which deliuered them from the ſnares and bondage of the Deuill, muſt needes bee made plaine vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iobal</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Ioyfull.</hi> In it, all Lands that were bought of any of the Tribes, was to returne to the old Poſſeſſor; then all priſoners were ſet at libertie. Figuring, that ioyfull yeare of the Lord, wherein we ſhould be freed from the bondage of Satan, wherof <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>He ſhall heale the broken heart, and bring the gladſome tidings of the Lord: Iuſtice ſhal be the girdle of his loynes, and faithfulneſse the girdle of his reynes: then the Woolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lye with the Kidde, and the Calfe, and the Lion, and the fatte beast, and a little Chila ſhall lead them, the ſucking Child ſhall play vppon the hole of the Aſpe, and the wayned Child ſhall lay his hand vppon the Cockatrice hole: then ſhall none hurt, nor destroy in the mountaine of mine holyneſſe: for the earth ſhall bee full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters that couer the Sea.</hi> Eſ. 11. The meaning is, that the prophane beaſts of the world, which nowe know not Chriſt, ſhall in this ioyfull yere be lightned with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his glorie, and ſhall reioyce and be glad for ſo great ſaluation, and ſhall be members of one head Chriſt Ieſus, louing one another as Chriſtians, whoſe ioy is expreſſed verie largely, in the 35. of <hi>Eſay.

Wherein wee may behold the wonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for them, ſo long as they kept his Sabbaths: for the Nine and fortieth yeare did yeeld corne for three yeares. No doubt, this muſt needs make the Nations aſtoniſhed, to ſee that the Children of Iſrael had ſuch a God, as could in one yeare giue them corne for three yeares, ſo that they ſhould neither ſowe nor reape, when themſelues had ſcarce corne with great labour for one yeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amos</hi> in his prophecie findeth great fault with thoſe which hoard vp corne, and pronounceth a woe vnto them for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But wee are to vnderſtand, that when the Iſraelites neglected their Sabbaths, and forgot the great benefites they had receiued, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Idolatrers, and polluted with the abhominations of the land into which they came; their ioy was turned into ſadneſſe, and their Iubilees vnto their deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in the ſeuenteenth Iubilee, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deſpiſed the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, they haue <hi>Sedechias</hi> a moſt wicked King ſet ouer them, and in <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> time, they are carried quite away into Babylon, and there are as dead bones for Seuentie yeares, vntill the land had payd her owne Sabbaths, which they had omitted when they dwelt vpon it. Therefore wee are to note, that wee ſhall neuer keepe our religion eaſie and plaine, but by caſting the Iubilees right, which we muſt caſt to end iuſt with the death of Chriſt, or elſe howe doth Chriſt according to <hi>Daniel</hi> the 9. end the ceremonie &amp; oblation? and the wiſedom of God hath taken ſuch order, that where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemeth to leaue off to reckon, there the heathen keepe a iuſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nothing at all croſsing <hi>Daniels</hi> Seuens.</p>
               <p>For the Iubilee which the Iewes and Romanes obſerue, there is no colour of Religion in it, nor warrant in <hi>Moſes</hi> for them. Therefore we leaue them to obloquie, as not worth the handling, amongſt the reſt of their groſſe errours which they againſt Scripture fooliſhly maintaine.</p>

Therefore they cryed vnto the Lord; and when they cryed, the Lord ſent a Prophet vnto them, who ſayd vnto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I haue brought you vp from Egipt, and haue brought you out of the houſe of bondage, and I ſaid vnto you, feare not the Gods of the Amorites in whoſe land you dwell: but you haue not obeyed my voice. And <hi>Gedeon</hi> of the Tribe of Ephraim, was threſhing of wheat to hide it from the Madianites. Then the Angell of the Lord appeared vnto him, and ſayd, The Lord is with thee thou valiant man.

               <p>The multitude of the Madianites, and the Amalekites, and all they of the Eaſt, lay in the valley like Graſhoppers, and there Camels were without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the ſand by the ſea-ſhore. <hi>But</hi> Gedeon <hi>with three Hundred deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Madianites, To ſhew, that victorie conſiſteth not in ſtrength of men, or multitude of Camels, but in God who giueth the Victorie. For</hi> at the ſounding of <hi>Gedeons</hi> Trumpet the enemies ranne, and cryed, and fledde, and the Lord cauſed them to kil one another.

Wherefore the Lord God of Iſrael ſayth: Behold, the dayes come that I will cut off thine arme, and the arme of thy Fathers houſe, that there ſhall not bee an old man in thy houſe, ſhall be a ſigne vnto thee, that thy Sonnes die both: for them that honour me, I will honour, and they that deſpiſe mee ſhall bee deſpiſed. <hi>1.

For rebellion is as the ſinne of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and tranſgreſsion is wickedneſſe and idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord was taken from the hoſt of Iſrael by the Philiſtines, and Iſrael was ſmitten down, and there was a great ſlaughter, for there fell of Iſrael thirtie Thouſand footmen, and <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> died.</p>

               <p>So the Arke of the Lord was in the Countrey of the Philiſtines Seuen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. But the Lord plagued them all the time, that they kept it.

               <p>This <hi>Samuel</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> anſwereable for rareneſſe to <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> birth was verie ſtrange, his Mother being an hundred and thirtie yeares: ſo the Hebrewes caſt her age. This they cannot prooue exactly: but yet ſhe muſt be verie old, becauſe ſhe was ſiſter to <hi>Moſes</hi> Grandfather: ſo <hi>Samuels</hi> mother verie old. The ſtrangeneſſe of their birth, muſt needs cauſe thoſe which liued with them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great thinges of them, and diligently to obſerue their actions. Here is yet the difference betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel. Moſes</hi> had ſome notable of his Aunceſtors, which were not touched with any notable blemiſh. <hi>Samuel</hi> is of <hi>Chore,</hi> which familie is moſt wicked. And here is a great matter to be conſidered. <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Samuels</hi> Sonnes are of one age, and yet from <hi>Leui</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> you haue Seuenteene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: and his Sonnes make one generation, which maketh Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Generations: But in the Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> you haue but fiue Generations, that is to ſay, <hi>Salmon, Booz, Obed, Ieſsai,</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> There is mention made in the Pſalmes of Ten pſalmes of the Sonnes of <hi>Chore</hi>: they be all pſalmes of comfort, but the Eightie and Foure pſalme is a ſpeciall one: for there he ſheweth, how God hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto the Land, becauſe hee brought againe the captiuitie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when in mercie hee forgaue their ſinnes. And this mercie will he alwayes ſhew to them that feare him, and then the Lord ſhall dwell in their Land. For mercie and truth ſhall meete righteouſneſſe and peace, becauſe truth ſhall budde out of the earth, and then righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall looke downe from heauen. In the 87. <hi>Pſal.</hi> thus they ſpeake: <hi>The Lord loueth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of</hi> Iacob: for in it the Temple was built, <hi>I will thinke vpon</hi> Rahab <hi>and</hi> Babell. <hi>Behold yee Philiſtines, and they of Tyre with the Morians, loe there was hee borne.</hi> The meaning of this laſt ſentence, is thus much: The Lord will write this man &amp; that man born in <hi>Salem</hi> by regeneration; where in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Dathan, Chore</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth, that the Sonnes of <hi>Chore</hi> did not periſh; Wee
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:4087:82"/>
muſt expound this as a Prophecie, and referre it to the preſent time. For he as a Prophet ſaw, that ſome of them ſhould be godly; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance whereof appeareth in theſe daies. Hereby we may learne, that diuers wicked Fathers may haue children inheritors of ſaluation. And the heathen were not hindred for being called, becauſe of the ignorance of their Fathers, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth in the <hi>Acts.</hi> This is a Meditation of great comfort, if it be applyed to euerie ones conſcience.</p>

Wilt thou alwaies remember iuſtice? God therefore to comfort them giueth them a conqueſt ouer the Hagarims, by the ſlaughter of whom they enrich themſelues. <hi>Aſer</hi> likewiſe might mourne, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with God, why he neuer looked on them in mercie? God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giueth them this comfort: <hi>Anna,</hi> that is, <hi>Grace,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Panuel, See God,</hi> of the happie Tribe of <hi>Aſer,</hi> prophecieth at the birth of Chriſt. And ſurely if we ſincerely embrace Chriſt Ieſus, wee ſhall haue the ſpirite of grace, to ſhew vs the loue of God layd vp in Chriſt, that thereby we may enioy all happines: by this you may ſee the tribe of <hi>Aſer</hi> had a great bleſsing.</p>

               <head>Now for his Faults.</head>
               <p>HIs fault was, in that he diſobeyed the commandement of God inſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and reſeruing the beſt of the ſpoyle vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And in that he was enuious againſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> and though he ſpeaketh good things of him, and knewe he ſhould ſucceed him in the Kingdome, yet hee perſecuteth him. This is to runne headlong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of Gods truth. So the Deuill tempted Chriſt, though he knew thereby he encreaſed his damnation. <hi>Sauls</hi> puniſhment was verie great: for he is ſlaine at Eaſter by himſelfe, then vndertaking battailes when he ſhould haue celebrated the Lords feaſts. That it was at Eaſter, it may be gathered by the Witch preparing him vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Saul,</hi> loued <hi>Dauid</hi> as his ſoule; therefore it may be concluded, he was ſaued: for hee loued <hi>Dauid</hi> the beloued of the Lord, and therefore beleeued in Chriſt of whome <hi>Dauid</hi> was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. This may be prooued by the new Teſtament: for in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes, Chap. 11.</hi> the Battailes of <hi>Gedeon, Baracke, Sampſon,</hi> and of others are rehearſed, of whome this is added, <hi>that they all by faith ſubdued Kingdomes, and receiued the promiſe</hi>: and in theſe <hi>Ionathan</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. This teſtimonie of the holy ſpirite is of no ſmall glorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul goeth to a Witch called</hi> Ob, which had a Hobgoblin. Herein he ſinned greatly againſt the gouernment of God layd downe in <hi>Moſes.</hi> The hid things for God, thoſe reuealed for you and your children to doe them. He fell to this wickedneſſe, becauſe hee killed thoſe which ware the Ephod, and therefore God anſwered him not by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> God ſuffereth him to take reuenge of himſelfe: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, hee was the higheſt Magiſtrate, and not to be put to death by his inferiours. His poſteritie was likewiſe plagued, becauſe they kept not the Couenant with the Gibeonites, which <hi>Ioſua</hi> had made.</p>

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> raigneth Forty yeres; Seuen yeares and a halfe in Hebron, and Thirtie two yeares and a halfe in Ieruſalem.</head>
               <p>HErein is a compariſon with Chriſt: for as <hi>Dauid</hi> was King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed at Eaſter ouer <hi>Iuda:</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his reſurrection at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was prooued King ouer the whole world. <hi>Dauid</hi> after the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> asketh God whether hee ſhall goe? God anſwereth, <hi>To He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron.</hi> This is not without ſpeciall obſeruation, that God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him to goe thether. The monuments of places are of great force to bring Stories into remembrance. For in Hebron <hi>Sara</hi> was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, being the firſt purchaſe which <hi>Abraham</hi> made. <hi>Iſaacke</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becka</hi> were buried there: <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> there: there <hi>Caleb</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his inheritance. So that <hi>Dauid</hi> being King there, is ioyned in a kind of purchaſe with theſe Fathers, and their glorie herein matched. So the Hebrewes apply it. Hebron is called <hi>Conſociation.</hi> The Seuen yeares King, is a compariſon with the Seuen yeares of conquering the Land: ſo that looke what glorie is reaped in the conqueſt thereof, the ſame you may gather in the time of <hi>Dauids</hi> gouernement in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron. Further it was requiſite there ſhould be proofe of the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his gouernment by gouerning Hebron, before hee ſhould rule ſo ſtately a kingdome as Ieruſalem was.</p>
               <p>His Two and thirtie yeares, and ſixe Moneths, haue a compariſon with Chriſts liuing on earth. He began his gouernment there exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One thouſand yeares before Chriſt was baptized, at the verie ſame time that Chriſt began: ſo you ſee all Gods dealings caſt in a fine and ſweet proportion.</p>

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> commeth of <hi>Ieſſai,</hi> in this reſpect Chriſt is called the roote of <hi>Ieſſai.</hi> The ages of <hi>Dauids</hi> Aunceſtors calleth in minde <hi>Abrahams</hi> yeares at the birth of <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> and ſo remembreth his Storie. About Seuen yeares before he was King, he fights with <hi>Goliah</hi> the Philiſtine, who came of <hi>Mitzraijm,</hi> which filled Egypt the curſed Nation of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4087:85"/>
                  <hi>Cham. Dauid</hi> is hereunto encouraged by a miracle, being made Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ouer a Lion and a Beare, and thereupon hee concludeth: <hi>This vncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them. Goliah</hi> challengeth all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and defieth them. <hi>Dauid</hi> truſting in the ſtrength of the Lord, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, onely with ſtones in his bagge, and his ſling, ſlayeth the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine. He was about this time Three and Twentie yeares old.</p>
               <p>This is the vſe; Looke what this <hi>Goliah,</hi> and the Philiſtines were to the ſtate of Iſrael: ſo is the Deuill and his Angels to the children of God. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> the beloued, by truſting in the beloued Sonne of God, ouercame; ſo ſhall we, if we beleeue as he did, putting on the armor of God. The ſumme in regard of the Iewes, is this: that as he, being of Iuda, ſubdued this Philiſtine; ſo likewiſe in all other battailes they ſhould couragiouſly follow him, ſeeing he of Iuda ſhould come after the fleſh, which fought for them from heauen.</p>
               <p>

Here wee haue the like compariſon of the Fortie yeares in the Wilderneſſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> referred all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the building of the Temple. And if we will truly be beloued, all our actions muſt haue this end, to aduance the glorie of God in his Temple. <hi>Dauid</hi> had many enemies: ſo that the <hi>18.

               </p>
               <p>The conſideration of this, is of great vſe to euerie godly man in his priuate life.

               <p>This is no warrant for the vſe of them nowe, ſeeing Ceremonies ceaſe. Concerning the eccleſiaſticall diſcipline amongſt the Iewes, we ſhall ſee, that <hi>Dauid</hi> durſt not aduenture to appoint the Sacrificers, whoſe turne ſhould be firſt, or ſecond; but they caſt lots for it, for as he was Prince &amp; ruler ouer the people, ſo they were al Princes of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, and therein equall with him. When the Leuites tooke vpon them to be Kings, they became Saduces, and <hi>Malachi</hi> calleth this time the time of the curſe. <hi>Rabbi, Leui, Ben, Gerſon</hi> ſheweth, that though the Leuites had notable victories againſt the <hi>Antiochi,</hi> yet they all died of violent deaths, becauſe they tooke the glorie from Iuda, therefore God would not hold them vnpuniſhed.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4087:88"/>
and warrant of God: the inſtrumentall cauſe is <hi>Dauid</hi>: he putteth it not in practiſe, becauſe hee was a man much buſied in warres. It was begunne to be built in the Fourth yeare of the raigne of <hi>Salomon.</hi> The Cedars for it were had from <hi>Libanon,</hi> where <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was built.</p>
               <p>In the vnderſtanding of the Temple, and the particulars thereof, conſiſteth the whole ſumme of Religion.</p>
               <p>It had Sixe Courts, and euerie Court of ſeuerall vſe, before you came to the holy of holyeſt: and euerie Court were Twelue ſteppes one aboue another. The vſe of which is, that it is no eaſie ſtudie to attaine to the depth of the knowledge of God, neither can a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it at the firſt as hee will, but he muſt aſcend by degrees. So were the windowes, narrowe without, and wide within: to ſhewe, that they which once had obtained the knowledge of Chriſt, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it with a liuely faith, doe behold his graces in a full clearer ſort, than thoſe which are without.</p>
               <p>For the Courts, they were thus diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Within the vtmoſt rayles the heathen and prophane people might ſtand, to ſee and heare: and as they were like beaſts in knowledge, ſo their place was next to the beaſts of the field.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Court, the women ſtood.</p>
               <p>In the third Court, the Common people.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Court, the King did heare the Law read.</p>
               <p>In the fift, were the Sacrifices burnt vppon the braſen Altar.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt, was the golden Altar, and the Table of Shew-bread.</p>
               <p>In the Seuenth, was the holy of holyeſt, where was the Arke of the Couenant of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and within it the two tables of Teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Into it onely might enter the high Sacrificer, and that he might doe but once a yeare: figuring Chriſt the high Sacrificer, which once for all ſhould enter into the holy of holyeſt, to make interceſsion for all the world.</p>
               <p>Betweene the holy, and the holy of holyeſt, there was a vaile of blew ſilke, purple, crimſon, and fine linnen, and Cherubines wrought thereon. This vaile repreſented the bodie of Chriſt, and ſhewed that none could come to the Father, but by the Sonne; and none come vnto the Sonne, except the Father draw him. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, this vaile did teare from the toppe to the bottome, and ſhewed that by his ſuffering of death, all men then were Kings and Sacrificers, and might by their owne prayers grounded on knowledge and the feare of God, obtaine forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The dores, pillars, and ſeeling of the Temple, were couered with gold: reſembling the golden ſpirite of prophecie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:4087:88"/>And when the Temple was built, the ſtones were ſo ſquared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought, that there was neither hammer, axe, or any toole of yron heard in the Temple while it was in building: To teach the Iſraelites, that they ought to liue in peace, loue, and vnity one with another, without iarring or contention, if they would haue the vſe of Gods holy Temple. For, ſaith God, <hi>My houſe is a houſe of prayer.</hi>

               <p>There be that thinke he was twentie yeares old when hee tooke vpon him to ſucceed in the Kingdome: and they caſt his yeares to be foure and Fortie when hee fell to Idolatrie. They reckon it thus: He is twentie yeares old when he is King: Foure yeres after he builds the Temple: hee is Seuen yeares in building: thirteene yeares after, he builds his owne houſe.</p>
               <p>Vpon this his Idolatrie there hath been a great doubt, whether he was ſaued, or not. It is without queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was ſaued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet it was not without ſinguler reaſon, that the holy Ghoſt left it doubtfull: for if it had been eaſie for him to bee ſaued, hee had been an example of great impietie.

               <p>This cannot bee meant of ſucceſsion in the kingdome: for what comfort had it beene to him, to haue enioyed the Kingdome, and afterwardes to haue enioyed damnation? therefore it muſt needs bee meant of his eſtate after this life.

But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the meaning, that allowing his Concubines to worſhip them, ſeeing done by his commaundement, it was as his act: and this will I hold, till I be better inſtructed.

               <head>Now concerning his felicitie.</head>
               <p>THere is no one thing ſetteth it forth more, than the Booke of the Preacher: which Booke was made in his age, and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: yet in that he ſpeaketh coldly of repentance. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is but vanities,</hi> ſaith the Preacher. This is the ſumme of the Booke. It is amplified by the generall ſtate of all things, then by the particular. The generall thus.</p>
               <p>The earth ſtandeth, yet one Generation paſſeth, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſo there is nothing conſtant. If we conſider thinges paſt, they are the ſame which ſhall be, all things haue a time. And the Perſians called wiſe men the ſearchers of time. <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth vs to pray to God to teach vs to number our dayes, that wee may apply our hearts to wiſedome. In all this there is nothing but for a man to bee merrie in his labor. Let vs behold the Sunne, it riſeth and ſetteth, and returnes againe to his place, and there riſing, goeth towards the South, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth towards the North: he neuer continueth in one place, he cauſeth Winter and Summer, Spring time and Harueſt; the Riuers runne all into the ſea, and they ouer-flowe againe into the ſea. Of all theſe, this is the ſumme, that all things vnder the Sunne are vanitie, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſpirite: Euen ſo is the ſtate of man. This likewiſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſheweth: for there is nothing new vnder the Sunne, either for good or badde. Euen the fineſt inuentions haue been before: but we count them new, becauſe the generation that knew them, is paſt, and ſo forgotten. So that by this wee may ſee no happpineſſe vnder the Sunne, but all is vanitie.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the generall.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Now follow the particulars.</head>
               <p>FIrſt as concerning men, and they are in two ſorts. The firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the beſt men: then men of corrupt conuerſation. I therefore,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4087:89"/>
ſaith the Preacher, I meant to trie pleaſure alone, and wiſedome alone, and then both together.</p>
               <p>Concerning wiſedome, I talked with the beſt Schollers: I knew all the plants, from the loweſt ſhrubbe, to the talleſt Cedar in Libanon, and their vſe in cleanſing the leaproſie, and how thereby Chriſt was ſignified. Yet this knowledge did not ouer-reach <hi>Moſes.</hi> The nature of the fowles was familiar vnto me. If it bee asked how hee came by this knowledge, it may be anſwered; partly by education, and partly by an immediate inſpiration from God: and yet of all, this is the end, Much reading is a wearineſſe of the fleſh, and there is no end of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many bookes. So wiſe men are neuer quiet, becauſe they ſee ſo few ſaued: for crooked things ſhall not bee made ſtreight: from this I went ſaith the Preacher, and tryed pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goe to now, I will prooue thee with ioy, and with pleaſant things, and yet this is a vanitie. Of laughter this I ſayd, that it was madneſſe: and of ioy What is that thou doeſt?</hi> Wee may ſee hee neuer diſputes of theſe things, but ſpeakes ſhort: for the heathen by the light of nature knew thus much <hi>I went yet further,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, <hi>and ioyned pleaſure and wiſedome together. For I made great workes: I built houſes, ſet Gardens, planted vineyardes, and trees of all ſorts. I got ſeruants and maides, and had children borne in the houſe. I had great poſſeſsion of Beeues and Sheepe: and to conclude, I was great, and encreaſed aboue all that were before mee in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. When I beganne to looke on all theſe thinges, I beheld nothing but vanitie and vexation of ſpirit, and that there was no profite vnder the Sunne. Beſides, when I looked who ſhould after mee poſſeſſe theſe, and thought with my ſelfe. What?</hi> Roboam <hi>the foole? and then I hated all the labor wherein I had trauailed vnder the Sunne, ſeeing no man knoweth whether he ſhall be wiſe or fooliſh, which ſhall be ruler ouer my workes, and wherein I haue ſhewed my ſelfe wiſe: this is alſo a vanitie.</hi> Therefore we ſee, <hi>to all things an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time. A time to be borne, and a time to die; a time to loue, and a time to hate; a time of warre, and a time of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God turneth the wheele of our life, to the end, that we ſhould not ſet our affections on theſe earthly vanities, but being riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue. Now that all hope of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in theſe tranſitory things might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, he reproues it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne perſon. For if he, being a king, and the greateſt in Iſrael, and ſuch a one, as <hi>Who is the man that will come after the King in things which hee now hath done?</hi> and yet could not finde wherein to free his heart from vexation and diſquietneſſe; ſhall any other thinke to finde quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſecuritie in this life? therefore of all theſe experiences, thus he concludeth, <hi>There is no profite to a man, ſeeing all his dayes are ſorrow, and his trauaile griefe, that hee eate and drinke, and delight his ſoule
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4087:90"/>
with the profite of his labours, becauſe this is of the hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning actions; they are either without a man, or within him. Without, the moſt excellent is Iuſtice: and how is that executed? <hi>I heard the cries of the innocent, and no man comforting them, and ſawe their oppreſsion, and no man reſiſting it; therefore I counted thoſe which are dead, better than thoſe which are aliue: and yet happier that neuer was. I haue ſeen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a wealthy foole greedie after riches, and yet tooke no fruit of them, and this is a great vanitie. I ſaw another in a kingdom, and the hearts of the people alienated from him. I ſaw another who hath gotten wealth iuſtly, and yet his heire ſhall not inherite it, but a ſtranger ſhall deuoure his ſubſtance, this is alſo a vanitie, and a great miſerie. Now ſeeing that preſent puniſhment fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not vpon the wicked for their ſins, therfore without feare they goe on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without regard of wickednes: for they are ſomtimes rewarded, as though their actions had been godly. But this is the ſumme: No man can know by the outward things in life, whether he be in the fauor and loue of God, or in the hatred of his Creator.</hi> The Pope expounds this of doubtfulneſſe in faith. This ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the meaning: for <hi>Salomon</hi> diſputes only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward actions, what a ſtranger may iudge: not what he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may aſſure himſelfe. This is the concluſion, <hi>As to the good, ſo to the ſinner it hapneth; as to the periured, ſo to him that ſaith true; their end is both a like. Yet here is the difference, that wiſedome and fooliſhneſse differ as light and darkeneſſe.</hi> Now then ſeeing nothing accords to vertue, fooles tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelues, euen as <hi>a dead flye marreth the Apothecaries oyntment.</hi> We muſt <hi>caſt our bread vpon the waters,</hi> doe good, though the caſe bee deſperate: for looke <hi>in what place the tree fals, there it lyes.</hi> The ſumme is, <hi>One generation paſseth, another commeth: and though one liue a Thouſand yeares, and hath reioyced in all the workes of his hands, he muſt remember the dayes of darkeneſſe, and that all that is paſt, is vanitie.</hi> Therefore ô young man, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the time of thy youth, before thy time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come: and before thy old age full of ſorow, in which thou ſhalt ſay, thou haſt no pleaſure, before the Sunne, Moone, and Starres ſeeme to the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thy hands the keepers of thy houſe doe tremble, and thy legges thy ſtronge men faile vnder thee, and thy teeth being few waxe idle, and thy eyes dimme, and thou riſe at the voice of a bird, &amp; a Graſhopper through thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, be a burthen vnto thee.

               <p>THe Iewes had it in ſuch reuerence and account, that afore thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of age none of them would ſtudie it. It is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, that all the particulars which the Booke containes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from marriage, and handled ſo ſincerely, no blemiſh or ſpot can be found therein. The meaning and ſumme thereof, is thus much; That as in mariage we are ioyned one to the other, &amp; haue ſeparated our ſelues from all other; ſo in our ſpirituall coniunction in the Church with Chriſt, we haue ſworne to deteſt Idolatry, &amp; to ſerue and worſhip the true and liuing God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſ. <hi>Cap. 5.</hi> expounds this: <hi>Husbands, loue your wiues as Chriſt loued the Church and gaue himſelf for it, that he might make vnto himſelfe a glorious Church, not hauing ſpot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle; ſo men ought to loue their wiues, euen as the Lord doth his church: for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father and mother, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great ſecret; but I ſpeak of Chriſt and his Church.</hi> Thus you ſee how S. <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth and maketh plaine the one by the other; ſo doth <hi>Salomon</hi> in this Booke. The hardnes of this booke is in this, that he taketh the beſt things in the courſe of nature, &amp; applies them to religion: this could not be done by the wit of man. All this is done, to expreſſe the vertues of Chriſt to his church. <hi>I am black, but faire, as the daughters of Ieruſalem, as the Tabernacles of Kedar, as the curtaines of Salomon.

               <p>Firſt let vs ſee, why hee omits any, and then why theſe three. It is certaine, that the Iewes wrote the Genealogies, and reduced them to ſixe Seuens, two and Fortie Fathers.

               <p>Now for the reaſon why Sant <hi>Mathew</hi> leaueth out three, this it is: They were verie wicked, and for their wickedneſſe were grieuouſly plagued; and therefore ſeeing the Iewes would not exceede the number of two and Fortie, they were the fitteſt to bee left out. The like example we haue in the bleſsing of <hi>Moſes</hi>: where <hi>Simeon</hi> is left out, being wicked, and the number of Twelue muſt bee obſerued. And in the Reuelation, where the Tribes are ſealed <hi>Dan</hi> is omitted, for the reaſon afore: euen ſo theſe three kings being very wicked, had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent deaths, in token of Gods curſe, and therefore the Iewes penning Chriſts Aunceſtors, might iuſtly leaue them out.

In <hi>Ezechias</hi> time <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh of nine Nations plagued, which were borderers on Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.

So God calleth the whole ſtate of Iſrael, a whole bodie, as barren as the wildernes. <hi>She conceiued againe, and bare a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and called her</hi> Loruhamah, not pitied. <hi>She bare againe another Sonne, and called his name</hi> Lognamj, that is, <hi>not my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is thus much, Goe to the multitude of Iſrael, whoſe Fathers pitched their Tents in the wilderneſſe of Diblaim: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fall to Idolatrie, worſhipping molten Calues as their fathers did in the wilderneſſe, not regarding the glorie of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> tell them, that their ſtate ſhall be as Iſrael, that is, like the ſlaughter of <hi>Iehu</hi> vpon <hi>Achab</hi> in the valley of Iſreel: and they ſhall be ſo vnpitied, that they ſhall be as though they were no people, vntill they know I am the Lord.</p>
               <p>Of theſe calamities, <hi>Oſeas</hi> preacheth vnto them in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, &amp; telleth them vnder theſe termes, of three alterations: the one by <hi>Iehu,</hi> which he expreſſeth by his firſt Sonne <hi>Iſreel, becauſe, a little while, and I will viſite the blood of</hi> Iſreel <hi>vppon the houſe of</hi> Iehu, <hi>and will make the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the houſe of Iſrael to ceaſe: and at that day will I alſo breake the bowe of Iſrael in the valley of</hi> Ieſrell.</p>
               <p>The Second by his Daughter <hi>Loruhamah</hi> without mercie: <hi>For I wil no more haue pitie vpon the houſe of Iſrael, but I will vtterly take them away,</hi> which was performed in <hi>Tighath Peleſars</hi> daies without mercie.</p>
               <p>The Third, <hi>Lognammi,</hi> no people: <hi>for yee are not my people, therefore will I not be yours,</hi> This was performed when <hi>Salmanaſar</hi> caried them cleane away.</p>
               <p>It is not expreſſed of what Tribes the Kings of Iſrael were, becauſe the Lord keepeth not the wicked in remembrance. If any be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is for ſome ſpeciall vſe in the Storie: as <hi>Iehu</hi> may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be of <hi>Gad,</hi> becauſe there is mention made, that he came from a Towne in that Tribe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and is a plague to Iſrael, when hee erected the two Calues in Dan and Bethel.</p>
               <p>This puniſhment <hi>Ioſeph</hi> drew vpon the Children of Iſrael by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with the Egiptians, and his ſinne is now plagued.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that he made all the Kings of Iſrael to ſinne, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of <hi>Sallum</hi> and <hi>Hoſeas.</hi> Hereby we may gather, that Kings being
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4087:97"/>
no Prophets, eſteeme no more of religion than Calues: and if they make Lawes for the eſtabliſhing of religion, it is but only for a colour to keepe the Kingdome ſure, and in peace. The Iewes conclude, that all the Kings of Iſrael went to deſtruction to <hi>Gehenna.</hi> Oh, but ſome ſay, we muſt not iudge, leaſt wee thereby become vncharitable. This is certaine, that the holy ſpirite teſtifieth, that they continued in the ſinnes of <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> and there is no mention of their repentance, which is not likely the holy ſpirit of God would haue left vntouched, if there had been any. Therefore ſeeing there is no ſaluation but through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Chriſt, in whome they neuer truſted, why ſhould wee hope better of them, than the ſcripture warrants?</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this falling away, was the pride of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> houſe deſpiſing the glorie of Iuda. There is one onely good of Iſrael. <hi>Abia</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Ieroboam</hi>: who being ſicke, by the counſell of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> his mother enquires of <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet, whether he ſhould liue or die. If ſhee had had faith, ſhe would neuer haue entred the houſe, and then the child ſhould haue liued the ordinarie courſe of life.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ieſabels</hi> Story we are to note, that wicked heretiques in the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are called by the name of <hi>Ieſabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Iſrael became <hi>Ieſabels,</hi> that is, <hi>Scattered of God,</hi> when they were cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into captiuitie, ſauing a ſcattered remnant, as corne in the field left ſtanding after the mower, here and there an Eare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> loſt his ſhips, and <hi>Ioram</hi> was plagued, becauſe they ioyned in affinitie with <hi>Achab. Micheas</hi> telleth them, that <hi>they made Statutes for</hi> Omri, <hi>Mich. 6.</hi> This rule is eternall: God plagueth thoſe which ioyne with Infidels. Heere againe was repeated <hi>Ochoſias</hi> Storie, being the Childe of the two and Fortie yeares. Wee may further obſerue, that in the Seuenth King of Iſrael the Kingdome of Iuda almoſt loſt all their ſtate. <hi>Iehu</hi> he did a verie good worke in ouerthrowing <hi>Achab, Rechab</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe giuing him counſell; and therefore hee hath a promiſe, that the kingdome ſhall continue in his houſe for foure diſcents. This was a ſpeciall glorie, the Kings before him not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing halfe ſo long, though this ouerthrowe was not done by faith. The fourth man of <hi>Iehus</hi> houſe, was Twentie yeres without the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and then ruled but ſixe Moneths. Now in <hi>Hoſeas</hi> time this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is fulfilled, <hi>Iehu ſhall be afflicted like Achab</hi>; not becauſe his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo wicked, but becauſe he himſelfe not ſincerely godly, did them not in faith, and ſtood in feare of the neighbours about.</p>
               <p>In that the Kings of Iſrael haue ſo ſhort continuance, we may know that God caring not for them, they were not to looke for any quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this life. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> handleth the ſtate of Iſrael, as <hi>Hoſeas</hi> did in the caſe of the Gentiles, where he ſaith, <hi>which ſometimes were vnpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4087:97"/>
and ſometimes</hi> no people: For this wee may likewiſe conclude, that they goe to deſtruction which beleeue not in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Kings of Iſrael in reſpect of the kingdome, ſometimes vnpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in <hi>Tiglahpeleſar,</hi> ſometimes no people, as in <hi>Salmanaſar,</hi> in reſpect of their ſoules, alwaies vnpitied, alwayes no people.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Elias</hi> Storie we haue a ſpeciall obſeruation, <hi>1.

Now though <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had a prophecie that he ſhould be King; yet it ſtretched not to his Sonnes, nor further than himſelfe, and therefore after his death they ſhould haue yeelded the Kingdome to Iuda: for which, becauſe they did not, they were ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably plagued.</p>

For vs, not one of many Thouſands come to <hi>Dauids</hi> yeares: ſo heauie is the wrath of God vppon ſinners. <hi>Solon</hi> being demaunded who were happie, tels a Storie of two, who in loue and affection to their Parents, drew their Mothers chariots to the Temple: And the God for recompence, cauſed them to die preſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſus</hi> going further, asked him, whether he thought him happie? he anſwered, There be in a yeare three Hundred, ſixtie, and fiue daies, and in euerie day, houres and minutes, wherein our life is ſubiect to change and alteration: and therefore till all this be ended, I cannot tell whome to account bleſſed.</p>
               <p>This number of Seuentie, depends of Seuen and Ten: thereby we may ſtill remember the creation, and the Fathers before the flood. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this there depends a prophecie. <hi>Leuit. 26. If you will not keepe my lawes, nor obſerue my Statutes, yee ſhall be in your enemies land, till the land hath payd her Sabbaths,</hi> which was fulfilled in ten Sabbaths. The ſtate of the people of the Iewes in Babylon, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> compareth to dead bones. For as it may ſeem to euerie man, that dead bones ſhall not be reuided; ſo ſhould they neuer bee deliuered. Yet hee comforteth them by the viſion, wherein God reſtored theſe bones to life; ſome reaſon they had thus to eſteeme of themſelues: for they were carried away captiue, the land of Iuda deſolate for religion, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about them amazed. In Babylon policie they could haue none, nor any exerciſe of Religion. If they prayed, it muſt be after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his Chamber, and ſo (no doubt) <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Salathiel,</hi> and the reſt did So that their age was euen as a dead time in the world. Beſides, God ſayth, <hi>Eſay 52. My name is euill ſpoken of, becauſe of you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the heathen:</hi> ſo that one of Babylon might ſay to his neighbour, You ſee here a Nation vild, and of no account; yet they haue a hope that they ſhall be deliuered out of captiuitie after Seuentie yeares: and here is one <hi>Ieremie,</hi> which taketh a ſtone, and caſteth it into the Sea, and ſo (ſaith he) head-long ſhall Babylon bee ouerthrowne: and they haue one <hi>Daniel,</hi> who prophecieth, that the great King <hi>Nebuchadnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> ſhall be a beaſt, that is, ſhall haue the heart of a Beaſt giuen him, becauſe hee doth not worſhip their God, but haue deſtroyed their temple. They deſpiſe to march with vs, looking ſtill for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This (no doubt) would cauſe them to be hated, and the name of God ill ſpoken of. From this wee may gather a deepe meditation for our owne eſtate, and to looke to our wayes, that they be the Lords wayes, and not our owne, leaſt through misbeleefe wee fall into the like ſorrowes. As <hi>Ezechiel</hi> compareth them to dead bones; ſo they themſelues were as men in graues: for ſo the <hi>126. Pſalme</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>When thou leddeſt captiuitie captiue, then were wee like men
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4087:98"/>
that dreamed</hi>: for wee thought no more that this had come to paſſe, than the dreames which appeare from the vanitie of our thoughts. Now if wee make vſe of theſe things, by comparing our ſtate in this life with theirs in Babell, wee ſhall doe well: for may not euerie one of vs ſay with <hi>Iacob, Geneſ. 47. Our dayes are fewe and euill, and full of ſorrowe, and wee doe not attaine to the dayes of our Fathers?</hi> All the Kingdomes of the earth ſince this time, in reſpect of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, are called Babell. In the Reuelation the godly are admoniſhed to come out of Babell, ſeeing they are Gods people; otherwiſe they ſhall bee partakers of their plagues: and as longe as wee liue, wee ſhall bee in Babell and confuſion, our tongues ſo confounded as not able to ſpeake the myſteries of God aright: this is the caſe of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs.</p>
               <p>Now the Iewes in Babylon, ſeeing they cannot reſtore policie, they perfourme outward obedience for ciuill actions, and turning their faces to Ieruſalem, the ſight of peace, they praiſe God in their ſoules; ſo we, ſeeing our caſe is no better than theirs in this life, wee muſt meditate on the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, and ſettle our affections on high, that after this life, wee may enioy the heauenly Ieruſalem, our conſcience hauing embraced that peace of God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, not going about to reſtore policie, but in intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lord to teach vs to number our dayes, that yet ſo we may apply our ſelues vnto wiſedome. To this purpoſe the 137. <hi>Pſalme</hi> is full of comfort: for we muſt conſider there is no Land, nor no law, that can hinder vs to be godly. And though there bee wicked lawes decreed, as when <hi>Nebuchadnetzar</hi> erected the Image, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a worſhipping of it; yet their end is but to trie the faith of Gods Children, that euen as Gold ſeuen times purified, is not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but made more glorious: ſo the Furnace ſeuen times more hot, ſhall not ſo much as make our garments to ſmell thereof, for God is in the middeſt of his choſen.</p>

               <p>IT had three captiuities: The one when <hi>Daniel</hi> was carried away. The ſecond Seuen yeres after, when <hi>Ieconias</hi> was caried away. The third, eleauen yeres after, when <hi>Sedechias</hi> was carried away: ſo they

were wholy but Fiftie yeares in captiuitie in <hi>Babel,</hi> a full Iubilee: this opinion hath been croſſed: but you ſhall ſee it muſt needs be ſo. Then it is ſayd, that captiuitie begins, when men are led captiue. Beſides, ſeeing God calleth the people of the Iewes <hi>Daniels</hi> people, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his Citie; ſhall we thinke that hee being in ſuch fauour with God, God made no account of his captiuitie, ſeeing by theſe titles giuen vnto him, it is apparant God eſteemed more of him, than of all the men in the earth? Further, if you reckon it from <hi>Iehoiakims,</hi> you then make it Seuentie ſeauen, which is more than the ſcripture warrants.</p>
               <p>Now for the place in <hi>Ezechiel, from the time of our captiuitie,</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Prophet there ſpeaketh onely of the carrying away of the Kings. <hi>Ieremie</hi> telleth, that the Babylonians ſhall rule but Seuenty yeares, and they muſt be in captiuitie but to them: and therefore you muſt beginne your captiuitie from the time that <hi>Daniel</hi> was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: otherwiſe you will make more or leſſe than Seuentie. Now if we examine why the Iewes would not beleeue this, we ſhall finde the reaſon by a common diſeaſe amongſt our ſelues. For we all know we ſhall die, but yet there is none ſo old, but thinketh hee may liue till to morrow: euen ſo they knewe they ſhould bee ledde away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but euerie one perſwaded himſelfe not in his daies, and ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction came ſuddenly vppon them. Beſides, there was a prophecie, <hi>Habac. 1. I will worke a worke in your daies, which you will not beleeue, though one ſhould tell you.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh this to the Gentiles, and applies it to Chriſt. We may marke another thing. Iſrael is carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in <hi>Hoſeas</hi> time, of whome this is not added, that hee continued in the ſinnes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and by this we may gather hee was the beſt of the Kings of Iſrael. Iuda is carried captiue in <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> time, and yet <hi>Manaſses</hi> as wicked a King as he. From hence wee ſee, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Palmoni,</hi> who numbreth, wayeth, and diuideth, and the wicked ſhall drink vp their portion the iudgment of God, which neither the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor wickedneſſe of any can hinder to cauſe to come ſooner, or later.</p>

               <p>And as the Iewes doe praiſe God after their deliuerance, ſo is it ſaid that vpon the deliuerance from this ſpirituall bondage, all Chriſtians ſhall ſay, Let vs be glad and reioyce, and worſhip God, ſaying Amen, Hallelu-iah: for our Lord God Almighty hath raigned.</p>
               <p>At this deliuerance out of Babell, about the euening offering, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeareth to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and telleth him the exact houre of Chriſts death, <hi>Dan. 9.</hi> in theſe wordes. <hi>Seauenty ſeauens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">70. 490.</note> (or <hi>490) yeares are exactly decreed for the death of Chriſt the King, the moſt Holy, to finiſh ſinne, to bring in iuſtice, to reconcile iniquity, to annoint the most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to performe euery viſion and prophecie.</hi> By this key the Iewes might haue vnderſtoode the death of Chriſt the ſonne of all ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeauenty ſeauens are diſtinguiſhed into ſeauen ſeauens, and the Temple ſhall be built into ſixtie two ſeauens, wherein Religion ſhall ſeeme to be vtterly obſcured: and into one ſeauen, in the halfe of which Chriſt the King muſt be killed, not for himſelfe, but for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Dan. 9.</hi> The time of the ſixtie two ſeauens is prooued out of the Grecians Storie, whome God in his ſecret wiſedome vſed though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly to themſelues) to be recorders of his truth. Theſe ſeauens of weekes I wil handle more at large at the death of Chriſt, where they are fully accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Vpon the viſion of the foure Beaſts in <hi>Dan:</hi> which repreſent foure ſtately kingdomes, figured before in <hi>Nebucadnetzars</hi> image which he ſawe in his dreame, <hi>Dan. 2.</hi> ariſeth a great queſtion, Whether the fourth Beaſt containe the kingdome of the Romanes, or not. It is certaine it doth not, and thus it may be prooued.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt, which is the Lion, to be meant of <hi>Babylon;</hi> the Beare, to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4087:109"/>
be the kingdome of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and the Leopard to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> kingdome, there is no controuerſie: but then of the fourth Beaſt with ten hornes, lyeth the queſtion.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that a ſtone ſhall be cut without hands, and ſhall become a great mountaine, and ſhall fill al the earth, and ſhal fal vpon the image, and punne it to duſt. This ſtone is Chriſt, vpon whoſe birth this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ends: for the ſtone falling vpon the feete of iron &amp; clay, the whole image fell and was beaten to powder. If then vpon the birth of Chriſt the fourth kingdome muſt be punned to duſt, and al the beaſts be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the fire by the Ancient of daies, as <hi>Daniel 7.</hi> then the fourth kingdome cannot be the Romanes. For vntill the comming of Chriſt they were in no glory, and then were they in their chiefeſt glory: for although a little before indeede they had conquered all the world, yet the world did not conſent to pay tribute vntill Chriſts time, and therefore it could not bee ſaid a full conqueſt. For it is neuer a full conqueſt, vntill a generall conſent of tribute be graunted. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, that it is meant of the ſecond comming of Chriſt, how is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſion and propheſie performed in Chriſt? and with what authority could <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeake of the ſecond comming, before hee had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt? Therefore, to hold this to be meant of the Romanes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Chriſt not to be yet come, nor the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed.</p>
               <p>Againe, the fourth Beaſt, that is, the fourth kingdome hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the fourth part of the image. And by the legges of iron &amp; clay, and thereby, as the legges of one body being twaine, are expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as the legges of contrary natures, that is, of iron and clay, being twaine, proceede out of one body: ſo the kingdome which by them is ſignified, muſt be a diuided Nation ruling one kingdome, which the Romanes were not: for <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> was onely Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: otherwiſe you darken the Romanes glory.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is ſaid of theſe legges (that is of this fourth kingdome) that they ſhall ſtriue by marriages, becauſe they were two Nations, that is, of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> to be as one body. But as iron cleaueth not in nature with clay; no more ſhould they bee one. Whoſe ſtories if you examine in <hi>Iustine</hi> and other heathen Authors, you ſhall find they were from time to time preuented by vntimely deathes. For the wiues killed their husbands, the mothers their ſonnes, the ſonnes their mothers; ſo that they could not bring to paſſe their purpoſe. This cannot be applied to the Romanes: for they were ſtill one ſole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and vniuerſall Emperours of themſelues.</p>
               <p>Againe, the little horne, that is, the tenth horne of the fourth beaſt, is <hi>Antiochus the vilde,</hi> who is the laſt part of the fourth beaſt: whoſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4087:109"/>
villanies indeede are anſwerable to the impieties of the Romanes, &amp; therefore in the Reuelation the whole time of their gouernment is by alluſion called daies 1260. a time. 2. times and halfe a time, or 42. monthes alluding to the time of <hi>Antiochus</hi> gouernment. For as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> polluted the Temple of God, changing the lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding that which God commanded, placing idolatry in his ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and perſecuting ſuch as would not forſake the Religion of God: ſo the Romanes haue polluted the Temple of God, changing the lawes that <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth, and forbiddeth that which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, compelling open idolatry, and perſecuting ſuch as will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the truth of Gods Religion.</p>
               <p>Againe, theſe legges, meaning the fourth kingdome, are called in <hi>Dan. 11.</hi> the King of the North, and the King of the South, that is, <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> which is North from <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Egipt</hi> which is South from <hi>Iudea:</hi> therefore not the Romanes.</p>
               <p>Againe, the corporation of the Romanes is deſcribed in the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be one beaſt with ſeauen heads and ten hornes. This fourth beaſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> hath but one head and ten hornes: therefore it cannot be meant of the Romanes.</p>
               <p>But in truth the Romanes hauing conquered the whole world, &amp; imbracing the impieties of the Babylonian Lyon, the cruelty of the Perſian Beare, the fiercenes of the Grecian Leopard, and the moſt tyrannicall and prophane blaſphemies of the fourth beaſt; The holy Ghoſt could not by fitter reſemblances deſcribe them, than by theſe beaſtes: therefore hee nameth them vnder the name of one mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſt: hauing property of all the former, that is, A beaſt with ſeauen heads and ten hornes, mouthed like the Babylonian Lyon, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like the Perſian Beare, bodyed like the Grecian Leopard, and hath ten hornes, and the blaſphemous wordes of the fourth beaſt, whoſe inhumane cruelty was ſuch, that no beaſt in the earth could be likened vnto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much for the parts of the image, and for the foure beaſts in generall.</hi>

This bleſsing was to <hi>Iaphet,</hi> in recompence of his vertuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Sem</hi> in couering their Father. For <hi>Noah</hi> prophecied, that <hi>Sem ſhould firſt be bleſsed, and then</hi> Iaphet <hi>ſhould haue a larger glorie.</hi> This bleſsing concerning <hi>Iaphets</hi> houſe, began in the ſucceſſe of <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> with <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Sem,</hi> againſt the Babylonians, enlarged now by <hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſt, and by making the Greeke tongue famous: but moſt of all after Chriſt, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was baniſhed into <hi>Iaphets</hi> Country, to ſee the glorious forme of the heauenly Ieruſalem, and a Booke in the Greeke tongue deliuered vp to all the world containing the graces of Chriſt, and the glad tidings of the euerlaſting Goſpell. The comfort of this is vnſpeakable, being duly embraced: but eſpecially to vs of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> houſe, that is, the Ilands of the ends of the earth, ſeeing by the benefite thereof, we haue the true vnderſtanding of eternall life.

               <p>About this time <hi>Solon</hi> the wiſe flouriſhed, and made a law, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> the Poet, who was long before him, ſhould be read in the publike aſſemblies on holy dayes and feſtiuall dayes, as the Epiſtles and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels bee read in our Churches. This <hi>Homer</hi> in a trifling argument of the warre at <hi>Troy,</hi> layeth downe all the excellencie of the Greeke tongue.</p>
               <p>About this time alſo, the Seuen wiſe men of Greece were famous,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4087:112"/>
and all their diſputations be vpon <hi>Homer</hi>: as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grecians affirme, that <hi>Homer</hi> was tranſlated into the Indian tongue, and other languages, that ſo he might be knowne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of other nations alſo.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Alexander</hi> being of great poſſeſsions, hee muſt haue many vnder-officers to belong vnto him: then he that would beare any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or bee in any credite, muſt be skilfull in the greeke tongue. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> Seuen and Fortie yeares before Chriſt, ſpeaketh of the <hi>Denides</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning greeke in England. <hi>Tullie pro Archia</hi> the poet, reaſoneth thus: Though <hi>Archias</hi> the poet be not by nature a Citizen, yet he deſerueth to bee thought ſo to bee, ſeeing by birth hee is a Grecian, and of Antiochia a populous Citie, and of great account, from whence flowed learned men, and liberall ſtudies. And if any man ſhall thinke a leſſer fruite of glorie to be reaped from greeke verſes, than from latine, hee erreth in good ſadneſſe, becauſe thoſe thinges which are written in greeke, are read almoſt into all nations: thoſe which are in latine, are contained with their owne borders, which in good ſooth are verie narrowe. Thus, by <hi>Tullies</hi> teſtimonie, the greeke tongue ſtretched ouer the whole world.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Auguſtus Caeſars</hi> time the latine beganne to flouriſh, and the greeke tongue ceaſed as if the holy ghoſt ſhould haue aduiſed the Grecians to haue written no more. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> doe not write any new ſtorie, but either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment on that which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before; or abridge it. And any one skilfull in the greeke tongue, may eaſily perceiue from what notable place of <hi>Plato, Homer,</hi> or other greeke writers euerie phraſe in the newe Teſtament is deriued; and thoſe which are not there to bee found in thoſe authors, are fetched from the hebrew of the old Teſtament, from whence all the rootes of the greeke tongue are drawne. So that to the exact knowledge and vnderſtanding of the new teſtament, two things are requiſite, cunning in the greeke authors, and in the old Teſtament.</p>

               <p>Whereas the Papiſts hold inuocation to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and to Saints, and call her the Queene of heauen, therefore greater than her ſonne Chriſt; therein they commit open blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt.

And againe, he ſaith <hi>Ioh. 6. None commeth vnto me except the father drawe him.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 6. Eternal is the gift of God,</hi> not the gift of men or women departed. And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal. 4. It is thou Lord only that makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> Againe, <hi>Chriſt being become an high Sacrificer of good thinges to come, not by the bloud of goates, or calues, but by his owne bloud hath entred once for all vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, and obtayned eternall redemption for vs. And for this cauſe is He the mediator of the new Testament, that through death which was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the tranſgreſsions that were in the former Teſtament, they which were called might receiue the promiſe of eternal inheritance. For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places that are made with hands, which are ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the true ſanctuary; but is entred into very heauen to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs, not that he ſhould offer himſelfe often as the high Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer did once euery yeare: (for then he muſt haue often ſuffered) but now in the end of the world hath he appeared once to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe, by the which we are ſanctified. Euery ſacrificer appeareth daily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring, and oft times offereth one manner offering, which can neuer take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinnes: but this man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, ſitteth for euer at the right hand of God, and from hence forth tarrieth vntil he hath
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4087:117"/>
made his enemies his footestoole: for with one offering hath he conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified. Seing therefore, brethren, that by the bloud of Ieſus we may be bold to enter into the holy place, by the new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing way, which he hath prepared for vs through the vaile, that is, his fleſh: And ſeeing we haue a high ſacrificer ouer the houſe of God, let vs draw neere with a true heart, in aſſurance of faith, ſprinkled in our hearts from an euill conſcience, and let vs keepe the profeſsion of our hope without wauering: for he is faithfull that promiſed. Hee that deſpiſeth</hi> Moſes <hi>law, dieth without mercie vnder two or three witneſſes: of how much ſorer puniſhments, ſuppoſe ye them worthy which tread vnderfoot the</hi> Sonne of God, <hi>and counteth the bloud of the Teſtament as an vnholy thing, wherewith we are ſanctified? for we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance is mine, I will recompence ſaith the Lord:</hi> and againe, <hi>the Lord ſhall iudge the people. Caſt not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward. For the</hi> iuſt ſhall liue by his faith. <hi>But without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe him. For hee that commeth to God, muſt beleeue that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him.</hi> Let vs therefore by him, (not by the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> or Saints) offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwaies to God that is the fruit of the lippes which confeſſe his name. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I, euen I am the Lord, and beſide me there is no ſauiour.</hi> This being dulie marked, &amp; rightly applied, is a full and large diſputation againſt any Papiſt.</p>

               <p>He ſuffered on the croſſe, to take the curſe vpon him.</p>

               <p>Generall darkneſſe at his death was ouer all the world from the ſixt houre vntill the ninth houre. <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule was in darkneſſe, hiding himſelfe from the preſence of God from the ſixt houre vntill the ninth houre.

Thus it was of no glorie vntill the end of the thouſand yeares, then Satan is let looſe, and ſuffered to goe roaring about to deceiue the hearts of the people, ſeeking like a ramping and a roaring Lion whome hee might deuoure, and hee putteth life into this dead beaſt, hauing power giuen him from God, <hi>Reuel. 13. And hee ſpake as did the Dragon, and hee did all that the firſt beaſt could doe in his preſence, and hee cauſed the earth with them that dwell therein, to worſhip the first beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed, and he did great wonders, ſo that hee made fire to come downe from heauen in the ſight of men, and deceiued them that dwelt on the earth, by the meanes of thoſe ſignes which hee had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe in the ſight of the beaſt, ſaying to them that dwell on the earth, that they ſhould make an image vnto the beaſt, which had the wound of a ſword, and did liue.
