         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

waited on the Lord <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
to be Introduced to
his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
his Lordſhip enquired of me,
If the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> had given
me any directions how to Diſcourſe the Duke? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
She had. Then he deſired to know what they
were. Upon which I ſhewed his Lordſhip a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book; in which was contained a Scheme, and
the pretended Diſcovery which I had made in
the Presbyterian Plot. Which Book his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
carefully peruſed, and finding ſome omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98540:4"/>
therein, he ordered me to Write, while his
Lordſhip did Dictate to me theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Presbyterian Party intended to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
in the North, and ſo to joyn with an
Army of the Scots. Immediately after this his
Lordſhip took us into the Dukes Cloſet (at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>)
where we both kiſſed his hand: and me he
took from the ground (for I was kneeling.) Then
I gave his Highneſs the aforementioned little
Book, which he after ſome ſhort peruſal thereof,
thanked me for: and alſo for my diligence in the
Catholick Cauſe: Did adviſe me to go on, and
wiſhed good ſucceſs to all my Undertakings: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in theſe very words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Plot was a thing of moſt mighty conſequence,
and if well managed, would be very Conducible
to the Safety of the Catholick Cauſe: and I do
not queſtion but the Effects of it will anſwer our
Expectation, eſpecially in the Northern parts:
where I am well aſſured the Major Part of the
Gentry are my Friends, and have given ſufficient
Demonſtration of their affections to me, as alſo of
their intentions to proſecute this Presbyterian Plot
to the utmoſt; for they are no Strangers to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this his Highneſs ordered that
Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and my ſelf (in the hearing of the
Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> who was privy to the whole
Diſcourſe) to be very careful of what we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the perſons who were to be the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in that new Plot, leſt we ſhould be caught
in the Subornation, and ſo bring a <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errible
Odium upon the Catholicks, and make our ſelves
uncapable of any further Service. After this the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98540:4"/>
Duke informed us, That in a Month or two's
time the Commiſſions would be ready: but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
us in the mean time to bring our part to
bear with the Commiſſions: and particularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me to find out ſome perſons (as there was
enough ſuch among the Catholicks, as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
which were fit to be Truſted, and that
ſhould accept of ſuch Commiſſions, which ſhould
be delivered them by a perſon appointed for that
purpoſe, but not to be known to them to be any
other but a Presbyterian: So that when occaſion
ſhould require, they might, together with thoſe
which we then had, be ready to ſwear in the Plot,
and that the Presbyterians were raiſing Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King and Government, and had given
out Commiſſions to that purpoſe. And in order to
this, I did in ſome ſhort time after, procure one <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Curtice, Grey, Hill, Hopkins,</hi> and others, to accept
of ſuch Commiſſions, when they ſhould be ready:
whoſe buſineſs in the mean time was, to ſpread
reports in the Coffee-houſes, That the Popiſh
Plot was a Contrivance of the Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for our encouragement in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Sham-Plot, the Duke promiſed that he
would take care that Money ſhould not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but ordered us to uſe all the expedition the
thing would allow, to make a Diſcovery thereof
to the King. After which the Duke ſaid, The
Catholick Party would be eaſed of the Charge, in
regard he was ſure it would be defrayed ſome
other way.</p>
               <p>Then the Duke made divers Vows, and bitter
Execrations, to ſtand by us in the thing: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
on his Honour to be our Rewarder. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98540:5"/>
That ſuch Conſiderable Services were not
to be ſlighted: and further promiſed, that to
whoſe lot ſoever it ſhould happen to be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
according to their fidelity and ſtedfaſtneſs in
the Cauſe, ſo much the more ſhould their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be augmented: and that all care poſſible
ſhould be uſed to ſupport and preſerve them:
but particularly deſiring me to keep up to the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and active Character which his Highneſs
had heard of me. All which I promiſed to do.
Whereupon we withdrew to the Lord <hi>Peterboroughs</hi>
Lodging, where we continued till his Lordſhip
had Introduced Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> to the Duke.
Which being done, his Lordſhip left them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he ſaid, and came to us: where among
other Diſcourſe his Lordſhip told me, I had a
great opportunity to make my Fortune what I
would my ſelf, if I would but follow the advice
of his Maſter the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who, as <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Lordſhip ſaid, would certainly be my King in
a very ſhort time. Adding, that I muſt be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in my undertakings: For, ſaid he, the Duke
much affects Reſolution, but hates mortally the
timorous man.</p>
               <p>Then I anſwered his Lordſhip, That I valued
not my Life, provided, to loſe it would be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Duke's Intereſt. At which Expreſſion
he ſeemed fully ſatisfied; and from that time
called me Captain <hi>Willoughby:</hi> and at our coming
away, his Lordſhip gave particular order to his
Servants, That at what time ſoever, day, or night,
either Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> or my ſelf, ſhould come to
ſpeak with his Lordſhip, we ſhould be forthwith
admitted. And then we parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98540:5"/>
Some ſhort time after, I went to wait on his
Lordſhip from the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> at midnight, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to move the Duke, to get me with
all expedition to the King: for then I was
ready.</p>
               <p>About four days after this, his Lordſhip ſent for
me, and took me to the Duke again (who was in his
Cloſet at <hi>Whitehall</hi>) and the Duke told me, I muſt
prepare my ſelf to wait on the King, to give
His Majeſty a more particular Account of the
Presbyterian Plot than what the little Book made
mention of, (which Book, the Duke ſaid, he had
given to the King) and that he had ſo ordered the
matter, that I ſhould be furniſhed with Money,
to enable me in the Proſecution thereof. But his
Highneſs charged me to conſider well my Story,
before I waited on the King.</p>
               <p>Then the Duke told me, I had gained, by my
Diligence, a good Reputation among the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and that I ſhould highly merit by my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to that Cauſe: adding, That I ſhould in a
ſhort time ſee the Catholick Religion flouriſh in
theſe Kingdoms; and Hereſie torn up by the
roots: And that he had heard of the Propoſal which
had been made me by the Lords, <hi>Powis,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi>
about Taking off the King, and of my refuſal;
as alſo of what I had accepted, touching my
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and of all my Tranſactions in the
Presbyterian Plot: ſaying in theſe very words, <hi>viz.</hi>
If you value the Religion you profeſs, my Intereſt,
(as you ſay you do) and your own future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
take my Advice, and depend upon my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Intereſt for your Advancement: For,
Sir, you look like a Man of Courage and Wit:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98540:6"/>
therefore leſs Diſcourſe may ſerve with you than
another: So that if you will but move by the
Meaſures which I will give you, you ſhall not only
eſcape with ſafety, but be rewarded according to
the greatneſs of your Actions.</p>
               <p>To all this I replied, I would ſtand and fall in
the Defence of the Roman Catholick Religion, and
his Highneſs Service; and was not a little concerned
for my refuſing to kill the King, whom I was then
well ſatisfied by my Ghoſtly Father, ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as an Heretick. But this I did offer, That
if his Highneſs would Command me to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
I would not fail either to accompliſh it, or
loſe my Life.</p>
               <p>Upon which the Duke gave me Twenty Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
and ſaid, If I would be but vigorous in what
I had undertaken already, he would ſo order it,
that my Life ſhould not be in the leaſt danger:
adding in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> We are not to have
Men taken in ſuch daring Actions, but to have
them make an effectual Diſpatch, and be gone.
Upon which I took my leave.</p>
               <p>Some ſhort time after this, when I was ready to
convey the Letters into Colonel <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Chamber,
I went to the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> who brought me
to the Duke, to whom I told, how I was ready
to fix the Letters in the Colonel's Chamber. To
which his Highneſs anſwered, I muſt make haſte,
that I might be Impowered to make a general
Search of the like nature. For, ſaid the Duke in theſe
words, <hi>viz.</hi> Since I ſaw you laſt, the Lady <hi>Powis</hi>
has informed me, That there are abundance of
Letters and Witneſſes ready: ſo that 'tis now high
time to begin. By this time there was ſome great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98540:6"/>
Man come to wait on the Duke, ſo I withdrew.</p>
               <p>About four days after this, when I had been
preſſing earneſtly with Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> for
a Warrant, and could not prevail, I went to the
Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s, and did deſire his Lordſhip to
make application to the Duke, to uſe ſome means
for a Warrant. To which his Lordſhip anſwered;
'Twas my fault there was not a Warrant granted,
and that the Duke was ſenſible of my neglec<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing to

               <head>In and about the Months of June, July
or Auguſt 1679,</head>
               <p>THe Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> ſent me with a
Letter to the Lord Privy Seal, who
was then at his Lordſhips houſe in
<hi>Kenſington:</hi> but the Contents of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I remember not, more than that it was to pray
ſome favour in the behalf of one <hi>Anderſon</hi> alias <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
a Prieſt, and then in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and was
reported to know ſomething of the Plot. Which
Papers contained matter of Fact, drawn up to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Strouds</hi> Teſtimony invalid, in caſe he ſhould
make any Diſcovery. And by my Ladies order I
was to pray his Lordſhip to take the Papers: ſo that
if <hi>Stroud</hi> ſhould be ſent for on Examination before
the Council, that his Lordſhip would produce
them to ſtop his Evidence: Which his Lordſhip
promiſed to do. But <hi>Stroud</hi> was not ſent for, and
ſo the Papers were of no uſe: but I ſuppoſe they
may ſtill remain with his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time I did, by Order from the
Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> inform his Lordſhip, That the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Plot would be ready for Diſcovery in a
Months time. To which his Lordſhip anſwered,
that I ſhould tell the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> He was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that a Month would be too ſoon, in regard
things then moved with too much violence, for
ſuch an Affair to have any Succeſs. So I took my
leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98540:7"/>
Some ſhort time after I went, by the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s
Order, with another Letter to his Lordſhip; the
Contents of which I never knew: But was ordered
to acquaint his Lordſhip, That the Presbyterian
Plot ſtill went on, and that we had divers Letters
and Witneſſes ready, to lay open the matter, when
it ſhould be thought fit. To which his Lordſhip
anſwered, He feared the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> were
too vigorous in that Deſign: but promiſed, when
the rigorous Proſecution againſt the Catholicks
were ſomewhat abated, he did intend to move it
to the King and Council. Adding, That if things
of that nature were but well timed, they could not
fail of Succeſs. So I took my leave.</p>
               <p>Some time after, Miſtreſs <hi>Cellier</hi> and my ſelf
went to wait on his Lordſhip at <hi>Kenſington;</hi> where
we both had admittance. Then 'twas Miſtreſs
<hi>Cellier,</hi> in my hearing, informed his Lordſhip, That
ſhe came in the name of her Great Maſter (the
Duke of <hi>York</hi>) and at the moſt earneſt requeſt of
the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to pray his Lordſhip to
uſe ſome means, that the Proceedings againſt the
Catholicks might be more eaſie, and that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Plot might be diſcovered. Then his
Lordſhip deſired her to let the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi>
know, that he was not idle in the Conſidering their
Safety: For, added his Lordſhip, in theſe words, I
have my ſelf diſcourſed lately with all the great
Miniſters of our party, and my Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>
has done the ſame, and we both find there is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
intended: but we muſt wait the time: For
things of that nature muſt be moved gently, or the
whole Royal Party may be deſtroyed at once, for
there are many eyes upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98540:8"/>
Then Miſtreſs <hi>Cellier</hi> informed his Lordſhip, That
Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> Trial had broken the Ice, and of
the great difficulty there was in prevailing with the
Lord C. J. to come over: and alſo of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that was between the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> and the
Lord C. J. To which his Lordſhip replied, That
the Lord C. J. had taken more time to Conſider of
his part, than Five other far greater men had done
(who they were I know not) and that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was forc'd to ſhew the Lord C. J. the Duke of
<hi>Yorks</hi> Letter, before he would believe any thing.
Nay, ſaid his Lorſhip, notwithſtanding this I was
forc'd to get a particular Letter ſent him from the
Duke, before he would make any promiſe. Truly,
Madam, ſaid his Lordſhip, 'tis no ſmall pains I
take to ſerve the Duke, and their Lordſhips, and
that you may aſſure them.</p>
               <p>Then Miſtreſs <hi>Cellier</hi> acquainted his Lordſhip,
That <hi>Dugdale</hi> was come about, and intended to
throw himſelf at the Dukes feet, with a Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that he had ſworn in the Plot. And,
ſaid ſhe, I am in the name of the Lords, to pray your
Lordſhip he may be ſecured in your houſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a place more proper than any other. To this
his Lordſhip anſwered, He was glad to hear of
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s ingenuity in that Affair, and did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in his Houſſe, and that his Lordſhip's
Prieſt ſhould be his Companion: ſo that it
ſhould be impoſſible for him to do any more
miſchief. But his Lordſhip deſired ſhe would
tell the Lords, They muſt uſe all the means ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to get him ſent beyond Sea, left a
too ſtrict Enquiry ſhould be made after him.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98540:8"/>
To which Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> replied thus; My Lord, we
do not intend he ſhall ſtay in your Lordſhip's Houſe
above Nine or Ten days: for though he muſt do
us Service by a general Recantation, yet we can
never think him ſafe, till we have got him into
the Inquiſition: for ſuch perſons are to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
not truſted. So upon this his Lordſhip ſent
a Compliment to the Lords in the Tower, and ſo
we came away.</p>
