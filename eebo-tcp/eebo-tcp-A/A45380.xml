            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>Alarum-Bell,</hi> I have ſent to be rung in the ears of all true Chriſtians, whereby it may arowſe them from the dead ſleep of ſin &amp; ſecurity: &amp; to beware of Gods Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he threatens againſt all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, preſumptuous, &amp; ſtiff-necked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: behold friends, I would not have you thinke, that I will take upon me to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie or Prognoſticate any thing in this Booke, but what is warranted me by the Scriptures. That little Talent that the Lord hath lent me, I would not hide it, but willingly ſo lay it out, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> uſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the glory of God, &amp; the good of all thoſe that fear him: my deſire is, that this my ſmall Book, cald <hi>Englands Alarum-Bell,</hi> may be as powerfull in your eares, &amp; work ſo much for your ſouls, to ſtop Gods wrath by Prayer and Repentance, as the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Jonah</hi> to the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> as the Lord commanded him; who at the hearing of <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Yet forty dayes &amp; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh <pb facs="tcp:107301:3"/>ſhall be overthrown:</hi> they faſted and mayed with ſuch earneſtnes &amp; ſincerity to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, that God repented him of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> evill that he ſaid he would doe, &amp; did it not: as you may read in the 3 of <hi>Jonah;</hi> You have heard lately, &amp; do hear by the Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; Prognoſtications of many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of many ſad things that are like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, not onely this Nation, but all Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome beſides; whether they will prove true or falſe, none but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord knows: the ſtars &amp; planets I muſt confes are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God, &amp; are ſent as fore runners of many things, which they do dive much into, yet faile in their judgements many times: &amp; many times I am perſwaded that the Lord doth call back y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terrour of thoſe ſignes and tokens that he ſends, to make them know, that they are but men.</p>
            <p>There is many I am perſwaded, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> did look to ſée the 29 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, to be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day, as all writers did prognoſticate. I muſt confes the Eclipſe was true, both of the Moon the 15 day, &amp; the Sun the 29, according as they had written; the Moon indéed a very ſad one, &amp; great winds roſe upon her eclipſe, according as M. <hi>Culpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> writ in his Almanack; For the Sun, 't was eclipſed ſo much, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appearance of it was like a new Moon; 9 parts of 12 of <pb facs="tcp:107301:3"/>her were darkned, or more, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſplendor of that that did appear of it, was ſo bright and glorious, &amp; ſo clear the aire was, that the day was not ſo terrible to behold: But the power of the Lord was admirable in this Eclipſe: I would deſire all you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> have ſéen this Eclipſe, to conſider this thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God over man was this, (that I may with Reverence ſay) <hi>He cauſed light out of darkneſſe:</hi> for the ſplendor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part of the Sun that was not eclipſed was ſo glorious, that it gave a luſter on earth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dark heavens; which if the Lord had ſuffered the clouds to have covered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part of the Sun that was not eclipſed, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch clouds &amp; darkneſſe that was in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before ſhe was eclipſed, it would have bin then (I think) a diſmall day to look on indéed; &amp; then perhaps more glory would have bin given to ſome men on earth, then to God above, and afterwards would have bin ſo extolled for their prognoſtications by ſo many ſilly people in theſe times, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would have took their Almanacks for Scripture, &amp; have looked more in them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible. They writ very largely of the effects that will follow; what the effects will be the Lord knows: &amp; if they do know by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtars &amp; planets, that the Lord doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe things that they writ on; yet <pb facs="tcp:107301:4"/>let this my <hi>Alarum-Bell</hi> ſound ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ears of all true Chriſtians, that if we wil but truly &amp; with a ſincere heart repent us of our ſins, &amp; leave them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord will repent him of the evill that hée pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, &amp; leave puniſhing: you ſhall find in the 13 of <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 9 &amp; 10 <hi>ver.</hi> the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord which he ſpare to his people after he had aflicted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſaith he, <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelfe, but in me is thy help; I will be thy King, where is any other that may ſave thee in all thy Cities?</hi> by this you may ſée the Lord hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the deſtruction of a nation or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I deſire you likewiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the brightnes of the Lords mercy in this eclipſe of the Sun, may not be a means to harden your hearts, as I am afraid it doth too many in this Land, that makes a laughing at it, &amp; thinks, becauſe it was not ſo diſmal a day as it was ſpoke of by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aſtrologers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God ſent thoſe ſigns &amp; tokens in vain: I deſire you to be carefull what you do, &amp; ſcoffe not at the wonders of the Lord, for though he lightened the glory of the Sun, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe; without repentance, he will darken the glory of this Nation, &amp; we may féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effects. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what the Lord ſaith by the mouth of his Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah, cap. 5.12 They regard not the workes of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb facs="tcp:107301:4"/>conſider the oppreſſion of his hands; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my people are gone to Captivity, becauſe they have no knowledge.</hi> I look upon this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe in my opinion in two ſeveral ways, that it is a fore-runner both of Mercy &amp; Iudgement. Firſt, I take it as the Lords mercy, that he ſhews theſe ſigns in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forewarn us on earth of his judgments to come, &amp; that all his people may prepare to méet him by repentance, before the day of his wrath comes upon us. Next, I looke upon it as his judgments, which he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens by it; for the Lord may ſay by us as he did by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Children of <hi>Iſrael, Amos 3.2. You onely have I knowne, of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities</hi>": For truly I think, no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Sun hath the Lord done more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for us, &amp; yet no nation hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him as we have done. Look again in the 4. of <hi>Amos, 9, 10, 11. verſes I have ſent amongſt you the Peſtilence, after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of Egypt; your young men have I ſlaine with the Sword, and have taken away your Horſes; and I have made the ſtink of your Corps to come up in your noſtrills; ye: have you not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord. I have overthrowne ſome of you, as I overthrew Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, &amp; you were as fire-brands pluckt out of the burning, yet have you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>I thinke if we rightly underſtand theſe words, the Lord may ſay as much to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as he did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; we may apply it to our ſelves: therefore I conclude this matter concerning the Eclipſes; &amp; deſire you to take notice of this, that when God ſhews wonders in the heavens above, and ſigns in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth below, 'tis high time to look about us, &amp; not to be as they were in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> for, <hi>They were eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp; marrying, &amp; giving in marriage, til the flood came upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.</hi> But if you wil take my advice, look upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are men; &amp; though God hath endued them with more knowledge then other men; <hi>Yet all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world is but fooliſhnes, in regard of the knowledge &amp; wiſdome of God above.</hi> Now give me leave to ring this my <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum-Bell</hi> once more to this ſinfull Nation, &amp; to ſhew you in this Booke, by the help of God &amp; the Scriptures, the reaſon &amp; cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord hath to enter into a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with us; &amp; truly I think there is none that hears or reads this Book, that hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fear of God before their eyes, but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this <hi>Alarum-Bell</hi> hath iuſt cauſe to be rung lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I refer the conſideration of this Book to any Chriſtian, that hath any féeling of the grace of God in them. Was ſin ever at a greater height then it is now at this time in our Land? and the more God ſtrives to humble us by his judgments &amp; afflictions, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more do we preſume in ſin: what ſins is there in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures to be pronounc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but we are guilty of? what Nation under y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſun doth more abound in iniquity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do, &amp; eſpecially now of late times? and briefly, theſe foure ſins which I ſhall name, are like four Load-ſtones, to draw down y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heavy wrath of God upon us; that is, Pride, Coveteouſnes, Blaſphemy, and Dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes; &amp; indéed Pride &amp; Coveteouſnes are ring-leaders of moſt ſins under y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſun: Pride was one of the chief ſins of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Look in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith to <hi>Samaria.

               </gap> is there invented every day, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride of this nation? &amp; we do as 'twere almoſt tell God to his face, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more he ſéeks to humble us by his judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which he hath ſent amongſt us, the more we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuouſly ſéek to exalt our ſelves, by our pride &amp; ambition: but remember what the Lord ſaith, <hi>He wil pull down the proud and lofty, and exalt the humble and meeke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Covetouſneſſe is a ſin that is linkt with Pride, for neither of them both hath any Charity in them: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore may lie &amp; ſtarve in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtréets, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pride or covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wil either cloth their nakednes, or fill their bellies: no, no, they will rather eat up the poore (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith) rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féed them. But look to it, thou that haſt corn, &amp; wine, &amp; riches; you are but ſtewards for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor, &amp; where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord gives much, much he requires, either te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral or ſpiritula: thou muſt give an account one day, how y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt ſpent that talent that God hath lent thée; without you uſe it the beteer, he will ſay, <hi>Depart, I know you not; I was a hungry, and <pb facs="tcp:107301:6"/>you gave me no meat; I was thirſtie, and you gave me no drinke; I was a ſtranger, and you took me not in; naked, &amp; you cloathed me not; ſick, and in Priſon, and you viſited me not: Mat.</hi> 25.42, 43. I think you underſtand, he meant his poore Members on earth; how many poore ſouls in theſe times are ready to ſtarve, &amp; where is the pity or charity y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſhew'd unto them? Did not <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh, bleſſed be his Name.</hi> And knowſt thou, O man, what ere thou be, how ſoone the Lord may take thy wealth from thée, or thée from it? doe not be fed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fancies of theſe times; that it is a relique of Popery to give alms or be charitable; no, if thou haſt faith &amp; no good works, it is a dead faith: all thy gold &amp; riches cannot buy thée one dram of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor procure one blaſt of breath, more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord (out of his mercy) doth beſtow upon thée: thou mayſt covet riches here on earth, but thou canſt not covet life; thou mayſt covet, but it is in vaine.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are fulfilled in theſe our times, &amp; indéed looke in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. &amp; read it, &amp; you ſhall find all things fulfilled, only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; we know not how ſoon that may be. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>And becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall grow cold:</hi> &amp; indéed ſo it doth now, <pb facs="tcp:107301:7"/>for there is little Love or Charity to be found amongſt us; look what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Chap. 4.1, 2. Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael; for the Lord hath a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing, &amp; lying, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp; ſtealing, &amp; committing adultery, they break out, &amp; blood toucheth blood: there fore ſhal the Land mourn, &amp; every one that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth therein ſhall languiſh.</hi> We may apply this to our ſelves, if we conſider Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>will not hold him guiltle; that taketh his Name in vaine;</hi> How will he hold him guiltleſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> takes a glory in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as many do in theſe times, who boaſt in their oaths, &amp; ſcarce ever think of God but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſwear by his name, whether it be falſe or true? look in <hi>Zechariah</hi> 5.3, 4. you ſhall ſée what the Lord ſent againſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Théefe &amp; the Swearer, for the Lord joyn &amp; them both together; for the Swearer robs God of his honour: &amp; he ſent out a Curſe to deſtroy them, &amp; it ſhall remaine in the midſt of their houſe, till it had deſtroyed both them &amp; it. I deſire you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are addicted to that ſin beware, for it is ſuch a ſin that you can make no excuſe for it; it brings you neither pleaſure nor profit, unleſſe it <pb facs="tcp:107301:7"/>be the wrath of God, which he threatens againſt preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſins: it is ſuch a ſin in this Nation (the Lord be mercifull to us) that you ſhall ſcarce walk the ſtréets but you ſhal hear little Children, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcarce knows the right hand from the left, yet they can learn to ſwear, &amp; their parents ſcarce correct them for it. The Lord may well viſit the ſins of the father upon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Children, when you ſuffer your Children to take his moſt ſacred Name in vaine.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſin which I have to name: for indéed 'tis not for me to number, nor to reckon all the ſeverall ſins of this Nation, for I think we exceed <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in our wickednes; only I have toucht theſe four ſins, as namely, Pride, Covetouſnes, Blaſphemy, &amp; Drunkennes, which is the foure crying ſins of this Nation: my <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum-Bell</hi> rings loud in the ears of all thoſe that loves y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſin of Drunkenneſſe: ſée what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> 1.5. <hi>Awake ye Drunkards, and weep, &amp; howle all ye drinkers of wine, becauſe of the new wine; for it is out off from your mouth.</hi> Read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chapter, &amp; you ſhall find what the Lord did doe for abuſing thoſe creatures; for in time of plenty, they made a waſt: therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord brought a Famine &amp; ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, becauſe of their Drunkennes &amp; Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:107301:8"/>
            <p>Again, look in <hi>Habakkuk 2.15, 16. Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that putteſt thy bottle to him, &amp; makeſt him drunk alſo, that thou maiſt look on his nakedneſſe. The cup of the Lord; right hand ſhalbe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thee, &amp; ſhamefull ſpung ſhalbe on thy glory.</hi> Let us take héed: we have, the Lord be thanked, plenty; but by our riotouſnes, &amp; drunkennes, it is juſt with God to bring a ſcarcity. How many poor ſouls, in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would be glad of a draught of Béer to quench their thriſt; when many thouſands take ſo much, they are fain to diſgorge it up again, &amp; worſt then beaſts, moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſe thoſe creatures that God hath ſent for the nouriſhment of man? I deſire you to beware of that ſin, for a man is not himſelf when he is in drink, he is ſubject to all kind of wickednes. How many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous &amp; deſperate ſins hath many men fallen into when they have bin in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe, and ſuch great ones too, that hath indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered both ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>Now, I have given you warning by my <hi>Alarum-Bell,</hi> that you may prepare your ſalves by flying from ſin, and flying to the Lord by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance; which if we undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, we néed not fear what man progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticates; for the Lord hath promiſed, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent him of <pb facs="tcp:107301:8"/>his ſins from the bottome of his heart, he will blot out all his iniquities.</hi> But we muſt not delay our repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance; &amp; take our own time, for we know not how ſoone the Lord will come; but let us be like wiſe Virgins, to be ready at all times to méet him, that we may enter into glory with him: for thus much aſſure your ſelves, there is like to be great troubles throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for all nations are preparing for the deſtruction of one another. Iuſt as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſpeaketh ſhalbe in the latter dayes: <hi>There ſhall be great Tribulations, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world, Mat. 24.21. For Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nation, and Kingdome againſt Kingdome, and there ſhall be Earth-quakes in divers places, and there ſhall be Famines, and great troubles: theſe are the beginnings of ſorrow, Mark</hi> 13.8.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, deſiring you to look in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.14, 16. <hi>Seeke good, and not evill, that you may live; and ſo the Lord, the God of Hoſts, ſhall be with you, as he hath ſpoken. Hate the evill, and love the go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, and eſtabliſh Judgements in the gate; It may be the Lord of God of Hoſts wil be gracious to</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>remnant of Joſeph:</hi> For the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he will hide his people in the day of his wrath. Then let us ſéek the Lord while he may be found, before the evill <pb facs="tcp:107301:9"/>day co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth; for if we get under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Wings, we néed not feer the day of Doome, nor the day of Death: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sword, Peſtilence, nor Famine ſhal hurt us, for the Lord will bring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of all their troubles.</p>
            <p>So the laſt ſound of this my <hi>Alarum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bell,</hi> concludes with the ſwéet harmony of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Chap. 8. verſ. 38, 39.</hi> Which I would deſire all Chriſtians in theſe ſad times, to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves with the ſame reſolution, and then aſſure your ſelves you ſhall bée more then Conquerors. For, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, ſaith S. <hi>Paul, That neither death, nor life, nor Angells, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
