            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'Tis not my intention to make an apology for my <hi>Poem</hi>: Some

Yet if  a <hi>Poem</hi> have a <hi>Genius,</hi> it will force its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the World. For there's a sweetness in good Verse, which tickles even while it hurts: And, no man can be heartily angry with him, who pleases him against his will. The commendation of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, is the greatest triumph of a Writer; because it never comes unless extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easy terms: If I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to please the more moderate sort, I shall be sure of an honest party; and, in all probability, of the best Judges; for, the least concerned, are commonly the least corrupt: And I confess I have laid in for those, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the <hi>Satyre,</hi> (where Justice would allow it) from carrying too sharp an edge.

            <p>If you like not my <hi>Poem,</hi> the fault may possibly be in my writing <pb facs="tcp:58013:3"/>
(though 'tis hard for an Author to judge against himself;) But, more
probably, 'tis in your Morals, which cannot bear the truth of it. The
violent, on both sides, will condemn the character of <hi>Absalom,</hi> as either
too favourably, or too hardly drawn. But they are not the violent
whom I desire to please; The fault, on the right hand, is to Extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
Palliate and Indulge; and, to confess freely, I have endeavoured
to commit it. Besides the respect which I owe his Birth, I have a
greater for his Heroick Vertues; and <hi>David</hi> himself could not be
more tender of the Young man's Life, than I would be of his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But, since the most excellent Natures are always the most easy;
and, as being such, are the soonest perverted by ill Counsels, especially
when baited with Fame and Glory; 'tis no more a wonder that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not the temptation of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> than it was for <hi>Adam</hi> not to
have resisted the two <hi>Devils,</hi> the Serpent and the Woman. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Story I purposely forbore to prosecute, because I could not
obtain from my self to shew <hi>Absalom</hi> unfortunate. The Frame of it
was cut out but for a Picture to the wast; and if the <hi>Draught</hi> be so
far true, 'tis as much as I design'd.</p>
            <p>Were I the Inventer, who am only the Historian, I should certainly
conclude the Piece with the reconcilement of <hi>Absalom</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> And
who knows but this may come to pass? Things were not brought to an
extremity where I left the Story; there seems yet to be room left for
a Composure, hereafter there may only be for Pity. I have not so much
as an uncharitable wish against <hi>Achitophel,</hi> but am content to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s'd
of a good natur'd Error; and, to hope with <hi>Origen,</hi> that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
himself may at last be saved. For which reason, in this <hi>Poem,</hi> he
is neither brought to set his House in order, nor to dispose of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
afterwards, as he in wisdom shall think sit. God is infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and his Vicegerent is only not so, because he is not Infinite.</p>
            <p>The true end of <hi>Satyre,</hi> is the amendment of Vices by correction;
And he who writes honestly, is no more an enemy to the Offender, than
the Physitian to the Patient, when he prescribes harsh Remedies to
an inveterate <hi>Disease;</hi> for those are only in order to prevent the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon's
work of an <hi>Ense Rescindendum,</hi> which I wish not to my very
enemies. To conclude all, If the Body Politick have any Analogy to
the Natural, in my weak judgment, an Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> were as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in a Hot, distemper'd <hi>State,</hi> as an <hi>Opiate</hi> would be in a raging
Fever.</p>

               <l>His vigorous warmth did, variously, impart</l>

               <l>Scatter'd his Maker's Image through the Land.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Michal,</hi> of Royal blood, the Crown did wear;</l>
               <l>A Soil ungrateful to the Tiller's care;</l>

               <l>His motions all accompani'd with grace;</l>

               <l>Thought they might ruine him they could create;</l>
               <l>Or melt him to that Golden Calf, a State.</l>
               <l>But these were random bolts, No form'd Design,</l>
               <l>Nor Intrest made the Factious Croud to joyn:</l>
               <l>The sober part of <hi>Israel,</hi> free from stain,</l>
               <l>Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:</l>
               <l>And, looking backward with a wise afright,</l>
               <l>Saw Seames of wounds, dishonest to the sight:</l>
               <l>In contemplation of whose ugly Scars,</l>

The moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd,</l>

               <l>But when the chosen people grew more strong,</l>
               <l>The rightful Cause at length became the wrong:</l>
               <l>And every loss the men of <hi>Iebus</hi> bore,</l>
               <l>They still were thought God's enemies the more:</l>

               <l>Submit they must to <hi>David</hi>'s Government:</l>
               <l>Impoverish'd, and depriv'd of all Command,</l>
               <l>Their Taxes doubled as they lost their Land;</l>
               <l>And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,</l>
               <l>Their Gods disgrac'd and burnt like common wood:</l>
               <l>This set the Heathen Priesthood in a flame;</l>
               <l>For Priests of all Religions are the same:</l>
               <l>Of whatsoe'r descent their Godhead be,</l>
               <l>Stock, Stone, or other homely Pedigree,</l>
               <l>In his defence his Servants are as bold,</l>
               <l>As if he had been born of beaten Gold.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Iewish Rabbins</hi> thô their enemies,</l>
               <l>In this conclude them honest men and wise.</l>

               <l>T' espouse his Cause by whom they eat and drink.</l>
               <l>From hence began that Plot, the Nation's curse,</l>

                  <hi>Zadock</hi> the Priest, whom, shunning pow'r and place,</l>
               <l>His lowly mind advanc'd to <hi>David</hi>'s Grace:</l>
               <l>With him the <hi>Sagan</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of hospitable soul, and noble stem;</l>
               <l>Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense</l>
               <l>Flows in fit words, and heavenly Eloquence.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58013:15"/>
The Prophets sons by such example led,</l>
               <l>To Learning and to Loyalty were bred:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Colleges</hi> on bounteous Kings depend,</l>
               <l>And never Rebel was to Arts a friend.</l>
               <l>To these succeed the Pillars of the Laws,</l>
               <l>Who best coud plead, and best can judge a Cause.</l>
               <l>Next them a train of Loyal Peers ascend:</l>
               <l>Sharp judging <hi>Adriel,</hi> the Muses friend,</l>
               <l>Himself a Muse;—In Sanhedrins debate</l>
               <l>True to his Prince; but not a Slave of State.</l>
               <l>Whom <hi>David</hi>'s love with Honours did adorn,</l>
               <l>That from his disobedient Son were torn.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iotham</hi> of piercing wit, and pregnant thought,</l>
               <l>Indu'd by Nature, and by Learning taught</l>
               <l>To move Assemblies, who but only try'd</l>
               <l>The worse a-while, then chose the better side;</l>
               <l>Nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too;</l>
               <l>So much the weight of one brave man can do.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hushai</hi> the friend of <hi>David</hi> in distress,</l>
               <l>In publick storms of manly stedfastness;</l>
               <l>By foreign Treaties he inform'd his Youth;</l>
               <l>And join'd experience to his native truth.</l>
               <l>His frugal care supp'y'd the wanting Throne,</l>
               <l>Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:</l>
               <l>'Tis easy conduct when Exchequers flow,</l>
               <l>But hard the task to manage well the low:</l>
               <l>For Soverereign Power is too deprest or high,</l>
               <l>When Kings are forc'd to sell, or Crowds to buy.</l>
               <l>Indulge one labour more, my weary Muse,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Amiel,</hi> who can <hi>Amiel's</hi> praise refuse?</l>
               <l>Of ancient Race by Birth, but Nobler yet</l>
               <l>In his own worth, and without Title great:</l>
               <l>The Sanhedrin-long time as Chief he rul'd,</l>
               <l>Their Reason guided, and their Passion cool'd;</l>
               <l>So dextrous was he in the Crown's defence,</l>
               <l>So form'd to speak a Loyal Nations sense,</l>
               <l>That as their Band was <hi>Israel</hi>'s Tribes in small,</l>
               <l>So fit was he to represent them all.</l>
               <l>Now rasher Charioteers the Seat ascend,</l>
               <l>Whose loose Carriers his steady Skill commend:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58013:16"/>
They, like th'unequal Ruler of the day,</l>
               <l>Misguide the seasons, and mistake the way;</l>
               <l>While he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles,</l>
               <l>And safe enjoys the Sabbath of his toyls.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>These were the chief, a small, but faithful Band</l>
               <l>Of Worthies, in the Breach who dar'd to stand,</l>
               <l>And tempt th'united Fury of the Land.</l>
               <l>With grief they view'd such powerful Engines bent,</l>

               <l>A numerous Faction with pretended frights,</l>

               <l>The Plot, by hireling Witnesses improv'd,</l>
               <l>These Ills they saw, and as their Duty bound,</l>
               <l>They shew'd the King the danger of the Wound:</l>
               <l>That no concessions from the Throne woud please,</l>
               <l>But Lenitives fomented the Disease:</l>
               <l>That <hi>Absalom,</hi> ambitious of the Crown,</l>
               <l>Was made the Lure to draw the People down:</l>
               <l>That false <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s pernitious Hate,</l>
               <l>Had turn'd the Plot to ruine Church and State:</l>
               <l>The Council violent, the Rabble worse:</l>
               <l>That <hi>Shimei</hi> taught <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to curse.</l>
               <l>With all these loads of injuries opprest,</l>
               <l>And long revolving in his careful Brest,</l>

               <l>Thus from his Royal Throne by Heav'n inspir'd,</l>
               <l>The God-like <hi>David</hi> spoke; with awful fear</l>
               <l>His Train their Maker in their Master hear</l>
               <l>Thus long have I, by native mercy sway'd</l>
               <l>My wrongs dissembl'd my revenge delay'd:</l>
               <l>So willing to forgive th' Offending Age;</l>
               <l>So much the Father did the King asswage.</l>
               <l>But now fo far my Clemency they slight,</l>
               <l>Th' offenders question my forgiving right.</l>
               <l>That one was made for many, they contend:</l>
               <l>But 'tis to Rule, for that's a Monarch's end.</l>
               <l>They call my tenderness of Blood, my fear:</l>
