         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> from heauen <hi>to iudge both the quick and the dead,</hi> whose comming wee thirstingly and continually expect and pray for; yet it is cleere and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable, by the current of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, and by due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the ruinous estate of the world, and the daily accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fore-runners and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Signes of the last day; that <hi>the ends of the world are come vpon vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>First, if in the Apostles times it was so neere his period and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation, yea consumption; how much more neere is it in our times, sith that so many hundreds of years are long agoe expired? And what if the Lord seemeth to stay long,
<pb facs="tcp:19048:3"/>
and to deferre his comming, yet this delay is nothing, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Eternity, and a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares with God are but as one day,</hi>

               </note> and the Lord will in the meane time, haue the number of his Elect fulfilled, and the sinnes of the Reprobate grow to their full measure and ripenesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is certaine that the glorious Gospell hath, euen in the Apostles times, beene solemnely published and proclaimed to the whole (habitable) world, so that such a solemne and generall Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Embassage is not againe to bee expected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ancient and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Romane Empire, that in former ages had the commaund of some two hundred and fifty Countries, Kingdomes and Prouinces, is now so impaired, wasted and weakned,
<pb facs="tcp:19048:4"/>

            <p>Fiftly, sinne and iniquity euery where aboundeth, and is growne excessiue and impudent: all things are out of square, all flesh hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his way, and (whether wee respect Doctrine, Discipline, and (specially) corruption of manners) in most Coasts and Countries, there is almost <hi>no faith left on the earth.</hi>

            <p>Lastly, (to passe ouer in silence many other Arguments, yea, and some few Signes shortly to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, whereof I distinctly entreate in the ensuing Treatise) the iust Iudge of the world must needs giue perfect <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> to his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Saints and seruants;<note place="margin">

               <p>First, the sacred Scriptures are pregnant and plentifull in this point, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.15. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.17. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.28.29. and chap. 12.44. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.16.17. and chap. 5.2. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11. 12.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.28.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the doctrine of the last Iudgement,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.2.</note> is a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and principall Article of the Apostles Catechisme; and therefore no person, vnlesse hee bee a meere Athiest, or Infidell, can, or will deny it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Generall Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the necessary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19048:9"/>
antecedent of the iudgement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sublatis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatis ad finem, tolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur finis.</hi>
                  </note> and those that shall arise and appeare in iudgement, who are the proper obiect of it, do enforce it; yea, and what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments serue to proue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, the same iustifie the last iudgement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the generall and particular iudgements, calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and punishments, both in the old and new Testament, and in all succeeding ages, are Types, Similitudes, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significations of it. Of this kind were <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud (or Deluge) wherein the world was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the ouer-whelming of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the red Sea; the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>; the destruction of Ierusalem; the ruin of the foure great Monarchies of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19048:9"/>
world, that afflicted Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; and of late time, the sinking and dispearsing of the <hi>Spanish</hi> inuincible <hi>Armado, Anno Christi</hi> 1588, in the English Seas, and by the coasts of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, vnlesse there should be a finall iudgement, wherein euery man is to receiue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to his workes, God could not declare himselfe perfectly iust. For all sinnes in this world committed, come not to light: neither are all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that are apparant. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and Oppressours; yea Christs Arch-enemies, the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp;c. liue long, and prosper in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And if God should cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all sinnes that are done in the earth, then no other iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would bee expected:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19048:10"/>
wherefore the Lord beareth long with sinners, and suffereth the offences of the Reprobate to grow rotten ripe, that hee may fully and finally punish and plague them at the last day. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance is no quittance:</hi> Christ commeth with <hi>woollen feete</hi> (i. faire and softly) but striketh with <hi>Iron hands,</hi> that is deadly.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, vnlesse there come a day of generall release and absolution for the godly, yea a day of full deliuerance, and glorious triumph, God cannot declare himselfe completely and infinitely mercifull. For it seemeth to goe well with the wicked, in this world, and ill with the good: The godly are oppressed and persecuted, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and tormented, molested, martyred, massacred, and both
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19048:10"/>
inwardly and outwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; therefore the iust Lord cannot but at length reward the patience and pietie of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: <hi>Great shall their reward be in heauen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee shall recompence the lightnesse of their momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 8.18. 2. Cor. 4 17 18.</note> 
                  <hi>with an exceeding and super-excellent weight of glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the feare, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, astonishment, horror of conscience and dreadfull des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire in many malefactors (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially persecutors and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers) euen of those that escape the iudgement of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, doth euidently argue that there will come a day of recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that there is an hell fire, whereof these are certaine flashings, and fore-runners.</p>
               <p>Lastly (to be briefe) the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19048:11"/>
of God look and long for, groane and pant for this day and time; which is the day of their <hi>Marriage,</hi> of the bodies <hi>ascent</hi> into heauen, and of their entrance and <hi>inauguration</hi> into the Kingdome of Glory. These spirituall sighes and sobs,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.22.</note> are speciall effects of Gods spirit, infallible characters of Gods children, and the very earnest of our inheritance. Inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires make a lowder sound in Gods eares, then bare words vttered with the tongue, and therefore cannot misse the marke, <hi>viz.</hi> eternitie of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Now that Iesus Christ, not onely as he is God, whereby in the decree, efficacie, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the iudgement, hee is equall with God the Father,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19048:11"/>
and the Holy Ghost; but also as he is man, in regard of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to bee pronounced, and the visible execution of the iudgement; is and shall be the Iudge both of the quicke and dead, the Scriptures put it out of question, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9.10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is an Article and foundation of faith, firmely to be beleeued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is one end, and that a principall one, of Christs Resurrection &amp; Ascension: It is a part of his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> which hee shall then most openly and eminently execute.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it standeth with all equity, that Hee that, when hee liued on earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.64</note> and was most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly iudged, accused, indicted,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19048:12"/>
condemned and executed, should at length, gloriously, and in the view of all the world, iudge, arraigne, condemne, and fee execution done vpon his enemies.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to stop the mouths of, and to put all Atheists to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the Heathenish Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse <hi>Sibylla</hi> testifieth as much, saying
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.</l>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That is:
<q>
                     <l>Christ shall come in the cloudes</l>
                     <l>In glorie, with his sinlesse Angels.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And that this miserable and corruptible world, with all the contemned creatures shall (not in respect of matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but outward forme, and accidentall qualities) haue an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19048:12"/>
end and consumption, thus I compendiously make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. First, by expresse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Secondly, by Argument. <hi>Heauen and earth shall passe away:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat 24.35 1. Cor. 7.31 2. Pet. 3.10</note> 
                  <hi>The fashion of this world passeth away. The heauens shall passe away with a great noise, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall melt with heate, the earth also and the workes that are therein, shall be burnt vp.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 20.11</note> 
                  <hi>I saw</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>a great white throne, and him that sate on it, from whose face the heauen and earth fled away, and there was found no place for them.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by argument, I thus make good my assertion. The world being but a creature had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and therefore it shall haue an end; <hi>Omnia orta intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</hi> The world as in the seuerall parts, so in the whole, daily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19048:13"/>
decayeth, weakneth, and is in an irrecouerable consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore it must needs, at length, come to an end. A <hi>rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous house</hi> will in tract of time fall, and a <hi>sick body</hi> cannot hold out long. The world must bee renewed <hi>at the last day</hi>;<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> for there shall be a <hi>new heauen,</hi> and a <hi>new earth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Generatio vnius est corraptio alterius.</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the old heauen and earth must (of necessitie) be first abolished. Lastly, some of the Pagan Philosophers and Poets (whensoeuer, or wheresoeuer, they had so much light) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as much.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platonists</hi> held, that the world should be destroyed: so did the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Prophecie: The Poet <hi>Ouid</hi> in the first booke of his Metamorphosis, and <hi>Lucan</hi> in the first booke <hi>belli Pharsalici,</hi> iustifie as much; and mans

                  <hi>their heads, knowing that their Redemption draweth neere.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> to awaken vs. And as the Sunne being about to arise, first sendeth forth his bright beames a farre off, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the East; so our Lord Iesus the Sunne of righteousnesse, doth before his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, send certaine generall <hi>Signes,</hi> and (as I may say) <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers,</hi> that men might the more carefully waite for, and
<pb facs="tcp:19048:15"/>
more dilligently addresse and prepare themselues against that time. The Tempests threaten before that they arise: the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses crack before they fall, and the Smoake goeth before the flame: So these Signes and Fore-warnings go before the consummation of the world.</p>
               <p>These Signes &amp; Fore-runners are of three sorts: namely, those that are already accomplished and fulfilled: Secondly, those that are mixt signes and praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations in continuall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and motion; and those that yet remaine in their due time to be performed. Of these plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in order: But (that I may cleere the coast, and proceede with more dexterity and profit) two principall questions by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moued, are to be seasonably
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19048:15"/>
decided.<note place="margin">Questions</note> First, why God doth not, and will not, reueale vnto any the houre, day, yeare, and time of the last iudgement. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why the Lord seemeth so long to delay and put off that day and iudgement; especially seeing that hee promiseth to come quickly, and that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren so long waite and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pray for that time.</p>
               <p>I answer to the former questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Lord wil haue the day, houre, yeare, &amp;c. of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall iudgement concealed. First, because it is the <hi>Glory of God to conceale a thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 25.2.</note> and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale some things before the euent, which is the best &amp; surest interpreter. Secondly, that hee might bridle and represse the impudent boldnesse, and rash curiositie of those, that vainely,
<pb facs="tcp:19048:16"/>
yea presumptuously, pry, and search into things forbidden, vnnecessary, and impossible to be known, &amp; in the meane time neglect the searching out of, and the due practise of things in the word of God reuealed and commanded. Thirdly, and lastly, not onely to try and make knowne the modesty and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his deere seruants, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they will break into the closet of his secrets or no; but also to keep them from the slumber of security, and to stir them vp to watch for, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues against that day. <hi>Vtiliter</hi> (saith an ancient Father) <hi>latet vltimus dies vt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruentur omnes dies</hi>: That is, it is for our profite that the last day is vnknowne, that wee may obserue and watch all daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:19048:16"/>
                  <hi>The second question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why doth the Lord so long deferre his comming to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First that the Prophecy of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 6 11 &amp; 11.10.</note> and of other Scriptures should bee fulfilled: <hi>For heauen and earth shall passe away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 24.35</note> 
                  <hi>but no point or tittle of Gods word shall passe away vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the sinnes and abhominations of the wicked and profane, who abuse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodnesse of God leadeth them to repentance: and who mispend and lauish their time that God hath allotted for their repentance;<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.22.</note> might be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plea or excuse, and that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19048:17"/>
their sinnes being heaped vp to heauen, might bee punished with eternity of torments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that none of the Predestinate should perish,<note place="margin">1. Tim, 2, 4</note> but that in this world they should come to the acknowledgement of the truth,<note place="margin">2, Pet, 3, 9.</note> to repentance, and so consequently to saluation.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to try, declare, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and exercise, the patience, faith, hope, and charity of his chosen, that liue amongst such an infinite number of lewd, Atheisticall, scandalous, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and venemous people, and yet by the grace of God, directing and preseruing them, are <hi>blamelesse,</hi>

                  <head>Question.</head>
                  <p>It seemeth that the Gospell hitherto, hath not bene known, much lesse Preached by the Apostles, to the <hi>Americans</hi> and West <hi>Indies,</hi> those huge and vaste Countries, for there is no monument or record of any such matter: and therefore the time is to come when they shall bee enlightned, and receiue the Gospell of our Lord Iesus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I must in this difficult point answere, as distinctly, so by distinction. First, I answere that the Apostles and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, hauing taught and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Gospell, to the most famous, knowne and populous Kingdomes, Prouinces, Cities, and Townes, it is very probable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19048:21"/>
that they, or their Successours, did Preach the Gospell to the vnknowne, obscure, and most barbarous Nations, such as are the <hi>Americans,</hi> West <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>North Parts</hi> of the world: And what if now either driuen thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therby Tempests, or forced by enemies, they might in time grow barbarous, and loose all knowledge of Christ? Againe, I deny not but that the Gospell may, and shall be at length pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and made knowne to the <hi>Americans,</hi> if they neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard of it; for the mercy of God in Christ is of infinite extent. And if the very Iesuites (though arch-heretickes, and the fire-brands of sedition) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps sow some seeds of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity amongst them: How much more purely and plaine<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19048:21"/>
may the <hi>English, Hollanders,</hi> and other Professours, in time, performe it? Fourthly, it diuers parts of Europe, haue within these hundred yeares last expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, since the reuealing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and the dispersion of the mists of Poperie, beene so greatly illuminated: why may not (specially after the generall calling and conuersion of the Iewes, which wee continually expect, and pray for, and which shall be the <hi>Enliuing</hi> and <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the world) the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.12</note> West Indians, and other Nations; yea euen in the Turkes Dominions, be enlightned?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the world of vnbeleefe, and to leaue the Inhabitants without excuse, if onely the <hi>Fame, Rumor,</hi> and <hi>Report,</hi> yea the

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19048:55"/>
brightnesse of his comming, shall (vtterly) obscure and hide the light of the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres.</hi> Neither must this seeme incredible or impossible, for the like hath beene seene in time past (though not vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally ouer the whole world, but in some kingdome and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place of it) <hi>At mid-day,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, at the death of Christ, the Sunne was darkened and terribly eclypsed:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.44.</note> 
                  <hi>And dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was vpon all the land</hi> (of Iudaea) <hi>from the sixt houre to the

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19048:57"/>
yeares remaine to bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> First, from Christs Birth (or Death) vnto the end of the world is counted but an age, or the last, though (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) the longest, age of the world: Seeing wee are not to haue, nor expect, any new <hi>Christ,</hi> new <hi>Gospell,</hi> new <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> new <hi>Scriptures,</hi> new <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> new <hi>Euangelists,</hi> new <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>; but content our selues with those that Christ hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably left vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this last age of the world is not confined and limited to a certaine stint and set number of yeares, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages are, and were: because wee should alwaies bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in continuall expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it should end, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19048:57"/>
men would more delay and post of (from time to time) their conuersion vnto God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the last age of a man (to wit old age) cannot bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a certaine number of yeares as the precedent ages of a man;<note place="margin">

                  <head>A second Question.</head>
                  <p>Whether that this world shall last and continue (at least) seuen hundred yeares, seeing that in the 20 chapter of S. <hi>Iohns Reuelation,</hi> expresse mention is made of two distinct thousands of yeares;<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> the former wherof, is thought to take his beginning at the raigne of the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> and to end about <hi>Wickliefes</hi> time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1300, and in all this time the Church declined; and the second mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, or thousand, wherein the Church shall bee renewed and flourish, beganne onely (as it is collected) about the yeare of our Lord 1300, so that seuen hundred yeares yet remaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> True it is that mention
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19048:58"/>
is made of two thousand yeares, and diuers of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did acknowledge as much, but mis-vnderstood, and mis-applyed, the same, being carryed away with the errour of the <hi>Millenarij,</hi> that imagined that the people of God should after the Resurrection, liue a thousand yeares in this world in pleasures and ioyes.</p>
                  <p>But, I answere first, that it is not agreed amongst Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when the first thousand should beginne, whether when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his <hi>Apocalipse,</hi> or rather <hi>Anno</hi> 300 when <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> beganne to raigne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the Elects sake, least all flesh should perish, these daies shall bee shortned, as well as those of the Iewes miserie at the destruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem<note place="margin">Mat. 24.22</note>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:19048:59"/>
were abridged: For the shortning of the former is a type and figure of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the latter. Now how many yeares, or, whether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hundred of yeares, God best knoweth (if not onely knoweth) and the end and issue will make manifest.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the end of the world should continue so long, and this should be notified, and publickly signified to the world, they would take occasion to liue much more licentiously, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their repentance; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would Atheistically inferre, that Christ would neuer come to iudgement: And therefore the Holy Ghost keepeth vs in suspense, and still in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth vs, that the <hi>Houre draweth neere,</hi> that the <hi>Day is at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19048:59"/>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>A third Question.</head>
                  <p>Whether that the world shall end in the yeare of Christ two thousand thirty nine, that is some foure hundred and fiue and twenty yeares hence, seeing that from the beginning of the world, to that date, are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished the 6000 yeares of the worlds full continuance; figured (as diuers old and new Writers thinke) by the sixe daies of the creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, from the six daies of creation to conclude of sixe thousand yeares of the worlds continuance, it is no certaine rule, or axiome, but onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.
<pb facs="tcp:19048:60"/>
And whereas Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith; That <hi>a thousand yeares with the Lord</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with His Erernitie) <hi>is but as one day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and one day as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares</hi>; hee neither alludeth to the sixe daies wherein the world was created, nor doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how long the world shall endure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is, that the world shall be consummate before this long date, for the dayes must bee shortned, otherwise if the world hold on his hold, there should no <hi>faith</hi> be left, or found vpon the earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the <hi>Wise Virgins,</hi> that is, the holy Professours of sincere Religion,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.6.</note> shall <hi>nictare, id est,</hi> nod and slumber (though their <hi>hearts</hi> shall wake) and therefore they

haue no certaine knowledge of any yeare when the Lord will come to iudgement,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.39</note> otherwise they would the more rowse vp themselues.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the sixt Angell hath already blowne, or sounded with the Trumpet, and when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth shall but beginne to blow (which time is shortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) then the <hi>Mysterie of God shall bee finished,</hi>

                  <p>Whether that the world shall end in the yeare of Christ 1699 or 1700, especially seeing that from the time that the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice shall bee taken away, and the abomination of desolation set vp, shall bee 1335 daies, which some interprete so many yeares, beginning the account in the yeare of Christ 367, when the Iewes, by the grant of the Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> repairing the Temple of Ierusalem, were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed by fire sent from heauen?</p>
                  <p>I Answere, that most, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Interpreters vnderstand those 1335 daies, not for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, but literally, for three yeares and an halfe, with the addition of 45 daies, in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19048:61"/>
end wherof <hi>Antiochus</hi> the chiefe enemy of the Iewes should die; and being fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> why, or by what reason, should any man extend them further?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is generally held that (the doctrine and mention of the last iudgement excepted) that <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecie endeth either at the death of Christ, or (at the furthermost) with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Ierusalem.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Maister <hi>Napier,</hi> a learned Scot, counting the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of these 1335 daies (and interpreting them for yeares) <hi>anno Christi</hi> 360, will haue the world to end, about the yeare 1695; But Maister <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> maketh this date the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the generall conuersion and flourishing state of the Iewes, which hee holdeth shall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19048:62"/>
continue diuers hundred yeares afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was a receiued opinion that the world should end 1588, and the euent descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vanity of their collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And why may not they erre (though they cannot so much erre comming neerer the end of the world) likewise, that define that the world shall certainely end betweene the yeares 1688, and 1695?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is not for vs (speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that liue not in the very last age of the world) <hi>to know the times and seasons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 1.7.</note> 
                     <hi>which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath reserued in his owne power</hi>; therefore let vs not bee ouer-curious, but wise to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:19048:62"/>
                  <head>A fift Question.</head>
                  <p>Whether (as some Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks are reported to hold and defend) the world shall end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeares of Christ 1630?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, to arguments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne wee cannot giue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular answeres.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this opinion is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and singular, and, perhaps, onely one man is the Author of it. <hi>An ille solus sapit?</hi> who hath told him?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the remaining Signes, not yet begunne to bee accomplished, cannot, in any probability, bee fulfilled in so short a scantling of time; or, if they can, let him assigne the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular yeare of Romes ruin, of the Iewes conuersion, of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19048:63"/>
comming of the false Christs; if he cannot resolue vs in the sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler point, how shall wee credit him in the greatest?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, when the Iewes are conuerted, it is most likely they shall (at least) continue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on the earth for one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Gods mercy may more euidently appeare, and that all the world may take suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient notice of their generall calling, and herevpon be either conuerted or (at least) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted.</p>

                  <p>Whether the very age (which some,<note place="margin">Deu. 15.16</note> reckoning according to the Iubile account, restraine to 50 yeares) wherein our Lord
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19048:63"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answere, First, that to restraine a generation, or, age of a man, to 50 yeares, may seeme too short an account; rather 70 or 80 yeares may make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the age wherein Christ shall come may bee knowne, because our Lord one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepteth the day and houre.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Scripture expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, that in that age in which the false Christs and Prophets shall arise, all shall bee fulfilled.</p>
